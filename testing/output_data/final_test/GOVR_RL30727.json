    "content": "The importance of accurate and timely information for modern military operations, highlighted in Joint Vision 2010, emphasizes the need for information dominance to achieve new levels of effectiveness in joint warfighting. This includes the capability to collect, process, and disseminate information while denying the same to adversaries, especially with the growing use of precision guided munitions. As the Department of Defense transforms into a network-centric force, the significance of precise information will continue to increase. The United States utilizes various satellites for intelligence gathering on enemy forces, with their effectiveness projected to increase. Airborne ISR platforms offer rapid deployment and flexibility, making it challenging for adversaries to hide. These platforms are expected to meet a significant portion of DOD's ISR needs in the coming decades. Congress and DOD must make crucial decisions on current and future ISR capabilities, considering the mix of manned and unmanned systems over the next 20 to 30 years. The mix of existing and planned manned and unmanned ISR aircraft will be integrated with information from various sources to meet DOD's requirements for timely and accurate enemy force information. While UAVs are expected to replace manned aircraft for reconnaissance, some believe manned airborne reconnaissance still has advantages in reacting to unexpected targets. The U.S. ISR inventory includes manned and unmanned aircraft with various strengths and weaknesses. The U-2 Dragon Lady is a key asset, providing significant imagery and targeting information in recent operations. During Operation Allied Force, the U-2 provided over 80% of imagery for air strikes, but its limited inventory and heavy usage may lead to retirement in the next two decades. Global Hawk UAVs are seen as a potential replacement, with testing underway for acquisition despite not matching all U-2 capabilities. The Air Force faces acquisition and budgetary challenges in replacing U-2s with Global Hawks for ISR capabilities. Questions arise about the design capabilities of Global Hawks compared to U-2s, funding for an accelerated acquisition effort, the need for maintaining manned aircraft alongside UAVs, and the implications of decommissioning U-2s. The U-2 is a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft providing all-weather intelligence support to military commanders. Its potential decommissioning for increased Global Hawk acquisition raises budgetary and effectiveness concerns for ISR capabilities. The U-2 is a reliable aircraft with long, wide wings resembling a glider. It is based at Beale Air Force Base, California, and supports theater commanders from various operational detachments worldwide. Originally designed to overfly the Soviet Union, the U-2 flies at high altitudes to avoid detection. Upgraded versions have been introduced since the 1980s, with improved engines for fuel efficiency and increased power. The upgraded U-2 aircraft, designated as U-2S/ST, is equipped with the General Electric F-118-10 engine for improved fuel efficiency, reduced weight, and increased power. It can carry various sensors and cameras for reconnaissance missions, including high-resolution cameras, electro-optic systems, and Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS) for capturing images of large territories. The U-2 aircraft is equipped with the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS) for real-time, high-resolution capability at night and in bad weather. It also has Senior Glass SIGINT capability with electronic and communications intelligence sensors. The aircraft can transmit data up to 600 nautical miles via satellites. The U-2 aircraft, known as the \"Dragon Lady,\" is difficult to fly and requires complex landing maneuvers. Maintaining an adequate supply of U-2 pilots is a challenge due to the physical rigors of flying at extreme altitudes. Pilots must wear pressure suits, undergo special training, and follow pre-flight preparations to combat the effects of long missions. Currently, there are only around 50 qualified U-2 pilots. The U-2 aircraft, known as the \"Dragon Lady,\" poses challenges for pilots due to its difficult handling characteristics and the physical rigors of flying at extreme altitudes. The Air Force faces retention issues with U-2 pilots, but efforts have been made to align their duties with other pilots. Improved morale may be linked to the U-2 winning the Collier Trophy in 1998. The U-2 aircraft, originally designed for Cold War missions over the Soviet Union, lost its strategic value after a U-2 was shot down in 1960. Surveillance satellites took over this role in the 1960s. The U-2's usefulness was demonstrated in Desert Storm in 1991. The U-2 aircraft proved its value during Desert Storm in 1991 by providing near-real-time intelligence for military commanders to accurately target bombs. The increased use of the U-2 was due to advancements in surveillance and communication technologies, as well as the availability of precision guided munitions. The largest U-2 operation in history during Desert Storm involved nine aircraft and thirty pilots flying multiple sorties daily, primarily targeting Iraqi Army positions, conducting bomb damage assessments, and searching for SCUD missile sites. Data collected from U-2s was quickly accessible to tactical commanders, leading to debates over collection priorities and demands for more photographic coverage. During military operations in the former Yugoslavia, U-2 aircraft were heavily relied upon for intelligence gathering and target identification. They provided a significant amount of imagery intelligence and Army targeting information. U-2s were used during Operation Allied Force in 1999 to identify Serbian targets and assess the accuracy of Allied strikes. Data collected by U-2s was transmitted for analysis at Beale Air Force Base in California. During Operation Allied Force in the former Yugoslavia, U-2 aircraft played a crucial role in gathering intelligence and identifying Serbian targets. Data collected by the U-2s was sent to Beale Air Force Base for analysis before being used to guide aircraft in attacking the targets. Admiral Daniel Murphy recalled using satellite positioning data on Serbian radars, but it was a 22-year-old intelligence specialist communicating with the U-2 that provided confirmation for targeting Tomahawk missiles. During Operation Allied Force in the former Yugoslavia, U-2 aircraft played a crucial role in gathering intelligence and identifying Serbian targets. U-2 pilots and support personnel were transferred to meet requirements for Allied Force, with U-2s being stretched to the limit. If operations on a larger scale were required, U-2 availability could be constrained, impacting precision bombing campaigns. U-2s also continue to fly collection missions over Iraq and the Korean peninsula, supplementing satellite and other systems for early warning. U-2 aircraft supplement satellite systems for early attack warning, operating at altitudes above 70,000 feet. While vulnerable, they can collect information from international airspace. Concerns about vulnerability over Iraqi territory have led to fighter escorts and warnings to Baghdad. The availability of SAMs poses a threat to U-2 missions. The RQ-4A Global Hawk, a high altitude, long endurance unmanned aerial vehicle, was developed as a replacement for the U-2 aircraft. The program started in 1994 with DARPA soliciting industry submissions, and the first flight took place in 1998. Global Hawk #2 crashed during a flight in March 1999 at China Lake Naval Weapons Center due to a test signal error. By October 2000, the Global Hawk had completed 62 flights totaling 737 hours, reaching altitudes of 66,000 feet and flying for up to 31 hours at a time. Ground support includes a Mission Control Element and Launch and Recovery Element, capable of operating three aerial vehicles simultaneously. The Global Hawk can carry electro-optical, IR, and synthetic aperture radar sensors but not SIGINT sensors. Its SAR capabilities are not as effective as the U-2 due to power and antenna size differences. DOD plans to manufacture twelve Global Hawk air vehicles between FY2003 and FY2009. The Air Force plans to produce twelve Global Hawk air vehicles between FY2003 and FY2009, with capabilities to carry EO/IR/SAR sensor payloads. In FY2009, they aim to develop four next-generation Global Hawks with potential SIGINT sensors, comparable to the U-2 and possibly replacing it. Key similarities and differences between the U-2 and Global Hawk are important for policymakers to consider when deciding on the U.S. airborne ISR force structure. The U-2 and Global Hawk are similar in altitude and speed, but differ in pilot requirements, range, endurance, and mission payload. The Global Hawk lacks a pilot, which can affect responsiveness to changing circumstances compared to a piloted aircraft like the U-2. However, U-2 pilots often rely on mission control for decision-making during missions. Unmanned aircraft may need adjustments to their mission profile based on warnings from mission control. Civil authorities impose demanding mission planning requirements on unmanned systems due to concerns about emergencies and potential crashes in inhabited areas. Global Hawk lacks a pilot, affecting responsiveness and requiring exhaustive mission planning. The Global Hawk's lack of a pilot requires exhaustive mission planning and raises concerns about its operational utility and survivability compared to the U-2. Despite its superior range and endurance, its high cost makes it non-expendable and limits its use in high-threat environments. The U-2 has a larger payload capability and engine power than the Global Hawk, allowing for more diverse payloads and potential upgrades. Congress has shown interest in U-2 programs due to their re-engining for higher altitudes. The U-2 planes have undergone upgrades to fly at higher altitudes and have improved sensors and communication data-links. A cockpit upgrade is in progress to meet Air Force standards. The U-2 is of interest to Congress and there is a recognized need for tactical airborne intelligence capabilities. Both U-2s and UAVs are in high demand with low inventories. The Clinton Administration may have been more inclined towards peacekeeping missions, but U.S. military forces are expected to engage in missions in various countries. The U.S. military's missions in different countries will require precise intelligence of potential targets, with plans to upgrade the U-2 and eventually replace it with the Global Hawk UAV. However, the availability of airborne platforms will limit ISR capabilities. Observers believe that more units and extensive training will be needed if UAVs replace the U-2 force. The FY2001 Defense budget is being considered by major oversight committees. The major oversight committees expressed concern about U-2 procurement issues in the FY2001 Defense budget, including the underfunding of initial deployment spares for the SYERS upgrade. Authorization conferees recommended a $3 million increase to address this issue, while appropriations conferees did not. Additionally, there was consensus among the defense oversight committees that the Air Force needed more RDT&E funds to support the development of the U-2 SYERS. The administration's request for an upgraded information collection capability for the U-2s was insufficient to procure a complete JSAF suite. To address this, an increase of $8 million was recommended for an additional JSAF unit. House authorizers also recommended funding for a fifth two-seat U-2 trainer to address concerns about producing enough U-2 pilots. Appropriations and authorization conferees noted that additional funding had already been allocated for these purposes. In FY2000, funding for U-2 sensor improvements and a U-2 trainer was allocated. House authorizers reduced U-2 procurement funding below the administration's request. Concerns were raised about funds being transferred from Intelligence Community programs to cover shortfalls in other areas. House Armed Services Committee prioritized addressing shortfalls in ISR aircraft and systems. The House Armed Services Committee prioritized addressing shortfalls in ISR aircraft and systems by designating the RC-135 and U-2 programs as congressional interest items. The Air Force FY2001 budget requested $22.3 million for procurement funding and $109.2 million for RDT&E funding for HAE UAVs, with the majority allocated for the Global Hawk UAVs. The Senate Armed Services Committee disagreed with entering production in FY2001 and zeroed out the request, while other defense oversight committees supported the procurement request. The Senate Armed Services and Senate Appropriations committees matched the administration's request for RDT&E funding. The Senate Armed Services committee increased the RDT&E request by $18 million for Global Hawk engineers to explore AESA radar integration. The House did not support the funding increase. Congressional reports provide information on intelligence programs related to the U-2 and Global Hawk, with classified annexes for more detail. The House Intelligence Committee concluded in May 2000 that there is extensive over-utilization of limited airborne assets in Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). The Department of Defense has been taking money from existing platforms to fund future capabilities, resulting in a decrease in overall ISR capabilities and resources. The House Committee approved the Administration's total request for operations and maintenance of the U-2 and RC-135, recommending increased funding for U-2 modifications. The House Intelligence Committee recommended increased funding for U-2 modifications, including $3 million for initial deployment spares for the SYERS upgrade and $8 million for JSAF, as well as the conversion of one U-2 into a trainer. The total recommended budget was $132.6 million, an increase of $34.2 million for U-2 modifications. The Senate Intelligence Committee did not provide similar details, but it is likely that their actions were consistent with those of the House Armed Services Committee. The budgeting and funding of airborne reconnaissance programs are complex due to overlapping roles of intelligence agencies, congressional oversight committees, and military departments. The House Intelligence Committee expressed concerns about funding transfers from ISR programs to other areas, impacting resources for U-2s and Global Hawk UAVs. Defense spending pressures complicate efforts to adequately support ISR programs. The Air Force is considering accelerating the acquisition of Global Hawk UAVs to meet surveillance requirements, potentially reducing the U-2 program and retiring all U-2s by FY2011. This decision may face controversy. The Air Force is considering retiring all U-2s by FY2011, a controversial decision due to the aircraft's extensive deployment and recent upgrades. Advocates argue that the Global Hawk can fulfill U-2's missions with fewer platforms and will gain SIGINT collection capability through upgrades. This decision will be closely scrutinized by Congress and the public. The Air Force is considering retiring U-2s by 2006 to invest in next-generation airborne surveillance capabilities. Funding for Global Hawks may come from early termination of U-2s, with potential alternative funding sources being considered. Opponents of retiring U-2s argue that the Air Force should increase ISR capabilities instead of just replacing them one-to-one with Global Hawks. They believe the U-2 should not be phased out until the Global Hawk is well-established to ensure a smooth transition and not lose essential capabilities. The argument against decommissioning all U-2s is based on the belief that it would be wasteful of an important capability. There are concerns about the Global Hawk's current limitations in comparison to the U-2, and suggestions include increasing the number of operational U-2s or more effectively managing the existing inventory until the Global Hawk is fully optimized. The current U-2 inventory management includes 31 operational U-2s with 4 used as trainers. Three are in depot for maintenance at any time, leaving 28 for global operations. Concerns exist about potential aircraft loss through accidents and attrition, with one U-2 lost every two years. Procurement of additional U-2s is suggested to maintain coverage in multiple spots globally. Congressional attention has been drawn to this idea. Some believe acquiring new U-2 platforms would be cost-effective and quickly expand capabilities. However, others argue it would lead to maintenance issues due to varying ages and outdated technology. Re-opening the U-2 production line after 20 years raises feasibility and cost concerns. Manning the U-2 requires specially trained pilots, limiting their employability in other Air Force positions and posing risks to pilots' lives. Re-opening the U-2 production line raises concerns about costs and feasibility. Specialized pilots are needed to fly the U-2, limiting their options in other Air Force positions and posing risks to their safety. Suggestions include exploring unmanned options and attracting more pilots to the program to alleviate the high operational tempo. Options for managing the U-2 program include increasing the percentage of pilots entering the program, using two-seat training aircraft for operational missions, and examining foreign basing arrangements. The lack of trainers and the need for specialized pilots are key concerns. The Air Force is withdrawing the U-2 from bases in France and Cyprus, leading to concerns about reduced intelligence collection capabilities. Base consolidation has been justified by the end of the Cold War, but the increase in smaller scale contingencies raises questions about the decision. Some suggest opening additional U-2 bases in different theaters to maintain coverage. Inventory management issues also include the Expeditionary Air Force concept for deployment predictability. The Air Force is considering including the U-2 and other ISR assets in the current AEF concept to increase deployment predictability and distribute the burden. However, due to low numbers of operational platforms, this may not reduce deployment tempo. Another option is to devise an AEF-like inventory management scheme specifically for the U-2. The Air Force is considering including the U-2 and other ISR assets in the current AEF concept to increase deployment predictability and distribute the burden. A management scheme specifically for the U-2 may be devised. Different UAVs or manned aircraft may be acquired, including the Global Hawk, Predator, or \"un-retired\" SR-71 Black Bird aircraft for ISR missions. Several SR-71 airframes are preserved at the Air Force facility in Palmdale, California. Opponents argue that un-retiring the SR-71 would be too expensive and question the availability of qualified pilots. Congress will likely play a key role in determining the future of the Global Hawk and U-2 programs. Congress has closely monitored the U-2 program, providing funding for upgrades and additional equipment. Plans for early retirement of the U-2 force will be scrutinized, with interest in the Global Hawk acquisition and integration. Various acronyms and terms related to reconnaissance programs are mentioned. Acronyms related to reconnaissance programs include HD/LD, IOC, IR, ISR, LRE, JSAF, MCE, PGM, RDT&E, SAR, SIGINT, SLAR, SYERS, TAD, and UAV."
