    "content": "\"Ideas for legislation can come from various sources like Senators, committees, legislative staff, and interest groups. Senators are the only ones who can formally introduce legislation in the Senate. When drafting a bill, considerations include identifying the problem it aims to solve and gathering information from reports, studies, and expert testimony.\" The Senate gathers relevant information for policymaking through expert testimony in committee hearings. Committee referral is important as it can impact the reception of proposed legislation. Cosponsorship indicates support for a bill and can influence committee actions. The Senate's process for passing legislation involves committee hearings, bipartisan cooperation, and budgetary considerations. A supermajority of 60 Senators is often needed to end debate and reach a final vote. Noncontroversial proposals can be passed quickly through unanimous consent, but budgetary restrictions apply to legislation with financial implications. When passing legislation in the Senate, budgetary considerations are crucial. A proposal adding to the federal deficit may face a point of order for violating budget rules. Senators may support a bill but disagree on how to fund it. To become law, a bill must pass both houses of Congress in identical form and be signed by the President. Senate sponsors may encourage identical legislation in the House for bicameral consideration and wider attention. The timing of introducing a measure is also important. Timing the introduction of legislation in the Senate is crucial. Early introduction allows for more examination of the provisions and can attract media attention. Strategic delay can provide time to study the issue and build support. The legislative process is not always linear, with bills following different paths. The Senate allows for the introduction of legislation at crucial times, with bills sometimes taken up due to emergencies. While there is no rule on bill preparation, the Office of the Legislative Counsel plays a key role in providing drafts to Senators and staff. Staff attorneys specialize in legislative drafting and work closely with committees to ensure bills align with sponsors' intentions. The Office of Legislative Counsel assists members and staff in drafting legislation to match sponsors' intent and Senate rules. Requests for bill drafting have doubled in the past decade, with a system in place to prioritize requests. Contact the office for assistance at Room 668 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building or email Receptionist@slc.senate.gov. The Office of Legislative Counsel has a system for prioritizing drafting requests, with measures in conference committee receiving the highest priority. Requests are prioritized based on the stage of the legislation and the workload of the office. Senators commonly attach a cosponsorship form when introducing a measure to signify support. When introducing a measure, Senators commonly attach a cosponsorship form listing names of supporters. Cosponsors show support for the proposal by contacting the legislative sponsor's office to add their names. Additional cosponsors can be added with unanimous consent after the measure is presented. There is no limit on the number of cosponsors a measure may have. A \"Dear Colleague\" letter is often used to inform Senators of a pending bill or resolution and solicit support. At the beginning of each new Congress, Senators can introduce measures by presenting them to the bill clerk on the Senate floor. Measures must be signed by the sponsoring Senator and include staff contact information. Senators can introduce an unlimited number of measures for any reason. On average, Senators introduced about 40 bills and resolutions per Congress between 1973 and 2016. Senators can introduce bills and resolutions by presenting them to the bill clerk on the Senate floor. They can make statements on the measure during morning business or at another point during the day. The text of the measure is typically printed in the Congressional Record by unanimous consent. Senators may also devise attention-grabbing titles for their legislation to attract media attention. If a Senator objects to the introduction of a bill, it may be introduced on the following legislative day. When a bill is heard, it can be introduced the next legislative day under Rule XIV. Referral decisions are made by the Senate Parliamentarian based on committee jurisdictions in Rule XXV. Referral is to the committee with jurisdiction over the predominant subject matter in the proposed legislation, which can lead to disagreements. Multiple referrals are rare and usually require unanimous consent. The Parliamentarian considers the predominant subject matter when referring a measure to committee. The Parliamentarian determines the committee referral of bills based on subject matter jurisdiction. Senate Rule XIV requires bills to be read twice before referral, but they are typically referred immediately without objection. Bills can be placed on the calendar without committee referral. The number of bills introduced in the Senate varies over time. The number of bills introduced in Congress varies over time, with the 109th Congress reaching a high point of 4,869 introductions. Most introduced measures are bills or joint resolutions, while concurrent and simple resolutions are used for internal matters of the chambers. Legislation in the Senate can be drafted as a simple or concurrent resolution to honor individuals, groups, or events. Senate committees can also report an \"original\" bill without waiting for referral, with the committee chair typically considered the sponsor. Original bills may not have cosponsors."
