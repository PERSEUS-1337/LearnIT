    "title": "SB 98",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 12439 of the Government Code is repealed. Section 22775 is amended to define \"family member\" as an employee's spouse, domestic partner, and children. Section 22781 is amended to define \"prefunding\" as making payments for postemployment health care benefits. Section 22843.1 is added to the Government Code. Section 22843.1 of the Government Code requires state employing offices to verify the eligibility of an employee's family members before enrolling them in a health benefit plan. Documentation must be maintained in the employee's file, and verification must be done periodically for different family members. Section 22844 of the Government Code states that employees, annuitants, and family members eligible for Medicare cannot be enrolled in a basic health benefit plan. They can enroll in a Medicare health benefit plan instead. Additionally, those enrolled in a prescription drug plan under Medicare Part D cannot be in a board-approved health benefit plan, unless the latter includes prescription drug coverage. Section 22865 of the Government Code requires the board to provide an initial estimate of proposed changes and costs to various committees and entities before approving benefits and premium readjustments. The board is required to report annually to the Legislature and the Director of Finance on the health benefits program, including details on health plans, benefits, out-of-pocket expenses, enrollment information, and geographic coverage. The board must report annually on the health benefits program, including historic expenditures, premium changes, benefit design, risk discussion, and prescription drug coverage details. The annual report on the health benefits program includes a discussion of risk, medical trend changes, premium reconciliation, member health data, federal subsidies impact, and costs beyond Medicare in supplemental plans. The annual report on the health benefits program includes details on Medicare supplemental plans costs, plan quality performance, member satisfaction, risk assessment, and mitigation policies for self-funded and flex-funded plans. The curr_chunk discusses reserve levels, factors affecting changes in reserves, policies for excess or inadequate reserves, premium decisions, reinsurance use, administrative expenditures, staffing levels, operating expenses, funding sources, investment strategies, and changes in strategic direction and policy initiatives. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the Annuitants\u2019 Health Care Coverage Fund in the State Treasury, allowing continuous appropriation of funds for prefunding health care coverage for annuitants, with the board having control over administration and investments. Moneys from investment income in designated state subaccounts of the fund cannot be used for state annuitant benefits until the funded ratio reaches 100% or July 1, 2046. Designated state subaccounts are separate accounts for prefunding benefits for specific state entities. This act allows for an alternative funding strategy if agreed upon in writing. It is a bill related to appropriations in the Budget Bill and will take effect immediately."
