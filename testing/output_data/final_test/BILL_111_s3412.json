Reduced service and higher fares can severely affect their quality of life. Millions of Americans rely on transit daily, and decreased service hinders job access and worsens traffic congestion. The Secretary of Transportation can provide grants for public transportation operating costs. Funds are apportioned with 80% according to section 5336, 10% according to section 5340, and 10% to other areas as per section 5311. The allocated amounts must be used for transportation purposes. The Secretary of Transportation can provide grants for public transportation operating costs to restore service, rescind fare increases, and prevent reductions through September 30, 2011, if due to funding decreases after January 1, 2009. Recipients can certify no major reductions to receive exceptions.
