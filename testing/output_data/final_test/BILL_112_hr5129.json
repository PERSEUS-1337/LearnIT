The program does not need to be funded, and eligible employees must be notified of its availability and terms. The plan must provide a written statement of expenses to eligible employees by January 31, showing amounts paid for student loan payment assistance. The plan must ensure that average benefits for non-highly compensated employees are at least 55 percent of those for highly compensated employees. Salary reduction agreements can be used to meet this requirement.

The term 'earned income' is defined in section 32(c)(2) and excludes employer payments for student loan assistance.
