    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medication Therapy Management Empowerment Act of 2011\". Congress recognizes the importance of medications in managing chronic diseases and the role of pharmacists in helping patients adhere to prescribed therapies. Nonadherence to medications is a significant issue, with only 50% of patients in developed countries following their medication regimens. Failure to adhere to prescribed medications costs over $290 billion annually, particularly impacting patients with chronic diseases. Poor adherence leads to disease progression, reduced quality of life, and premature death. Adhering to medication therapy can reduce higher-cost medical attention and preventable human costs. Community-based medication therapy management services by pharmacists have been shown to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce spending. The Asheville Project is a diabetes program designed for this purpose. The Asheville Project, a diabetes program in Asheville, North Carolina, led by community pharmacists, resulted in decreased medical costs, reduced sick days, and increased productivity. Another project improved medication compliance for patients with high cholesterol. The ChecKmeds NC program in North Carolina saved $34 million in healthcare costs through medication therapy management for seniors. The ChecKmeds NC program in North Carolina saved an estimated $34 million in healthcare costs since 2007 for over 31,000 seniors through medication therapy management by community pharmacists.
