    "content": "PROHIBITION ON SALE OF NAVAL VESSELS AND MARITIME ADMINISTRATION VESSELS FOR DISMANTLING ABROAD. Prohibition on selling Navy and Maritime Administration vessels for dismantling abroad, unless approved by EPA and Congress for compliance with environmental standards in the destination country. The Secretary of Labor must certify to Congress that the environmental standards in the country where a vessel is to be dismantled are similar to those in the United States, and that the country recognizes internationally recognized worker rights. The text chunk discusses a demonstration program for breaking up naval vessels and Maritime Administration vessels in United States shipyards. The Secretary of the Navy will conduct a demonstration program to evaluate breaking up naval and Maritime Administration vessels in US shipyards. Contracts will be awarded to two shipyards to break up vessels over 80,000 tons annually for three years. The Secretary will identify vessels for contracts before awarding them, with a deadline of 6 months after the Act's enactment. A \"qualified United States shipyard\" must meet specific criteria to be eligible for these contracts. Each shipyard awarded a contract under subsection (b) must have the capacity to perform required activities, including hazardous substance removal, and must break up and process scrap from vessels covered by the contract. The shipyard awarded a contract must perform activities specified in the subsection using employees of the shipyard. A report on the demonstration program must be submitted to Congress within a specified timeframe. The demonstration program activities involve assessing the feasibility of breaking up naval vessels and Maritime Administration vessels in US shipyards. The report to Congress must include findings and recommendations deemed appropriate by the Secretary."
