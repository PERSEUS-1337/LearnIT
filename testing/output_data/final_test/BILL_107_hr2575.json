The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section 25C, allowing a tax credit of $1,200 per applicable individual with long-term care needs certified by a physician. The new section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows a tax credit of $1,200 for individuals with long-term care needs certified by a physician, who meet specific age and assistance criteria. The new section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides a tax credit of $1,200 for individuals with long-term care needs certified by a physician, meeting specific age and assistance criteria. Eligible individuals must require substantial assistance with daily living activities or supervision due to cognitive impairment. Taxpayers can be eligible caregivers for themselves, their spouse, siblings, or parents. If multiple caregivers qualify for the same individual, one taxpayer will be designated as the caregiver. In a calendar year, a taxpayer can be considered an eligible caregiver if each individual (other than the taxpayer) files a written declaration stating they will not claim the applicable individual for the credit. If all required individuals do not file the declaration, the one with the highest income will be designated as the eligible caregiver. The taxpayer must include the name, taxpayer identification number, and physician identification number of the applicable individual to claim the credit. The eligible caregiver is determined based on income if married individuals file separately. The taxable year must be a full taxable year to qualify for the credit. The taxpayer must provide the correct TIN or physician identification for the applicable individual to claim the credit. The taxable year must be a full taxable year to qualify for the credit, except in cases of a taxpayer's death. Amendments include penalties for omitting required information on the return. The table of sections for subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by inserting a new item after section 25B. Section 25C provides a credit for taxpayers with long-term care needs, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2001."
