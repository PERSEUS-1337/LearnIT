It contributes significantly to research and development, provides high-quality jobs with higher wages than the service sector, and creates a multiplier effect on job creation and investments in other sectors. The manufacturing sector has a significant multiplier effect on the economy, with a job slump post-recession hitting the sector the hardest. The loss of manufacturing jobs in the US is attributed to the challenge of competing with lower-priced foreign products. Some governments intervene in currency markets to keep their currencies undervalued, benefiting their exports and hindering imports from the US. China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan hold $1.2 trillion in reserves, mostly in dollars, and contribute to 60% of the US trade deficit in manufactured goods. This manipulation strategy is evident in China. China aggressively intervenes to keep its currency, the renminbi, undervalued by pegging it at a fixed exchange rate against the dollar. This manipulation has led to a significant increase in the US trade deficit with China, reaching $103 billion in 2002. Economists estimate that China's currency manipulation has kept the renminbi's value essentially flat since 1994. The Chinese currency, the renminbi, is undervalued by 15 to 40 percent, giving Chinese manufacturers a price advantage. Japan's yen is undervalued by 20 percent, benefiting Japanese manufacturers. This currency manipulation puts US manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage. The United States has the right to address unfair competitive practices in international trade, including currency manipulation. The Secretary of the Treasury is mandated to determine if any country is manipulating its currency exchange rate to prevent balance of payments adjustments. The United States has the right to address unfair competitive practices in international trade, including currency manipulation. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to negotiate with countries with significant trade surpluses to prevent currency manipulation for gaining unfair advantages in trade. The International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade also prohibit currency manipulation to prevent unfair competitive advantages. Deliberate currency manipulation by nations to undervalue their currencies may violate international trade agreements, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Exchange Agreement and the Agreement on Subsidies. Currency manipulation can disrupt reciprocal and mutually advantageous trade arrangements. The United States Trade Representative has the authority to take action against deliberate currency manipulation by governments, which may violate international trade agreements and lead to remedies under the World Trade Organization dispute settlement procedures. The Trade Act of 1974 allows for redress of market disruption caused by currency manipulation by trading partners. Factors contributing to the decline of manufacturing in the US include non-tariff barriers, weak enforcement of trade agreements, and limited government support for trade promotion. The President will conduct negotiations with nations engaging in currency manipulation for 90 days to end the practice and ensure fair currency trading. Support will be sought from international agencies and affected regions. Findings of fact and a report on currency manipulation will be provided. During the 90-day negotiation period, the International Trade Commission will investigate currency manipulation by countries to boost exports to the US and limit imports, quantify the manipulation's extent, assess its impact on US manufacturers and trade levels, and analyze potential effects on US interest rates and public debt financing. The International Trade Commission will investigate currency manipulation by countries, assess its impact on US manufacturers and trade levels, and analyze potential effects on US interest rates and public debt financing. They will also determine available mechanisms for redress under international trade treaties and agreements, and provide a detailed report to relevant authorities within 90 days.

The US Trade Representative and International Trade Commission will also evaluate and report on unfair trade practices by major East Asian trading nations, including discriminatory tax regimes against imports. Trade Enforcement and Promotion: The US Trade Representative and International Trade Commission will report on improving trade enforcement against unfair practices and recommend additional support. The Secretaries of State and Commerce will also provide recommendations to enhance trade promotion for US goods and services.
