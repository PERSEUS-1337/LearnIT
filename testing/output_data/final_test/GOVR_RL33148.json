    "content": "President Bush announced a plan in 2004 to relocate military personnel from overseas bases in Europe and Asia to bases within the United States. The shift aimed to move away from large, comfortable bases like Ramstein Air Force Base to more austere facilities in Central Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The Congress chartered the Overseas Basing Commission to assess the Department of Defense's overseas basing needs. The DOD plan for overseas basing could impact budget decisions for Congress, including approving, modifying, or rejecting proposals. Congress may need to consider appropriations for infrastructure at new locations, acquisition programs for mobility capabilities, and treaties with new basing partners. The plan's feasibility may be influenced by the 2005 BRAC process results. The Department of Defense Global Posture Review, also known as the Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy (IGPBS), aims to realign U.S. overseas forces from Cold War-era bases to better support current allies and address new threats. The plan involves reducing overseas installations from 850 to 550, bringing back 70,000 personnel, and potentially saving $1 billion annually by minimizing troops permanently stationed abroad. The plan includes three tiers of bases, retaining main operating bases like Ramstein AFB in Germany. The military's overseas network under the Global Posture Review includes main operating bases like Ramstein AFB in Germany with full amenities, forward operating sites for temporary duty, and cooperative security locations for crisis access and training with local allies. The Global Posture Review includes plans for U.S. forces to train with local allies, participate in cooperative activities, and rely on off-shore prepositioning for logistical support. In Europe, nearly 200 facilities would close, and around 40,000 troops would be drawn down. Remaining forces in Europe would deploy from bases in Germany to locations in Romania, Bulgaria, and Central Asia. New forward operating sites like Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo and Manas Air Field in Kyrgyzstan would lack elaborate infrastructure. The Global Posture Review includes plans to shift military basing focus south and east, consolidate bases in South Korea, adjust troop dispositions in Japan, and potentially deploy forces to the Philippines, Malaysia, or Singapore for exercises and training. The United States is proposing various relocations of headquarters and troops in Asia. The U.S. military presence in Africa is expanding, with a focus on training and cooperation. The Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) in Djibouti is delivering military training and public works projects in the region, with plans to expand activities into Uganda and Tanzania. The U.S. military presence in Africa is expanding, with plans to transform the CJTF-HOA into a unified command for all of Africa. There are arguments for revising overseas military basing arrangements, as they are considered obsolete and may not align with current threats. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld highlighted the need to update the military's global posture. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld emphasized the need to update the military's global posture, stating that relocating personnel and facilities could reduce frictions with host governments and enhance cooperation with allies. He implied that nations imposing restrictions on U.S. forces would be viewed less favorably. It was widely assumed he was referring to friction with Germany over the invasion of Iraq and restrictions on U.S. training exercises. During his June 2005 testimony, Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Ryan Henry discussed the military's reliance on pre-positioned equipment and forces for forward operating sites. He mentioned improvements in military families' quality of life but acknowledged that more frequent short deployments could increase family separations. Deputy Undersecretary Henry discussed the 2005 BRAC round and the Quadrennial Defense Review study, but did not address criticism regarding the timing of the QDR. The impacts of global basing realignment and BRAC-driven relocations have not been clearly articulated. The Overseas Basing Commission released its final report on August 15, 2005. The Overseas Basing Commission released its final report critical of the DOD's overseas restructuring process and proposal. The report supported the concept of transforming the military to meet new requirements, shifting forces in South Korea and Central Europe, and utilizing forward operating sites and cooperative security locations for increased crisis options and alliances. The Overseas Basing Commission's final report criticized the DOD's overseas restructuring process for emphasizing military perspectives over diplomatic concerns. It raised issues about the timing and synchronization of global re-basing initiatives, highlighting the need for strategic decisions and coordination rather than quick base withdrawals based on current threats. The Overseas Basing Commission's final report criticized the DOD's overseas restructuring process for disregarding politics and values of potential allies, questioning the timing and ambitious timeline of the moves, and expressing concerns about the strain on military capabilities during ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The report emphasized the importance of mobility and equipment prepositioning for the success of the re-basing strategy. The report raised concerns about inadequate strategic airlift and sealift for the Defense Department's re-basing strategy, lack of prepositioned supply stocks, and insufficient plans for support facilities at bases gaining and losing personnel. It also criticized future budget plans for sea and airlift procurement not meeting the re-basing plan's needs. The report highlighted concerns about inadequate support facilities for military families overseas, including commissaries, exchanges, hospitals, and child care. It also warned that frequent family separations due to temporary overseas rotations could impact retention and recruiting. Additionally, the report suggested that the DOD may have underestimated the total cost of implementing the plan. The report raised concerns about the DOD underestimating the total cost of base realignment. The Commission's analysis projected a $20 billion cost, while the DOD budgeted only $4 billion. This discrepancy could lead to using operational funds, affecting force readiness. The Commission recommended a slower pace of overseas re-basing to ensure key capabilities are in place. The Commission emphasized the need for better budget support for establishing forces at new locations, including funding for movement of people and equipment. They also highlighted the importance of preparatory activities for local communities to absorb new military families. The Commission called for a formal national debate on American security post-Cold War before further re-basing moves and recommended diligent Congressional oversight to ensure a cohesive basing strategy. The Defense Department responded to the Commission's report in May 2005, with officials rebutting critiques and defending their strategic basing choices for flexibility and speed of response. Critics argue that predicting future threats is essential for articulating a strategic vision. Mr. Henry disagreed with the Commission's claim that the Department of Defense did not coordinate the Global Posture Review effectively. He mentioned meetings with combatant commanders, consultations with various government agencies, and briefings to Congress. He emphasized visits to foreign countries affected by relocations but did not provide details on the progress or status of forces agreements. The Global Posture Review was intended to inform the 2005 QDR and BRAC. The 2005 Global Posture Review was meant to inform the 2005 QDR and BRAC, with a focus on coordinating lift procurement and equipment acquisition to support the Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy. Mr. Dubois disputed concerns about military families' quality of life, stating that re-basing decisions were included in the BRAC analysis after discussions with various stakeholders. The re-basing decisions included in the BRAC analysis were discussed with stakeholders, including state governors and community leaders. There was no mention of additional impact aid for communities or plans to expand infrastructure near affected installations. The reduction in permanent changes of station for military families may offer stability, but assumes all bases are equally desirable, which is not always the case. Some military families find living overseas advantageous for their career. Mr. Dubois and Mr. Henry discussed the potential impact of increased unaccompanied overseas deployments on families and troops, as well as the disparity in cost figures between the Defense Department and the Commission. Mr. Henry suggested that the Commission's study included costs covered by other programs, while Mr. Dubois mentioned eventual savings in operations and maintenance accounts. However, there is no indication of a proposed budget increase to cover these costs. The Pentagon's budget does not propose an increase for construction, airlift procurement, or sealift procurement. It is uncertain if compensation from new host nations would offset what is currently received from established allies. Some new host nations, like Kyrgyzstan, are demanding payments from the U.S. for basing rights. Reaction to the plan is ongoing, with a focus on alliance relationships and the importance of U.S. presence for European stability and integration. Some critics fear that moving forces away from long term allies to basing in nations less likely to restrain U.S. military operations could give the Administration more latitude for unilateral military action in future crises. Concerns have been raised about eroding ties with traditional American allies, particularly with Germany. Some suggest that the moves were intended as punishment for Germany's opposition to U.S. operations in Iraq. Some advocacy groups warn about the impact of U.S. military relocations on quality of life for personnel and families. They express concerns about lack of preparation for unit moves, strain on civilian infrastructure, and potential problems with relocations. For example, soldiers at Fort Drum had to move up to 75 miles away for a new brigade posting. Soldiers at Fort Drum had to move up to 75 miles away for housing, causing strain on shift work and response times in crises. Scarce housing affects troops' standard of living, especially for families with both adults on active duty or single parents. It also drives up rent costs for junior enlisted members and limits civilian spouse employment opportunities. Other communities like El Paso, Texas, welcome job growth and homebuilding surge from military relocations. The Base Realignment and Closure findings from 2005 have been implemented, and other Department of Defense programs are progressing. The BRAC Commission reviewed Pentagon proposals to close or realign over 800 installations, with 86% of the DOD's proposal adopted. Congress did not prevent the BRAC results from taking effect, but implementation plans will be ready in early 2006. Closings must begin by 2007 and be completed by 2011. The 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review is being finalized, focusing on homeland defense, global war on terrorism, and conventional major warfare. The 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review is finalizing deliberations on force structure changes, including potentially reducing the Navy's carrier battle groups. The Mobility Capabilities Study, completed in July 2005, highlights the importance of logistics and mobility functions in the Global Posture Review. Despite a changed threat environment, the study supports the current planned program. The study concludes that the current planned program is sufficient to support national strategy, recommending no additional airlifters, sealift ships, or aerial refueling tankers. It suggests ending purchases of C-17 and C-130J transports while retaining and modernizing all Air Force C-5 transports. This recommendation contradicts calls for more C-17 aircraft by former U.S. Transportation Command commander General John Hardy and a 2005 Defense Science Board report questioning airlift and tanker capabilities. The Government Accountability Office also raised concerns about the DOD methodology behind the Mobility Capabilities Study. The Government Accountability Office raised concerns about the validity of modeling and simulation tools used in the Mobility Capabilities Study. Congress incorporated these concerns into the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act, directing the DOD to submit a report addressing selection criteria and funding for overseas locations. Congress also ordered DOD to notify congressional defense committees when basing agreements are completed with foreign governments. The FY2006 Authorization Act addressed mobility requirements for overseas basing, expressed skepticism towards the Mobility Capabilities Study, authorized the purchase of up to 42 C-17 airlifters pending a reassessment of airlift requirements, and directed consultation with state and local governments on infrastructure needs for returning forces. The FY2006 Authorization Act emphasized the importance of consulting with state and local governments on infrastructure needs for returning forces and directed a study on transportation infrastructure around bases affected by BRAC and IGPBS. Several recent positive events have helped move forward the implementation of the Global Posture Review. Secretary of State Rice signed agreements with Romania and Japan for stationing U.S. forces at various locations. Negotiations for basing in Bulgaria are also progressing. However, there are international developments that could potentially challenge key assumptions of the Global Posture Review. There are indications of a shift in international attitudes towards hosting U.S. forces. South Korea's President placed limits on U.S. forces' missions beyond the peninsula, while Kyrgyzstan demanded a significant increase in rent for the Manas air base. The U.S. refused additional charges for jet fuel, citing corruption issues within Kyrgyzstan. The Kyrgyz government is also seeking compensation for environmental damage from aircraft operations. Russian officials expressed dismay at the U.S. basing agreement with Romania, suggesting it could jeopardize the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe treaty. The U.S. was given 180 days to leave its air base in Uzbekistan, impacting operations in Afghanistan. The last contingent of U.S. troops departed Uzbekistan on November 21, 2005, following pressure from the State Department over human rights abuses and unease from China and Russia about U.S. military activity in Central Asia. Russia and China viewed U.S. support for democratic revolutions in the region as a threat to authoritarian leaders like President Karimov in Uzbekistan. China publicly supported Uzbekistan during demonstrations that led to U.S. criticism. China publicly supported Uzbekistan during demonstrations that led to U.S. criticism. President Karimov visited Beijing and secured $1.5 billion in contracts. The security climate in proposed U.S. forward bases could require significant manpower for local security. Afghanistan, a potential host for U.S. troops, faced a surge in violence in August 2005. Other countries hosting U.S. troops also faced significant terrorist threats. The \"Lord's Resistance Army\" continues brutal attacks in Uganda despite a failed cease-fire. In Turkmenistan, government crackdowns on terrorists have led to accusations of human rights violations. The Overseas Basing Commission emphasizes Congressional oversight of the basing realignment process. Key issues include the adequacy of the IGPBS linkage to a strategic framework and the need for a re-basing strategy. The lack of a comprehensive re-basing strategy without completing key defense reviews and obtaining buy-in from government agencies and Congress is seen as premature and could have significant impacts on U.S. foreign and security policy. Disagreements exist on cost projections for overseas realignment between the Defense Department and the Overseas Basing Commission. Proposing a re-basing strategy before completing important studies could lead to infrastructure and asset mismatches. The potential consequences of unfunded requirements for basing realignment moves include added pressure on services already strained by combat operations. The sustainability of frequent deployments and the impact on military families' quality of life and retention/recruiting are key concerns. Additionally, the effect of re-basing on long-term relationships with allies like Germany is uncertain. The re-basing proposal raises concerns about the impact on relationships with long-term U.S. allies like Germany, potential challenges in motivating international coalitions, and the need for legal arrangements in new host nations. Political climates and standing treaties also play a role in the decision-making process. The re-basing proposal raises concerns about potential impacts on relationships with long-term U.S. allies like Germany and the need for legal arrangements in new host nations. Early evidence suggests that DOD and the State Department should further examine potential treaty impacts."
