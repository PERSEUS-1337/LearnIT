Recipients receive the higher amount between the Special Minimum PIA and regular Social Security benefits. The number of recipients qualifying for the Special Minimum PIA has been decreasing, with only 0.6% of Social Security recipients qualifying in 2017. This report explains how the Special Minimum PIA works and provides historical background on minimum benefit provisions in the Social Security Act. The report discusses expanding the Special Minimum PIA in Social Security, eligibility requirements for retired-worker benefits, and how the PIA is calculated based on earnings credits. The PIA in Social Security is calculated based on the worker's lifetime earnings, known as the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). Earnings are indexed to historical wage growth, and the highest 35 years are used to determine career-average annual earnings. The AIME is divided by 12 to get a monthly amount. The standard benefit formula is applied to the AIME using bend points to calculate the PIA. In 2018, Social Security uses three conversion factors to compute the basic monthly benefit based on the worker's AIME. The benefit formula is progressive, providing higher replacement percentages for workers with low career-average earnings. Auxiliary benefits are also provided to eligible family members, such as a spouse's benefit equal to 50% of the worker's PIA. Unlike the regular benefit based on lifetime earnings, family benefits are a specified percentage of the worker's PIA. The Special Minimum PIA benefit is based on years in covered employment, with beneficiaries receiving the higher of two amounts. A year of coverage is when earnings exceed a specified threshold, currently set at $14,310 in 2018. This creates a \"cliff\" effect where even a small shortfall in earnings can impact eligibility. The Special Minimum PIA benefit is determined by a worker's years of coverage, with a minimum of 11 years required for eligibility. The monthly benefit starts at $40.80 in 2018 and increases by $43 for each additional year of coverage. The benefit amount is capped at $848.80 for those with 30 years of coverage. Initial Special Minimum PIA benefits are indexed to price inflation, while regular Social Security benefits are indexed to wage inflation, resulting in slower growth for the Special Minimum PIA benefits. The Special Minimum PIA benefit grows slower than regular benefits due to different inflation indexing. Monthly rates for dependents are based on worker's PIA. Various provisions can affect benefit payments, including actuarial reduction and retirement earnings test. The Social Security benefits system includes provisions such as the retirement earnings test (RET), government pension offset (GPO), and family maximum benefit. The delayed retirement credit (DRC) increases benefits for those who start receiving them after reaching full retirement age. Workers entitled to a pension from certain government positions not covered by Social Security may have their benefits reduced by the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP). This provision decreases the conversion factors used in the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) computation. Some beneficiaries can receive Social Security benefits based on their own work record and a spouse's work. If the retired-worker benefit is higher, only that benefit is received. If the retired-worker benefit is lower, the beneficiary is considered \"dually entitled\" and receives a payment equal to the spousal or survivor benefit. The impact of the Special Minimum PIA on beneficiaries has diminished over time, as regular benefits are usually higher due to wage indexing. The number of beneficiaries affected and the additional benefit from the Special Minimum PIA have both declined. The Special Minimum PIA has seen a decline in the number of families benefiting from it since 1988. It now only benefits newly entitled beneficiaries subject to the WEP. The difference between regular PIA and Special Minimum PIA for low earners has decreased, with an estimated $4 difference for those eligible in 2010. The provision is projected to have no effect on individuals turning 62 in 2019 or later. In June 2013, the Special Minimum PIA increased average benefits by $46 per month for those affected. In June 2013, the Special Minimum PIA increased average benefits by $46 per month for beneficiaries, with only about 35,000 out of 54 million Social Security beneficiaries receiving a higher monthly benefit. The discrepancy in numbers is due to dually entitled workers whose total benefits were not affected by the provision. The Special Minimum PIA provision, enacted in 1939, increased benefits for affected beneficiaries, with most being retired women workers. The law initially set a $10 minimum benefit, which was later adjusted periodically until 1975. The Special Minimum PIA provision, enacted in 1939, increased benefits for retired women workers with a $10 minimum benefit, adjusted periodically until 1975. Cost-of-living-adjustments (COLAs) in 1972 tied benefits to the Consumer Price Index, with initial minimum benefits frozen at $122 per month in 1978 for new beneficiaries. COLAs continued for monthly benefits. The rationale for freezing the minimum benefit (H.R. 9346; P.L. 95-216) was that it was being paid to individuals who did not rely on their covered earnings as their primary source of support, such as civil service retirement annuitants. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-35) eliminated the minimum benefit structure for all beneficiaries, effective January 1, 1982, due to public outcry. The Highway Revenue Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-123) was enacted in December 1981 to restore the original minimum benefit structure for certain Social Security beneficiaries. The Special Minimum PIA, established in 1972, aimed to reduce reliance on means-tested cash assistance for individuals who worked in covered employment for many years. The Special Minimum PIA provision, effective from January 1973, set the benefit base amount at $8.50 multiplied by years of coverage exceeding 10. It operated alongside the original minimum benefit until the end of 1981. Beneficiaries received the higher of the two benefits. Unlike the original minimum benefit, the Special Minimum PIA did not assist those with only a few years of Social Security payroll taxes. Initial benefits base was $9 from 1974 to 1978, then increased to $11.50 under the Social Security Amendments of 1977. Special Minimum PIA was indexed to prices and benefit levels after eligibility to price inflation. The Special Minimum PIA provision, effective from January 1973, set the benefit base amount at $8.50 multiplied by years of coverage exceeding 10. It operated alongside the original minimum benefit until the end of 1981. Unlike the original minimum benefit, the Special Minimum PIA did not assist those with only a few years of Social Security payroll taxes. Many policymakers and analysts have suggested creating a new minimum benefit to reward long-term, low-wage work without means testing. In 2016, the poverty rate for people aged 65 and older was 9.3%, with older women more likely to fall below the poverty line than men. The poverty rate for older adults varies by race and gender, with black older adults being nearly three times as likely to be poor as white older adults. Single black older women have a poverty rate of nearly 30%, compared to 13% for white women. Research suggests that restructuring the Social Security minimum benefit could be more effective in alleviating poverty than certain reforms to the SSI program. Minimum benefits could be a way to reward long-term, low-wage work with a Social Security benefit above the poverty threshold. Restructuring the Social Security minimum benefit to provide a benefit at or above the poverty threshold for long-term workers could more generously reward workforce participation. Minimum benefit guarantees in recent proposals aim to reduce poverty rates among older beneficiaries efficiently, reaching those who may not qualify for other Social Security benefits. Among women born in the 1960s, the proportion of white and Hispanic women eligible for spouse or widow benefits in old age is around 80%, compared to 50% of black women. The number of women eligible for these benefits is decreasing due to changing marriage and work patterns. Private pensions and savings are becoming more insecure and unequal, with employer pension support declining. Social Security minimum benefits could help protect older adults from new financial risks they are facing. The Special Minimum PIA may phase out to improve protections against financial risks for older adults. Arguments for phasing out include the inability to accurately target benefits to the working poor due to lack of earnings information. Means-tested programs like SSI may be a better way to supplement incomes for those in need, although means testing could potentially discourage work and saving. SSI's asset limits are currently low, with countable resources capped at $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples. Social Security is available to retired workers earlier than SSI, with benefits starting at age 62. SSI is generally insufficient to lift recipients above the federal poverty level. Proposals for a minimum benefit consider who should receive it and how much they should get, with a focus on years-of-coverage requirements to target those with extensive work history. Many recent proposals for a minimum benefit link it to the number of years worked in covered employment, with requirements ranging from 10 to 20 years. Lowering the years of coverage could help reach more workers, especially women and part-time workers. However, this may raise concerns about the impact on the program. Lowering the required number of years of coverage for a minimum benefit proposal could potentially result in inadequate benefits for some individuals, raising questions about work incentives. To prevent windfalls, the proposal could include the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) for those with pensions from noncovered employment. Limited workforce attachment may be due to various reasons such as caregiving or poor health. Some proposals suggest combining a years-of-coverage requirement with credits for caregiving, unemployment, or poor health. This could increase administrative costs for Social Security. Disabled workers under the SSDI program may be affected by minimum benefit proposals. The current-law year of coverage threshold for the Special Minimum PIA is $14,310. Insured status for regular benefits is based on quarters of coverage. Some proposals suggest counting quarters of coverage instead of years to qualify for minimum benefits. A study found that combining a quarterly coverage threshold with a lower dollar amount could reach more workers. The goal of a minimum benefit is to reduce poverty, but the current Special Minimum PIA is not linked to poverty. The Special Minimum PIA benefit is not linked to poverty, with many recipients still below the federal poverty threshold. Proposed reforms include increasing benefit levels as a percentage of poverty guidelines or a new poverty measure. Another suggestion is to extend the maximum years of coverage for benefit determination beyond 30 years. This reform would reward additional years of work and slightly increase benefits for those with the most need. The reform proposal aims to slightly increase benefits for individuals with 35 or more work years. Policymakers would need to determine how the minimum benefit would grow annually, with options to index it to prices or workers' income. The current Special Minimum PIA benefit, linked to prices, has become negligible compared to regular Social Security benefits tied to wages. The maximum SSI monthly benefit, serving as the de facto minimum benefit, currently grows with prices. If the Social Security minimum benefit is redesigned to be more generous or reach more people, it would be necessary to address interactions with other programs targeted at low-income individuals, such as SSI, Medicaid, SNAP, and LIHEAP. SSI is available to people with low incomes and limited resources, and if a Social Security beneficiary also receives SSI, there may be no advantage to an increase in Social Security benefits as SSI benefits will be reduced by an equal amount. The SSI federal benefit rate is $750 per month in 2018 for individuals living independently, supplemented by any federally administered state supplement. Countable income includes earned and unearned income, with SSI eligibility at risk if countable income exceeds the base SSI benefit. Losing SSI eligibility may also result in losing Medicaid eligibility, but Section 1619(b) of the Social Security Act protects Medicaid eligibility for those who lose SSI due to earned income only. Medicaid eligibility may be lost for individuals who lose SSI eligibility due to earned income, with limited protection for those losing eligibility based on unearned income. Proposals include maintaining Medicaid eligibility for those losing SSI due to increased special minimum benefit or increasing the disregarded dollar amount of Social Security benefits for SSI eligibility. Various proposals for minimum benefits include a benefit based on years of work, an enhancement of benefits, or an increase in benefits by a fixed-dollar amount. The Office of the Chief Actuary, CBO, and SSA's Office of Retirement Policy have analyzed minimum benefit options. One option is to reconfigure the Special Minimum PIA based on years of work, with a benefit equivalent to 125% of the poverty line for those with 30 years of work. Years of work are defined as earning four quarters of coverage, with a phased-down benefit for those with less than 30 years but more than 10 years of earnings. The option to count up to eight years of childcare as coverage would increase benefits for a significant portion of beneficiaries, particularly low earners born in the 1960s, 1980s, and 2000s. It is estimated to raise benefits by about 10-27% for low earners and increase retired worker benefits for 30% of new beneficiaries and 45% of disabled benefit recipients in 2040. The long-term budgetary impact would be significant according to SSA's Office of the Chief Actuary. Enactment of the option to include childcare years would increase the OASDI trust funds actuarial deficit by 0.15% without childcare provision and 0.22% with it. The shortfall would rise by 5% and 8% respectively, requiring a payroll tax rate increase to 12.55% (or 12.66% with childcare years) for solvency. Another similar proposal in 2010 suggested a cost increase of 0.12% to raise the tax rate to 12.52%. In 2011, Representative Jason Chaffetz proposed setting the minimum PIA for workers with 30 years of coverage at 100% of the poverty level, costing an additional 0.10% of taxable payroll. The Social Security Enhancement and Protection Act of 2013 also suggested a similar minimum PIA, with a reduction for fewer years of work and a limit of five childcare years, resulting in a 0.2% increase in the actuarial deficit starting in 2020. The S.O.S. Act of 2016 proposed increasing coverage years for full benefits to 40, with a minimum PIA at 125% of the poverty level decreasing to 100% with 20 years and 0% with 10 years. The Rivlin-Domenici task force suggested a minimum PIA for 30 years at 133% of the poverty level, costing 0.5% more in taxable payroll. The proposed minimum benefit under Representative Paul Ryan's option in 2010 would be based on a worker's years of work and average earnings, with a decline for fewer years of earnings and higher average earnings. The budgetary impact of this provision was estimated to be relatively small. The Social Security Reform Act of 2016 proposed changes to the Special Minimum benefit, with a phased implementation for newly eligible workers from 2024 to 2033. Workers with 35 years of coverage could receive a minimum PIA equal to 35% of Average Wage Index, decreasing to zero with 10 or fewer years of coverage. This option was estimated to increase the actuarial deficit by 0.22% of taxable payroll in the 75-year projection. The Social Security Reform Act of 2016 proposed changes to the Special Minimum benefit, with a phased implementation for newly eligible workers from 2024 to 2033. Workers with 35 years of coverage could receive a minimum PIA equal to 35% of Average Wage Index, decreasing to zero with 10 or fewer years of coverage. An alternative approach analyzed by CBO would increase the standard benefit for low-wage workers by up to 40%, with smaller increases for workers with at least 20 years of work and below-average lifetime earnings. This option would increase total benefits by about 7%, with median benefits for low earners increasing by about 24%. The Bipartisan Policy Center's Commission on Retirement Security and Personal Savings has proposed a basic minimum benefit (BMB) that supplements Social Security benefits. The BMB would be automatic but phased out based on the benefit amount, with higher income filers repaying it through the income-tax system. The actuarial deficit of this proposal would be 0.20% of taxable payroll in the 75-year projection, increasing the projected long-range shortfall of OASDI trust funds by 7%. Another approach would be to set a minimum dollar Social Security benefit for qualifying individuals. A universal Social Security benefit could greatly reduce elderly poverty, but it may not be well-targeted as it could increase benefits for those with higher non-Social Security income. About one-sixth of beneficiaries had benefits lower than the maximum SSI benefit level in 1996. In 1996, setting a minimum Social Security benefit equal to the SSI benefit would have increased total Social Security outlays by about 2%. Instead of implementing a minimum benefit, low-wage workers could be assisted through other approaches, such as changes to the standard benefit formula or a separate program. Proposals to address poverty among long-term, low-wage workers include targeting benefit increases to specific groups like single or divorced women or those who live into advanced old age. Proposals to increase benefits for aged women include lowering the length-of-marriage requirement for divorced women, adding caregiver credits to the Social Security benefit formula, and increasing the survivor's benefit to 75% of the couple's combined benefit. These proposals aim to address equity and adequacy concerns rather than financing issues and may raise system costs. Increasing federal support for poor aged and disabled individuals could be done outside of Social Security, such as through increases in federal SSI spending. A new program called the Senior Income Guarantee (SIG) could provide benefits at 75% of the poverty threshold for individuals at or above full retirement age with 10 years of covered work and 40 years of residence in the US. It would offer less strict benefit and eligibility standards compared to SSI, with more generous asset tests."
