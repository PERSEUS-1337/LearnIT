Congress finds that the National Forest System trails are in need of significant maintenance, with a backlog of $314 million and an additional $210 million needed annually. This lack of maintenance threatens access to public lands, poses environmental risks, and may increase future costs. The National Forest System trails require more efficient maintenance solutions due to budget limitations. Volunteers, partners, and outfitters are crucial for trail maintenance, and a comprehensive strategy is necessary to utilize them effectively. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"Administrative Unit\" referring to national forests or grasslands, \"Outfitter or guide\" as individuals or businesses providing outfitting services, \"Partner\" as a non-Federal entity in a partnership, \"Partnership\" as voluntary agreements between the Department of Agriculture and non-Federal entities, and \"Priority area\" as a specific region on National Forest System land. Trail maintenance refers to activities that ensure trails within the National Forest System are usable and sustainable, including making sure they are passable, preventing environmental damage, protecting public safety, and avoiding future maintenance costs. Trail maintenance activities aim to ensure trails in the National Forest System are sustainable, passable, and safe, while also preventing environmental damage and avoiding future maintenance costs. Volunteers are defined in accordance with federal regulations. The National Forest System Trails Volunteer and Partnership Strategy is outlined in Section 4. The Secretary must publish a strategy in the Federal Register to increase volunteer and partner involvement in trail maintenance within 2 years of this Act. The strategy should enhance Federal employees' capabilities, offer opportunities for volunteers and partners in all Forest Service regions, address barriers to volunteerism, and prioritize regions with severe trail maintenance needs. The Secretary must publish a strategy to increase volunteer and partner involvement in trail maintenance within 2 years of this Act. The strategy aims to enhance Federal employees' capabilities, offer opportunities for volunteers and partners in all Forest Service regions, address barriers to volunteerism, and prioritize regions with severe trail maintenance needs. Additionally, the strategy should aim to increase trail maintenance by volunteers and partners by 100 percent within 5 years of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary shall study opportunities to improve trail maintenance by using fire crews in a manner that does not jeopardize firefighting capabilities, public safety, or resource protection. If determined beneficial, these proposals will be incorporated into the strategy. The Secretary shall consult with volunteer and partner organizations to develop a strategy for increasing volunteer involvement in trail maintenance. Regulations will be adopted to ensure shared financial risk for claims or liability related to volunteers. The Secretary will require each administrative unit to develop a volunteer and partner coordination plan for trail maintenance. A report will be prepared on the strategy's effectiveness in addressing the trail maintenance backlog, increasing volunteerism, and miles of trails maintained by volunteers and partners. The Secretary will submit a report on the effectiveness of the volunteer and partner coordination plan for trail maintenance, including stewardship credits for outfitters and guides pilot program status and recommendations for increasing volunteerism and partnerships. The Secretary will submit a report on the effectiveness of the volunteer and partner coordination plan for trail maintenance to the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives. SEC. 5. PRIORITY TRAIL MAINTENANCE PROGRAM. The Secretary of Agriculture must select 9-15 priority areas for increased trail maintenance within 6 months of the Act's enactment. Priority areas must meet criteria related to access, natural resource protection, public safety, trail usability, and deferred maintenance costs. Public input on priority areas must be considered in the selection process. Within 6 months of the Act's enactment, the Secretary of Agriculture must select priority areas for increased trail maintenance in each region of the United States Forest Service. The approach developed should substantially increase trail maintenance accomplishments, consider public input, costs, benefits, and involve partners and volunteers. The Secretary of Agriculture must select priority areas for increased trail maintenance within each region of the United States Forest Service. Regional volunteer coordinators may assist partner organizations in implementing projects to enhance trail maintenance. The Secretary will periodically review and revise priority areas as needed. The Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with various entities to carry out the Act, focusing on trail maintenance in priority areas. Stewardship credits are provided for outfitters and guides. Within a year of the Act's enactment, the Secretary will establish a pilot program on at least 20 administrative units to offset outfitting and guiding permit fees with work on National Forest trails, trailheads, or sites. The program aims to improve trail maintenance and will have specific terms and conditions."
