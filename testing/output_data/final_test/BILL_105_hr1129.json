The Congress finds that over 1 billion people in the developing world live in severe poverty, with high child mortality rates and preventable deaths. Women in poverty face greater workloads and fewer opportunities than men. Directly aiding the poorest, especially women, has positive effects on family incomes and child health. The poor in the developing world, especially women, lack stable employment and social safety nets, often turning to self-employment. However, they struggle to access credit at reasonable rates, leading to high interest payments. A global microcredit summit in 1997 aimed to expand credit access for self-employment. The global microcredit summit in 1997 aimed to expand credit access for self-employment and other financial services to 100 million of the world's poorest families, particularly women, by 2005. This goal would benefit nearly half of the world's 1 billion absolute poor by providing loans at reasonable interest rates through self-sustaining microcredit programs led by organizations like the Grameen Bank and Accion International. Microcredit institutions, supported by organizations like FINCA, IFAD, and UNDP, have been successful in lending to the very poor with repayment rates of 95% or higher. These institutions not only reduce poverty but also decrease dependency on foreign assistance by using interest income to cover costs, ensuring long-term sustainability. Loans are recycled, leveraging foreign assistance resources for new benefits. The United States Agency for International Development launched a microenterprise initiative in 1994 to expand funding for microenterprise programs, with a goal that half of all resources would support programs providing credit to the poorest with loans under $300. This initiative is part of a global strategy for poverty reduction and economic development. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is crucial to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit. The United States needs to provide a small increase in funding for international microcredit programs, focusing on institutions serving the poorest. Expanding and replicating successful microcredit institutions is essential to reach millions of the poorest with microcredit. These institutions require assistance in developing their capacity and accessing commercial capital. Nongovernmental organizations have shown competence in developing networks for local microcredit. The United States Agency for International Development should prioritize investing in successful nongovernmental network institutions to expand microcredit services for the very poor globally. This leadership can help create a sustainable infrastructure to reach millions of the poorest families with financial services. The United States Agency for International Development can lead other development agencies in expanding support for the microenterprise sector and improving coordination of donor efforts to provide financial services to the poor. By increasing support for microcredit, especially for the poorest, USAID can continue to play a key role in expanding financial services to 100 million of the poorest families globally. The purpose of the United States Agency for International Development is to expand support for the microenterprise sector and improve coordination of donor efforts to provide financial services to the poor. The Act aims to expand microenterprise development, make it a key part of economic growth strategy, support NGOs in providing services to microentrepreneurs, increase assistance for credit activities in developing countries, and improve access to credit for the poorest, especially women. The Act aims to expand microenterprise development, support NGOs in providing services to microentrepreneurs, increase assistance for credit activities in developing countries, and improve access to credit for the poorest, particularly women. It also encourages the United States Agency for International Development to lead in promoting microenterprise among donors. SEC. 4. MICRO- AND SMALL ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT CREDITS. Section 108 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to focus on micro- and small enterprise development credits. The Congress recognizes the importance of supporting micro- and small enterprises in developing countries for stable growth and a fair international economic system. It is in the best interest of the United States to assist in private sector development through programs providing credit, training, and technical assistance. Assistance to private institutions can complement grant assistance for micro- and small private enterprises. The President is authorized to provide credit availability to these enterprises through loans, guarantees, training programs for lenders, and entrepreneurs to better manage their businesses. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development will establish eligibility criteria for entities assisting microenterprises. Criteria may include recipients' lack of access to formal financial sector, being among the poorest, focus on working with poor women, cost recovery, and financial sustainability. SEC. 129 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 introduces Microenterprise Development Grant Assistance. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development will set eligibility criteria for entities aiding microenterprises, focusing on those with limited access to formal financial services, the poorest populations, and women in poverty. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development is authorized to provide grant assistance for microenterprises in developing countries through various organizations. Approximately half of the credit assistance will be used for poverty lending programs. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development is authorized to provide grant assistance for microenterprises in developing countries, including poverty lending programs targeting very poor members of society, especially women. Support should be given to mechanisms that provide technical support, strengthen institutional development of intermediary organizations, and share information for sustainable development impact. A monitoring system will be established to maximize the impact of the assistance. The Administrator will establish a monitoring system with performance goals and indicators for grant assistance to microenterprises in developing countries, focusing on sustainable development impact, especially for the very poor, particularly poor women. SEC. 6. MULTILATERAL COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. The Congress recognizes the International Fund for Agricultural Development's mission to serve the rural poor and its support for microfinance activities. IFAD can contribute to a global network of sustainable microfinance institutions for the very poor. The Congress supports cooperation with IFAD to expand activities, especially in institutional development. The US should continue to support IFAD's microenterprise and microfinance initiatives. The Congress supports the United Nations Development Program's Microstart Program and urges the President to back it through the US representative at the UN."
