Congress finds that the Hanford Reach, the last free-flowing nontidal segment of the Columbia River in the US, is vital for anadromous fish migration and should be designated as a recreational river under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The Hanford Reach in the Northwest United States is crucial for fish spawning, including fall chinook salmon and steelhead trout. It also provides habitat for various wildlife species and offers recreational activities like hunting, fishing, and hiking near the Tri-Cities area of Washington. The Hanford Reach has been significant for Native Americans for over 10,000 years, with 150 archaeological sites. The southern shore showcases the Manhattan Project history and nuclear production. The White Bluffs area is rich in fossils from the Pliocene period. Protecting the Hanford Reach as a national wild and scenic river can boost local revenues and attract economic investment. The Hanford Reach, designated as a wild and scenic river, can aid in the cleanup of contaminated areas at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. It also serves as an outdoor laboratory and classroom, offering unique educational opportunities. The Columbia River shore downstream of the Hanford Reach in the Tri-Cities area has high levees that create a barrier for migrating fish. Modifying these levees could improve habitat for fish and wildlife, reduce mortality of migratory fish and waterfowl, and benefit the area's natural and human history. Local jurisdictions in the Tri-Cities area are interested in partnering with agencies to study rivershore restoration and develop a plan of action, aiming to improve habitat for migratory fish and waterfowl, enhance rivershore access, recreation, and aesthetics. The Act aims to protect the natural, cultural, scenic, and recreational resources of the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River, promote education and interpretation of the area, and restore the natural habitat downstream in the Tri-Cities area of Washington. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is amended to designate the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River in Washington as a recreational river, managed by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with relevant laws. The Act designates the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River in Washington as a recreational river, managed by the Secretary of the Interior in consultation with various stakeholders. Nothing in the Act allows for the alteration of the river's classification. The Act designates the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River in Washington as a recreational river, managed by the Secretary of the Interior in consultation with local governments, an advisory council, and the public to develop a strategy for acquiring. The Act designates the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River in Washington as a recreational river, managed by the Secretary of the Interior in consultation with local governments, an advisory council, and the public to develop a strategy for acquiring private land in the area defined by the applicable environmental impact statement through various means like purchase, conservation easement, lease, or donation on a willing-seller basis. Recreation is recognized as an outstandingly remarkable value of the designated area, giving it a high management priority along with the protection of natural, cultural, and scenic resources. Coordination and cooperation with State, local, and tribal governments, as well as other entities, are emphasized in the development and implementation of educational and interpretive programs. The Act focuses on developing educational and interpretive programs related to the Hanford Reach, including constructing a center and coordinating efforts with local governments and schools. It also aims to enhance recreational tourism in the area. The Hanford Reach efforts can be coordinated through a community-based bureau. Access corridors will be retained, and the designation of the river segment will not affect hydroelectric facility relicensing or water rights laws. The paragraph discusses restrictions on energy, transmission, water intake, and outfall facilities on the river segment, including prohibiting their operation or maintenance, and imposing remediation requirements. These restrictions aim to protect the natural, cultural, and scenic resources of the river segment and adjacent land area. The paragraph prohibits construction of temporary facilities for remediation and restoration of contaminated areas within the river segment's viewshed. It also addresses the Secretary of Energy's obligations at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation under various environmental laws. Additionally, it discusses rivershore restoration and enhancement. The Secretary of the Army, in coordination with other agencies, will develop a plan for rivershore restoration and enhancement in the Tri-Cities area of Washington, focusing on habitat, recreation, and aesthetics. The Secretary of the Army, in coordination with other agencies, will develop a preliminary restoration plan for rivershore projects in the Tri-Cities area of Washington within 180 days of enactment. This includes Clover Island and levee areas in Kennewick. The Secretary of the Army will develop a preliminary restoration plan for rivershore projects in the Tri-Cities area of Washington, including levee modifications in Kennewick, Franklin County, and Pasco. Each project will be considered separately. The Secretary of the Army will develop a preliminary restoration plan for rivershore projects in the Tri-Cities area of Washington, including levee modifications in Kennewick, Franklin County, and Pasco. Each project will be considered separately and completed within 18 months."
