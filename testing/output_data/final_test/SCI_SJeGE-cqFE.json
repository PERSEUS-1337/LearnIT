Existing DRS focus on profit or minimizing travel time, neglecting the social experience of riders. DROPS is a framework that considers riders' social preferences to enhance trip quality. It aims to maximize operational value for service providers while maximizing trip value for users based on compatibility and ride time. Dynamic ridesharing services like UberPool and LyftLine are popular for urban commute. A real-time matching algorithm is used for trip formation, considering social preferences based on user surveys. The approach improves riders' social compatibility without significantly impacting vehicle miles or travel time. Dynamic ridesharing services like UberPool and LyftLine are popular for urban commute due to cost effectiveness and ease of finding a ride in large cities. Dynamic ridesharing helps reduce operational costs for service providers by serving customers with fewer vehicles. User satisfaction in ridesharing systems is not only influenced by travel time but also by compatibility with strangers, which can be a barrier for some users. Dynamic ridesharing services like UberPool and LyftLine are popular for urban commute due to cost effectiveness and ease of finding a ride in large cities. User satisfaction is influenced by travel time and compatibility with strangers, which can pose a major barrier. Preferences for riding with co-passengers of the same gender can impact trip optimization for service providers. DROPS (Dynamic Ridesharing Optimization using social PreferenceS) is a framework that incorporates social preferences of users in trip formation for ridesharing services like UberPool and LyftLine. It aims to optimize trip value for both passengers and service providers by considering user preferences through a weight vector. The value of a trip for a user is calculated based on social compatibility, ride time, and cost. A bi-objective optimization problem is solved using scalarization BID18, with the weight vector controlling the importance of each objective. Shared trips are evaluated using an optimal trajectory planning algorithm, considering social factors like age, gender, user rating, and time preference. The feasibility of incorporating social preferences into trip scheduling is empirically evaluated. The impact of incorporating social preferences into trip scheduling is empirically evaluated using a real-world taxi trips dataset. Results show that matching with social preferences improves user satisfaction without significantly affecting operational costs. The study presents a system for dynamic ridesharing with social preferences. Dynamic ridesharing with social preferences, presented as DROPS, utilizes a real-time greedy algorithm for trip formation. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates the benefits of social matching in dynamic ridesharing using real-world taxi data and a population model based on user surveys. This approach differs from car-pooling by focusing on a dynamic ridesharing setting with a service provider managing the vehicle fleet. Optimizing dynamic ridesharing services is a key research area, involving various fields like operations research and artificial intelligence. Different solution methods such as optimization-based, partition-based, auction-based, and genetic algorithms are used to optimize routing and travel time. Common objectives include minimizing system-wide vehicle-miles. The DROPS framework aims to improve user experience in dynamic ridesharing by considering social preferences in trip formation. It allows for customizing rides to enhance user compatibility and satisfaction. The DROPS framework enhances user experience in dynamic ridesharing by incorporating social preferences such as age, gender, and user ratings. Preferences are based on user surveys and indicate desirability, undesirability, or indifference towards certain factors. The DROPS framework improves user experience in dynamic ridesharing by considering social preferences like age, gender, and user ratings. Preferences are represented as vectors and the goal is to maximize operational and user value through bi-objective optimization. The DROPS framework enhances user experience in dynamic ridesharing by incorporating social preferences such as age, gender, and user ratings. To maximize operational and user value, a bi-objective optimization approach is used, employing scalarization to combine multiple objectives into a single scalar value based on weight vectors. The weight values for operational and user values are denoted as \u03b2o and \u03b2u respectively, resulting in a single objective function for optimization. The user utility in dynamic ridesharing depends on social compatibility with co-passengers and the discount gained. Social utility is calculated based on preferences and demographics of co-passengers. An example with two requests shows how social utility is determined. The solution approach for dynamic ridesharing involves trip formation and dispatch components. Requests are matched with vehicles in each decision cycle, with a focus on unassigned requests and vehicles. The route planner calculates optimal trajectories for pickups and drop-offs, using a greedy matching algorithm. The algorithm for trip formation in dynamic ridesharing matches requests to trips based on a minimum improvement threshold. Each request is assigned to the best trip that meets the improvement criteria, creating new trips if necessary. The route planner generates trajectories to optimize pick-up and drop-off order for maximizing trip value. The algorithm selects the best route for trip formation and updates it when new requests are added. The output is a set of trips formed. To handle computational complexity, requests are partitioned based on independence, allowing matches to be formed in parallel. In the algorithm, trips are formed by partitioning requests into geographic zones and dispatching them based on trip value or queue time. The dispatch threshold and queue time are set by the service provider, ensuring timely service for unserved requests. The experiments evaluate the impact of using social preferences in ridesharing, with respect to users and the service provider. A realistic simulator of ridesharing was built using the Chicago taxi trips dataset and a population model based on user surveys. The results obtained using social preferences in dynamic ridesharing matching (SM) were compared with other methods. The study compared results from using social preferences in dynamic ridesharing matching with three baselines. Algorithms were implemented on a computer with specific specifications for evaluation. The experiments aimed to illustrate the benefits of social matching in ridesharing. In this case, the benefits of social matching are highlighted. The greedy algorithm sets the trip threshold \u03b4 to zero, adding requests to trips without diminishing their value. The request queue time threshold for dispatch is five minutes. Travel time and distances are calculated using straight line distances and a vehicle speed of 30 miles per hour. The experiments do not consider actual routes and traffic conditions but focus on the relative merits of each approach. The population model used in the experiments is not specified. The study is based on online surveys in North America with 489 responses indicating a preference for matching with similar people. Demographic data is from Chicago, preferences and weights are based on survey results. Some users are reluctant to use ridesharing without social matching. Chicago taxi trips data includes trip-specific information. The study analyzes Chicago taxi trip data, partitioning it into zones for training and testing. Empirical weights for scalarization are determined using training data. The algorithm is evaluated on test sets with different weight combinations for zones 8, 28, and 56. Requests from these zones are analyzed based on their request densities. The study analyzes Chicago taxi trip data, partitioning it into zones for training and testing. Requests from zones with high, medium, and low densities are analyzed based on their average number of requests per day. The impact on users is measured in terms of total user value, average social utility per minute, and increase in ride time. Trips formed by maximizing operational value have the least user value, while the approach (SM) achieves user value close to optimizing for user value alone. This approach overcomes the drawback of trips being dispatched after five minutes, which reduces user value. Our approach optimizes for both objectives, providing greater cumulative value for a trip and enabling quicker dispatch. The social utility per minute measures user compatibility with co-passengers. SM consistently performs as well as or better than B2, improving user value through better matching. The average ride time for requests is 10-20 minutes, with our technique adding around three minutes. Ridesharing in general incurs some increase in ride time. The increase in ride time of our technique is well within the acceptable range for users, with social compatibility offsetting the additional time. The impact on the service provider is determined by operational value and total miles driven, with our approach achieving higher user utility and operational value compared to other objectives. Our approach improves trip quality without significantly affecting total miles driven or operating costs. The matching algorithm is fast, with run times of 0.5 seconds in high request density zones. Comparison to a hindsight greedy matching shows potential gains in operational and user value with knowledge of future requests. Our approach achieves high operational and user value by forming trips based on real-time requests, showing potential gains in user value with knowledge of future requests. The DROPS system optimizes dynamic ridesharing with social preferences, improving user value without affecting operational value. Social matching incentivizes more individuals to use the service. The study found that social matching can benefit dynamic ridesharing by incentivizing more users to use the service, especially in areas with high request density and user compatibility. Future research will focus on extending the matching model to consider nearby trips, using multi-objective planning algorithms, and employing predictive models for future requests. The relative benefits of social matching are expected to persist."
