    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Workforce Reduction Through Attrition Act\" and defines key terms such as agency, baseline quarter, Federal employee, quarter, and total number of Federal employees. SEC. 3. WORKFORCE LIMITS AND REDUCTIONS. The President, through the Office of Management and Budget, must ensure that the total number of Federal employees in each quarter does not exceed the set maximum. The \"applicable maximum\" is calculated based on the baseline number of employees minus two-thirds of those separating from agencies after the baseline quarter. The \"target-attainment quarter\" is defined as the first quarter where the total number of Federal employees is below 90% of the number as of September 30, 2013, or the quarter ending on September 30, 2016. Compliance with employee limits is required, with exceptions outlined. Any necessary reductions to comply with subsection (a) must be made through attrition, except if the total number of Federal employees exceeds the maximum allowed, in which case reductions can be made through attrition and a freeze on appointments. Counting rules for Federal employees must be based on full-time equivalents and determined under section 4. The President has the authority to waive provisions of the section for individual appointments in cases of war, national security, or emergencies. The total number of Federal employees for a quarter will be determined by the Office of Management and Budget. SEC. 4 of the Act mandates a reduction in service contract procurement expenses equal to the previous year's reduction in Federal workforce spending. The President can waive this requirement in cases of war, national security, or emergencies. The Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Office of Personnel Management, is responsible for monitoring agencies quarterly to determine if the requirements of section 3(a) have been met. A written determination must be submitted to the President and Congress within 14 days after each quarter. The President or his designee may prescribe any necessary regulations to carry out the Act."
