The \"Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act\" aims to address the economic losses caused by counterfeit goods in various industries. Ties have been established between counterfeiting and terrorist organizations, posing a threat to public health and safety. Strong domestic criminal remedies against counterfeiting will allow the US to seek stronger anticounterfeiting provisions in agreements with trading partners. SEC. 2. TRAFFICKING IN COUNTERFEIT MARKS. Section 2320 of title 18, United States Code is amended to include trafficking in counterfeit goods or services, as well as labels, patches, stickers, wrappers, badges, and other items with counterfeit marks. Property bearing counterfeit marks used in violations will be subject to forfeiture to the United States. The court shall order the forfeiture of any property used to commit a violation of trafficking in counterfeit goods or services, including items with counterfeit marks. Civil forfeiture provisions under chapter 46 of title 18, including section 983, apply to seizures under this section. Upon conclusion of forfeiture proceedings, forfeited articles with counterfeit marks must be destroyed or disposed of according to the law. The court may order the forfeiture of property obtained through the offense, property used to commit the offense, and articles with counterfeit marks. Forfeiture procedures are governed by the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. When a person is convicted of an offense involving a counterfeit mark, the court shall order the forfeiture and destruction of any article bearing the mark. The convicted person must also pay restitution to the mark owner and other victims of the offense. The term \"victim\" is defined as per section 3663A(a)(2). The court shall order the forfeiture and destruction of any article bearing a counterfeit mark, which includes various items like patches, stickers, containers, and labels that are identical or substantially indistinguishable from a registered mark. The court shall order the forfeiture and destruction of any article bearing a counterfeit mark, which includes various items like patches, stickers, containers, and labels that are identical or substantially indistinguishable from a registered mark. The term \"counterfeit mark\" refers to any label, patch, sticker, wrapper, badge, emblem, medallion, charm, box, container, can, case, hangtag, documentation, or packaging designed for use with goods or services registered in the USPTO, likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception. The term \"counterfeit mark\" does not include marks or designations used in connection with authorized goods or services, as specified by the manufacturer or producer. Section 2320 is further amended to redesignate subsection (f) as subsection (g) and insert a new subsection after (e). The United States cannot bring a criminal cause of action for the repackaging of genuine goods or services not intended to deceive or confuse. SEC. 3. SENTENCING GUIDELINES. The United States Sentencing Commission must review and potentially amend sentencing guidelines for individuals convicted of offenses under specific sections of the United States Code within 180 days of this Act's enactment. The Commission is authorized to make amendments following specified procedures, and it is responsible for determining the definition of \"infringement amount.\" The United States Sentencing Commission will review the adequacy of the definition of \"infringement amount\" in the Federal sentencing guidelines to address situations where the defendant trafficked items intended to facilitate infringement or counterfeit goods, considering cases like U.S. v. Sung. The Senate passed S. 1699 on November 10, 2005, to amend title 18, United States Code, providing criminal penalties for trafficking in counterfeit marks."
