    "title": "AB 2182",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Neurocognitive Testing Pilot Grant Program is established in the Education Code to provide funding to Title I schools for neurocognitive testing. The Superintendent will oversee the application process for school districts to participate in the program, with grants apportioned to three school districts in different regions of the state. Grant funding will track pupils from grade 9 through high school completion. Baseline and postinjury neurocognitive testing is required for high school students participating in interscholastic athletics in various sports. Baseline and postinjury neurocognitive testing is mandatory for high school athletes in sports like lacrosse, rugby, soccer, softball, volleyball, wrestling, and others. Testing must be done before each athletic season and after any head injury, with baseline testing repeated every 24 months while the athlete is enrolled at the school and participating in one of the specified sports. Testing should be administered by trained individuals, potentially including school district employees. Postinjury neurocognitive testing for athletes suspected of concussion must be done within 72 hours of the injury. Personnel must be trained to interpret test results, and parents must be notified that results are available upon request. Results can also be shared with the athlete's physician upon request. Neurocognitive testing data for athletes must be reported to the county office of education, including baseline testing and post-injury follow-up. The testing evaluates cognitive status in various domains. The department prepares a report based on data collected by county offices, including the number of athletes receiving baseline tests. The report on neurocognitive testing data for athletes, including baseline and post-injury tests, must be submitted to the Legislature by December 31, 2021. This section is dependent on funding and will be in effect until January 1, 2022, unless extended or deleted by a later statute. Section 49475.6 is added to the Education Code for this purpose. Section 49475.6 of the Education Code requires schools offering interscholastic athletic programs to track and report traumatic brain injuries and concussions to the county office of education while maintaining confidentiality. The county office will analyze the data, and if the state mandates costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts."
