If the tribe files a motion for intervention, they must also submit a tribal certification to the court. The certification must document the Indian child's membership or eligibility for membership in the tribe under tribal law. Any action or inaction by the tribe does not affect placement preferences or rights under the Act, nor does it prevent the tribe from intervening in a proceeding if the adoptive placement changes.
