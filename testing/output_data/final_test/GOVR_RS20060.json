Concerns have been raised that the CPI-W may not accurately reflect the inflation experience of the elderly, who are the majority of Social Security beneficiaries. Some argue that a different index, such as one for the elderly, may be more appropriate as annual cost-of-living adjustments have not kept pace with increases in prices of goods and services more commonly purchased by the elderly. Suggestions to change the index for inflation-adjusting Social Security benefits have been raised in connection with deficit reduction plans. Some proposals recommend using the Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U) instead of the CPI-W or CPI-U, causing concern among Social Security recipients about insufficient compensation for cost of living increases. The bipartisan amendment to the FY2013 budget resolution in the House aims to slow deficit growth by changing the price index for Social Security COLAs. The report discusses the CPI-W, CPI-E, and C-CPI-U, analyzing spending patterns and rates of change over time. Policy considerations are also briefly addressed. The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) tracks the buying habits of employed individuals, representing about 32% of the U.S. population. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects data through the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) to assign weights to goods and services in the market basket, reflecting their relative importance. Elderly households allocate their spending differently, impacting how price changes affect the overall CPI. Elderly households allocate their spending differently from the general population, with the largest difference seen in health care expenditures. In 2010, those aged 65 and older spent twice as much on health care compared to the overall population. Health care costs have consistently risen faster than the average price level, leading to a potential understatement of inflation for elderly households by the CPI-W. The CPI-W may not accurately reflect the inflation experienced by elderly households due to differences in spending patterns and varying rates of price change for goods and services. Individual inflation rate experiences within the elderly population can vary significantly from the measured average, making small differences in average inflation rates between groups less significant. The average inflation rates between the elderly population and the overall population may not be significantly different. Individual inflation rates among the elderly can vary widely, suggesting that indexing benefits to an inflation measure based on the average elderly household could benefit all elderly individuals. However, this approach could lead to varied consequences within the elderly population, with some experiencing understated inflation rates and others experiencing exaggerated rates compared to overall measures. In 1987, Congress directed BLS to develop an experimental price index, CPI-E, to track inflation for the population aged 62 and older. Studies show that differences in inflation rates among demographic groups are small compared to variations within those groups, suggesting no one group suffers disproportionately from inflation. Arguments for a separate index for the elderly population may be less compelling if consumption patterns and average inflation rates are not significantly different between the elderly and overall population. BLS developed the CPI-E in 1987 to track inflation for those aged 62 and older. The CPI-E usually rose faster than the CPI-W and CPI-U between 1982 and 2011, with a focus on health care costs. Discrepancies in inflation rates have decreased since 1993 due to narrowing gaps in health care and shelter inflation. The CPI-E, developed by BLS in 1987 for those aged 62 and older, showed discrepancies in inflation rates compared to CPI-W and CPI-U. The gaps in inflation rates have decreased since 1993, with a focus on health care costs. Constructing a specific CPI for older Americans would require a costly process, including drawing a sample of geographic areas and designing surveys for that specific population. The CPI-E, developed by BLS in 1987 for those aged 62 and older, has discrepancies in inflation rates compared to CPI-W and CPI-U due to methodological limitations. The index is subject to greater sampling error and uses a smaller sample size for market baskets. The CPI-E is considered an experimental index due to these limitations, which may affect the accuracy of inflation measures for the elderly. Some argue that using a market basket of the elderly population to adjust Social Security benefits may not be appropriate. This could introduce complications in other areas, such as adjusting income tax brackets for elderly taxpayers. Policymakers are interested in the indexes used to inflation-adjust federal programs and individual income tax provisions. Switching to the Chained CPI-U from CPI-W or CPI-U is proposed to reduce government spending and increase revenue. However, it may not align with the goal of using the CPI-E for Social Security benefits calculation. There is uncertainty if a new index for the elderly population would have the same relationship to CPI-W and Chained CPI-U as CPI-E."
