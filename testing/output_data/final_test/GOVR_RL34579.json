    "content": "Light water reactors use ordinary water for cooling and moderating the neutrons in a nuclear chain reaction. Thermal neutrons are efficient in causing fission in specific isotopes like uranium 235 and plutonium 239. Enrichment of U-235 to 3-5% is required in nuclear fuel for sustaining the reaction. Fission in the reactor releases energy, neutrons, and radioactive fission products. In light water reactors, fission of U-235 and Pu-239 produces energy, neutrons, and highly radioactive fission products. Some neutrons are absorbed by U-238 to create Pu-239, leading to spent nuclear fuel with depleted U-235 and buildup of neutron-absorbing fission products. Disposal of spent fuel as waste is the current policy, posing long-term hazards due to plutonium and other actinides. Reprocessing for use in fast reactors is a potential solution. Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel for fast reactors aims to address LWR fuel cycle shortcomings by utilizing fast neutrons to induce fission in all actinides, including plutonium isotopes. Fast reactors can sustain a chain reaction with a higher proportion of fissionable isotopes and are efficient in breeding Pu-239 from U-238, potentially converting all natural uranium into usable nuclear fuel. Current reprocessing programs in France, Britain, and Russia aim to convert natural uranium into usable nuclear fuel. Plants in these countries produce Pu-239 blended with uranium to make mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, with capacities ranging from 400 to 900 metric tons per year. Japan is also constructing a reprocessing plant to succeed a demonstration facility. About 200 metric tons of MOX fuel is used annually. The reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel is a goal for many countries, including France, Britain, Russia, and India. MOX fuel, made from plutonium blended with uranium, is used in nuclear reactors. However, there are concerns about the proliferation risk of extracting plutonium for fuel, as it can also be used for nuclear weapons. Advanced fuel cycle programs aim to develop recycling technologies that minimize this risk. Reprocessing spent fuel can reduce the volume of radioactive waste and convert plutonium into shorter-lived fission products. Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel aims to reduce long-term radioactivity by converting plutonium into shorter-lived fission products. However, the resulting waste still has high short-term radioactivity and heat due to fission products. To address this, a proposal by the DOE suggests separating heat-generating fission products like cesium 137 and strontium 90 for separate storage and decay over several hundred years, increasing repository capacity. This proposal requires an alternative secure storage system for cesium and strontium. The DOE's Generation IV program is focusing on high temperature, gas-cooled reactors to improve safety and efficiency over LWR technology. These reactors would use fuel with a higher melting point to prevent accidents like the Three Mile Island incident. The high operating temperature would also increase fuel efficiency and allow for cost-effective production of hydrogen. The DOE's advanced nuclear technology programs, including Generation IV reactors, have been in development since the 1940s and 1950s. While technical advancements have brought some technologies closer to commercial viability, greater federal support is needed to move them beyond the research stage. The commercial viability of Generation IV reactors remains uncertain, and the GNEP program was initiated by the Bush Administration to address this issue. The GNEP program, initiated by the Bush Administration, aims to develop proliferation-resistant fuel cycle technologies for commercial deployment of spent nuclear fuel recycling. Previous U.S. reprocessing programs faced concerns over encouraging weapons-useable plutonium separation. The PUREX process was used for this purpose, with a commercial plant operating in West Valley, New York from 1966 to 1972. DOE also worked on fast breeder reactors for reprocessed plutonium fuel. The DOE worked on fast breeder reactors for reprocessed plutonium fuel, including Experimental Breeder Reactors I and II in Idaho and the Fast Flux Test Facility in Hanford, Washington. Plans for a commercial-scale breeder reactor near Clinch River, Tennessee were halted by President Carter in 1977 due to nuclear proliferation concerns. President Reagan later restarted preparations for the project, but Congress cut funding in 1983. The DOE then focused on an alternative technology based on work at Experimental Breeder Reactor II. The Clinton Administration terminated DOE's advanced reactor programs in 1993, including the shutdown of Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II). However, funding for pyroprocessing technology continued for treating EBR-II spent fuel. The George W. Bush Administration prioritized nuclear energy and emphasized the National Energy Policy Development Group's recommendations. The National Energy Policy Development Group, led by Vice President Cheney, recommended expanding nuclear power in the US and reintegrating reprocessing into the nuclear program. They suggest reexamining policies to allow for research on fuel conditioning methods that reduce waste and enhance proliferation resistance. Collaboration with international partners is also advised to develop cleaner, more efficient reprocessing and fuel treatment technologies. The Bush Administration implemented the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative in 2003 to develop cleaner, more efficient, and proliferation-resistant reprocessing technologies for nuclear fuel. The program focused on UREX+ technology to chemically remove uranium and other elements from spent fuel, leaving plutonium and other radioactive elements. Congress provided additional funding for the program, which received statutory authorization in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The GNEP initiative, announced in 2006, aimed to address reprocessing goals set in 2001. It envisioned a consortium of nations providing fuel services and reactors to countries in exchange for not conducting fuel cycle activities. Despite international attention, no country has committed to being solely a fuel recipient. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty guarantees the right to develop fuel cycle facilities. The Statement of Principles signed by the United States and 15 other countries in 2007 supports the right to develop fuel cycle facilities while promoting alternatives. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) has 21 member countries and 17 candidates/observers. DOE issued a plan in 2006 for a Technology Demonstration Program to achieve GNEP's goals, with phases running through FY2020. The National Academy of Sciences criticized DOE's aggressive deployment schedule for GNEP during Phase 3 from FY2008 to FY2020. AFCI is conducting R&D on an Advanced Burner Reactor (ABR) as part of GNEP to destroy recycled plutonium and reduce potential stockpiles. Funding for AFCI has increased but remains below requested amounts in recent budget cycles. The Senate recommended cutting the funding request for the FY2009 Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative from $395.0 million to $179.4 million. The House Appropriations Committee suggested further reducing AFCI funding to $90.0 million in FY2009, eliminating funding for GNEP. The remaining funds would be used for research on advanced fuel cycle technology, with $10.4 million requested for conceptual design work on an Advanced Fuel Cycle Facility. The Committee urged DOE to continue coordinating fuel cycle research with countries that already have spent fuel recycling capability. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations act rejected funding for the development of an Advanced Fuel Cycle Facility (AFCF) for FY2009. DOE requested $18.0 million for the Advanced Burner Reactor (ABR) program, focusing on developing a sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR). The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the ABR in FY2009. DOE is conducting Generation IV research for advanced reactor technologies that could be available after 2030, aiming to offer advantages over existing Generation III reactors in cost, safety, waste, and proliferation. Generation IV research is being conducted in cooperation with other countries through the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). A technology roadmap identified six Generation IV nuclear technologies to pursue, including fast neutron gas-cooled, lead-cooled, sodium-cooled, molten salt, supercritical water-cooled, and very high temperature reactors. The DOE Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative is focusing on a helium-cooled Very High Temperature Gas Reactor (VHTR) for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP). Sodium-cooled fast reactors are also being developed. The DOE requested $70.0 million for Gen IV for FY2009, with most of the funding allocated to the NGNP program. The VHTR technology uses helium as a coolant and coated-particle fuel. The House Appropriations Committee recommended an increase to $200.0 million for Gen IV research, with a focus on accelerating work on NGNP. Phase I research on the NGNP is set to continue until 2011. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes $1.25 billion through FY2015 for NGNP development and construction, with a focus on accelerating work on NGNP. DOE is preparing a draft PEIS for GNEP to make decisions about developing an advanced fuel cycle research facility. The PEIS will not consider commercial-scale reprocessing/recycling facilities and an advanced fast reactor. The DOE solicited studies from industry consortia for the GNEP program to determine its future direction. Four industry teams proposed concepts for advanced fuel recycling facilities with cost estimates and schedules. These teams will continue developing designs and technology roadmaps at least through FY2008. EnergySolutions, Shaw Group, and Westinghouse Electric Company are leading the industry efforts. EnergySolutions, Shaw Group, and Westinghouse Electric Company proposed aqueous reprocessing facilities to handle 1,500 metric tons per year of LWR spent fuel by 2023. A fuel fabrication plant would supply MOX fuel to existing LWRs, funded by DOE. The EnergySolutions proposal includes a 410 MW fast reactor starting in 2033, with expansion to 96 GW by 2100. A federal corporation would sign long-term contracts for spent fuel recycling. A federal corporation would be established to sign long-term contracts with industry for spent fuel recycling, fuel fabrication, waste repository operation, and spent fuel transportation. The funding for the federal corporation would come from doubling the nuclear waste fee on nuclear power generation. The proposed fee increase would generate about $1.5 billion per year. The proposal includes a pyroprocessing facility using the electrometallurgical separations process developed by the IFR program. The Power Reactor Inherently Safe Module (PRISM) developed by GE for the ALMR program would consume 5,800 metric tons of LWR spent fuel over its 60-year operating life. The proposal includes construction and operation of PRISM modules in phases, with the final phase involving multiple Advanced Recycling Centers (ARCs) after 30 years. General Atomics proposed a spent fuel recycling plan with a two-tier approach. General Atomics proposed a two-tier spent fuel recycling system using gas-cooled reactor technology. LWR spent fuel would be reprocessed in aqueous plants for high-temperature gas reactors, eliminating most plutonium and minor actinides. The remaining fuel would be pyroprocessed for fast reactors. The plan includes constructing 136 LWRs by 2050, phasing them out by 2110. The first gas-cooled reactor module (385 mwe) would start by 2025, with an aqueous reprocessing center operating by 2030. The proposed spent fuel recycling system by General Atomics involves reprocessing LWR spent fuel in aqueous plants for high-temperature gas reactors and pyroprocessing for fast reactors. The plan includes constructing 136 LWRs by 2050 and phasing them out by 2110. The first gas-cooled reactor module would start by 2025, with an aqueous reprocessing center operating by 2030. Areva recommended continued reliance on LWRs with a gradual buildup of fast reactors, with the first pyroprocessing facility opening in 2040 and the first fast reactor by 2075. Initial facilities for the program would be developed by a government corporation, to be privatized by 2035. A government corporation would be established to run the recycling program for nuclear reactors, with costs estimated to be 10%-70% higher than the existing nuclear waste fee. The industry argues that new commercial reactors will not be built without increased government incentives or subsidies, raising the question of whether the government should promote nuclear power expansion. Nuclear power proponents argue that significant growth, supported by the government, is necessary to meet future energy demands in a carbon-constrained environment. The question arises whether light water reactors can handle this growth or if a transition to advanced nuclear technologies is required. Concerns about long-term fuel supply resurface, as uranium production capacity expands to meet the demand. The expansion of uranium production capacity in response to chronically low prices raises concerns about worldwide resource estimates and nuclear weapons proliferation. The proposed solution of replacing LWRs with fast breeder reactors poses challenges in managing nuclear waste and limiting the proliferation of fuel cycle facilities. The success of GNEP's approach to expanding nuclear power while addressing these issues remains uncertain. Reprocessing could potentially shorten the disposal horizon for plutonium and other radionuclides, making waste repository siting easier. Advanced reactor technologies offer benefits such as improved safety, lower costs, and high-temperature heat production for industrial purposes. Generation IV designs aim to eliminate major risks of existing reactors, although potential safety risks still need further assessment. New LWR designs also aim to reduce costs. New LWR designs aim to reduce costs, but recent cost estimates have escalated. Generation IV reactors are projected to lower construction and operating costs, but these projections have not been proven. High-temperature gas reactors could be practical for hydrogen generation. Nuclear power could potentially replace petroleum if hydrogen becomes a major transportation fuel. However, battery-based electric vehicle systems are currently receiving more commercial attention. US nuclear energy policy is focused on government incentives for private-sector construction of new reactors. The government's nuclear energy policy has primarily focused on providing incentives for private-sector construction of new reactors, such as loan guarantees and tax credits. Imposing federal controls on carbon dioxide emissions would further incentivize the construction of new reactors. Advanced nuclear technologies under development by GNEP and Gen IV will require years of government-supported development before reaching the stage of current reactors. The question before Congress is whether to move to the next, more expensive, development stages."
