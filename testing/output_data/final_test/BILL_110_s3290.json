    "content": "The Act titled \"America's Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008\" authorizes the issuance of redesigned quarter dollars representing national parks or other national sites. Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include a new subsection (t) for the redesign and issuance of quarter dollars emblematic of national sites. This redesign program applies to various states and territories, following the completion of a prior program. The redesign program for quarter dollars issued starting in 2010 will feature designs emblematic of national sites in the States, with flexibility in the placement of inscriptions on the coins. The redesign program for quarter dollars starting in 2010 will feature designs emblematic of national sites in each State, with the selection of sites made by the Secretary of the Treasury after consultation with the governor of each State. The governor or chief executive of each State will choose the national site for the quarter dollar design, selected by the Secretary after consultation with relevant agencies and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Commission. The Secretary may include participation by officials of the State, artists, engravers, and the public in the selection and approval process for quarter dollar designs to ensure dignified designs for the nation's coinage and currency. The Secretary must ensure that no frivolous or inappropriate designs are selected for any quarter dollar minted. Prohibition on certain representations includes no head and shoulders portrait or bust of any person, living or dead, no portrait of a living person, and no outline or map of a State on the reverse of any quarter dollar. Yellowstone National Park shall be featured on a quarter dollar since it was established as the Nation's first national park by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872. Yellowstone National Park will be depicted on the first quarter dollar issued and designated to the State of Wyoming. Quarter dollar coins with national site designs will be issued in reverse alphabetical order of each State, at a rate of 5 new designs during each of the first 10 years. During the 11th year of issuance, the Secretary of the Treasury will prescribe 6 new designs for quarter dollar coins, following a specific order. The Secretary may determine the number of quarter dollars to be issued with selected designs each year. All coins minted under this subsection are considered numismatic items. The Secretary can mint and issue quarter dollars in uncirculated and proof qualities as deemed appropriate. Silver coins may also be minted and issued for selected designs. The program established under this subsection will continue until a national site in each State has been honored, with the Secretary having the discretion to extend the period of issuance to honor a second national site in each State. The Secretary will submit a report to the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs within 30 days of determining the design for a national site on a quarter dollar. The Secretary will continue the program under this subsection until all states are honored, following the issuance of quarter dollars with the first design. Upon completion of the coin program, the design on the quarter dollar will revert to the image of President Washington. The reverse will feature an image of General Washington crossing the Delaware River. The placement of inscriptions will follow the guidelines described in paragraph (1)(B). The term 'national site' includes various sites under federal supervision. In the event of independence, guidelines for inscription placement will still apply. The subsection will no longer apply to the minting of quarter dollars with designs emblematic of a territory or possession of the United States once such coins are minted. SEC. 201.
