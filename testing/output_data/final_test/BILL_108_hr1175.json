The budget allocation for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 includes specific amounts for defense and homeland security activities. Adjustments to discretionary spending limits are made, including accrual accounting for Federal retirement and health benefits. Additionally, amendments are proposed to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Extension of pay-as-you-go under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is enforced through an amendment to Section 252. The purpose of this section is to ensure that any legislation enacted before October 1, 2008, which increases the deficit, will trigger an offsetting sequestration within 15 days of Congress adjourning. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will calculate the deficit increase or decrease by adding all OMB estimates for the budget year of direct spending legislation. The section outlines the process for sequestering funds in response to deficit increases caused by direct spending legislation. It requires the OMB to estimate savings from prior year sequestrations and any net deficit changes in the current year. The process for sequestering funds in response to deficit increases caused by direct spending legislation involves making reductions in automatic spending increases, direct spending accounts, and medicare programs if necessary. The sequestration process involves reducing automatic spending increases, direct spending accounts, and medicare programs by a specified percentage, with outlay reductions credited for the following fiscal year. Estimates are provided by the CBO. The CBO provides estimates to OMB for direct spending legislation, which OMB must transmit to Congress within 7 days of enactment, including explanations for any differences in estimates. OMB shall consult with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate regarding significant differences in estimates, including written communication for committee feedback before report issuance. The estimates must cover changes in outlays for the current year, budget year, and outyears, excluding certain amounts related to deposit insurance guarantees. The OMB and CBO, in consultation with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, will establish common scorekeeping guidelines for preparing estimates under this section. Emergency provisions designated by the President and Congress will be treated as emergency requirements in budget reports. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to change the expiration date from \"2002\" to \"2008\" in various sections. SEC. 5. Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to exclude emergency appropriations and legislation from the baseline. SEC. 6. OMB EMERGENCY CRITERIA. The definition of an emergency under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 includes situations requiring new budget authority for the prevention of loss of life or property, or a threat to national security, that are unanticipated, sudden, and urgent. The term 'emergency' is defined as a compelling need requiring immediate action, unforeseen and temporary in nature. This definition aligns with the criteria outlined in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. SEC. 7. RULE RESPECTING DESIGNATION OF LEGISLATIVE PROVISION AS AN EMERGENCY. This section amends Title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 by adding a new rule regarding the designation of legislative provisions as emergencies. In designating legislation as an emergency requirement, the committee report must analyze if it meets the definition of an 'emergency' as outlined in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Bills with emergency designations under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 must also meet this definition to be considered in the Senate or House of Representatives. The Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 outlines procedures for waiver and appeal in the Senate, requiring a three-fifths vote to suspend certain sections. In the House of Representatives, it is not allowed to consider rules or orders that waive specific subsections. The Chair is responsible for deciding on points of order raised under this section. The Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 outlines procedures for waiver and appeal in the Senate, requiring a three-fifths vote to suspend certain sections. In the House of Representatives, rules or orders cannot waive specific subsections. The Chair decides on points of order raised under this section, with debatable consideration for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point of order and an opponent. The question of consideration also applies to determining the question of consideration for an amendment made in order as original text.
