    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Toll Credit Marketplace Act\" and includes a Toll Credit Marketplace Pilot Program. The Toll Credit Marketplace Act establishes a pilot program for a toll credit marketplace where states can buy and sell toll credits to meet non-Federal share requirements. The Secretary of Transportation will implement the program within a year of the Act's enactment. The Act establishes a pilot program for a toll credit marketplace for States to buy and sell toll credits. The purposes include assigning monetary value to toll credits, determining discounted rates, providing budget flexibility for States, and testing the feasibility of expanding the market to all States. The Secretary will administer the program and establish procedures for the marketplace. The Secretary will establish procedures for a toll credit marketplace and an online platform for States to buy and sell toll credits. Within 90 days of the Act's enactment, States will be notified to participate in the pilot program. States with existing toll credit balances, without toll credit infrastructure, or without any toll credit balance can participate. The pilot program for a toll credit marketplace will require States to purchase or sell toll credits in amounts not less than 10 percent of the value if used as a non-Federal share requirement. Reporting requirements include an initial report to be submitted to relevant committees within 180 days and State reports within 30 days of a transaction in the toll credit marketplace. The pilot program for a toll credit marketplace mandates States to buy or sell toll credits, with reporting requirements for transactions including cash amount, toll credit value, intended use, and remaining balance for sellers, and credit value, intended use, and maintenance of effort plans for buyers. The pilot program requires the Secretary to submit an annual report evaluating the viability of a toll credit marketplace, describing buying and selling activities, determining the monetary value of toll credits, and assessing the success of the program. The pilot program requires the Secretary to submit an annual report evaluating the toll credit marketplace, including potential expansion to more States, updated toll credit balances, and public availability of the report. States participating in the marketplace must adhere to maintenance of effort requirements, and funds received from toll credit sales can only be used for eligible transportation projects. Before expending funds received in exchange for toll credits, the State must provide certification to the Secretary and receive approval within 30 days. The Secretary will either approve the certification or provide reasons for disapproval with recommendations for addressing deficiencies. If the certification is disapproved, the State can appeal the decision. The State can appeal the Secretary's decision to disapprove the certification within 30 days. The Secretary must review the appeal and make a determination within 60 days. Metropolitan Planning Organizations and local governments can request toll credit allocation, which the State can purchase on their behalf with timely payment. The State can purchase toll credits on behalf of metropolitan planning organizations or local governments. Federal funds cannot be used for this purchase, and toll credits can only cover up to 10% of the non-Federal share requirement for certain funds under title 23, United States. The toll credit marketplace pilot program, available for chapters 1 and 53 of title 23 and title 49, respectively, will be evaluated by the Comptroller General of the United States after the first year of operation. A report will be submitted to Congress with a determination of the program's success and any recommendations for improvement. The pilot program is set to end on September 30, 2020."
