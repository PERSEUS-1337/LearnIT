    "content": "The Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission on January 21, 2010, allows for increased political advertising by corporations. Congress may respond by either raising contribution limits or imposing restrictions on spending to address campaign finance policy issues. These approaches have advantages and disadvantages that may spark debate. Some argue that amending the Constitution is the only way for Congress to directly impact rulings like Citizens United, which could be controversial and difficult. Proposed legislative responses focus on disclosure and restricting spending by certain groups. This report aims to address Congress's interest in campaign finance policy post-Citizens United, providing an overview of relevant issues and options. This report does not provide a legal analysis of Citizens United or legal issues affecting policy options. It will be updated regularly with additional legislation reflected in future updates. Other reports discuss legal and constitutional issues related to Citizens United and the DISCLOSE Act in more detail. Events described are current as of September 2010. From a campaign finance policy perspective, Citizens United appears to be most relevant for political advertising funded by corporate or union treasuries. Two issues are particularly noteworthy: corporations and unions can now fund advertising explicitly calling for the election or defeat of candidates, and previous restrictions on corporate- or union-funded broadcast ads known as electioneering communications have been eased. Despite these changes, corporate and union advertising purchases must be made. Following Citizens United, corporations may now fund unlimited political advertising, but must do so independently without coordinating with campaigns. The ban on corporate or union contributions to political committees remains in effect. Before Citizens United, corporations and unions were prohibited from using treasury funds for political advertising, but could establish separate PACs for this purpose. Following Citizens United, corporations can now fund unlimited express advocacy messages independently, without coordinating with campaigns. Previously, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act prohibited corporate and union treasuries from funding electioneering communications mentioning federal candidates close to elections. Now, corporations and unions are free to fund such communications. After the Citizens United ruling, corporations and unions can now fund electioneering communications independently. This raises questions about the impact on political advertising and potential flooding of airwaves with corporate advocacy. The outcome could lead to new legislation restricting political advertising. The full effects of Citizens United on campaign spending will only be known after the 2010 elections. The legislative response to the Citizens United ruling began immediately after the decision in January 2010. Multiple hearings were held to assess the ruling and consider policy options, with specific legislation discussed in three hearings. The legislative response to the Citizens United ruling began in January 2010 with hearings on corporate governance and shareholder protection. Legislative proposals such as the Shareholder Protection Act (H.R. 4790) and the House version of the DISCLOSE Act (H.R. 5175) were discussed, with requirements for shareholder approval of political expenditures and board approval for larger political activities. Table 1 in this report outlines relevant legislation for a congressional response to Citizens United, focusing on bills introduced shortly after the Court's ruling. Recent attention has been on the House and Senate versions of the DISCLOSE Act, sponsored by Representative Van Hollen and Senator Schumer. Van Hollen introduced H.R. 5175 on April 29, 2010, while Schumer introduced S. 3295 the next day. The House of Representatives passed the DISCLOSE Act on June 24, 2010, with additional amendments by a 219-206 vote. Senator Schumer introduced a revised version of the bill on July 21, 2010, but the Senate did not invoke cloture on July 27, 2010. The bill remains on the calendar, focusing on disclosure and disclaimer requirements for political spending by corporations, unions, and tax-exempt organizations. The DISCLOSE Act aims to restrict political spending by certain entities like government contractors, corporations with foreign influence, and TARP recipients in federal elections. It focuses on providing more information and limiting political advertising facilitated by Citizens United. The bill expands definitions of independent expenditure and electioneering communication. The DISCLOSE Act expands disclosure and disclaimer requirements for political communications by corporations, unions, and certain tax-exempt organizations. It mandates reporting of donor information and spending for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. Additionally, it requires approval from high-ranking officials for advertising content and prohibits government contractors and TARP recipients from certain political spending in federal elections. The DISCLOSE Act expands disclosure and disclaimer requirements for political communications by corporations, unions, and certain tax-exempt organizations. It mandates reporting of donor information and spending for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. Additionally, it prohibits government contractors and TARP recipients from certain political spending in federal elections. The Act also aims to restrict contributions and expenditures by corporations subject to control or ownership by foreign nationals in federal, state, and local elections. The current legislation debate focuses on restrictions for corporate and labor entities in making independent political expenditures. Questions include whether subsidiaries of foreign corporations should be treated differently, what characteristics should determine regulation, and what information should be reported to regulators, shareholders, and voters. There is also discussion on requiring corporate advertising to identify chief executives and funders, restructuring the political financing system to help candidates respond to corporate expenditures, and permitting public financing of campaigns. The debate revolves around regulating corporate and labor expenditures, including the possibility of public financing for campaigns and a constitutional amendment to allow Congress to regulate political money. Congress is considering how to respond to the Citizens United decision through legislation, with a focus on campaign finance policy. The discussion focuses on campaign finance policy options related to restrictions on spending, advertising, or fundraising. Future updates will include additional options and legislation. If Congress takes no action, the Citizens United decision would remain unaffected, allowing corporations to make independent expenditures as they choose. Maintaining the status quo may be preferred by those who believe in corporate participation in elections. Proposals to amend the Constitution to allow Congress to regulate campaign finance have been regularly introduced since the 1970s. Several relevant constitutional amendments were introduced during the 111th Congress, showing different ways Congress could frame an amendment to regulate campaign spending. Public financing of campaigns, seen as a solution to \"big money\" in politics, aims to reduce candidates' reliance on private funds, limiting conflicts of interest and allowing more focus on policy. While public financing for presidential campaigns has been in place since 1976, attempts to extend it to U.S. House and Senate campaigns have been unsuccessful. Amendments to the Constitution to regulate campaign spending have been proposed since the 1970s, but implementing them would be controversial and time-consuming. Public financing programs have been proposed in the 111th Congress to cover campaign costs, with some measures requiring candidates to limit private fundraising. Enacting public campaign financing could enhance small contributions and grassroots donors, offering an alternative to the current focus on large contributions. Some candidates may see public financing as a way to reduce corporate influence in politics post Citizens United, but they could face challenges from outside advertising. Even with equal resources from public financing, their ability to raise funds in response to outside ads would be limited. Increasing contribution limits or raising caps on party coordinated expenditures are two options to provide additional resources to campaigns or parties facing high levels of opposition spending post Citizens United. Some Members of Congress are considering increasing or repealing caps on coordinated party expenditures to give parties more flexibility in supporting their candidates post Citizens United. This could help campaigns facing outside advertising by providing additional resources. However, there is concern that campaigns may feel pressured to adopt party strategies to benefit from coordinated expenditures. Bills like H.R. 5175 and S. 3295 propose exempting certain spending from coordinated party expenditure limits if the candidate campaign does not control the spending. Some may object to increasing contribution limits or coordinated party expenditures, while others may see additional funding as necessary to compete post Citizens United. Debate focuses on whether Congress could restrict independent expenditures to prevent corruption, particularly regarding foreign corporations, government contractors, and potential risks of corruption. Foreign nationals, including companies from foreign countries, are currently prohibited from making expenditures in elections. Congress may consider additional restrictions on U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations to address foreign influence. Bills like H.R. 3859 aim to prohibit PACs affiliated with foreign-controlled entities from making contributions. Congress may consider extending contribution or expenditure restrictions to corporations owned or controlled by foreign entities. Additionally, restrictions on the amount of independent expenditures made by firms with government contracts could be pursued. The DISCLOSE Act proposes amendments to existing foreign national prohibitions. In the 111th Congress, bills like H.R. 1095, H.R. 4434, H.R. 4617, H.R. 4768, and S. 133 proposed regulations on political expenditures by firms with government contracts or federal assistance. The DISCLOSE Act also suggests changes to government contractor prohibitions and advocates for giving shareholders a say in corporations' political spending decisions. In the 111th Congress, bills proposed regulations on political expenditures by firms with government contracts or federal assistance. Relevant measures introduced include H.R. 4487, H.R. 4537, H.R. 4644, H.R. 4630, H.R. 4790, and S. 3004. The DISCLOSE Act would require corporations to provide additional information about campaign-related expenditures to shareholders. Shareholder protection measures could ensure corporations' political spending aligns with shareholders' wishes. The current discussion focuses on potential requirements for corporations to disclose information about political advertising or independent expenditures. This additional disclosure could involve reporting political spending to government regulators or including identifying information in the advertising itself. Congress may consider implementing these measures to ensure transparency in corporate political speech. Disclosure in campaign finance refers to reporting information about contributions or expenditures to the FEC. Political committees and individuals regulated under FECA must file regular disclosure reports. Independent expenditures over $10,000 must be reported within 48 hours, and electioneering communications over $10,000 require 24-hour reporting. These requirements cover any \"person.\" The electioneering communication requirements cover any \"person,\" including corporations and labor unions. No legislative action may be needed to extend the current requirements to corporations post Citizens United, but amendments may be required if Congress wishes to do so. Disclaimers in political advertising must include the name, address, and authorization information of the person funding the communication. Congress may need to review and potentially update these requirements. If Congress determines existing requirements are sufficient, no additional legislative action may be necessary. However, if Congress wants corporations in express advocacy to provide more identifying information, they could extend \"stand by your ad\" disclaimers. Bills like H.R. 4432, H.R. 4527, H.R. 4583, H.R. 4630, H.R. 4749, S. 2959, and S. 3004 propose additional disclosures post Citizens United. H.R. 5175, S. 3295, and S. 3628 suggest more disclosure and disclaimer requirements. Additional disclosure and disclaimer provisions are proposed by S. 3295 and S. 3628. This could increase transparency in corporate political advertising. The impact of extending the \"stand by your ad\" requirement to corporate advocacy is uncertain. The decision's effect on the political and policy environments will become clearer over time. Corporations and unions are now free to use their treasury funds for political ads supporting or opposing candidates. The Citizens United decision allows corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts on political campaigns, potentially overshadowing candidates and parties. However, some safeguards like the ban on corporate contributions in federal elections remain. Congress may need to monitor how this decision affects political spending in the upcoming election cycles. The Citizens United decision raises questions about the impact of increased corporate advertising on elections. Will corporations directly fund advertising or continue to use indirectly funded methods? Will new advertising be national or targeted to specific races? How will campaigns, parties, and other actors adapt? The answers to these questions will inform Congress on potential public policy responses."
