    "content": "The \"21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act\" may provide a credit for dual-earner families under section 25E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act\" offers a tax credit for dual-earner families based on 10% of the lesser of $10,000 or the earned income of the spouse with the lower income. The credit is subject to reduction based on the taxpayer's excess adjusted gross income compared to $20,000. Definitions include \"earned income\" as defined in section 32(c)(2) and an \"eligible taxpayer.\" The \"21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act\" defines an eligible taxpayer as someone who files a joint return, has at least one qualifying child under 12 years old, and has excess adjusted gross income exceeding $110,000. Additionally, there is an inflation adjustment for dollar amounts starting after 2016. Starting in 2016, dollar amounts in subsections (a)(1) and (c)(3) will increase based on the cost-of-living adjustment for that year. If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $1,000, it will be rounded to the nearest multiple. No credit will be given under this section to individuals claiming benefits under section 911. No credit allowed under this section if an individual (or spouse) claims benefits of section 911 for the taxable year. Non-resident aliens ineligible unless treated as US residents. Identification number required on joint tax return for credit eligibility. The text chunk discusses the requirements for claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit, including providing information about the individual, spouse, qualifying children, and the necessity of a full taxable year.

A conforming amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments under section 25E for dual-earner families will apply to taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
