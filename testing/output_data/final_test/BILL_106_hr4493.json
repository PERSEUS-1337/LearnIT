    "content": "The Act titled \"Prosecution Drug Treatment Alternative to Prison Act of 2000\" authorizes drug treatment programs as an alternative to prison, administered by state or local prosecutors under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The Attorney General can provide grants to State or local prosecutors for drug treatment alternative to prison programs. The funds can be used for program operation expenses and payments to substance abuse treatment providers for offenders participating in the program. The grant program includes aftercare supervision, vocational training, education, and job placement. Payments are made to entities for providing treatment to offenders in the program. The Federal share of the grant should not exceed 75% of the program cost. Grant amounts should supplement, not supplant, non-Federal funds for program activities.

The Federal share of the grant should not exceed 75% of the program cost. Grant amounts should supplement, not supplant, non-Federal funds for program activities. SEC. 2702 outlines program requirements. A drug treatment program funded by a grant must be administered by a State or local prosecutor. Eligible offenders can only participate with the prosecutor's consent and will be sentenced to a long-term, drug-free residential treatment facility instead of prison. Failure to complete treatment will result in imprisonment for the underlying crime. The residential substance abuse provider must report the progress of treatment to the prosecutor and court. An enforcement unit of law enforcement officers will ensure compliance with the program. The program includes duties such as verifying offender's information, locating and apprehending absconded offenders, and returning them to court for sentencing. To apply for a grant under this program, a State or local prosecutor must submit an application to the Attorney General with required information and certifications. The Attorney General will ensure equitable distribution of grant awards to prosecutors in all states and jurisdictions. Additionally, reports and evaluations are required for the program. Each recipient of a grant under this program must submit a report to the Attorney General annually, evaluating the effectiveness of activities funded by the grant. The report must contain information as required by the Attorney General, with specified submission dates. The term 'State or local prosecutor' refers to officials with the authority to prosecute criminal offenses under State or local law. An 'eligible offender' is someone convicted of a crime requiring imprisonment, who has not completed the sentence and has no prior violent felony or major drug offense convictions. The term 'felony crime of violence' and 'major drug offense' are defined in specific sections of the United States Code. Authorization of appropriations for carrying out a specific part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Street Act of 1968 is also included. Authorized appropriations for part AA are as follows: $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, $85,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, $95,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $105,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, and $125,000,000 for fiscal year 2004. The House of Representatives passed the bill on October 17, 2000."
