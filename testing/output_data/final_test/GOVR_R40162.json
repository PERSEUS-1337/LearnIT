    "content": "A spate of autumn 2008 news stories reported the downsizing or closure of various periodicals and publishers due to financial challenges. This included reductions in paper issues for U.S. News & World Report and transitioning CosmoGirl magazine to a web-only publication. Job cuts were also announced by Time Inc., Alpha Media Group, and Cond\u00e9 Nast, among others. Radar magazine ceased operations, and Manhattan Media Inc. postponed plans to restart publication of 02138 magazine. The Christian Science Monitor, a century-old newspaper, also faced challenges. The Christian Science Monitor will stop publishing in paper format in April 2009, becoming a Web-only publication except for a weekend paper edition. Revenue shortfalls since 2006 have led many magazines to cease publication or transition to online-only. Factors contributing to periodicals' difficulties include declining subscriptions, rising paper costs, and decreased advertising revenue due to the U.S. economic downturn. Other firm-specific causes like managerial errors and oversupply have also impacted periodicals' survival. The 111th Congress may be asked to help periodical publishers reduce operating costs by providing increased postage subsidies due to high profile incidents and a possible U.S. Postal Service postage increase in 2009. Congress has a history of subsidizing periodicals postage since the founding of the United States. Initially, senders did not have to pay postage, and the Post Office attempted to collect postage from recipients. The Post Office Act of 1792 set lower postage rates for newspapers and magazines compared to letters. However, the Post Office struggled to collect postage from recipients of periodicals, leading to significant costs. Congress had to appropriate funds annually to cover the Post Office's expenses not covered by postage revenue. In 1874, Congress enacted a statute requiring publishers to prepay postage for periodicals. Publishers were charged two cents per pound for newspapers and three cents per pound for magazines. This helped address the revenue shortfall, but Congress still subsidized the delivery of newspapers and magazines. The rationale behind this was to ensure citizens had access to information necessary for participating in a democratic republic, especially in the absence of modern communication technologies like telegraphs and radios. The national policy of subsidizing newspapers in the 19th century led to various consequences. Publishers actively lobbied Congress for their interests, political parties used the mails to spread their message, and Post Office officials struggled to define what constituted a newspaper. This lack of clarity led to different criteria being used, such as the publication's format or content. In the 19th century, Congress and the Post Office worked to distinguish between publications eligible for government postage subsidies. Changes in postage rates in 1852, 1863, 1872, and 1874 set higher rates for non-periodical printed matter like advertisements and required prepayment for periodicals. Despite these efforts, the Post Office still faced challenges with non-periodical mail. In the 19th century, Congress and the Post Office refined postal classifications to distinguish between periodicals and non-periodicals. An 1876 statute defined advertising mail as a \"publication designed primarily for advertising.\" Three years later, a reclassification limited second-class mail to printed paper sheets without substantial binding, requiring publishers to register with the Post Office to qualify for periodical postage rates. The 1879 law established criteria for second-class mail, requiring periodicals to be published regularly, addressed to specific subscribers, and primarily focused on public information, literature, sciences, arts, or special industries. Publications failing to meet these criteria were charged higher third-class rates for postage. The 1876 and 1879 laws established criteria for second-class mail, distinguishing between periodicals and advertising mail. Postage on periodicals that benefited the public could be subsidized by taxpayers, but not for private advertising schemes. Congress expanded the range of publications eligible for periodical postage rates, even if they did not meet the legal standards for periodicals. In 1917, Congress refined postal laws to separate editorial from advertising content in periodicals, charging different rates for each. In 1951, a statute was enacted to prevent publications with over 75% advertising from receiving periodicals postage rates. In 1960, Congress enacted a statute to recodify postal laws, defining a periodical as a publication issued regularly, from a known office, with printed sheets, for public information or literature, and with a legitimate list of subscribers. Publications seeking periodicals postage rate could not have more than 75% advertising in over half of any issues in a 12-month period. Congress enacted major reforms in 1970 due to the Post Office crisis in the late 1960s. In 1970, the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 addressed the Post Office crisis by replacing the department with the financially self-sufficient U.S. Postal Service (USPS), eliminating the need for annual congressional appropriations. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 gave the USPS more authority over its operations to control costs and increase revenues. It also impacted periodicals, requiring them to be charged reduced rates and maintaining lower postage rates for editorial content compared to advertising. Periodicals had received special treatment under postal law since 1792. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 granted USPS more control over operations to cut costs and boost revenues. Periodicals were required to provide detailed information annually to maintain periodical publication mail privileges, including ownership details, circulation numbers, and other necessary data as determined by the Postal Service. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 granted USPS more control over operations to cut costs and boost revenues. Periodicals must provide detailed information annually to maintain publication mail privileges, including ownership details. The Postal Service may require information to determine continued eligibility for privileges, with rules for suspension or revocation if requirements are not met. USPS's interpretations of these requirements can be found in the Domestic Mail Manual. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 shifted the responsibility of setting postal rates from Congress to USPS and the Postal Rate Commission. USPS would file rate increase requests, which the PRC would review and make recommendations on based on fairness and mail service value. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 transferred the authority to set postal rates from Congress to USPS and the Postal Rate Commission. USPS would propose rate increases based on factors such as mail service value, cost allocation, impact on the public and businesses, alternative mail options, mail preparation, and structural simplicity. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 transferred rate-setting authority from Congress to USPS and the Postal Rate Commission. Criteria for setting rates included mail service value, cost allocation, impact on the public and businesses, alternative mail options, mail preparation, and structural simplicity. The Act required mail classes to bear direct and indirect postal costs, but did not mandate reduced postage rates for certain types of mail. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 transferred rate-setting authority to USPS and the Postal Rate Commission. It required postage to cover USPS costs for receiving, handling, and delivering mail. The Act had significant effects on postage rates, particularly for periodicals. In 1972 and 1974, periodicals postage rates were raised significantly, with further increases recommended in 1976. The Act established timetables for phasing out subsidies for periodicals over five years, later extended to eight years due to publishers' economic hardship. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 transferred rate-setting authority to USPS and the Postal Rate Commission, requiring postage to cover USPS costs. Despite postage increases, periodicals continued to be subsidized due to lower rates for editorial content and the failure to cover their total costs, leading to other mail classes covering the shortfall. After the steep postage increases of the early 1970s, some publishers protested that the new rates were too high and considered using private couriers for delivery. In 1976, Congress amended the PRA to ensure periodicals mailers paid postage less than their total delivery costs. The PRC was required to consider the value of mail matter to the recipient when setting rates. From 1971 to 1996, periodicals postage increases helped cover costs and contribute to USPS's institutional costs. However, after 1996, postage revenue did not keep up with delivery costs. In 1996, periodicals postage revenue did not increase as quickly as delivery costs, leading to a $375 million shortfall by 2006. The cause of this decline is unclear, but the USPS did not propose increasing periodicals postage in 1997, resulting in a drop in cost coverage. Subsequently, the USPS and PRC agreed to raise periodicals rates multiple times, with a proposed 14.4% increase in 2000. The USPS and PRC increased postage on periodicals by more than 10% in 2002 and more than 5% in 2005 to reduce processing costs. However, these higher rates did not generate enough revenue for periodicals to cover their costs. Postmaster General John E. Potter testified that periodicals volume declined by 13% between 2000 and 2006, with some periodicals not even covering their costs. The USPS filed a rate case in 2006 due to a projected revenue deficiency. The USPS and PRC increased postage on periodicals in 2002 and 2005 to reduce processing costs, but the rates did not cover costs as periodicals volume declined. The PRC recommended new postage rates in 2007, which USPS mostly accepted, implemented in May and July. The USPS delayed new periodicals rates until July 15 to allow mailers time to adjust. The PRC recommended an 11.8 percent increase in rates to cover costs and identified cost drivers in the mail handling process. The new, more complex rate schedule reduces postage costs for mailers who prepare mail to lower USPS handling costs. The new rate schedule for periodicals, influenced by rate case R2006-1, aimed to reduce postage subsidies and address inequities among mailers. Critics raised concerns about corporate influence and regulatory cronyism in the decision-making process. The Bush-appointed U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors approved a 758-page plan submitted by Time Warner that will increase mailing costs for small-circulation magazines like Mother Jones, while costs for larger publications will decrease. The new rate schedule aims to reflect costs better and encourage more efficient mailing practices. The Postal Service approved a new rate structure that combines proposals from the Postal Service and Time Warner Inc. The rates aim to address cost drivers while moderating the impact on mailers, particularly Periodicals mailers. Some periodicals criticized the structure for being unfair to small circulation magazines, while others expressed concerns about the higher rates jeopardizing their existence and free speech. Victor Navasky, publisher emeritus of The Nation magazine, testified before Congress about the negative impact of the R2006-1 rate case decision on magazines focusing on public affairs. The Nation faces a significant increase in mailing costs, which could amount to an additional $500,000 per year. Navasky warned that small-circulation periodicals may face closure due to the higher postage rates. Scott McConnell of The American Conservative also highlighted a 58% increase in mailing costs for their magazine. The USPS's cost of delivering periodicals had outpaced inflation by more than 60% since 1986, leading to a 15% increase in postage rates for U.S. News & World Report, L.P. The rate case decision did not benefit all large circulation publishers and afflict all small circulation publishers, according to Mark W. White. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) in 2006 aimed to address biases in periodicals rate structure, but critics argue more should be done to support small circulation magazines. The new Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) is tasked with creating a new postage rate-setting system to allocate costs appropriately between market-dominant and competitive products. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) in 2006 aimed to address biases in periodicals rate structure. The new Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) is tasked with creating a new postage rate-setting system to allocate costs appropriately between market-dominant and competitive products. The PAEA requires each mail class to cover its \"attributable\" costs, not total costs, and allocates USPS's institutional costs among mail classes. The PAEA requires USPS's institutional costs to be allocated appropriately among mail classes. The PRC interprets this to mean competitive products must cover 5.5% of costs, favoring subsidization of periodicals. The PAEA mandates a new postage rate system that limits annual increases for periodicals and other products. The USPS proposed a postage increase in line with the Consumer Price Index. The Postal Service proposed a postage increase below the CPI-U limit, approved by the PRC under the PAEA. The law allows for higher increases in exceptional circumstances, not clearly defined. USPS may seek another increase in 2009 due to financial distress from declining mail volume and rising costs. The Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) may not agree to a sharp increase in postage for periodicals and other market dominant products. It is uncertain if the law allows USPS to raise periodicals postage higher than other mail classes. The periodicals postage subsidy's long-term impact is unclear, with revenues covering only 83% of costs in FY2007. Government subsidies for periodicals have been a contentious issue with disputed principles and implementation challenges. Some argue periodicals play a unique role in democracy, deserving subsidization due to their contribution to information flow. Others question this, suggesting alternative means of information transmission are equally effective. Fairness in postage payment is also debated. Some argue periodicals play a unique role in democracy, deserving subsidization due to their contribution to information flow. Postage subsidy policies have raised contentious questions about which periodicals should receive subsidies and who should pay for them. Enacting periodical postage subsidies has been challenging and expensive due to the diversity of periodicals. Congress may need to consider various issues if they wish to assist periodical publishers. The current chunk discusses the ongoing challenges facing periodicals, including the impact of closures on democracy, the shift to online publications, and the potential benefits of increased postage subsidies or other forms of government aid. It raises questions about which periodicals should receive assistance and what the goal of that subsidy should be."
