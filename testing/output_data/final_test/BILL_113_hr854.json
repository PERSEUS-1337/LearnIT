    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Qods Force Terrorist Designation Act\". The Qods Force, designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the Secretary of State in 1984, is the elite external operations branch of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It supports terrorist groups like Hamas, Hizballah, and Taliban fighters by providing weapons, training, and funding. Responsible for deadly attacks such as the bombings of the US Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut. In 2007, President George W. Bush and General David Petraeus accused Iran's Qods Force of aiding militias in killing American soldiers in Iraq and providing material support to terrorist organizations. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qods Force was sanctioned for supporting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In 2008, Congress urged designating Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization and placing them on the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists. Following the 2009 election in Iran, the Qods Force was implicated in violence, including custodial deaths, killings of protesters, torture, beatings, and rape. President Obama issued Executive Order 13572 in 2011, blocking property of certain persons involved in human rights abuses in Syria, including the Qods Force. This was due to the repression of the Syrian people through violence, torture, arbitrary arrests, and detentions of peaceful protestors. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice charged two members of Iran's Qods Force for an alleged plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States. The criminal complaint against individuals included charges of conspiracy to murder a foreign official, engage in foreign travel for murder-for-hire, use a weapon of mass destruction, and commit an act of international terrorism. The U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Iran's Qods Force General Gholamreza Baghbani as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker for supporting terrorism through the Qods Force. Iran's Qods Force stations operatives in foreign embassies, charities, and institutions to build relationships. In recent years, there has been an increased presence of the Shia Diaspora in Latin America, fostering relationships and building on existing socio-economic ties. The Secretary of State will designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qods Force as a foreign terrorist organization. A report on the terrorist activities of the Qods Force will be submitted to the relevant committees in Congress."
