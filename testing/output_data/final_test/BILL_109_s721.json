    "content": "Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem Restoration in Louisiana. The Secretary may implement an ecosystem restoration program in the Louisiana Coastal Area, Louisiana, based on a report from the Chief of Engineers. Priority will be given to critical restoration features and Mississippi River diversion projects that protect population areas and provide environmental benefits to the coastal area of Louisiana. The Secretary may implement an ecosystem restoration program in the Louisiana Coastal Area, Louisiana, focusing on critical restoration features and Mississippi River diversion projects that protect population areas. The non-Federal share for project costs can be offset by integral work carried out by the non-Federal interest. Credits for such work can be carried over between authorized projects. The Louisiana Coastal Area ecosystem restoration program allows nongovernmental organizations to contribute to project costs. The Secretary, in coordination with the Governor of Louisiana, must develop a comprehensive plan for protecting and restoring the coastal ecosystem, to be submitted to Congress every 5 years. The comprehensive plan for the Louisiana Coastal Area ecosystem restoration program includes a long-term framework for protection, conservation, and restoration of wetlands, estuaries, barrier islands, and shorelines. It also addresses the integration of new technologies and the involvement of other Federal agencies and programs. The Secretary developing the comprehensive plan for the Louisiana Coastal Area ecosystem restoration program should consider integrating related projects or activities from other Federal or State programs, such as the Mississippi River and Tributaries program, Louisiana Coastal Wetlands Conservation Plan, Louisiana Coastal Zone Management Plan, or the State of Louisiana's plan. The Coastal Louisiana Ecosystem Protection and Restoration Task Force, established to implement the plan \"Coast 2050: Toward a Sustainable Coastal Louisiana,\" consists of key members including the Secretaries of various departments and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Coastal Louisiana Ecosystem Protection and Restoration Task Force, established to implement the plan \"Coast 2050: Toward a Sustainable Coastal Louisiana,\" includes key members such as the Secretaries of various departments and representatives appointed by the Governor of Louisiana. The Task Force is responsible for making recommendations to the Secretary on policies, strategies, and financial participation in conserving, protecting, restoring, and maintaining the coastal Louisiana ecosystem. The Coastal Louisiana Ecosystem Protection and Restoration Task Force is responsible for making recommendations on funding and coordinating agency budgets for the comprehensive plan. Working groups may be established as needed, and the Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to the Task Force. Additionally, the Secretary is required to develop a plan for the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet within one year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary is tasked with developing a plan to modify the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet to address wetland losses, erosion, storm surges, saltwater intrusion, navigation interests, and environmental restoration. If necessary, a report recommending modifications, including measures to prevent saltwater intrusion, must be submitted to Congress. Additionally, the Secretary will establish a coastal Louisiana ecosystem science and technology program. The coastal Louisiana ecosystem science and technology program aims to identify uncertainties and improve knowledge of baseline conditions in the area. Working groups may be established to assist in this effort, and contracts and agreements may be utilized for implementation. The Secretary may enter into contracts or agreements with individuals or entities for coastal restoration and enhancement through science and technology. The Secretary may determine that environmental benefits outweigh disadvantages in conserving the coastal Louisiana ecosystem. The Secretary may enter into contracts with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on identifying causes of degradation in the Louisiana Coastal Area ecosystem. If the activity is deemed cost-effective, no further economic justification is needed. The Secretary, in conjunction with the Chief of Engineers, must submit a report to Congress by July 1, 2006, detailing the features in table 3 of the report. Additionally, project modifications are allowed. The Secretary, along with any non-Federal interest, will review existing federally-authorized water resources projects in coastal Louisiana to assess their alignment with the program for ecosystem restoration. Public notice and comment are required before modifying project operations or features. Before modifying a project's operation or feature, the Secretary must submit a report to the Senate and House committees detailing the changes. The report should include information on the timeline and cost of the modification. $10,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary to carry out these modifications."
