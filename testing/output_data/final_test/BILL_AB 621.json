    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 2750.8 of the Labor Code establishes the Motor Carrier Employer Amnesty Program, allowing eligible motor carriers performing drayage services at ports to be relieved of penalties for misclassifying commercial drivers as independent contractors. The program requires eligible carriers to properly classify all commercial drivers as employees. A commercial driver is defined as a person with a valid commercial driver's license hired for port drayage services. The Motor Carrier Employer Amnesty Program defines key terms such as \"Department,\" \"Eligible motor carrier,\" \"Motor carrier,\" and \"Port\" for the program's eligibility criteria and operations. The Motor Carrier Employer Amnesty Program defines key terms and eligibility criteria for participation, including the definition of \"Port\" as any sea or river port in the state. Motor carriers must apply by submitting an application to the Labor Commissioner and reporting the results of a self-audit. Motor carriers reclassifying commercial drivers as employees before January 1, 2016, must submit documentation and details of compensation paid to drivers prior to reclassification. The motor carrier must submit a self-audit report for all reclassified commercial drivers and any drivers subject to reclassification. Proceedings against a motor carrier under specific sections cannot be initiated after applying for a program, but may proceed if the application is denied. The Labor Commissioner will evaluate a motor carrier's application for participation in the program and has the authority to determine if prior reclassification efforts were sufficient to provide relief to misclassified commercial drivers. The application denial does not imply admission of misclassification. Before January 1, 2017, the Labor Commissioner could negotiate settlement agreements with eligible motor carriers under a program. After this date, no new settlement agreements could be executed. Prior to executing a settlement agreement, a motor carrier must file contribution returns and report unreported wages and taxes. The agreement requires the motor carrier to fulfill certain obligations. The settlement agreement requires the motor carrier to pay all owed wages, benefits, and taxes to reclassified commercial drivers, maintain converted positions as employee positions, and presume future drivers as employees unless proven otherwise. After executing the settlement agreement, ensure workers' compensation coverage for reclassified commercial drivers, provide proof of insurance within five days, pay authorized costs if necessary, and comply with any additional requirements deemed necessary by the Labor Commissioner and the department. A settlement agreement may require a motor carrier to pay the Labor Commissioner and department for review and compliance monitoring costs, deposited into the Labor Enforcement and Compliance Fund. The settlement agreement may allow installment payments for amounts due by a motor carrier, charging interest as per the Unemployment Insurance Code. Failure to comply with installment payment terms will nullify the agreement, making the total amount immediately due. The Labor Commissioner and the department may share necessary information for the program without waiving confidentiality requirements. An eligible motor carrier fulfilling a settlement agreement will not be liable for penalties, except for specific ones. Penalties under Section 1128 of the Unemployment Insurance Code are final unless reversed by the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board. Motor carriers admitting fraud or intent to evade reporting requirements face penalties. Violations of specified divisions with criminal investigation notice or court proceedings result in penalties. An eligible motor carrier under a settlement agreement is not liable for unpaid penalties and interest related to misclassification of drivers as independent contractors. Penalties issued before the agreement date are not waived. An eligible motor carrier is not liable for state personal income taxes withheld by Section 13020 of the Unemployment Insurance Code if they issued an information return or if the driver certifies payment. No refund or credit for penalties or interest paid before applying to the program. The department will not pursue criminal action for tax reporting violations against eligible motor carriers who fulfill obligations under a settlement agreement. The statute of limitations on misclassification claims against motor carriers is paused during participation in the program. The Labor Commissioner can recover funds for reclassified commercial drivers through settlement agreements, but drivers are not obligated to accept the terms. If a driver declines, they can still be reclassified as an employee but may lose the right to pursue certain penalties. If a commercial driver does not accept the terms of a settlement agreement, the motor carrier is excused from paying the agreed amount to that driver. If the Labor Commissioner finds a motor carrier violated a settlement agreement, they can file a civil action to enforce it. The Commissioner can seek recovery of amounts due to commercial drivers by filing a petition for entry of judgment. The Labor Commissioner can file an application for an order to show cause against an eligible motor carrier within 60 days of filing a petition for entry of judgment. The court will hold a hearing and enter a judgment for amounts owed to commercial drivers under the settlement agreement, with credits for any payments made by the motor carrier. This judgment does not prevent further action for civil or statutory penalties by the Labor Commissioner or employees. The court will award the Labor Commissioner costs and attorney's fees if a motor carrier violates a settlement agreement. A Motor Carrier Employer Amnesty Program is established under the Unemployment Insurance Code, where the department collaborates with the Labor Commissioner. Definitions from the Labor Code apply to this program. Commercial drivers classified as employees under a settlement agreement can receive a refund of elective coverage contributions. The department has the authority to create regulations and take necessary actions to implement the program."
