    "content": "The Act titled \"Disaster Victims Crime Prevention Act of 1995\" aims to prevent fraud following major disasters by amending Title III of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. This includes redesignating sections and adding a new section 315 for fraud prevention. The Act aims to prevent fraud after disasters by defining terms like 'agreement', 'consumer good or service', and 'provide'. The Act defines terms like 'provide' and 'supplier' in relation to consumer goods or services. It also establishes Anti-Fraud Strike Forces after a major disaster is declared. The Act establishes an anti-fraud task force to combat fraudulent activities by suppliers offering goods and services for disaster recovery. The Act establishes penalties for suppliers who fraudulently obtain money or goods in connection with disaster recovery efforts, with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment or a fine under title 18, United States Code. The Act imposes penalties on suppliers who fraudulently obtain money or goods during disaster recovery, with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment or a fine under title 18, United States Code. Suppliers are considered to obtain money by false pretenses if they use it for purposes other than specified in the agreement. The Act imposes penalties on suppliers who fraudulently obtain money or goods during disaster recovery, with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment or a fine under title 18, United States Code. Suppliers are considered to obtain money by false pretenses if they use it for purposes other than specified in the agreement, such as exceeding 10% of the money received for residential construction services. The Act penalizes suppliers who fraudulently obtain money or goods during disaster recovery, with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment or a fine under title 18, United States Code. If a supplier receives money or value under an agreement for services and fails to apply for necessary permits within 30 days or start construction within 90 days, they are in violation. The Act penalizes suppliers who fraudulently obtain money or goods during disaster recovery, with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment or a fine under title 18, United States Code. A person who obtains federal assistance through false pretenses or fraudulent conduct is committing an offense. During a declared major disaster, it is illegal for suppliers to engage in price-gouging of disaster victims within the affected area. Offenders can face imprisonment for up to 10 years or fines under title 18, United States Code. It is illegal for suppliers to charge unconscionably excessive prices for consumer goods or services during a declared major disaster. The determination of excessive pricing is a question of law for the court to decide, with a gross disparity in pricing considered prima facie evidence. The price of consumer goods or services during a disaster should not grossly exceed the average price in the 30-day period prior to the disaster declaration. The price of consumer goods or services during a disaster should not significantly exceed the average price in the 30-day period before the disaster declaration. This excess amount should not be due to increased costs incurred by the supplier. The supplier's increased replacement cost cannot be factored in unless they have no guarantee of recovering it in a future sale. Violating this rule can lead to imprisonment, fines, disgorgement of unlawfully acquired gains, and restitution to affected parties. The supplier may face legal action in a US district court for damages, including treble damages, disgorgement, punitive damages, attorney's fees, and injunctive relief. State attorneys general can also bring civil actions on behalf of residents for similar damages. The Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, in consultation with relevant officials, will develop public information materials to help disaster victims detect and avoid fraudulent suppliers. The United States Sentencing Commission will review and amend sentencing guidelines to consider committing offenses following a major disaster as an aggravating factor. This is in connection with fraudulent offers to disaster victims for goods or services related to cleanup and recovery efforts. Committing offenses under specific sections of title 18, United States Code, related to providing consumer goods or services for disaster recovery may lead to a sentence twice as severe."
