    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Elgin Stafford Mental Illness Information Disclosure Act of 2012\" or \"Elgin's Law\". The Congress recognizes that mental illness is a leading cause of disability worldwide, especially affecting women and children. It strikes individuals during prime years, leading to significant consequences like disability, unemployment, substance abuse, and suicide, with an economic cost exceeding $100 billion annually in the United States. The best treatments for serious mental illnesses in the United States are highly effective, with 70-90% of individuals experiencing significant symptom reduction and improved quality of life through a combination of medications and therapy. Early identification and treatment, especially for children and young adults, is crucial, and the involvement of parents and legal guardians is encouraged to support clinical practices. Disclosure to parents and legal guardians of mental illness treatment for children under 26 is mandated. The health care professional treating a covered individual for mental illness must disclose relevant information to the parent, except in exceptional circumstances determined by the Secretary. This disclosure is considered permissible under HIPAA privacy regulations. The Secretary will post information on the requirements of this section on Department websites to inform the public and healthcare professionals. A covered individual is defined as a minor child, uninsured adult under 26, or an adult under 26 being treated for mental illness by a healthcare professional. The term \"health benefits coverage\" refers to minimum essential coverage. The term \"HIPAA privacy regulations\" refers to regulations in the Social Security Act. \"Mental illness\" includes conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. The term \"uninsured\" refers to individuals not covered by any health benefits coverage. The term \"parent\" includes legal guardians, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
