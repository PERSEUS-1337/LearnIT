    "content": "As of January 1, 2014, federal law allows states to expand Medicaid eligibility for citizens with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the ACA would increase Medicaid enrollment by 7 million in CY2014, rising to 13 million by CY2024. To qualify for Medicaid, applicants must meet financial requirements tied to specific percentages of the federal poverty level. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) allowed for the expansion of Medicaid eligibility up to 133% of the federal poverty level. This expansion created a new categorically needy group for nonelderly, non-pregnant adults with income below 133% FPL to receive Medicaid benefits through Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs). However, the Supreme Court made this expansion optional in 2012. The ACA made Medicaid expansion optional, allowing states to offer more restrictive benefits to the medically needy subgroup. States can use waivers to design benefit packages tailored to specific subpopulations. Medicaid benefits vary based on eligibility classifications. Medicaid benefits vary based on eligibility classifications, with mandatory and optional services available. Benefit packages can differ for different Medicaid subpopulations, categorized into traditional benefits and Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs). States must cover certain benefits under federal law, while others are offered at state discretion. Examples of mandatory benefits include inpatient hospital services, physician services, and early and periodic screening for individuals under 21. Medicaid benefits include mandatory services like inpatient hospital and physician services, as well as optional services such as prescribed drugs and physical therapy. Coverage can vary by state for both mandatory and optional benefits. Medicaid benefits can vary by state, even for mandatory services like inpatient hospital care. Federal guidelines require services to be sufficient in amount, duration, and scope, with equal access within a state. States can modify rules through waiver authority. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed states to offer benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage, now known as ABPs, as an alternative to traditional Medicaid benefits. The ACA made changes to ABP design and requirements, requiring individuals eligible for Medicaid expansion to have ABP coverage. States can also enroll \"full benefit eligibles\" or specific subgroups in ABPs, with the option to extend coverage to other sub-populations and sub-state areas. States can enroll \"full benefit eligibles\" or specific subgroups in ABPs, with the option to extend coverage to other sub-populations and sub-state areas. Medically needy populations can continue to receive coverage through the medically needy program or through an ABP if eligible for the ACA Medicaid expansion subgroup. Certain groups, such as those with special health care needs, are exempt from mandatory enrollment in ABPs. ABPs may cover fewer benefits than traditional Medicaid but must include at least the 10 essential health benefits. Some requirements, like EPSDT and transportation to medical providers, make ABPs more generous than private health insurance. Starting in 2014, ABPs must cover essential health benefits such as ambulatory services, emergency care, hospitalization, maternity care, mental health services, and substance use disorder treatment. The Affordable Care Act requires Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs) to cover at least the 10 essential health benefits, including services like hospitalization, mental health, and pediatric care. Certain services like routine dental and eye exams are not considered essential. ABPs must also comply with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act and cover family planning services. For children under 21, ABP coverage must include Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) services. The Affordable Care Act mandates that Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs) cover essential health benefits for children under 21, including EPSDT services. States must choose a coverage option for Medicaid ABP, such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield or a state employee plan, with equivalent actuarial value. The Secretary of HHS has identified options for defining essential health benefits, including using base benchmark plans from various sources. States must ensure coverage of all EHB categories, supplementing with other plans if necessary. Benefit substitution rules apply to EHBs in ABPs and equivalent plans, allowing states to substitute benefits when needed. States can substitute benefits in Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) and equivalent plans under certain conditions, such as actuarial equivalence, same EHB category, and non-prescription drug services. Evidence of actuarial equivalence must be certified by an American Academy of Actuaries member and based on accepted actuarial principles. Additional rules apply to Medicaid ABP coverage for prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, habilitative services, and preventive care. A health plan must cover at least one drug in every USP category to provide EHBs. A health plan providing Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) must cover at least one drug in every U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) category or class, or the same number of prescription drugs in each category as the EHB base benchmark plan. The plan must submit its drug list to the relevant authorities and have procedures for enrollees to access clinically appropriate drugs not covered. Rehabilitative and habilitative services are mandatory EHB categories without a standard federal definition. States may adopt service definitions similar to NAIC for rehabilitative and habilitative services. Rehabilitative services help regain lost skills due to illness or injury, while habilitative services aim to attain new skills due to a disabling condition. CMS may provide further guidance based on implementation experience. Traditional Medicaid state plans cover preventive services, diagnostic services, and services of recognized practitioners. Medicaid ABPs must cover preventive care at the minimum level required for EHBs, including services rated A or B by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Cost-sharing for preventive services is prohibited. The ACA created health insurance exchanges for those ineligible for Medicaid due to income. Overlapping benefit requirements exist between Medicaid ABPs and exchange plans, allowing individuals to adjust coverage based on income changes. States have the authority to align Medicaid benefits with health insurance exchange coverage by implementing benchmark benefit packages. The requirements for current ABPs differ from former benchmark plans, and states must adhere to the new ABP requirements if they wish to continue using them. It is uncertain how state experiences with Medicaid benchmark plans will impact benefit package design in 2014. States without experience may look to other states for guidance. States can align Medicaid benefits with health insurance exchange coverage by implementing benchmark benefit packages. States without experience may learn from those that have implemented benchmark packages for lessons in designing benefit packages in 2014. Table 5 provides information on selected characteristics of ABPs for 15 states, illustrating similarities and variations in covered benefits. Dental care for adults is covered in six states. In six states, dental care for adults is covered, while non-emergency medical transportation is offered in four states. Nursing facility care is included in the ABPs of four states. Federal mental health parity requirements mandate equal coverage for mental health and addiction services compared to medical and surgical services in insurance plans. Managed care plans under Medicaid and ABPs must comply with these requirements. Both traditional Medicaid and ABPs must comply with federal mental health parity requirements. ABPs not managed care plans only need to comply with parity in treatment limitations and financial requirements. Offering EPSDT to individuals under 21 ensures compliance with federal mental health parity requirements."
