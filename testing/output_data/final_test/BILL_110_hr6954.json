    "content": "The \"Senior Financial Empowerment Act of 2008\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section is included in the Act. The Congress finds that the population of the United States aged 60 years or older will significantly increase in the next 30 years due to Baby Boomers approaching retirement. Between 500,000 and 5,000,000 seniors in the US are abused, neglected, or exploited annually, with financial exploitation being a common issue. Senior abuse knows no boundaries and is underreported, making it difficult to estimate the prevalence of fraud targeting seniors. The Federal Bureau of Investigation notes that seniors are often targeted for fraud due to underreporting and lack of national statistics on senior fraud. Seniors may not report fraud out of shame, not knowing who to report to, or fear of losing control of their financial affairs. Perpetrators target seniors for mail, telemarketing, and Internet fraud because they are vulnerable and trusting. The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act strengthened the US Postal Service's ability to protect consumers from fraudulent schemes targeting seniors, who often fall victim to scams through mail, phone, and the internet. In response to mail fraud complaints, analysts sent over 27,000 letters and postcards in fiscal year 2007. In 2000, the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging reported that consumers lose approximately $40 billion to telemarketing fraud annually, with an estimated 10% of telemarketing firms being fraudulent. Only one in 10,000 fraud victims report the crime to authorities. Telemarketing fraud is underreported among seniors, but those counseled by trained volunteers are less likely to fall victim. The threat of fraud to seniors is increasing, with criminals using traditional methods like phone calls and mailings, as well as online scams. The IC3 processed over 219,553 complaints of Internet crime in 2007. In 2007, the IC3 received over 219,553 complaints of Internet crime. They referred 90,008 complaints to law enforcement, resulting in a total dollar loss of $239,090,000. Consumer awareness is crucial in preventing fraud. Enhanced sentencing penalties based on age of victim are outlined in Section 3. The United States Sentencing Commission is directed to review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to include the age of a crime victim, especially for senior victims, as a criteria for sentencing enhancements. The Commission is urged to consider increased penalties for crimes against seniors, consult with relevant groups, ensure consistency with other guidelines, and account for circumstances that may warrant exceptions. The Commission is directed to enhance sentencing guidelines based on the age of crime victims, make necessary changes to Federal sentencing guidelines, and ensure they align with the purposes of sentencing. A report on issues related to the age of crime victims must be submitted to Congress within one year, including explanations of policy changes and recommendations for penalty levels for offenses involving seniors. SEC. 4. Grants to prevent mail, telemarketing, and internet fraud. The Attorney General will establish a grant program to award funds for fraud prevention education programs for seniors. Eligible organizations include State Attorneys General, law enforcement agencies, senior centers, and nonprofit organizations. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2013. The Congress recognizes the need for increased awareness of mail, telemarketing, and Internet fraud on senior citizens. They propose designating a week in May as \"National Senior Fraud Awareness Week\" with educational activities. The President is encouraged to issue a proclamation supporting prevention of fraud against seniors."
