The Consumer Auto Safety Enhancement Act of 2010 highlights the benefits of event data recorders for vehicle safety, including automatic crash notification systems and understanding crashworthiness. It emphasizes the potential to reduce the high number of annual road fatalities in the United States by maximizing the use of event data recorders in vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's working group underscores the importance of widespread adoption of these recorders to fully realize their safety benefits. The National Transportation Safety Board recommends installing event data recorders in new motor vehicles for safety benefits, despite the minimal financial burden on manufacturers. The National Transportation Safety Board recommends installing event data recorders in new motor vehicles for safety benefits. SEC. 3. EVENT DATA RECORDERS. The Secretary of Transportation will require motor vehicle manufacturers to equip all vehicles from model year 2012 onwards with event data recorders meeting specific specifications and a uniform data retrieval method. The event data recorder required for vehicles from model year 2012 onwards must be capable of surviving specific crash and immersion scenarios without data loss or function failure, as determined by the Secretary of Transportation. This includes withstanding fires, immersion in water up to 10 feet, and frontal and rear barrier crash tests at high speeds. The event data recorder for vehicles from model year 2012 onwards must pass specific crash and immersion tests without data loss. This includes rear barrier crash tests and recording data elements like yaw data, safety belt status, vehicle speed, and engine rotations. The event data recorder for vehicles from model year 2012 onwards must pass crash and immersion tests without data loss, recording key details like airbag deployment, rollover data, ABS operation, tire pressure, and vehicle identification information. The event data recorder for vehicles from model year 2012 onwards must pass crash and immersion tests without data loss, recording key details like airbag deployment, rollover data, ABS operation, tire pressure, and vehicle identification information. The recorder required under subsection (a)(1) should record crash event data for at least 60 seconds before and 15 seconds after time zero, including additional data elements specified by the Secretary. The term 'time zero' is defined in section 563.5(b) of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations. The event data recorder required under subsection (a)(1) must have safeguards to prevent data alteration and be compatible with a universal data retrieval method. The Secretary will specify data format requirements for the universal data retrieval method. The universal data retrieval method mandated by the Secretary for event data recorders on motor vehicles must allow for the extraction of recorded data in a readable format for safety analysis. The Secretary will establish a process for individuals or entities to transmit data from event data recorders. The Secretary will create a database for research and analysis containing all data from event data recorders, periodically evaluating and modifying the process to ensure effectiveness and efficiency. The Secretary will establish a database for research using data from event data recorders, including police accident reports, and other official information. The database will be available to the public, with safeguards in place to protect personally identifiable information. The Secretary will ensure that public data from event data recorders do not contain information that could identify vehicle owners, lessees, or occupants. This includes withholding vehicle identification numbers, names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, and any other prohibited or privacy-sensitive information. The definition of an event data recorder is provided for this section. The Secretary of Transportation will promulgate a rule requiring motor vehicle manufacturers to ensure that data recorded by event data recorders in vehicles before model year 2012 can be read by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This rule applies to vehicles equipped with event data recorders, regardless of manufacture date. The rule mandates that all motor vehicles, regardless of manufacture date, must have an event data recorder that allows the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to access and analyze safety performance data. The effective date of this rule will be within 30 days of its promulgation. Sec. 30131 states that data in event data recorders are owned by the vehicle owner or lessee. Access to this data is restricted to the owner/lessee, unless authorized by a court, with consent, or for government purposes. The data retrieved by a government motor vehicle safety agency is used to improve motor vehicle safety. Personally identifiable information, including vehicle identification numbers, is not publicly disclosed in connection with the data. Event data recorders required for model year 2012 or later, readability of data in event data recorders prior to 2012, and privacy of data in event data recorders are addressed in this section. Additionally, a report on the feasibility of automatic transmission of EDR data is required. The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress on the feasibility of event data recorders automatically transmitting crash data. The report will analyze systems for electronic data transmission, manufacturer data collection practices, and potential benefits. The report to Congress will include an analysis of the benefits and costs for motor vehicle manufacturers to comply with the requirement of automatic data transmission to the Secretary. It will also recommend a timeline for compliance and address any privacy issues that may arise."
