    "content": "The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 aims to preserve outdoor recreation resources and promote the health of U.S. citizens. It provides funds for federal land acquisition and state assistance related to outdoor recreation. The fund receives $900 million annually from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf, federal motorboat fuel tax, and surplus property sales. However, these revenues are only available if appropriated by Congress through the discretionary appropriations process. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) receives additional revenue from OCS leasing under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA), which provides mandatory appropriations for grants to states for outdoor recreation purposes. The total accrued revenues in the fund amount to $40.9 billion, with only $18.9 billion appropriated through FY2019, leaving an unappropriated balance of $22.0 billion. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes, with not less than 40% to be used for specific purposes. The LWCF Act mandates that at least 40% of the fund be used for federal purposes, primarily for land and water acquisition by federal agencies. Another 40% is designated for financial assistance to states for outdoor recreation. Appropriations have historically been allocated for land acquisition by federal land management agencies like BLM, FWS, NPS, and FS. Since FY1965, appropriations have funded outdoor recreation matching grants, state recreational planning, land acquisition, and developing recreational facilities. From FY1998, LWCF appropriations have funded federal programs for natural resource purposes. $18.9 billion has been allocated through FY2019, with $11.4 billion for federal land acquisition, $4.8 billion for state grants, and $2.7 billion for other purposes. Congress is considering the allocation of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states. Some advocates are concerned about potential lower appropriations for land acquisition and recreation grants if funds are diverted. Various measures have been proposed in Congress to authorize LWCF funding for other purposes, but none have been enacted. Some proposed measures in Congress aimed to allocate LWCF funding for programs and activities not traditionally funded by the LWCF, such as deferred maintenance, critical infrastructure, visitor services, clean-up efforts, Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program, and offshore energy exploration. The 105th Congress bill proposed LWCF funding for park and recreation projects. In FY1998, $72.0 million was appropriated for other purposes, including maintenance for land agencies and Beartooth Highway. Total LWCF appropriations in FY1998 spiked to $969 million from $159 million in FY1997. Since FY1998, LWCF appropriations for other purposes have fluctuated, declining overall from $132.5 million in FY2010 to $93.3 million in FY2019. The FY2019 level was the highest since FY2010, with appropriations for other purposes consistently below $100 million since FY2011. The lowest funding was in FY1999, with no funds allocated, and the next lowest in FY2000 at $20.0 million for specific projects. In contrast, appropriations for other purposes exceeded $100 million annually from FY2001 to FY2010, with some years reaching between $200 million and $225 million. The highest appropriation was $456.0 million in FY2001, which funded various programs in the Clinton Administration's Lands Legacy Initiative, surpassing $1 billion in total LWCF appropriations. This funding was partly in response to President Clinton's $1.4 billion Lands Legacy Initiative. The LWCF funding was partly in response to congressional interest in securing increased funding. The highest percentage of annual funds for other purposes occurred in FY2006 and FY2007, in response to President George W. Bush's request for funding for various programs. For example, in FY2007, the Bush Administration sought funding from the LWCF for 15 programs in addition to land acquisition and state grants. The appropriation for other purposes in FY2007 was $216.1 million out of a total LWCF appropriation of $366.1 million. In some years, the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the Administration requested, such as in FY2008 when the appropriation was $101.3 million out of a total of $255.1 million. The LWCF has allocated $2.7 billion for other purposes from FY1998 to FY2019, with FWS and FS receiving the largest shares. Presidents have requested funds for various purposes, and Congress decides which requests to fund from the LWCF. Appropriations for other purposes have been provided for diverse natural resource-related programs. Since FY1998, the LWCF has allocated $2.7 billion for various natural resource-related programs, with funds mainly going towards facility maintenance, ecosystem restoration, and wildlife conservation. In recent years, funds have been primarily appropriated for grants under the Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund programs, totaling $1.7 billion. Since FY1998, the LWCF has allocated $2.7 billion for natural resource programs, with funds mainly for facility maintenance, ecosystem restoration, and wildlife conservation. Grants under the Forest Legacy program are used to acquire lands or conservation easements to preserve private forests threatened by conversion to non-forest uses. FS provides matching grants to states through a competitive process based on project importance and public benefits. The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund provides grants for species and habitat conservation actions on non-Federal lands, including habitat acquisition, conservation planning, restoration, surveys, propagation, research, and education. State partners implement the program primarily through state forestry agencies, acquiring and administering easements or land purchases. Additional appropriations are typically received by the fund, with LWCF funds used for land acquisition grants to states. The LWCF funds are used for land acquisition grants provided to states and territories for species recovery goals, habitat conservation plans, and wildlife programs. State and Tribal Wildlife Grants receive funding from the LWCF for FY2001-FY2007, with subsequent funding from the U.S. Treasury. The program mainly focuses on formula grants for state conservation plans and implementation. The LWCF funds are used for land acquisition grants for species recovery, habitat conservation, and wildlife programs. Grants may be used for state conservation plans and specific projects. Smaller amounts are allocated for competitive grants to states, territories, and tribal governments, without matching requirements. Appendices show total LWCF appropriations for other purposes from FY1998 to FY2019 and annual appropriations for specific purposes."
