    "content": "The text chunk discusses the exclusion of water conservation subsidies provided by water utilities from gross income according to an amendment in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The text chunk outlines that gross income does not include water conservation subsidies provided by water utilities to customers. It also states that no deduction or credit is allowed for expenditures covered by the subsidy, and defines a water conservation measure as any installation or modification to reduce water consumption. The text chunk defines specially defined water property as toilets, urinals, laundry machines, and dishwashers with specific water usage limits per flush or cycle. The specially defined water property includes equipment that reduces water pressure, recycles water, and optimizes water cycling. The curr_chunk lists equipment and facilities that use treated municipal effluent for non-potable applications, evapotranspiration stations, tank and reservoir covers, sub-metering systems, equipment for identifying and repairing water leaks, and other specified properties. The curr_chunk discusses regulations for specially defined water property, including exceeding local water efficiency standards, leak identification and repair services, and landscape measures to improve soil moisture retention. The curr_chunk discusses regulations for water utilities and includes a definition of the term 'water utility' as well as a clerical amendment to the tax code. The curr_chunk introduces new regulations for water utilities, specifically addressing water conservation subsidies and expenditures. The effective date for these amendments is after December 31, 1993. The new regulations allow water utilities to deduct water conservation expenditures for subsidies provided to customers for water-saving devices or services. This does not include expenditures used to determine the basis of depreciable property owned by the taxpayer. The amendment to section 263(a) of the tax code allows for a deduction under section 198 for certain expenditures. Section 198 allows for water conservation expenditures by water utilities, with amendments applying to expenses incurred after December 31, 1993."
