    "content": "Repeal of provision including one-half of Social Security and Railroad Retirement benefits in gross income. The repeal of Section 86 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 removes the inclusion of social security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits in gross income. Additionally, Section 6050F, which requires returns relating to Social Security benefits, is also repealed. Technical and conforming amendments are made to sections 72(r) and 6050G(a) of the Code. The amendments remove sections 86 and 6050F from the Internal Revenue Code, replacing them with sections 72(r)(3) and 6050G(a). The changes apply to benefits received after December 31, 1989, in taxable years starting after that date. Taxation of one-half of Social Security benefits paid to nonresident aliens continues. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to define \"social security benefit\" as any amount received by a taxpayer from entitlement to monthly benefits under the Social Security Act or tier 1 railroad retirement benefits. The amount received is determined without considering a specific section of the Social Security Act. Repayments during the year are also considered for adjustments in the taxation of Social Security benefits for nonresident aliens. The amount of Social Security benefits received in a taxable year is reduced by any repayment made by the taxpayer of previously received benefits. If workmen's compensation benefits reduce Social Security benefits, the compensation amount is included in the definition of Social Security benefits. The curr_chunk discusses technical and conforming amendments related to taxation of Social Security benefits, including changes to specific sections of the tax code. Amendments are made to sections of the tax code related to Social Security benefits, changing references from 86(d) to 871(j). The effective date for these amendments is the first taxable year after the enactment of the Act."
