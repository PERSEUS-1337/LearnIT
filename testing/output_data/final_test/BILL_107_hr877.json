The \"Skilled Workforce Enhancement Act of 2001\" offers a $15,000 training credit for small business employers with 250 or fewer employees. The term 'qualified training year' refers to each year during the training period where the employee received at least 1,500 hours of training in a highly skilled trade as an apprentice. Highly skilled trades include precision machinists, die makers, and mold makers. The curr_chunk lists various skilled trades including tool and die designers, HVAC contractors, masons, plumbers, electricians, welders, and shipfitters. The curr_chunk defines a \"qualified training program\" as a written plan for individuals in highly skilled trades, excluding trades with apprenticeship periods less than 2 years. A \"qualified training program\" under clause (i) must be a program registered and certified with the Secretary of Labor under the National Apprenticeship Act, licensed, registered, or certified by the workforce investment board or apprenticeship agency of a State, or conducted by a vocational or technical education program. A qualified training program must be registered and certified with the Secretary of Labor under the National Apprenticeship Act, licensed by a State workforce board, or conducted by a vocational or technical education program. It can also be an apprentice training program developed by an employer trade group, an industry-sponsored program recognized within the industry, or accessible to individuals. A qualified training program must be accessible without discrimination and provide an overview of the trade, related instruction of skills, and training in math and blueprint reading if required. The training program for trade includes specific tools and equipment training, on-the-job training under supervision, and periodic evaluation of skills proficiency. The text discusses a tax credit for employers who hire apprentices in highly skilled trades, lasting up to 4 years. The credit reduces other allowable credits for the same employee. The text introduces a new paragraph (14) regarding a tax credit for small business employers in highly skilled trades. It also includes a denial of double benefit and a clerical amendment to the tax code. Sec. 45E allows for expenses on long-term training of employees in skilled small business trades. The amendments apply to expenses incurred in taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
