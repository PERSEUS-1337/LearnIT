    "content": "The Export-Import Bank of the United States operates under a renewable charter, the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945. Congress's central issue is whether to reauthorize the Bank's charter, which could impact U.S. export promotion activities and industries. The 112th Congress debated reauthorizing the Bank's authority, which had been extended through appropriations vehicles. The 112th Congress passed a bill to extend the Export-Import Bank's authority through FY2014. The Bank was established in 1934 to support U.S. exports and employment. Congress plays a crucial role in reauthorization, appropriation, and oversight of the Bank. The Export-Import Bank provides financing to support U.S. exports when private sector financing is not available or too costly. Its transactions are backed by the U.S. government's credit. The Bank's charter requires repayment assurance, limits competition with private capital, and notifies Congress of transactions over $100 million. The recent reauthorization bill raises the Bank's lending authority to $140 billion. The Export-Import Bank, supported by the recent reauthorization bill (H.R. 2072), raises its lending authority to $140 billion in FY2014. The Bank has financed over $400 billion in U.S. exports through programs like direct loans, credit guarantees, and export insurance. With weak domestic consumption post-2008 financial crisis, the U.S. economy is increasingly relying on exports for growth. The Ex-Im Bank plays a key role in promoting U.S. exports to support the economy. It is part of President Obama's National Export Initiative to double exports by 2015. The Export Promotion Cabinet's report recommends increasing U.S. export financing by making more credit available and expanding eligibility criteria. The Ex-Im Bank is expanding credit and insurance eligibility for SMEs, focusing on priority international markets, and streamlining the application process for federal export credit. Other agencies also provide export financing. The Ex-Im Bank has various stakeholders including U.S. businesses, indirect suppliers, service exporters, import-sensitive U.S. industries, and international buyers of Ex-Im Bank-financed exports. The Ex-Im Bank has stakeholders such as U.S. businesses, international buyers from developing countries, commercial lenders, economic development organizations, federal government agencies, and non-governmental organizations. The Ex-Im Bank plays a crucial role in providing export financing, supporting approximately 10% of global trade. Private lenders handle short-term financing, while official export credit agencies (ECAs) are more involved in medium- and long-term financing for large projects. The role of ECAs has grown due to the 2008 financial crisis, with businesses turning to them for credit when facing difficulties in the private sector. Since its establishment in 1934, the Ex-Im Bank has seen a surge in demand for export credit and insurance from ECAs in the private sector. Globalization has brought significant changes to the international export credit environment, with the United States and other developed countries traditionally being key players in world trade flows and ECA financing. The G-7 countries have historically dominated global medium- to long-term export finance, accounting for about 80% of it. As members of the OECD, these countries adhere to the OECD Arrangement to ensure fair exporting practices. Economic changes driven by globalization have led to the increasing wealth of emerging markets in recent decades. Economic changes from globalization have boosted emerging economies' wealth and their role in the global economy. Emerging market countries like China, India, and Brazil operate ECAs but are not OECD members, leading to non-compliance with international standards in export credit financing. This has increased competition for U.S. exporters from both developed and emerging countries. The globalization-driven economic changes have led to increased competition for U.S. exporters from both developed and emerging countries. Developed country ECAs have seen a shift in competition dynamics, with new forms emerging despite reductions in certain types of competition. The aircraft sector, for example, has witnessed an informal \"home market rule\" among the Ex-Im Bank and ECAs of the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Germany. Canada's non-recognition of this rule indicates a changing competitive landscape. Canada's competitive landscape is evolving as Bombardier enters the large civil aircraft market with support from Canada's official ECA. Similar trends are seen in other sectors like green energy projects, with Japanese ECA supporting companies in the United States. Concerns arise among OECD members about the level playing field for exporters due to increasing official export credit activity from emerging economies outside the OECD Arrangement. Non-OECD countries are expected to expand their market share using financing methods outside OECD rules. Officially subsidized export credit activity by emerging economies, particularly Chinese ECAs, is increasing in strategic markets like oil and gas, renewable energy, and natural resources extraction. This trend has raised concerns about a new \"race to the bottom\" as emerging economies compete in the financing sector. Data on ECA activities are limited and comparing activities across ECAs can be challenging. In 2010, Berne Union members provided $1.4 trillion in credit and investment insurance support, covering over 10% of international trade transactions. They typically cover riskier transactions where insurance is taken to mitigate trading risks. The Ex-Im Bank's annual report estimates new medium- and long-term official export credit financing by various ECAs in 2010. In 2010, G-7 countries and emerging economies provided significant new medium- and long-term official export credit financing. The G-7 ECAs totaled $65.4 billion, with the United States accounting for 20%. Emerging economies like Brazil, China, and India surpassed the G-7 with $72.7 billion in new financing. ECAs have different mandates, with some focusing on commercial objectives and others acting as lenders of last resort. Canada's ECA supports Canadian exports and trade capacity, while other ECAs in emerging markets focus on economic development. ECAs offer various products like loans, guarantees, and tied aid for short, medium, and long terms. In the United States, the Ex-Im Bank provides credit and insurance for exports, while OPIC offers political risk insurance for overseas investment. The Ex-Im Bank in the United States provides credit and insurance for exports, while OPIC offers political risk insurance for overseas investment. Some ECAs determine support for export contracts based on various criteria, with the Ex-Im Bank having more stringent policies compared to other ECAs. Congressional examination of the Ex-Im Bank for reauthorization focuses on its effectiveness, efficiency, competitiveness, and specific policies. The Ex-Im Bank's credit and insurance programs have been debated in Congress for their effectiveness and competitiveness compared to foreign ECAs. Some view federal export financing as corporate welfare, while others argue it is necessary for certain projects. Advocates believe these programs address market failures and counter foreign governments' export financing efforts, while critics argue they only shift production within the economy without adding to overall exports. The Ex-Im Bank's credit and insurance programs have been debated in Congress for their effectiveness and competitiveness compared to foreign ECAs. Concerns include government intervention crowding out private sector financing and the composition of firms benefiting from Ex-Im Bank services. Large firms dominate the dollar value of credit and insurance authorizations, while small firms lead in the number of transactions. Supporters emphasize the Bank's mission to support businesses of all sizes, with a focus on small businesses. Supporters argue that the dollar value of Ex-Im Bank support to small businesses may be misleading due to larger corporations requiring more support. They also mention \"invisible\" exporters benefiting from Ex-Im Bank services. One study found 33,000 SMEs supplying goods to larger companies using Ex-Im Bank financing. Congress sets limitations on the Bank's loan amounts. The Ex-Im Bank's exposure cap/ceiling on loan amounts has evolved over time. Initially capitalized with $1 billion in 1934, Congress authorized limits on outstanding credit and insurance authority. The limit was set at three and a half times the authorized stock in 1945, then changed to four and a half times in 1951. In 1954, the limit was fixed at $5 billion, with periodic increases through legislation. The recent legislation, H.R. 2072, increases the Ex-Im Bank's exposure cap incrementally to $120 billion in FY2012, $130 billion in FY2013, and $140 billion in FY2014. Concerns arise that the Bank may reach its ceiling soon, affecting its ability to finance large export transactions. The Bank's credit and insurance transactions are backed by the U.S. government's full faith and credit. The Ex-Im Bank's exposure cap is the maximum amount for which U.S. taxpayers may be liable. Opponents express concern about potential taxpayer burden due to the Bank's activities, citing increased risks with global financial crises. Supporters argue that the Bank is self-sustaining and monitors risks in its portfolio. The OECD Arrangement lacks specific guidelines on content requirements. The Ex-Im Bank's content policy limits support for medium- and long-term transactions to 85% of the value of U.S. goods and services or 100% of U.S. content in an export contract. The policy aims to target U.S. content and support U.S. jobs by encouraging companies to maximize sourcing from the U.S. The Ex-Im Bank's policy aims to promote U.S. content sourcing but allows financing for foreign-originated goods/services in export contracts with restrictions. The policy balances stakeholder interests and may include flexibility in content requirements, such as lowering the domestic content requirement to 70% and expanding the definition of content to include R&D and global supply chain management. The Ex-Im Bank's policy aims to promote U.S. content sourcing by potentially lowering national content requirements and expanding the definition of content to include R&D, project, and global supply chain management. Industry proposals suggest lowering U.S. content requirements for full financing to match OECD countries or automatically covering non-U.S. content for U.S. FTA partners. Labor groups are concerned about the impact on employment if national content requirements are reduced. The Ex-Im Bank's policy aims to promote U.S. content sourcing by potentially lowering national content requirements. Concerns exist about the impact on employment in the home country if these requirements are reduced. The Bank provided over $8 billion in financing for U.S. services exports during 2008-2010, with some arguing that its definition of national content overlooks high-value U.S. jobs in R&D and supply chain management. Business groups argue that the Ex-Im Bank should focus more on services industries, which are the fastest-growing sector of the U.S. economy. The federal government recognizes the need to enhance efforts in promoting services exports, including better data collection, sector and market focus, and coordination of export promotion. The Ex-Im Bank introduced the co-financing program in 2001 to enable export credit financing from multiple ECAs. In 2010, the Bank conducted 34 co-financing transactions totaling $6.5 billion, with 98% involving aircraft. This allows the Ex-Im Bank to participate with other ECAs on the non-U.S. content portion of an export contract, reducing the risk of U.S. exporters losing sales due to insufficient support. The Ex-Im Bank's co-financing program, introduced in 2001, involves aircraft transactions to offer maximum support to exporters. The Bank's shipping policy, based on PR-17, requires certain products to be transported on U.S. vessels. Waivers may be granted on a case-by-case basis by the U.S. Maritime Administration. Supporters argue that maintaining U.S. flag vessels is crucial for national security and the commercial U.S.-flag merchant marine. Cargo preference is seen as a cost-efficient way to support a privately owned U.S.-flag fleet, leveraging transportation expenses to benefit the nation. Without this requirement, the government would need to duplicate sealift capacity at a high cost. These U.S.-flag vessels can also transport troops and military personnel. Critics argue that the U.S. shipping policy, including cargo preference requirements, may make U.S. goods less competitive in the global market. Compared to other G-7 ECAs, only France and Italy have similar cargo preference requirements to the Ex-Im Bank. U.S.-flagged shippers generally charge higher rates and face capacity constraints due to limited U.S. bulk cargo carriers. Some critics argue that U.S. shipping policy, including cargo preference requirements, can hinder the competitiveness of U.S. goods in the global market. Higher rates and scheduling challenges with U.S.-flagged vessels make it difficult for lenders and exporters to utilize Ex-Im Bank support. The cost of U.S. shipping can be significantly higher than non-U.S. shipping, leading to potential loss of business to foreign competitors. Obtaining a waiver from MARAD for the shipping requirement can be time-consuming and complex. Congress mandates that Ex-Im Bank support for export transactions must consider economic and environmental implications, ensuring no adverse effects on U.S. industry and employment. Ex-Im Bank-financed exports must undergo an economic impact assessment for transactions over $10 million or subject to trade measures. Projects that harm U.S. producers or violate trade measures are not supported. Environmental effects are considered in financing decisions. The Ex-Im Bank conducts environmental reviews for transactions over $10 million, which some U.S. exporters find burdensome. Denial of financing for projects that don't meet environmental requirements may hinder export and job opportunities, impacting competitiveness. The Ex-Im Bank is the only ECA in the G-7 to systematically publish environmental monitoring reports, including carbon accounting. It faces competition from less rigorous ECAs outside the OECD, like China. Debate surrounds balancing U.S. exporting interests with other policy considerations. The economic impact of Ex-Im Bank activities, particularly in financing Boeing aircraft exports to India, has been challenged by Delta Airlines and other U.S. airlines. They argue that this has led to an oversupply of airline seats, negatively affecting their businesses. Legal challenges have been filed against the Ex-Im Bank, with a pending case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The Ex-Im Bank has a Tied Aid Capital Projects Fund (TACPF) to counter foreign subsidized financing. The tied aid war chest has about $171 million and is funded by the Treasury Department. Applications for the fund are reviewed by the Treasury. The Ex-Im Bank's tied aid fund, funded by the Treasury Department, is subject to review. U.S. exporters express concerns about competitive disadvantage due to tied aid policies. Calls for increased flexibility and authority for the Ex-Im Bank to compete with foreign ECAs. Congressional directives mandate support for specific sectors like small businesses and \"green\" technologies. The Ex-Im Bank is mandated to support small businesses and \"green\" technologies through financing exports. Congressional directives require a minimum percentage of financing for these sectors, with supporters arguing it benefits strategic sectors and SMEs, while critics see it as government interference in the market. The Ex-Im Bank is mandated to support small businesses and \"green\" technologies through financing exports, with some stakeholders concerned about government interference in the market and the bank's budget constraints. Stakeholders also worry about the feasibility of meeting certain mandates, such as the 10% goal for supporting small businesses. The Ex-Im Bank aims to support environmentally-beneficial exports, but achieving the 10% goal may be challenging due to the disparity between expected authorizations and the value of renewable energy exports. Despite this, the Bank is committed to expanding its support for environmental exports. Stakeholders debate the effectiveness of the OECD Arrangement in leveling the playing field for exporters, with some estimates suggesting it saves U.S. taxpayers $800 million annually. The OECD Arrangement's minimum interest rate rules limit subsidized export financing and reduce competition based on below-cost interest. The OECD Arrangement limits subsidized export financing and reduces competition by imposing minimum interest rates and exposure fees for country risks. Critics argue it is ineffective in disciplining non-compliant OECD members. Some countries may be supporting export financing in developed countries, creating concerns about competitive disadvantages. There are questions about the relevance of the OECD Arrangement with the increasing official export credit activity of non-OECD countries. The OECD Arrangement limits subsidized export financing and reduces competition by imposing minimum interest rates and exposure fees for country risks. Critics argue it is ineffective in disciplining non-compliant OECD members. Some countries may be supporting export financing in developed countries, creating concerns about competitive disadvantages. In light of the growing official export credit activity of non-OECD members like China, Brazil, and India, the 112th Congress is considering reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank. Policy options include maintaining the Ex-Im Bank as an independent agency, reorganizing or privatizing its functions, or terminating it. Supporters argue that maintaining the Ex-Im Bank's current role would provide continuity, government backing, and avoid potential drawbacks. Critics suggest addressing issues of effectiveness and efficiency in promoting exports. President Obama proposed reorganizing federal entities involved in export promotion in 2012. President Obama proposed the consolidation of six federal entities, including the Ex-Im Bank, into one department to streamline the government. Congress could oversee the reorganization and work with the President on the proposal. Different approaches could be taken, such as consolidating all trade functions under one entity. President Obama proposed consolidating six federal entities, including the Ex-Im Bank, into a new \"Department of Trade\" or a centralized U.S. export credit agency. Proponents argue that consolidation could increase effectiveness and reduce costs, while critics fear it may create a large federal bureaucracy with little impact on expanding exports. Some stakeholders are concerned about the consolidation of trade functions, fearing that federal export assistance may not meet the specific needs of certain exporters. Congress may consider privatizing the functions of the Ex-Im Bank due to concerns about market competition and efficiency. Some stakeholders are concerned about privatizing the functions of the Ex-Im Bank, as it may shift costs and risks to the private sector. Critics argue that federal financing is crucial during financial crises and for certain export transactions, making them more commercially attractive. Additionally, they believe the government's role in addressing market failures is unique and necessary. The Ex-Im Bank faces potential challenges if privatized, including logistical issues and concerns about its impact on taxpayers and effectiveness in promoting exports. Business stakeholders support the Bank, believing it helps U.S. firms compete with foreign counterparts. Business stakeholders support the Ex-Im Bank, believing it helps U.S. firms compete with foreign counterparts. They argue for improvements in the Bank's programs and policies to enhance export support. Terminating the Bank may hinder the success of the National Export Initiative without federal government export financing. Congress may debate the length of time to extend the Bank's authority if reauthorized. The Ex-Im Bank's authority was extended through FY2011, with policy options for reauthorization time length including maintaining status quo, shorter extensions, longer extensions, or permanent reauthorization. Some policymakers argue for frequent reauthorizations for oversight, while others prefer longer-term planning. The Bank has never had its authority lapse, and if it did, it couldn't approve new authorizations but could fulfill existing obligations. Legislation for reauthorization typically includes improvements in programs and policies to support exports. The Ex-Im Bank's reauthorization legislation may include congressional directives and policy options. Congress may opt for a \"clean reauthorization\" without major policy changes, citing the Bank's historical effectiveness in supporting exports and jobs. Proponents argue that the current balance of stakeholder interests is fair and adjustments are unnecessary. Congress could potentially revise the Ex-Im Bank's policies related to credit and insurance activities, as well as consider changes to address stakeholder concerns and enhance the Bank's core mission of boosting U.S. exports and jobs. Additionally, Congress may review policies related to U.S. labor interests, environmental protection, and foreign policy objectives. Congress could potentially revise the Ex-Im Bank's policies related to domestic and foreign content, cargo preference requirements, economic and environmental impact assessments, tied aid war chest, and congressional mandates. This could include broadening the definition of \"national content\" and transforming economic and environmental considerations into positive requirements. Other limitations on the Bank, such as the total credit exposure ceiling and notification threshold to Congress, could also be examined and revised. Congress may need to strike a balance between export promotion and other policy goals when considering changes to Ex-Im Bank policies. The competitive international ECA landscape presents new challenges for the Bank, requiring potential revisions to international disciplines. The international disciplines guiding ECA activity may need to be updated to reflect current trends. Congress could direct the United States to encourage greater engagement by the OECD with non-OECD emerging market economies, negotiate rules to limit ECA financing in other developed countries, and pursue a greater role for the WTO in disciplining international ECA activity. Supporters believe this could level the playing field for U.S. exporters, while skeptics argue that changes may be slow to materialize due to the complex nature of negotiations. One possible avenue for Congress to enhance the United States's understanding of the global competitiveness context in which the Ex-Im Bank and U.S. exporters operate is to revise the Ex-Im Bank's annual competitiveness report. This could include directing changes to enhance the comparative analysis with more comprehensive data on the Bank's performance compared to other ECAs. Additional requirements may provide a more informed analysis of the Ex-Im Bank's competitive position. Skeptics may argue against these changes. Reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank has become a more controversial debate in Congress, with divergent interests of various Members and stakeholders. Business groups seek a longer-term increase in the Bank's authority, while some companies argue that the Bank's activities place them at a commercial disadvantage. Critics view the Bank as a form of official international export credit competition. The 112th Congress passed H.R. 2072, extending the Export-Import Bank's authority through FY2014 and increasing its lending authority. Critics question the Bank's role in export promotion and financing. The Export-Import Bank is required to submit a report to Congress if the rate exceeds 2% and develop guidelines for economic impact analyses. The Bank must also provide notice and comment for transactions over $100 million, negotiate to reduce export subsidies, and report annually on progress. Additionally, negotiations are required to eliminate aircraft export credit financing by state-sponsored entities. The Bank must review its national content policy, considering factors like costs of U.S. production, competitiveness with foreign ECAs, impact on U.S. workforce, recommendations of Advisory Committee, and incentives for U.S. operations and jobs. The GAO will analyze the Bank's methodology for calculating U.S. job creation. Transactions with persons must self-certify no sanctionable activities related to Iran. The Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, and part 560 of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations require certification for engaging in sanctionable activity with Iran to prohibit Ex-Im Bank financing unless waived by the President. Additionally, up to 1.25% of the Bank's surplus during FY2012-FY2014 can be used for updating information technology systems, increasing textile industry representation on the Advisory Committee, extending the Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee, and enhancing reporting requirements. The final version of H.R. 2072 passed by Congress reflects amendments related to the Bank's exposure limit, risk management, and support for small businesses. The bill was introduced on June 1, 2011, and passed after a bipartisan compromise on May 4, 2012. Amendments included extending the Bank's authority, increasing the exposure cap, and conducting international negotiations on export credit financing. The House and Senate passed an amended version of H.R. 2072, with the Senate rejecting five proposed amendments related to Ex-Im Bank activities. The final bill included amendments on the Bank's exposure limit, risk management, and support for small businesses. The Senate rejected proposed amendments related to Ex-Im Bank activities, including restrictions on loan subordination, financing of certain fossil fuel projects, and extension of credit for renewable energy projects in foreign countries. Additionally, an amendment would have capped the Ex-Im Bank's lending authority at $100 billion until international negotiations were initiated by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury certified initiation of international negotiations to eliminate export financing programs. The Senate considered S. 1547 for Ex-Im Bank reauthorization, increasing lending authority to $140 billion by FY2015. The final version of H.R. 2072 included provisions from the Senate legislation. The final version of H.R. 2072 includes enhanced transparency and accountability requirements for the Ex-Im Bank, restrictions against companies doing business with Iran, and revised domestic content requirements. Several other pieces of legislation were considered to extend the Bank's authority, including S.Amdt. 1836 (Cantwell) and H.R. 4302 (Larsen), but a cloture motion on the amendment did not pass. Legislation was also introduced to terminate the Ex-Im Bank (H.R. 4268). Legislation was introduced in Congress to terminate the Ex-Im Bank (H.R. 4268, Amash)."
