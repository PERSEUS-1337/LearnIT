    "title": "SB 545",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3008 of the Public Resources Code is amended to define \"well\" as any oil or gas well, including those for injection, disposal, or storage, and \"prospect well\" as a well drilled to extend a field or explore a new reservoir. An active observation well gathers reservoir data at least once every three years. An idle well has not been used for production or injection for six consecutive months in the last five years. A long-term idle well has not been used for production or injection for six consecutive months in the last 10 years. The Public Resources Code defines \"enhanced oil recovery method\" as processes to extract oil from reservoirs, and \"confidential well\" as an exploratory well with confidential records. Section 3106 is amended to authorize the exploration and production of hydrocarbons, including drilling and stimulation. The Public Resources Code authorizes various activities related to oil and gas production in a manner that prevents damage to life, health, property, and natural resources, as well as loss of oil, gas, or reservoir energy. This includes drilling, stimulation, enhanced oil recovery methods, well completion techniques, operation, maintenance, and abandonment of wells, tanks, and facilities within oil and gas fields. The Public Resources Code authorizes activities related to oil and gas production to prevent damage and loss. The supervisor may allow methods to increase hydrocarbon recovery, declaring it a state policy to grant rights to explore and remove hydrocarbons. The Public Resources Code authorizes activities related to oil and gas production to prevent damage and loss. Methods to increase hydrocarbon recovery may be approved by the supervisor, ensuring the best interests of the lessor, lessee, and the state are considered. This includes injecting fluids, applying pressure or heat, and creating new channels for hydrocarbon movement, with approved methods not imposing a legal duty on the lessee or contractor. The supervisor may require monitoring programs for detecting releases from aboveground oil production tanks and facilities. This is administered in accordance with Chapter 4.5 of the Government Code. Section 3203 of the Public Resources Code is amended. Before drilling a well, the operator must submit a detailed application outlining the methods and practices to be used, including well stimulation treatments and enhanced oil recovery methods. Approval must be obtained from the supervisor or district deputy, ensuring minimal risk to public health and safety. If drilling does not begin within a year of approval, the application is considered canceled unless an extension is requested and granted by the supervisor. The operator must submit a detailed application before drilling a well, including methods and practices to be used. Approval from the supervisor is required, and an extension may be granted in writing if drilling does not begin within a year of approval. The application should contain necessary data on approved forms provided by the division. Additional information may be requested by the supervisor. After drilling a well, this section also applies to deepening, redrilling, plugging, or altering casing. Approval is needed to change the well's number or designation. If an operator fails to comply with a supervisor's order, approval for proposed well operations may be denied until compliance is met. Failure to pay civil penalties or remedy violations may also result in denial of approval. Applications and approvals by the supervisor or district deputy must be posted on the division's website. Section 3215.5 of the Public Resources Code requires operators to report any loss of well integrity to the water quality control board within five days. Section 3234 states that well records are public under the California Public Records Act. Operators must request in writing to keep well records confidential, providing a detailed explanation. The supervisor will then decide whether to grant confidential status, with both the request and decision being public records. The confidential period for onshore wells is up to two years, and for offshore wells, up to three years from the end of drilling operations. The division's well records can be inspected by authorized individuals, with confidentiality potentially extended for up to six months in certain circumstances. Once the confidentiality period ends, all well records must be posted on the division's website. Well records become public when the lease expires or is terminated. The production reports filed under Section 3227 are open for inspection by the State Board of Equalization, its representatives, and the county assessor. Well records do not include experimental logs or interpretive data. Cessation of drilling operations is when drilling machinery is removed from the well site. Section 3450 of the Public Resources Code is repealed and a new Section 3450 is added. Section 3450 of the Public Resources Code allows oil producers' committees to issue recommendations to the supervisor regarding oil and gas exploration and production, with the condition that copies of the recommendations are delivered to the supervisor and the committee provides access to its records. The supervisor may express disapproval of any recommendation received. The division is required to post these recommendations on its website. The supervisor may issue recommendations on oil and gas exploration if deemed necessary. Oil producers are not obligated to comply with the supervisor's disapproval or recommendation. Production of oil or gas must not violate the division's regulations. Section 3451 of the Public Resources Code is repealed. Section 3451 of the Public Resources Code is repealed. No reimbursement is required by this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
