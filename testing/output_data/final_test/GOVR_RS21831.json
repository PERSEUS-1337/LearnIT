Actions were taken to address citizens' concerns, reduce lead exposure, identify the cause of the issue, and assess water quality in other cities. The EPA conducted a national review of lead monitoring from 2000 to 2003, finding that 3.6% of systems serving over 50,000 people exceeded the action level for lead. Since 2000, EPA found that 3.6% of water systems serving over 50,000 people exceeded the lead action level of 15 ppb. Additionally, 3.4% of systems serving 3,300 to 50,000 people reported exceeding the action level. In both size categories, the majority of systems had lead levels below 5 ppb. Several Members of Congress raised concerns about possible manipulation of lead monitoring data by water systems to avoid noncompliance with the lead rule. EPA announced that enforcement actions would be taken if utilities provided false data. EPA also determined that systems needed more guidance for collecting samples and calculating lead levels for compliance. In November, EPA issued a memorandum clarifying these requirements. Lead exposure is a major environmental health threat to young children, affecting their nervous systems and development. The CDC set a blood lead level of concern at 10 \u03bcg/dl in 1991, but recent studies show negative effects at levels below that. Lead can also increase blood pressure in adults and is commonly found in older homes with leaded paint and soil. EPA issued a memorandum in November clarifying compliance requirements for the lead rule. Lead exposure is widespread in the environment, found in older homes with leaded paint, soil, plumbing materials, pottery glazes, and pewter. The main sources for children are house dust from lead-based paint and contaminated soil. EPA estimates 10-20% of lead exposure may come from drinking water, with lead service lines, solder, and pipes being common sources. New homes are also at risk due to lead plumbing fixtures. New homes, including those labeled as \"lead-free,\" may still have lead pipes, joints, and solder that can leach lead into drinking water. Corrosion of these materials is the main cause of lead contamination in water. The Safe Drinking Water Act sets regulations to limit contaminants in public water supplies, including enforceable standards like maximum contaminant levels (MCL). EPA may establish treatment techniques if determining contaminant levels is not feasible. EPA may establish treatment techniques instead of maximum contaminant levels (MCL) to determine contaminant levels. Every six years, EPA reviews and revises drinking water regulations. In 1991, the Lead and Copper Rule replaced an outdated interim lead standard of 50 parts per billion (ppb). EPA had proposed lowering the MCL for lead to 5 ppb and implementing corrosion control to reduce lead in water, but faced concerns about the proposed rule. The 1991 Lead and Copper Rule established a treatment technique (corrosion control) to prevent lead and copper from leaching into drinking water, instead of setting an enforceable standard (MCL) for lead in tap water. Other requirements included tap water monitoring, public education, source water treatment, and lead service line replacement. Some concerns were raised about the potential confusion among the public and regulated community if an MCL for source water was set in addition to a treatment technique for corrosion control. The 1991 Lead and Copper Rule established a treatment technique (corrosion control) to prevent lead and copper from leaching into drinking water. Large water systems were required to conduct corrosion control studies and recommend optimal treatment, while smaller systems had to optimize corrosion control based on monitoring results. The rule also set a lead \"action level\" of 15 ppb at the tap. The Lead and Copper Rule set an action level of 15 ppb for lead in tap water samples, with monitoring requirements based on system size and previous testing results. Systems exceeding the action level in more than 10% of samples must provide an EPA-developed public education program within 60 days. Monitoring frequency can be reduced based on lead levels, with potential for annual or triennial testing. The water system has 60 days to deliver an EPA-developed public education program to customers about lead's health effects, sources, and steps to reduce exposure. They must offer to sample tap water upon request, and if lead levels remain high, they must replace 7% of lead service lines annually. States can oversee water system compliance with federal regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA Region 3 oversees water systems in the District of Columbia, including the Washington Aqueduct and DC Water and Sewer Authority. EPA reported that WASA exceeded the action level for lead in tap water multiple times since 1992. Changes in treatment processes at the Washington Aqueduct led to elevated lead levels in tap water. The switch to chloramines in 2000 caused increased lead leaching from pipes. A new corrosion control process using orthophosphate was tested in June with positive results, approved by EPA in August. The EPA approved a new corrosion control process using orthophosphate for the Washington Aqueduct to reduce lead leaching in pipes. WASA failed to comply with lead rule requirements, leading to a consent agreement with EPA for improvements. High lead levels in DC tap water prompted blood testing for residents, with 40 children showing elevated levels out of 1,954 screened individuals. A recent CDC analysis found 40 children with elevated lead levels in Washington, DC, with most living in homes without lead service lines. Homes of children with high lead levels had dust and/or soil lead levels exceeding federal guidelines. Despite high lead levels in tap water, residents living in homes with the highest lead levels did not show elevated blood lead levels. This raised concerns about the adequacy of the lead rule and its enforcement. During the 108th Congress, hearings were held to address concerns about the lead rule's effectiveness in protecting public health. Issues raised included inadequate monitoring, allowing some samples to exceed lead levels without action, and lack of homeowner notification of monitoring results. The lead rule does not require systems to notify homeowners of monitoring results, allows 15 years to replace lead service lines, and is not enforceable like an MCL. Critics are concerned about delays in response to high lead levels and potential undetected lead problems nationwide. EPA is reviewing the rule's effectiveness, implementation, and enforcement, focusing on public notification, monitoring, and lead service line replacement requirements. In October 2004, the agency announced a national data review of 73,000 water samples. In October 2004, EPA found that lead in drinking water is not widespread but systems need guidance for lead sampling compliance. EPA issued guidance to clarify requirements and offered workshops to improve compliance. S. 2550, a water infrastructure funding bill, addressed lead contamination. In the 109th Congress, discussions on water infrastructure financing legislation could address lead contamination, as seen in the Safe Drinking Water Act implementation and issues brief."
