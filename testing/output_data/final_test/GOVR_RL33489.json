    "content": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) was established in June 1870 with the Attorney General as its head. It has since grown to include 40 agencies, such as the FBI, DEA, ATF, USMS, and BOP, which work to prevent crime, prosecute offenders, and provide confinement for convicted federal offenders. The litigating divisions enforce federal laws, and the Office of Justice Programs focuses on community policing. The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office provide grant funds for crime prevention and intervention programs. OJP, overseen by the Assistant Attorney General, awards grants to states, local governments, and nonprofit organizations to prevent and control crime, improve criminal justice systems, and assist victims of crime. The Assistant Attorney General coordinates OJP's efforts to meet its mission through five bureaus and two program offices. The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) provides leadership and assistance for local criminal justice strategies to achieve safer communities by offering funding, training, and technical assistance. BJA awards formula grants to state and local governments through its Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program. NIJ is the research, evaluation, and development agency for the DOJ, focusing on advancing scientific research to enhance justice and public safety. NIJ sponsors research and development through grants to external organizations and conducts internal evaluations for the DOJ. OJJDP awards grants to states and localities to improve their juvenile justice system, including formula grants through the JABG program and Title V grant program. OJJDP also sponsors research, evaluation, and training programs to promote delinquency prevention. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) provides evaluation, statistics, technical assistance, and training programs for delinquency prevention and response to juvenile violence. BJS collects, analyzes, and disseminates data on crime and criminal justice to assist in combating crime and improving justice administration. They also offer technical assistance to governments to enhance their statistical capabilities. The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) provides federal funds for victim compensation and assistance programs nationwide, along with training. The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) provides federal funds for victim compensation and assistance programs nationwide, training for professionals, publications, and projects to enhance victims' rights and services. OVC uses discretionary funds for training and technical assistance to improve victim service providers' skills. The Crime Victims Fund, established by the Victims of Crime Act, funds OVC programs through donations and private gifts authorized by the USA-PATRIOT Act. The Community Capacity Development Office (CCDO) oversees the Weed and Seed Program, working with local communities to deter crime and promote neighborhood revitalization. The Community Capacity Development Office (CCDO) works to deter crime and revitalize neighborhoods by developing, evaluating, and implementing policies. CCDO also hosts the Office of Weed and Seed Strategies and the American Indian and Alaska Native Affairs Desk for funding opportunities and information access. The SMART Office, authorized by the Adam Walsh Act, administers sex offender standards. The SMART Office, established by the Adam Walsh Act, oversees sex offender registration and notification standards. It offers technical assistance and grants for tracking offenders. The COPS program, created under the '94 Crime Act, aims to promote community policing by providing grants to law enforcement agencies for hiring and training officers. The DOJ grant programs discussed include Weed and Seed, Drug Court Discretionary Grant program, Prisoner Re-entry Initiative, President's DNA Initiative, Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant program, Kirk Bloodsworth Post-conviction DNA Testing program, Paul Coverdell Grant program, assistance to Indian tribes, and Tribal Law Enforcement Assistance. This report excludes other discretionary grant programs administered by OJP and COPS, as well as the Justice Assistance Grant Program and grant programs administered by OVW and the Office of Victims of Crime. The Weed and Seed program, authorized by the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005, has been receiving funding since FY1993. Funding for the program has fluctuated over the past five fiscal years, with approximately $58 million in funding in FY2004. The Weed and Seed program received $58 million in FY2004, increased to $62 million in FY2005 (6% increase), decreased to $50 million in FY2006 (19% decrease), remained the same in FY2007, and decreased by 35% in FY2008. The program funds Weed and Seed Communities to implement their strategy overseen by a steering committee aiming to reduce crime and drug abuse. The Weed and Seed strategy aims to reduce crime, drug abuse, and gang activity through law enforcement, community policing, prevention, intervention, and neighborhood restoration. The strategy involves \"weeding\" and \"seeding\" activities that must complement each other to improve public safety and the neighborhood. In FY2007, CCDO changed the way it funds WSCs, requiring them to submit a notice of intent to apply for funding and develop a strategy within one year. The Weed and Seed strategy aims to reduce crime, drug abuse, and gang activity through law enforcement, community policing, prevention, intervention, and neighborhood restoration. Sites selected for funding will receive up to $1 million over a five-year period, with funding levels following a bell curve design. Continued funding is contingent upon meeting performance measures. Funding for the Drug Court program decreased each fiscal year between FY2005 and FY2007, with funding in FY2004 at $38.5 million and increasing to $40 million in FY2005. In FY2006, funding for the Drug Court program decreased to $10 million, a 75% decrease from FY2005. Funding remained the same in FY2007 but increased by 54% in FY2008 to $15.2 million. Drug courts aim to reduce recidivism and substance abuse among nonviolent offenders through supervised treatment, drug testing, and community supervision. Drug courts funded by BJA must only include nonviolent offenders. The Prisoner Re-entry Initiative, authorized by the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, received funding since FY2001. Funding for the initiative fluctuated over the years, with $5 million in FY2004, $10 million in FY2005, $5 million in FY2006, and approximately $15 million in FY2007. In FY2007, funding for the Prisoner Re-entry Initiative increased by 197% compared to the previous year, reaching $11.75 million in FY2008, a 21% decrease. The initiative is a collaborative effort between multiple government departments and provides funding to states and tribes to develop re-entry strategies for non-violent offenders transitioning back into their communities after incarceration. The Prisoner Re-entry Initiative provides offenders with individual re-entry plans in three phases: preparation while incarcerated, support before and after release, and connection to community services post-supervision. Programs include education, job training, mentoring, and substance abuse treatment. President Bush announced the DNA Initiative, \"Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology,\" providing funds, training, and assistance to enhance DNA technology for solving crimes, protecting the innocent, and identifying missing persons. The initiative received $100 million annually from FY2004 to FY2007, with a peak of $110 million in FY2005 and a decrease to $108.5 million in FY2006. Funding increased to $112 million in FY2007. In FY2008, Congress did not appropriate funds for the President's DNA Initiative, which aimed to eliminate backlogs of unanalyzed DNA samples, improve crime labs' capacity, stimulate research, provide training, access to DNA testing, and protect the innocent. The DNA Initiative funded by Congress aims to protect the innocent using DNA technology. Grant funds are administered by NIJ and awarded to state and local governments for capacity enhancement, reducing DNA backlogs, and solving cold cases with DNA. Grant recipients must have accredited crime labs or undergo external audits to ensure compliance with DNA Quality Assurance Standards. Grant funds can be used for purchasing equipment, software, evidence collection kits, supplies, and renovations to improve forensic DNA analysis. Recipients must have accredited labs or undergo audits to comply with FBI standards. NIJ grants can be used for training, hiring employees for DNA analysis, and validating new methodologies. States can use the funds to analyze offender DNA samples in-house or outsource to private labs. All offender profiles generated with NIJ funds must be included in CODIS. NIJ grants can be used for analyzing convicted offender DNA samples, paying for overtime for laboratory staff involved in analysis, and covering administrative expenses related to the project. State and local crime labs must be accredited or undergo external audits to receive grants. The grants are used to reduce backlogs in analyzing forensic DNA casework samples. Backlog Reduction grants are used to analyze backlogged forensic DNA casework samples from sexual assaults, murders, and kidnappings. The analysis can be done by a government-owned or accredited fee-for-service lab. Funds can also be used for post-conviction DNA testing. Eligible DNA profiles must be included in CODIS. Funds can be used for purchasing supplies, paying overtime for staff, hiring consultants, and contracting with vendors for DNA analyses. NIJ awards grants to state and local governments to support law enforcement agencies in conducting DNA analysis on violent crime \"cold cases\" that can be solved through DNA testing. Grant funds can be used for personnel, travel, laboratory supplies, and DNA analysis by accredited labs. All eligible DNA profiles developed with program funds must be included in CODIS. In FY2008, Congress appropriated $147.4 million for the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant program, originally authorized by the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000. The program was expanded by the Justice for All Act, allowing grants for DNA analyses of samples from crime scenes, including rape kits, to be included in the national DNA database. The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant program aims to increase laboratory capacity for DNA analysis, collect DNA samples from individuals under legal authority, and ensure timely testing of samples from crimes, including sexual assault. The Attorney General distributes grant funds to maximize the use of DNA technology for crime fighting purposes and allocate grants fairly among states and local governments. The Attorney General distributes grants to address backlogs in jurisdictions with DNA analysis needs based on offender and casework samples, population, and violent crimes. States receive a minimum allocation of 0.50% of the total funding, while territories receive 0.125%. Funding for the Kirk Bloodsworth Post-conviction DNA Testing program has been consistent since FY2006. The Kirk Bloodsworth DNA Post-conviction DNA Testing program, authorized by the Justice for All Act (P.L. 108-405), provides grants to states for post-conviction DNA testing programs. States must demonstrate eligibility by offering DNA testing for convicted individuals, ensuring a process for resolving claims of innocence. The Justice for All Act authorizes the Kirk Bloodsworth DNA Post-conviction DNA Testing program, providing grants to states for DNA testing of convicted individuals. States must offer post-conviction DNA testing and preserve biological evidence to allow applicants to apply for relief if testing excludes them. The Paul Coverdell Grant program, authorized by the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act of 2000, has seen an increase in funding since FY2004. Funding for Coverdell grants has generally increased, with Congress appropriating $10 million in FY2004, $15 million in FY2005, and $18.5 million in FY2006. Funding remained consistent in FY2007. In FY2008, funding for Coverdell grants increased to $18.8 million. These grants are awarded to state and local governments to improve forensic sciences in laboratories. 75% of the total funding is awarded to eligible states based on population percentage, with a minimum allocation for each state. The remaining funds are awarded competitively to both state and local governments. Eligibility requires a certification of a developed forensic science plan. The certification for state or local governments must include a plan to improve forensic science services, ensure labs use accepted practices, and limit grant funds for new facilities under the Coverdell law. The Coverdell law sets limitations on examiner services, requires independent investigations into misconduct, and mandates the use of grant funds to improve forensic science services and eliminate backlogs. Assistance to Indian tribes has increased almost every fiscal year since FY2004, with funding for Correctional Facilities on Tribal Lands, Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse, and Tribal Courts Assistance programs. Funding for Indian tribes was $15 million in FY2004, increased to $18 million in FY2005 (20% increase), and further increased to $22 million in FY2006 (22% increase). In FY2005, Indian tribes received $22 million, a 22% increase from FY2004. Congress allocated $22.4 million in FY2007 for Assistance to Indian tribes. The Correctional Facilities on Tribal Lands program, authorized by P.L. 104-134, provides grants to 23 Native American tribes for constructing correctional facilities. The Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse program awards grants to tribes for planning and addressing substance abuse issues. The Abuse program awards grants to Native American and Alaskan Native tribes to implement strategies for reducing crime related to alcohol and substance abuse. Grant funds are used to develop advisory teams, apprehend offenders, prevent crimes, collaborate with justice agencies, and provide culturally appropriate treatment services. Grant funds can be used to improve existing programs or develop new ones for prevention and treatment of substance abuse. The Tribal Court Assistance program, authorized by the Indian Tribal Justice Technical and Legal Assistance Act of 2000, promotes collaboration between law enforcement, courts, treatment providers, and the community to address crime related to alcohol and substance abuse. Grants are awarded to support the development, implementation, and enhancement of tribal court systems, including planning and implementing intertribal court systems for smaller service populations. Grant funds are used to facilitate the development and initial implementation of inter-tribal court systems, single-tribe court systems for tribes with over 1,000 people, and to enhance or continue the operation of existing tribal courts, regardless of size. The Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) aims to support tribal court structures, case management, personnel training, tribal code development, equipment acquisition, prosecution, defense, probation programs, juvenile services, and inter-tribal appellate systems. Funding for TRGP decreased from $25 million in FY2004 to $15 million in FY2006. In FY2008, Congress appropriated approximately $15 million for the Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP), a 5% decrease compared to FY2007. TRGP is administered by the COPS Office and provides funding to help tribes meet their law enforcement needs, including hiring officers, training, purchasing equipment, and vehicles. Some have questioned the effectiveness of DOJ grant programs and called for program evaluations. The DOJ has responded to calls for program evaluations by requiring federal agencies to submit performance plans and report on program performance. Grantees are now required to collect and report output and outcome data, with some programs being evaluated by the DOJ and GAO. As Congress decides on anti-crime assistance funding, the effectiveness of these programs remains an ongoing issue. Grant management has been identified as one of DOJ's top ten management challenges since 2000. Grant management is listed as one of DOJ's top ten management challenges due to various issues such as grantees not submitting reports, deficiencies in monitoring grantee activities, delays in awarding grants, and significant findings in audits. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of monitoring OJP and COPS grants. In a 2003 audit, structural overlaps and inefficiencies were found in grant programs between the COPS Office and OJP. A 2004 report highlighted issues with the Weed and Seed grant program, including problems with grant monitoring and progress reporting. In 2005, NIJ failed to enforce certification requirements, and OJP, COPS, and OVW were ineffective in monitoring grants to tribal governments. The DOJ's Inspector General found that tribal grantees did not submit necessary reports for grant assessment and monitoring of fund utilization. The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 addressed these issues by creating the Office of Audit, Assessment, and Management in OJP. This office ensures grants undergo performance audits and comply with DOJ standards. The act also established the CCDO to provide training on grant program requirements. The CRS reports cover various topics such as juvenile justice, victims of crime compensation, DNA testing for law enforcement, the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program, community-oriented policing services, immigration issues, and the Violence Against Women Act."
