The \"United States Army Relief Act of 2005\" includes findings by Congress regarding the Army's tasks of homeland defense, deterring aggression, conducting military operations in different regions, and winning decisively in major campaigns. General Richard Myers emphasized the Army's need to win decisively in one theater even when engaged in multiple contingencies. Congress supports the Administration's efforts to reduce demands on ground forces through transformation. The recent experiences of the Army in Iraq highlight the need for sufficient troops for post-conflict missions. The current force requirements in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other areas are unsustainable and hinder the execution of the National Military Strategy. Despite the heavy burden, the nation must remain engaged in world affairs to defend its interests and protect the defenseless. The Army's engagement in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Middle East is described as \"generational\" by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The Army is currently overused, with approximately 499,000 active duty troops, backed up by nearly 700,000 members of the Army National Guard and Reserve. This is a third less than the force level during the first Persian Gulf War in 1991. Around 150,000 troops are in Iraq, 10,000 in Afghanistan, 1,700 in Kosovo, and 37,000 on the Korean peninsula. The Army's active-duty force is stretched thin due to the total number of troops and operational demands, leading to a lack of strategic balance and resiliency. Former Army officials have expressed concerns about the Army being too small to fulfill its current missions effectively. The Army's active-duty force is at risk of being significantly damaged or even breaking in the next five years due to too few troops. The Reserve force is also being spread too thin, rapidly degenerating into a 'broken force' and unable to meet missions abroad or domestically. The Chief of the United States Army Reserve expressed deepening concern about the overuse of troops, which hampers mission completion and impacts homeland security. The strain on first responders who are also National Guard or Reserve members is unacceptable during a time of terrorism threats. Increasing the Army's end-strength is necessary. An increase of 100,000 troops over the permanently authorized level for the Army for fiscal year 2004 of 482,000 troops is in the best interests of the United States and consistent with Congress's duties. Progress was made with a 20,000 troop increase in fiscal year 2005. An increase in the permanent authorized end-strength for the Army of 80,000 troops is necessary to address personnel issues and enable optimal troop rotation schedules for stabilization operations like Iraq. This proposal is supported by testimony from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office in November 2003. An increase in the permanent authorized end-strength for the Army is proposed, with specific numbers specified for each fiscal year starting from 2006. The goal is to address personnel issues and enable optimal troop rotation schedules for stabilization operations like Iraq."
