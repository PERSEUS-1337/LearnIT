    "content": "The Bush Administration announced plans for an \"administrative PAYGO\" process in February 2005, alongside a legislative proposal to restore aspects of statutory PAYGO. This internal review process required agencies to propose offsetting administrative decisions to reduce mandatory spending. The OMB process differed from statutory PAYGO in various ways, including the budget process stages, actors involved, and transparency to Congress and the public. The OMB May 2005 memorandum issued by then-OMB Director Bolten required agencies to follow steps to restrain Federal spending growth by offsetting administrative decisions to reduce mandatory spending. This process aimed to increase transparency into OMB's actions. The OMB May 2005 memorandum required agencies to offset administrative decisions to reduce mandatory spending, defining \"administrative actions\" and \"increase in mandatory spending.\" The memorandum aimed to increase transparency and involve OMB in agencies' decision-making processes. The OMB May 2005 memorandum required agencies to provide projections of mandatory spending relative to the President's budget request. Agencies had to list planned actions that would increase mandatory spending in their budget submissions to OMB. The OMB May 2005 memorandum mandated agencies to inform OMB of any planned administrative actions that would raise mandatory spending. Agencies were also required to propose additional administrative actions that would offset the increase in mandatory spending. The OMB May 2005 memorandum required agencies to propose administrative actions to offset any increase in mandatory spending. Requests for exceptions to this requirement would need to come from the agency head and be granted by the OMB Director only in extraordinary circumstances. An agency head could appeal to the Budget Review Board, or if an action is required by law, the agency's general counsel must provide an opinion. All materials submitted to OMB should include cost estimates provided by the agency's chief actuary or budget officer. The OMB May 2005 memorandum required agencies to propose administrative actions to offset any increase in mandatory spending. If OMB deems an offset inappropriate, they may request alternative offsets or return the action to the agency for reconsideration. This process is similar to OIRA's review of agencies' proposed and final rules. During the Bush Administration, OMB's May 2005 memorandum influenced agencies' actions through return letters. The memorandum's controls were briefly cited in Circular No. A-11 and included in presidential budget requests. After President Obama took office, the Obama Administration indicated its continuation. After President Obama took office in 2009, the Obama Administration indicated it would continue implementing the OMB memorandum's procedures. Ranking Member Paul Ryan questioned OMB Director Peter R. Orszag about the memorandum's process and baseline changes. Director Orszag confirmed the Administration's support for the OMB process and its implementation in the President's FY2010 budget. Director Orszag confirmed the Administration's support for implementing the OMB memorandum's procedures in the President's FY2010 budget proposal, with some exceptions for waiving Administrative PAYGO. The upcoming FY2010 Analytical Perspectives volume will provide information on the budgetary impact of regulations and baseline assumptions. However, without greater transparency, it may be challenging to identify all planned changes in mandatory spending resulting from the OMB process. The OMB memorandum from May 2005 formalized activities within OMB's Resource Management Offices, but information about its scope and effects is not publicly available. OMB considers proceedings and communications regarding the process to be pre-decisional and restricted. The OMB memorandum from May 2005 formalized activities within OMB's Resource Management Offices, with proceedings and communications considered pre-decisional and subject to restrictions. The memorandum emphasizes policy consistency between the President's Budget and materials for Congress and the media, with statutory provisions limiting agency officers and employees from submitting certain requests to Congress without specific requests from either House. Congress has legislated exceptions to this restriction, but little is publicly known about the memorandum's widespread use and consistency across agencies and policy areas. The OMB memorandum from May 2005 formalized activities within OMB's Resource Management Offices, emphasizing policy consistency between the President's Budget and materials for Congress. The memorandum's effects and implications have not been fully addressed, leading to potential issues for Congress. OMB's controls on mandatory spending programs were observed during the implementation of the Conservation Reserve Program in the USDA. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a federal land retirement program enacted in 1985, aiming to keep sensitive cropland out of production for ten or more years. The 2008 farm bill allows USDA to enroll up to 32 million acres at a time, with funding from the Commodity Credit Corporation. Congressional jurisdiction for CRP resides in the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture. Despite statutory authority and funding, obstacles outlined in OMB's 2005 memorandum have hindered USDA's ability to reach the enrollment goal. In 2010, a USDA official acknowledged obstacles imposed by OMB's process on agency action, specifically regarding the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The Bush Administration's application of the OMB process was tied to agency actions concerning the CRP, with spending reductions from changes to the federal crop insurance program used as offsets for CRP funding. Previous administrations also made efforts to modify the CRP program, requiring offsets and tradeoffs to pay for programs. The previous Administration made efforts to modify the CRP program, requiring offsets to pay for programs. However, due to changes in assumptions and budget allocations, the program was not implemented, resulting in lost savings. In an attempt to extend expiring CRP contracts, assumptions about future CRP signup were made to secure funding. As the focus shifts to maximizing CRP participation this year, there is a need for about $300 million in administratively required PAYGO offsets. The USDA baseline did not have enough funding to enroll additional acres in the CRP program, limiting program activity. There was a discrepancy between USDA and CBO baseline assumptions for CRP enrollment from 2011 to 2014, causing tension between Congress and the Administration. The tension between Congress and USDA/OMB arises from the requirement to offset additional CRP enrollment to reach the 32 million acre cap. OMB's process appears to demand offsets in other mandatory programs for increasing CRP acres, impacting USDA's ability to implement authorized initiatives without finding offsets first. During the Bush Administration, OMB's process affected CRP funding by reallocating funds for an Open Access initiative that was never implemented. The freed-up funds were later allocated to deficit reduction instead of CRP during the presidential transition. In the Obama Administration, offsets were required again when USDA wanted to increase CRP enrollment, which became more transparent during the renegotiation of the SRA for the federal crop insurance program. The final SRA agreement for the federal crop insurance program includes $2 billion in savings to strengthen risk management and conservation programs, with $4 billion allocated to reduce the national deficit. Investments will be made in Farm Bill programs such as expanding insurance products, providing discounts for certain producers, increasing CRP acreage, and funding new conservation initiatives. The House Agriculture Committee expressed concern over the use of funds for CRP monitoring, questioning the decision to cap CRP acreage below authorized levels and redirect funds to the Open Access program. This raised issues with OMB's process and potential need for a hearing. The House Agriculture Committee raised concerns about OMB redirecting funds from CRP monitoring to the Open Access program, undermining the authority of authorizing committees. USDA pledged to cooperate with Congress and provide information. The budgetary offsets used by the Administration may impact the official CBO baseline used by Congress. The Administration's savings from the renegotiation of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement for crop insurance may affect the CBO baseline used by Congress. There is uncertainty about the amount of savings and how it will be reinvested into farm bill programs. Members of Congress, especially those on the Agriculture committees, are closely monitoring these developments. Some Members of Congress, particularly those on Agriculture committees, are concerned that USDA actions may reduce funds available for writing the next farm bill in 2012. They worry about preserving the CBO baseline to make decisions on reallocating funds within the agricultural budget or complying with directives to reduce the deficit. The Agriculture committees could make similar reductions to crop insurance, with savings potentially available for legislative offsets through statutory PAYGO. The OMB process for mandatory spending programs may have been inconsistently implemented across agencies and programs, lacking transparency on its usage and enforcement. It is unclear if the process has effectively contained increases in spending. The OMB process may impact program outputs and outcomes, such as enrollment numbers and services provided. It could also create administrative burdens for federal agencies when proposing actions for OMB review. The OMB process requires federal agencies to develop cost estimates for actions and determine if they are required by law. This could increase workload and shift focus away from other tasks. Agencies may alter their behavior if they struggle to find offsets, potentially leading them to avoid costly actions, regardless of merit or congressional intent. The lack of transparency in OMB's process may also impact agency decisions. The OMB's recent efforts to control agency mandatory spending may lead to reluctance in discussing policy options with Congress. The balance of power between Congress, the President, and the courts is crucial as they compete for agency control. The expansion of the administrative state has granted agencies more discretion, prompting ongoing congressional interest. In response to the expansion of the administrative state, Congress has shown ongoing interest in monitoring agency discretion and presidential influence through the establishment of OMB. The Administrative Procedure Act was passed in 1946 to bring transparency and public participation to agency decision-making. Congress has reviewed instances of presidential interventions in agency decision-making and ways to address them. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 brought transparency to agency decision-making by defining certain discretionary actions as \"rules\" and allowing stakeholders to oversee rulemaking. However, most agency decision-making is informal and unregulated, with OMB sometimes involved in decision-making processes as required by Congress or Presidents. OMB's involvement in agency decision-making is often initiated by Congress or Presidents for legislative purposes or policy preferences. Congress has responded with statutory directions, constraints, and transparency requirements. OMB administers the budget submission process on behalf of the President, with Congress legislating exceptions when necessary. In response to OMB's involvement in agency decision-making, Congress has legislated exceptions to allow direct submissions of budget information to Congress, providing agencies with independence from the President's policy preferences. Executive Order 8248 established OMB clearance of agency communications with Congress, but Congress has also granted some agencies statutory authority to directly submit materials to improve congressional access to agency information. The Paperwork Reduction Act was passed by Congress to provide central oversight of agency communications. The Paperwork Reduction Act established the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within OMB to oversee efforts to reduce paperwork burden. OIRA approves agency information collection requests with transparency and public participation requirements. The rulemaking process allows for presidential review of agency rulemaking through E.O. 12866, requiring significant regulatory actions to be reviewed by OIRA before publication. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) oversees agency rulemaking by reviewing draft proposed and final rules before publication. OIRA may return rules to agencies for reconsideration. Congressional responses to OMB involvement in agency decision making may inform potential options for congressional consideration. The process outlined in OMB's May 2005 memorandum raises issues for Congress regarding mandatory spending, agency discretion, and OMB involvement in agency decision making on behalf of the President. Congress may consider five general options regarding OMB controls on agency mandatory spending: maintaining the status quo, conducting oversight through hearings, increasing transparency, legislating in greater detail, or addressing the topic prospectively through lawmaking. The options for Congress regarding OMB controls on agency mandatory spending include maintaining the status quo, increasing transparency, legislating in greater detail, or modifying how OMB's process operates. The status quo option would continue the OMB process with limited transparency, while agencies would adhere to baseline spending projections unless exceptions are made. Advocates of the option to persuade OMB that cost-increasing administrative actions are required by law argue that it could prevent unnecessary increases in mandatory spending. The Bush Administration justified this process by stating that federal policy is often made through administrative actions leading to significant spending increases. Critics, however, warn that this process could be used by the President to displace agency decisions. Critics argue that OMB's process outlined in a May 2005 memorandum could allow the President to override agency authority. They suggest alternative options for oversight, transparency, and modifying OMB's role. Another group of critics believes OMB lacks the authority to disapprove agency actions, leading to inadequate leverage for the President. Congress could conduct oversight through hearings to review agency and OMB operations under OMB's process. If needed, Congress could consider legislative options. Congress could use oversight tools to gain more information about OMB's process to prevent unintended consequences from legislating. Investigating the scope and effects of OMB's controls on mandatory spending programs, determining which agencies and programs are subject to the process, and assessing its impact on program outputs, outcomes, and agency workload are potential avenues of inquiry. The oversight tools Congress could use to gain more information about OMB's process for controlling mandatory spending programs include assessing the impact on program outputs, outcomes, and agency workload. Questions also arise about agencies' consistency with congressional intent, consultation with authorizing committees, and the use of the Administration's baseline. It is possible for a President or OMB to use the baseline as a policy lever to influence agency discretion in mandatory spending programs. This could lead to agency practices being considered as \"proposals\" for mandatory spending increases, requiring offsets. Congress may consider legislation to increase transparency in this area. Congressional oversight tools could assess OMB's control over mandatory spending programs and agencies' adherence to congressional intent. The use of discretion and OMB involvement in agency decision making may inform congressional options for increased transparency at various stages of agency and OMB activity. Congress could consider implementing processes similar to exceptions for budget information submission directly to Congress or establishing an APA-like or PRA-like process for agency submissions to OMB or the President. Congress could consider implementing processes similar to exceptions for budget information submission directly to Congress or establishing an APA-like or PRA-like process for agency submissions to OMB or the President. Another option is to provide advance notice to Congress for agency administrative actions reviewed and approved by OMB, allowing for public participation and congressional oversight. Reporting requirements could also be considered for agency actions pursued after OMB review. Advocates of increased transparency argue that OMB's current process lacks transparency, making it difficult to ensure consistency with congressional expectations. They believe that significant administrative actions affecting spending should be subject to public participation. Critics, however, argue that transparency could weaken the President's control over agencies and hinder communication within the executive branch. Advocates of increased transparency argue that OMB's current process lacks transparency, making it difficult to ensure consistency with congressional expectations. Critics argue that transparency could impede open communications within the executive branch on implementing current law. Congress could legislate in greater detail to reduce agency discretion and limit OMB's involvement in agency decision making to prevent deviations from congressional intent. This would require individual authorizing committees to anticipate implementation issues that agencies would otherwise handle. When adjusting mandatory programs or pursuing new policy priorities, the outcome may rely more on Congress. If program parameters set in statute need to be optimized or adjusted, legislative action may take longer than administrative action, potentially jeopardizing program costs or participation. Revising legislative details could have adverse PAYGO implications for authorizing committees. Congress may be hesitant to revise authorizing language due to unrelated program requests complicating the legislative process. Congress could consider modifying the process outlined in OMB's May 2005 memorandum to give OMB explicit authority to approve agency actions. This could be done on an agency-specific or government-wide basis, potentially using CBO's baseline spending projection instead of the Administration's baseline for reviews. Alternatively, Congress might restrict OMB from implementing the memorandum, similar to limitations on OMB reviews of agricultural marketing regulations. Congressional authorizing committees or the Senate and House Budget Committees could conduct reviews instead of OMB. Advocates and critics may bring various arguments regarding procedural arrangements that could impact power relationships among Congress, the President, and agencies. Giving statutory authority to OMB for approving agency discretion on mandatory spending could enhance the President's leverage and bargaining power, while prohibiting OMB from conducting such reviews could strengthen Congress's influence over agencies. The lack of transparency in OMB's process outside the executive branch is a concern. Congress may seek more information on OMB and agency practices to inform decision-making and prevent unintended consequences. Tables categorize mandatory spending by House and Senate authorizing committees and programmatic areas. Congress historically emphasizes agencies executing laws in line with congressional intent. Congress often legislates in detail when directing agencies or the President, but also grants discretion in implementation. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 marked a shift in Congress's approach due to factors like industrialization and the Great Depression, leading to increased delegation of legislative authority to administrative agencies. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 shifted legislative authority to administrative agencies, leading to increased delegation. Congress passed laws to enhance its oversight capacities, including the APA which requires transparency and public participation in agency rulemaking. The APA defines rules and establishes procedures for rulemaking, such as publishing notices in the Federal Register. The APA of 1946 increased delegation to administrative agencies, requiring transparency and public participation in rulemaking. Agencies must publish notices in the Federal Register, allow written comments, and provide a statement of basis and purpose for adopted rules. Presidents and Congress have sought to influence agency decision-making, sometimes involving the OMB. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 mandated the President to submit a consolidated budget proposal annually for congressional review, centralizing budget requests under presidential direction. This shift aimed to reduce agency independence and increase executive authority, reflecting Progressive Era distrust in legislative institutions. Congress often responded to OMB involvement with legislation, either at OMB's initiation or as required by statute for additional oversight. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 centralized budget requests under presidential direction to reduce agency independence and increase executive authority. One key provision restricts agency officers from submitting budget requests to Congress without a request from either House of Congress. OMB issues annual directions to agencies on budget requests for potential modification by the President before submission to Congress. Congress has established exceptions allowing certain agencies to provide budgetary information directly to Congress. The OMB is responsible for clearing and coordinating departmental advice on proposed legislation to assist the President. This duty was assigned to OMB through Executive Order 8248 following the reorganization plan of 1939. The OMB, through Executive Order 8248, is tasked with reviewing and modifying agency documents for congressional recipients to align with the President's policy agenda. OMB's role in coordinating departmental advice on proposed legislation is crucial. The Paperwork Reduction Act established OIRA within OMB to oversee efforts in reducing paperwork burden and managing information resources across government agencies. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) ensures transparency and public participation by requiring OIRA to allow 30 days for public comment on proposed information collections. OIRA maintains a database of approved, under review, and expired collections, and keeps Congress informed. The Paperwork Reduction Act requires OIRA to inform Congress of major activities and submit an annual report on reducing information collection burdens. OIRA develops an annual Information Collection Budget by gathering data from agencies. Presidential review of rulemaking was established by President Clinton in 1993 through E.O. 12866, requiring agencies to submit \"significant\" regulatory actions to OIRA for review before publication. The order defines a \"significant\" regulatory action as one that may have a $100 million impact on the economy, create inconsistency with actions by another agency, or raise novel legal or policy issues. OIRA conducts formal reviews under E.O. 12866 within 90 days, requiring disclosure of changes made to rules based on OIRA's suggestions. In January 2007, President Bush issued E.O. 13422, which changed the regulatory review process by requiring agencies to designate a \"regulatory policy officer\" and expanding OIRA review to include informal reviews before rules are officially submitted. President Bush issued E.O. 13422 in January 2007, appointing a \"regulatory policy officer\" to oversee rulemaking and expanding OIRA review to include guidance documents. The changes were controversial, seen as a power grab. President Obama revoked E.O. 13422 with E.O. 13497 in 2009, returning E.O. 12866 to its original form. The OMB's formal review of rules requires disclosure of changes made, while OIRA's review of agency actions and documents, including significant policy and guidance documents, does not have the same requirement. Congress has limited OMB's review scope through provisions added to its appropriation, such as restrictions on reviewing agricultural marketing orders issued by the Department of Agriculture. Members of Congress assert that the Department of Agriculture, not OMB, has statutory authority in this area."
