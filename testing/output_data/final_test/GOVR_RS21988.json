    "content": "The Department of Energy (DOE) manages defense nuclear waste and cleanup of contamination from past nuclear weapons production. Radioactive waste is stored in underground tanks at Hanford, Savannah River, and the Idaho National Laboratory. Hanford has 53 million gallons in 177 tanks, Savannah River has 37 million gallons in 49 tanks, and INL has nearly 1 million gallons in 11 tanks. Leaking tanks have contaminated soil and groundwater, with Hanford being of greatest concern due to waste reaching the Columbia River. Recent monitoring data show that radionuclide levels in the Columbia River meet water quality standards, but concerns remain about contamination in the Snake River in Idaho and the Savannah River in South Carolina. The Department of Energy (DOE) is debating the best way to decommission tanks holding radioactive waste, favoring removal of liquid waste and immobilizing residual waste with cement grout to prevent leaks. High-level waste would be stored for future disposal in a deep geologic repository. The Department of Energy (DOE) is considering decommissioning tanks holding radioactive waste by removing liquid waste and solidifying residual waste with cement grout to prevent leaks. Concerns have been raised about the potential for pockets or layers of liquid waste within the residual sludge-like waste, which could pose a risk of leakage. Removing all waste from the tanks would eliminate contamination risks but create new challenges, including managing a hazardous waste stream and risks to workers handling the residues. The Department of Energy is facing challenges in decommissioning tanks holding radioactive waste. Risks include exposure to workers removing residues, managing new waste streams, and environmental risks from contaminated tank metal. Legal issues complicate waste disposal, with some classified as high-level requiring deep geologic repository disposal. An internal agency order exempts residual tank waste from high-level classification, raising concerns about proper disposal. The Department of Energy proposed disposing of residual tank waste at Hanford, Savannah River, and the INL by grouting it in place, with state concurrence required for tank closure. DOE faced legal challenges from NRDC for disposing of waste in this manner, with concerns raised by the state of South Carolina and others. In 2003, a federal district court ruled that DOE cannot classify tank waste as anything other than high-level or dispose of it on-site permanently. DOE appealed, and in 2004, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling, stating that the challenge was not \"ripe\" for review as DOE had not yet implemented the plan to grout the tanks. This allowed DOE to proceed with activities under Order 435.1, with the possibility of legal action if violations occur. In 2003, a federal court ruled that DOE cannot classify tank waste differently or dispose of it permanently on-site. DOE appealed, and in 2004, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed DOE to proceed with grouting tanks under Order 435.1. Congress later authorized DOE to classify tank waste in South Carolina and Idaho as incidental to reprocessing and grout it in place, but not in Washington State where most leaking tanks are located. Funding for this authority is subject to annual authorization and appropriation. Section 3116(a) of P.L. 108-375 authorizes the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to classify tank waste in South Carolina and Idaho as other than high-level waste if it does not require permanent isolation in a deep geological repository and highly radioactive radionuclides have been removed to the maximum extent practical. The Secretary must determine if the waste exceeds concentration limits for Class C low-level waste, but disposal can still follow Class C performance objectives for human exposure. If limits are exceeded, consultation with the NRC is required to develop a plan. The Secretary must consult with the NRC to develop a disposal plan for waste that exceeds allowable limits. Disposal must adhere to state-approved closure plans and permits. Class C waste performance objectives aim to prevent human exposure to radiation. The grout's effectiveness in achieving this depends on preventing leaks from tanks. Even if a tank leaks, objectives can still be met if radioactivity decays before contamination spreads. Protection from inadvertent intrusion must be ensured after removing institutional controls. Sealing tanks with cement grout is a method to meet these objectives. The authority of states is limited to the hazardous component of waste, allowing DOE to grout residual waste in tanks in Idaho and South Carolina as long as Class C performance objectives are met and NRC is consulted. The NRC monitors DOE's waste classification authority for Class C waste in Idaho and South Carolina. If DOE is non-compliant, the NRC informs relevant parties. Waste classification authority does not apply to material transported outside of these states. DOE cannot reclassify waste as \"incidental to reprocessing\" for disposal in other states. This provision does not affect other laws and regulations in Idaho and South Carolina. Section 3116(a) does not affect existing Federal Facility Agreements and Consent Orders or consent decrees for DOE sites, ensuring compliance with waste disposal and cleanup requirements. It specifically applies to Savannah River and the INL, maintaining agreed-upon waste disposal limits. Judicial review under the APA is available for any Secretary determinations or actions related to this section. In implementing Section 3116, DOE must determine the portion of tank waste not classified as high-level for disposal. DOE has made this determination at the INL but not at Savannah River. Public notice may be required under other federal laws and state-approved closure plans. In January 2006, DOE determined the portion of retrievable waste at Savannah River that would be classified as non-high-level, to be solidified and disposed of on site. The NRC agreed with DOE's waste determinations but disagreed on future roles in classifying tank waste. Section 3146 of P.L. 108-375 authorized the NAS to study disposal alternatives at Savannah River, INL, and Hanford, with the NAS concluding that DOE's approach to remove most waste from tanks and grout the rest in place is feasible. The NAS acknowledged that grouting tank waste is a feasible method to immobilize residual waste, but uncertainties remain due to technical, economic, and regulatory factors. Long-term performance of the grout to safely contain the waste is uncertain, and predicting performance until radioactivity decays completely is doubtful. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of grouting over time. The NAS recommended that DOE delay grouting tanks with more residual waste to develop technologies for waste retrieval. They suggested $50 million annually for 10 years for research on effective waste removal methods and residue immobilization upon tank closure. The Department of Energy (DOE) has allocated $10 million to establish a program for cleanup at sites like Savannah River, INL, and Hanford, with estimated completion costs of $32.1 billion, $15.3 billion, and $60.0 billion respectively. The disposal of tank waste is a major challenge, with grouting at Savannah River estimated to cost between $3.8 million and $4.6 million per tank. The Department of Energy is assessing alternatives and costs for disposing of tank waste at Hanford, with potential lower costs at the INL due to less waste in the tanks. Grouting the tank waste could be a faster and less costly method, but there are concerns about environmental risks if the grout does not solidify the waste completely. Potential future leaks could lead to environmental contamination and human exposure risks, depending on various factors. The federal government would be responsible for cleaning up contamination from tank leaks, depending on factors like human exposure risk and remedial actions chosen. Time and costs for cleanup could outweigh initial savings from grouting waste."
