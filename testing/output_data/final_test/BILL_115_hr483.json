    "content": "The Act titled \"No Funding for Sanctuary Campuses Act\" amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to address the treatment of sanctuary campuses. The \"No Funding for Sanctuary Campuses Act\" defines a sanctuary campus as an institution of higher education that prohibits sharing information on citizenship or immigration status with government entities. The \"No Funding for Sanctuary Campuses Act\" prohibits institutions of higher education from harboring or bringing in aliens in violation of immigration laws or providing postsecondary education benefits to aliens without lawful immigration status. The \"No Funding for Sanctuary Campuses Act\" prohibits institutions of higher education from preventing access to Department of Homeland Security recruiting on campuses. The \"No Funding for Sanctuary Campuses Act\" states that institutions of higher education cannot be considered sanctuary campuses if they refuse to share information on individuals' citizenship or immigration status with government entities or comply with requests from the Secretary of Homeland Security regarding detainers or notifications. The Secretary of Homeland Security can determine if an institution of higher education is a sanctuary campus, which would make the institution ineligible for funding under this title. Providing in-State tuition to undocumented immigrants is seen as creating an incentive for illegal immigration. The amendment prohibits encouraging illegal immigration into the United States and takes effect 90 days after enactment."
