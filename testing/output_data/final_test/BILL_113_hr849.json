Congress finds the need for a comprehensive deficit reduction plan to address fiscal challenges and promote national security and economic stability. The Budget Control Act of 2011 reduced discretionary spending by $1 trillion, but additional savings are required due to the failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. Sequestration was intended as a mechanism for deficit reduction but has failed to produce results. Relying on it for a balanced solution no longer makes sense due to the high costs to the government and economy. Automatic cuts under sequestration through fiscal year 2021 would impact various discretionary spending programs, hindering investments in national security, education, healthcare, and other critical areas. Congress must eliminate the threat of sequestration and establish a long-term discretionary spending plan to address the Federal deficit. Additional cuts to discretionary spending may be necessary for comprehensive deficit reduction. An additional $320 billion in targetable cuts to discretionary appropriations from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2021 is proposed. The Act aims to eliminate sequestration threat and provide predictability for economic recovery by proposing $167 billion in cuts to discretionary appropriations from 2014 to 2021. The Department of Defense is urged to revise its strategic guidance to align with available resources. The Act aims to provide predictability for economic recovery by proposing cuts to discretionary appropriations and implementing a long-term spending plan for deficit reduction. The Act repeals Section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and includes a $320 billion reduction in discretionary spending limits. The discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2014, 2015, and 2016 are amended to set specific budget authority amounts for the security and nonsecurity categories. In fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019, specific budget authority amounts are set for the security and nonsecurity categories: $569 billion and $522 billion in 2017, $579 billion and $531 billion in 2018, and $589.5 billion and $541 billion in 2019, respectively. In fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the budget authority is set at $602.5 billion for security and $553 billion for nonsecurity in 2020, and $616 billion for security and $565 billion for nonsecurity in 2021. SEC. 5 amends the definition of 'security category' for fiscal years 2012-2013 and 2014-2021. SEC. 6 suspends the statutory limit on public debt until February 1, 2017. SEC. 6 of the No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013 suspends the statutory limit on public debt until February 1, 2017."
