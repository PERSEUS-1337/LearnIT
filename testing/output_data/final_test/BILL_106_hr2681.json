    "content": "The Act titled \"Rail Passenger Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1999\" provides assistance by the National Transportation Safety Board to families of passengers involved in rail passenger accidents. The Rail Passenger Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1999 amends Subchapter III of chapter 11 of title 49, United States Code, to provide assistance to families of passengers involved in rail passenger accidents. The Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board is required to designate a director of family support services and an independent nonprofit organization to assist families in the event of a rail passenger accident resulting in a major loss of life. The Rail Passenger Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1999 designates an independent nonprofit organization to coordinate emotional care for families of passengers involved in accidents. The Board is responsible for facilitating recovery, identification of fatally injured passengers, and communicating with families about the roles of designated organizations, government agencies, and rail carriers. The designated organization for rail passenger accidents is responsible for providing mental health services, creating a private grieving environment for families, and maintaining contact with affected families. The designated organization for rail passenger accidents provides mental health services, private grieving spaces for families, and arranges memorial services in consultation with families. The director of family support services requests passenger lists from the rail carrier involved in the accident. The rail passenger carrier must provide passenger lists to the designated organization for accidents upon request. The director of family support services and the organization are not allowed to release this information to anyone else. The organization can provide information about a passenger to their family from a list obtained after an accident. The Board must ensure that families are briefed about the accident and allowed to attend public hearings. The organization designated for an accident must coordinate with the rail passenger carrier involved to utilize carrier resources. Prohibited actions include impeding the Board or designated organizations from carrying out their responsibilities and restricting families' contact after an accident. No unsolicited communication regarding personal injury or wrongful death can be made by an attorney or potential party to the litigation to individuals involved in the accident before the 45th day. States cannot prevent designated organizations from providing mental health services for 30 days after the accident. The director of family support services can extend the 30-day period after a rail passenger accident by an additional 30 days if necessary. Definitions for \"rail passenger accident\" include disasters in interstate rail passenger transportation or high-speed rail. The term 'rail passenger carrier' refers to a rail carrier providing interstate intercity rail passenger transportation or interstate or intrastate high-speed rail transportation, excluding tourist, historic, scenic, or excursion rail carriers. The term 'passenger' includes employees of a rail passenger carrier aboard a train and any other person aboard the train, regardless of payment. The section discusses the definition of a rail passenger carrier and the term 'passenger', including those who paid for transportation, occupied a seat, or held a reservation. It also mentions the limitation on statutory construction and the obligations of rail passenger carriers in providing assistance to families of passengers involved in accidents. SEC. 3. RAIL PASSENGER CARRIER PLANS TO ADDRESS NEEDS OF FAMILIES OF PASSENGERS INVOLVED IN RAIL PASSENGER ACCIDENTS. Part C of subtitle V of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding a new chapter titled \"CHAPTER 251--FAMILY ASSISTANCE\" which includes plans to address the needs of families of passengers involved in rail passenger accidents. Rail passenger carriers must submit a plan within 6 months of enactment to address the needs of families involved in rail accidents resulting in major loss of life. The plan should include a toll-free number for families to call and a notification process. Rail passenger carriers must have a process in place to notify families of passengers involved in accidents before releasing any public names. The carrier must verify passenger status and provide notifications promptly, preferably in person. Additionally, they must provide information to the designated family support services director. The rail passenger carrier must promptly provide a list of passenger names to designated organizations upon request after an accident. They must also consult with the family of each passenger regarding the handling of remains and personal effects. The rail passenger carrier must assure the return of passengers' possessions to their families upon request, retain unclaimed possessions for 18 months, consult with families about monuments for passengers, and treat families with care after an accident. The rail passenger carrier must provide equal treatment to families of nonrevenue passengers, collaborate with designated organizations for post-accident services, compensate these organizations, assist families in reaching the accident site, and ensure their physical care. The rail passenger carrier must commit resources, provide training to employees, inform families about passenger manifests, and limit liability in case of accidents. The rail passenger carrier must limit liability for passenger list preparation and train reservation information unless gross negligence or intentional misconduct is involved. Definitions for rail passenger accident, rail passenger carrier, and passenger are provided in this section. Nothing in this section restricts the actions or obligations of a rail passenger carrier. The text discusses the actions and obligations of a rail passenger carrier in providing assistance to families of passengers involved in an accident. It also includes a conforming amendment to the table of chapters for subtitle V of title 49, United States Code. The House of Representatives passed a new item related to family assistance on October 4, 1999."
