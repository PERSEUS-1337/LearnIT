    "content": "Radioactive waste is a byproduct of various nuclear activities, including weapons production, power generation, and medical use. Waste classification is often based on the waste's origin rather than its radiologic characteristics. Congress recently amended the definition of high-level waste, excluding certain residue from storage tanks. The classification of radioactive waste remains an important aspect of disposal policy. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 defined fissionable materials as plutonium, uranium-235, and other materials capable of nuclear fission. Special nuclear material, including uranium enriched in isotope 233, replaced fissionable material in the 1954 amended Act. The Atomic Energy Commission initially held title to all fissionable material for national security, but commercial reactor licensing and private company use of special nuclear material were authorized by Congress in 1954. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 defined fissionable materials as plutonium, uranium-235, and other materials capable of nuclear fission. Special nuclear material, including uranium enriched in isotope 233, replaced fissionable material in the 1954 amended Act. The Act eased restrictions on private companies using special nuclear material, but government title was retained over the material. The AEC was authorized in 1964 to issue commercial licenses for special nuclear material. Radioactive waste was not defined until the 1980s, with high-level waste and spent nuclear fuel defined by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 defined low-level radioactive waste as material not high-level waste, spent nuclear fuel, or byproduct material. Radioactive elements decay over time, transforming into more stable elements through the release of radiation. Radioactivity is measured in curies. Radioactivity is measured in curies, with the rate of decay expressed as half-life. Shorter half-lives mean quicker decay. The absorption of radiation by living organisms is called dose, measured in rem in the US. Different types of radiation have varying biological effects, with some more efficient at transferring energy to living cells. The ICRP concluded in 1977 that the mortality risk factor from radiation-induced cancers is about 1 x 10^-4. The mortality risk factor from radiation-induced cancers is about 1 x 10^-4 per rem dose. The recommended annual exposure limit is 500 millirem, which includes natural background and artificial radiation. The ICRP revised its risk factor conclusion in 1990, recommending a reduction in the annual effective dose limit to 100 millirem. Even at a continued exposure of 500 millirem, the change in age-specific mortality rate is very small\u2014less than 4.5%. The NRC's radiation protection standards are based on a dose limit of 100 millirem, excluding background radiation and medical procedures. The EPA uses a risk-based approach, attributing risk to natural background radiation levels and setting a goal of a 1-in-10,000 risk for cancer development. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has criticized the EPA and NRC for their low-level radiation protection standards, stating that there is a lack of conclusive scientific basis for these standards. Radioactivity levels of various wastes and materials are compared in Figure 1, with the goal of achieving a 1-in-a-million risk in cleanup of chemically contaminated sites. The curr_chunk discusses the levels of radioactivity in different types of waste, including phosphogypsum mining waste, uranium mill tailings, low-level waste, and transuranic waste. The levels range from 3 to 40 microcuries/cubic-meter for natural background radiation, up to 750 microcuries/cubic-meter for uranium mill tailings. The curr_chunk provides specific ranges for each type of waste based on various disposal facilities and inventories. The curr_chunk discusses the levels of radioactivity in different types of waste, including phosphogypsum mining waste, uranium mill tailings, low-level waste, and transuranic waste. The vitrified high-level waste processed by the Savannah River Site ranges from 6,700 to 250,000 curies/cubic-meter, while spent fuel aged 10 to 100 years would range from 105,000 to 2.7 million curies/cubic-meter. Definitions of various radioactive wastes are summarized in Table 2 along with applicable legislative provisions. The pressurized-water reactor (PWR) operates with 100 metric tons of nuclear fuel. During refueling, one-third of the fuel is replaced with spent nuclear fuel, which is then moved to a storage pool for cooling. Some cooled spent fuel is stored in dry casks at licensed independent spent fuel storage installations (ISFSI). Fuel debris from the Three Mile Island reactor accident is stored at the Idaho National Laboratory. General Electric operates an independent spent fuel storage installation in Morris, Illinois. Private Fuel Storage, LLC, in partnership with the Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians, has applied for an NRC license to build a temporary storage facility. The Department of Energy (DOE) has stored commercial spent nuclear fuel at various federal sites. Naval reactors can operate without refueling for up to 20 years, with 103 in operation as of 2003. Approximately 65 metric tons of spent fuel have been removed from naval reactors. Naval spent fuel was reprocessed for weapons production until 1992, and since then has been transferred to the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for interim storage. The planned Yucca Mountain repository is scheduled to receive 63,000 metric tons of spent fuel. The Energy Information Administration reported a total of 47,023.4 MTHM discharged from commercial reactors between 1968 and 2002. Of this, 46,268 MTHM is stored at reactor sites, and 755.4 MTHM is stored away from reactor sites. A combined total of 49,333 MTHM had been discharged by commercial and defense activities by the end of 2002, with commercial reactor storage pools holding 41,564 MTHM and ISFSIs holding 5,294 MTHM. Commercial reactor storage pools held 41,564 MTHM, ISFSIs held 5,294 MTHM, and federal spent fuel at other sites accounted for 2,475 MTHM. EIA's data differs from CRS's, with EIA only compiling commercial spent fuel data and combining reactor storage pool and dry storage data. EIA reported 38,418 MTHM discharged by the end of 1998, and CRS estimates an average annual discharge of 2152 MTHM. By the end of 2004, CRS estimates a total of 53,637 MTHM discharged. The NWPA defines high-level waste as liquid waste produced directly in reprocessing and any solid material derived from it containing fission products in sufficient concentrations. Most of the US high-level waste inventory comes from DOE nuclear weapons programs at various sites. President Carter ended federal support for commercial reprocessing in 1977 due to proliferation concerns. Limited high-level waste was generated by commercial spent fuel reprocessing at the West Valley Demonstration Project in New York. Weapons-production reactor fuel, naval reactor spent fuel, and weapons-related spent fuel were reprocessed to remove special nuclear material, generating highly radioactive liquid wastes stored at Hanford, INL, and Savannah River. The Hanford Site has 53 million gallons of waste in underground tanks, while the Savannah River Site has 36 million gallons in tanks. Some strontium and cesium have been separated out for commercial use. The Hanford and Savannah River Sites stored about 36 million gallons of high-level waste in underground tanks. The liquid waste had to be neutralized before storage. Savannah River has a facility to convert high-level waste into vitrified form for eventual disposal in a deep geologic repository. Hanford also plans to construct a similar processing facility. INL generated 300,000 gallons of high-level waste through 1992. INL is processing naval reactor spent fuel and sodium-bearing waste, converting liquid high-level waste into granular solids. West Valley's high-level waste has been vitrified and removed, with plans for a waste processing facility similar to Savannah River's vitrification plant. Hanford Site and INL are also planning vitrification plants for high-level waste, which is considered mixed waste due to hazardous substances. The DOE's Order 435.1 reclassifies waste streams from spent fuel reprocessing as incidental waste, subject to RCRA regulations. This waste can be managed as transuranic or low-level waste if specific criteria are met. The evaluation process considers if the waste is from reprocessing plant operations and meets certain conditions. The DOE's evaluation process at the Savannah River Site reclassifies plant operations waste as low-level or transuranic waste. Public concerns raised about the definition of \"incidental waste\" and potential NRC licensing authority. In 2003, the NRDC challenged DOE's evaluation process for Savannah River as scientifically indefensible, citing concerns about residue activity when capping with grout. DOE argued that key radionuclides had been removed and the waste met Class C low-level radioactive waste restrictions. The Federal District Court ruled in NRDC v. Abraham that DOE violated the NWPA. The Energy Secretary sought legislation clarifying DOE authority in waste management at Hanford, Savannah River, and INL. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated a judgment regarding high-level radioactive waste definitions in the Ronald W. Reagan Defense Authorization Act. The Act excludes certain waste from reprocessed spent fuel if specific conditions are met. NRC developed a draft Standard Review Plan in response to the Act, expecting an increase in waste determinations. Additionally, the Act authorizes $350 million for DOE's High Level Waste Proposal. The Atomic Energy Act defines transuranic waste as material contaminated with elements having atomic numbers greater than uranium. DOE revised the minimum radioactivity defining transuranic waste in 1984. Transuranic elements are artificially created in a reactor by irradiating uranium, including neptunium, plutonium, americium, and curium. Transuranic waste, including plutonium, americium, and curium, emits alpha particles and has long half-lives. Americium is used in smoke detectors, while plutonium produces fission energy in power reactors. The Department of Energy (DOE) generates transuranic waste mainly from defense-related weapons programs. This waste comes from reprocessing fuel to remove transuranic elements and fabricating nuclear weapons and plutonium-bearing fuel. In 1970, the DOE stopped burying transuranic waste in shallow landfills due to disposal challenges posed by its long half-life and alpha emissions. The Department of Energy distinguishes between \"retrievably stored\" and \"newly generated\" transuranic waste. Waste buried before 1970 is considered irretrievable, while waste since then has been stored in above-ground facilities. The Energy Secretary was directed to cooperate with New Mexico for safe disposal of defense radioactive wastes. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act limited disposal acceptance to transuranic waste. The WIPP Act limited disposal acceptance to transuranic waste meeting specific criteria. The WIPP facility in New Mexico began accepting waste in 1999, initially restricted to contact-handled waste. In 2006, the permit was revised to allow remote-handled waste. Additional disposal requirements were imposed on transuranic waste mixed with hazardous constituents. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for 2005 limited the disposal of transuranic waste at the WIPP facility to 20% plutonium by weight. Special nuclear material, including plutonium, is strictly regulated due to its importance in weapons programs. Surplus weapons-usable plutonium is planned to be used in mixed oxide fuel for commercial reactors, with the rest destined for repository disposal. The special facility constructed to reprocess surplus plutonium would generate transuranic and low-level radioactive waste streams. Spent mixed oxide fuel would be disposed of in an NRC-licensed deep geologic repository. Low-level radioactive waste is classified as A, B, C, or Greater than Class C in 10 C.F.R. 61.55\u2014Waste Classification and is disposed of in licensed facilities. Low-level radioactive waste is generated by various industries and institutions, including nuclear power plants, medical facilities, and research institutions. The waste includes wet and dry materials such as filter sludge, ion-exchange resins, and evaporator bottoms. In 2003, 99% of the 12 million cubic feet of low-level waste disposed of was classified as Class A by the NRC. The NRC classifies low-level waste based on the length of radioactive decay, with a dividing line at a half-life of 100 years. Long-lived radionuclides include carbon-14, nickel-59, niobium-94, technetium-99, iodine-129, plutonium-241, and curium-242. Short-lived radionuclides include tritium, cobalt-60, nickel-63, strontium-90, and cesium-137. Low-level waste is generated by nuclear power plants from uranium fuel fission or reactor activation. The fission of uranium fuel in nuclear power plants results in the creation of various radionuclides, such as tritium, carbon-14, nickel-53, nickel-59, niobium-94, strontium-90, technetium-99, cesium-137, and transuranic radionuclides. These radionuclides are produced from reactor components absorbing neutrons or as fission products of irradiated uranium fuel. Iodine-129, found in radioactive wastes, can be taken up by humans if released into the environment. Some short-lived radionuclides like cobalt-60, strontium-90, and cesium-137 have industrial applications. Cobalt-60 is used in cancer radiotherapy and sterilization, while strontium-90 is used in various applications due to its chemical similarity to calcium. Cesium-137 is also used in cancer radiotherapy and can be taken up by living organisms. The classification of low-level waste for burial is determined by radionuclide concentration limits. There are four waste classes: Class A for waste with the lowest radionuclide concentration, Class B for intermediate waste, and Class C for waste with the highest concentration of radionuclides. Greater than Class C (GTCC) wastes, not suitable for near-surface disposal, include irradiated metal components from nuclear power plants like core shrouds and support plates. Class A, B, and C wastes are candidates for near-surface disposal, involving a system with waste form, trenched excavation, engineered barriers, and natural site. The disposal facility for Class A and B wastes involves waste form, trenched excavation, engineered barriers, and natural site characteristics. Class C waste requires deeper burial to prevent disturbance. The facility operates for 20 to 40 years, followed by a stabilization period and long-term care under institutional control. No disposal facility currently exists for Greater than Class C Waste. The DOE is in the initial phase of identifying disposal options for Greater than Class C Waste. The GAO reported in 2004 that there was no imminent shortfall in disposal capacity for low-level waste, but the national database used for estimating future capacity was inaccurate. The GAO recommended that the DOE stop reporting database information and suggested that Congress direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to report any changes in disposal capacity that would require congressional evaluation. Congress established the policy that each state is responsible for disposing of low-level radioactive waste generated within its borders. States are responsible for disposing of low-level radioactive waste within their borders and can enter into compacts for this purpose. The NRC created tables for classifying waste based on radionuclide concentration limits, with Table 1 for long-lived radionuclides and Table 2 for short-lived ones. Concentration limits are expressed in \"curies/cubic meter\" or \"nanocuries/gram.\" Figures 3 through 6 provide guidance on interpreting the tables but are not for waste classification purposes. Tables 1 and 2 break down radionuclides into long-lived, transuranic, short-lived, and mixed categories. The sum-of-the-fractions rule is applied to waste containing a mixture of radionuclides for classification. If the sum of the fractions is less than 1, the waste is Class A; if greater than 1, it is Greater than Class C. For long-lived radionuclides, the fractions of each radionuclide are summed. In waste classification, the sum-of-the-fractions rule is used for mixed radionuclide waste. If the sum is less than 1, it is Class A; if greater than 1, it is Greater than Class C. For long-lived radionuclides, fractions of each radionuclide concentration are compared to concentration limits to determine the waste class. For example, a waste with Sr-90 at 50 Ci/m3 and Cs-137 at 22 Ci/m3 is classified as Class B since the sum of the fractions is 0.83. Mixed waste contains both concentrations of radioactive materials that satisfy the definition of low-level radioactive waste in the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, and hazardous chemicals regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6901). Facilities managing mixed waste are subject to RCRA Subtitle C (Hazardous Waste) requirements implemented by EPA or comparable state regulations. Source material uranium contains uranium isotopes in approximate proportions of U-238 (99.3%), U-235 (0.7%), and U-234 (trace amount) by weight. Depleted uranium is a mixture of isotopes U-234, U-235, and U-238 with U-235 less than 0.711% of total uranium. Most DOE depleted uranium has 0.2%-0.4% U-235. Uranium enrichment plants produce U-235 enriched fuel for reactors. Commercial reactors use uranium enriched 2%-5% with U-235. Uranium ore is converted to UF6 gas for enrichment, depleting U-235. The Department of Energy (DOE) has a large inventory of depleted uranium hexafluoride (DUF6) stored at three enrichment plant sites. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) assessed converting DUF6 into stable forms suitable for disposal as low-level radioactive waste. The forms considered were metallic (DU), tetrafluoride (DUF4), dioxide (DUO2), and triuranium octaoxide (DU3O8). The DU metal form has various commercial and military uses. DOE has evaluated the environmental impacts, costs, and benefits of managing its DUF6 inventory. DOE decided to convert DUF6 to depleted uranium oxide or metal, stored for future use or disposal. Uranium Disposition Services will convert DUF6 to non-reactive oxide to eliminate RCRA criteria. Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (TENORM) is a byproduct of processing mineral ores with radionuclides like uranium, phosphate, and rare earth ores. It can be found in consumer products, fly ash from coal-fired power plants, and in water treatment processes. Groundwater may contain naturally occurring radionuclides (NORM) like uranium and radium, which can be concentrated in water treatment plants. Plants can concentrate NORM in filters, tanks, and pipes, resulting in technologically enhanced NORM (TENORM) like filtrate and scale. Radium-226, a decay product of uranium and thorium, is a concern due to its radiologic threat. Public exposure to TENORM is federally regulated. In 1997, the EPA requested the NAS to study EPA's guidance on naturally occurring radioactive material. The NAS defined TENORM as naturally occurring material with increased radionuclide concentrations due to human activities. The study identified important radionuclides. The NAS completed a study in 1999, identifying radium, thorium, uranium, and their decay products as important radionuclides. Radium is concerning as it decays into radioactive radon gas, a carcinogen. Federal regulation of TENORM is lacking, with no standards developed for all exposure situations involving naturally occurring radioactive material. The EPA submitted a report to Congress on implementing NAS recommendations and plans to revise TENORM guidance documents. EPA has used existing environmental laws to regulate some sources of TENORM. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amends the definition of \"byproduct material\" to exclude certain sources of naturally occurring radioactive material. It clarifies that byproduct material is not considered low-level radioactive waste for disposal purposes under the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to expand its jurisdiction to include certain radium sources and accelerator-produced radioactive materials (NARM). The proposed rule does not specify criteria for determining NARM sources but notes the NRC's authority over discrete sources of radium-226. The example of residuals from water treatment is given as a diffuse source. The authority of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact to dispose of NORM and TENORM is questioned for potentially violating the Commerce Clause. The Compact originally included Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, but Arizona, Utah, and Wyoming later withdrew. The definition of low-level waste excludes certain types of radioactive waste, but Article VII(d) allows for the management of other radioactive waste with authorization. The host state can manage radioactive waste other than low-level wastes, considering factors like transuranic elements. The legislative history of the Rocky Mountain Compact doesn't clarify states' responsibilities for NRC-defined A, B, and C class wastes. The Southeast Interstate Compact allows for flexibility in defining low-level waste and handling waste states are responsible for. The Compact's jurisdiction may extend to TENORM disposal if it meets certain criteria. The Compact's jurisdiction extends to TENORM disposal if it meets Class A, B, or C low-level radioactive waste criteria. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 may restrict the Compact's authority in disposing of low-level radioactive waste. TENORM similar to radium-226 may fall outside the Compact's jurisdiction, while diffuse sources of radium-226 within the jurisdiction. Uranium and thorium mill tailings are byproducts of ore processing containing radioactive uranium decay products and heavy metals. Mined ores are considered source material if they contain 0.05% or more uranium or thorium. The Atomic Energy Act defines byproduct material as uranium or thorium weighing 0.05% or more, excluding depleted underground ore bodies. Tailings from uranium or thorium extraction are regulated under the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act to prevent radon diffusion. The NRC oversees tailings impoundment siting, disposal, decommissioning, and monitoring for radon emissions and environmental hazards. The Atomic Energy Act regulates byproduct material like uranium or thorium, with specific guidelines for tailings from extraction. The NRC oversees monitoring programs, financial surety requirements, and eventual government ownership of pre-1978 tailings sites. The AEC addressed radioactive waste disposal concerns in 1955, leading to research on disposal methods in geologic media. The Academy recommended disposal in salt beds or salt domes, with engineering tests conducted in a salt mine near Lyons, Kansas in the mid-1960s. In the 1970s, the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) and later the Department of Energy (DOE) began screening various geologic media for a repository, including salt deposits at federal sites like the Hanford Reservation and Nevada Test Site. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 was passed by Congress to address the national problem of accumulating spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste, requiring environmentally acceptable waste disposal solutions. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 addressed the need for acceptable waste disposal solutions, leading to the development of repositories for high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. The Department of Energy will take ownership of waste accepted for disposal in a repository. The Yucca Mountain repository site in Nevada was recommended by the President in 2002, but a recent court ruling found EPA's safety standard on radiation containment to be inconsistent with congressional recommendations. The Energy Department plans to submit a license application for Yucca Mountain in mid-2008, with the potential for waste acceptance in the next decade. The controversy over DOE waste incidental to reprocessing has been resolved by redefining high-level radioactive wastes. Congress requested the National Research Council to study DOE's plans for managing residual tank waste. New Mexico's Governor amended WIPP's hazardous waste permit to only allow disposal of waste listed on DOE's Transuranic Waste Baseline Report. The Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 encouraged multi-state compacts for disposal sites, with a deadline extended to 1992 in 1986. Low-level waste includes debris and contaminated soil from decommissioning nuclear facilities. Utah has a new licensed site, while the Nevada site has closed. The National Research Council found inconsistencies in regulating low-activity radioactive waste from nuclear facilities. The EPA proposed disposing of certain low-activity wastes in hazardous waste landfills, pending legal and regulatory resolutions. The NRC permitted very low-activity wastes from a decommissioned nuclear power plant to be sent to solid waste landfills. The NRC rejected a staff proposal to allow disposal of low-activity waste in solid waste landfills, despite other states permitting it. Radioactive waste classification remains a concern for policymakers, with the DOE working to clean up contaminated sites from weapons facilities. The disposal of low-activity waste at RCRA C and D landfills could help alleviate capacity constraints at existing low-level waste facilities. The EPA and NRC have not reconciled standards for public exposure to low-level radiation from contaminated sites. Uncertainty exists regarding the classification of radioactive waste, leading to overlapping jurisdiction between the two agencies."
