The \"Doctor-Patient Relationship and Research Protection Act\" establishes a Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research with full authority to direct and coordinate all Federal funding of such research conducted or supported by various departments. The Council's membership will include specified individuals. The Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research will include members from specific agencies and individuals appointed by the Comptroller General of the United States, representing patients, physicians, and agencies. The Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research will include 3 members representing agencies that administer public programs, including one member from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services with experience in administering programs under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, and another member representing agencies that administer State health programs with experience in administering programs under title XIX or title XXI of the Social Security Act. The Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research will include a member representing agencies that administer other Federal health programs, such as those under the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, or Indian Health Service. The Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research will include members representing private payers, pharmaceutical, device, and technology manufacturers, nonprofit organizations in health services research, organizations focusing on quality measurement and improvement, and independent organizations. The Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research will have members representing various sectors including health services researchers, differences in treatment outcomes, and rural populations. At least half of the members must be physicians or clinical experts. The Secretary will serve as Chairman with a designated Vice Chairman. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is amended to clarify that the Council cannot mandate coverage policies for payers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can cover routine clinical care costs for individuals in clinical trials under certain conditions. The Council under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 cannot mandate coverage policies for payers and must establish procedures for transparency, credibility, and access in conducting comparative effectiveness research. The Council must allow a 30-day public comment period on research proposals and a 60-day comment period on research results. Public comments will be transmitted to the entity conducting the research. The Council will hold additional forums to gather public feedback on research priorities, findings, and other activities. Information will be made public through the Council's website and other appropriate channels. The Council will conduct comparative effectiveness research, including entity identity, industry links, draft study designs, research protocols, and research results. Public feedback will be gathered through forums and made available on the Council's website. The Council will provide information on research findings, investigators' identities and conflicts of interest, progress reports, public comments, bylaws, processes, and proceedings. Relevant reports or comparative effectiveness research findings must be shared within 60 days of receipt. The Council considers conflicts of interest when appointing members to advisory panels, selecting individuals for peer-review processes, and hiring executive staff. Conflicts of interest are disclosed in an annual report to Congress. The term 'conflict of interest' in this subsection refers to associations, including financial and personal, that may bias decisions related to the Council or comparative effectiveness research. Individuals contributing to peer review processes must be described in a way that prevents their identification with a specific research project. SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF FEDERALLY FUNDED CLINICAL COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH. The Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services cannot use federally funded clinical comparative effectiveness research data for coverage decisions based on cost under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. Federally funded research must ensure that clinicians and patients have the best evidence for healthcare choices, considering variations in patient populations and preferences. The Social Security Act allows individuals entitled to benefits to have expedited access to coverage determinations, redeterminations, and appeals. It also grants full access to administrative or judicial review. The Act does not mandate coverage of any drug, product, device, or treatment deemed unsafe by the FDA. No federal funds can be used for disaggregation of research results. No federal funds can be used for disaggregation of research results in federally funded clinical comparative effectiveness research, which must include variables to analyze differences based on racial and ethnic background, gender, and geography among patient subpopulations. The term \"medical treatments, services, and items\" refers to various health care interventions, procedures, devices, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostic tools used in patient treatment and diagnosis. Patient subpopulations include individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, genders, and geographic locations."
