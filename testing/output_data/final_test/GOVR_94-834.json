    "content": "The Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) is only for federal employees hired before 1984 and will end with the death of the last CSRS annuitant around 2075. Employees hired in 1984 or later are part of the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). Cost-of-living adjustments for CSRS annuities are based on CPI-W changes. Cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for benefits paid under FERS are based on the percentage change in the CPI-W from third quarter to third quarter. COLAs under FERS are limited based on eligibility category and rate of inflation. Nondisabled FERS retirees under age 62 do not receive COLAs, but survivors and disabled retirees do after the first year of disability. All COLAs under FERS are limited if inflation exceeds 2.0%. The CSRS COLA is 2.8% and the FERS COLA is 2.0% starting January 2019. P.L. 87-793 enacted in 1962 provided for automatic adjustments in civil service retirement. The first law in 1962 allowed for automatic adjustments in civil service retirement and disability benefits based on CPI changes. Subsequent laws in 1965 and 1969 added adjustments to offset benefit erosion and included semiannual adjustments based on CPI changes. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts of 1981 and 1982 replaced semiannual COLAs with annual COLAs based on the December-to-December change in the CPI. The implementation of COLAs was delayed by one month in FY1983, FY1984, and FY1985. Nondisabled retirees under 62 would receive 50% of the projected CPI plus the full difference in the actual CPI over these projections. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts of 1981 and 1982 replaced semiannual COLAs with annual COLAs based on the December-to-December change in the CPI.

Nondisabled retirees under 62 would receive 50% of the projected CPI plus the full difference in the actual CPI over these projections. COLAs for January 1985 and thereafter were to be the full amount for all retirees. P.L. 97-253 limited COLAs in certain cases by restricting annuity increases. P.L. 98-270 delayed the COLA scheduled for May 1984 until December (payable in January 1985) and all subsequent COLAs were to be effective in December and payable in January. The COLAs for civilian and military retirement were to be based on the change in the average monthly CPI-W from third-quarter to third-quarter, following the same formula as Social Security COLAs. The payments were to be issued on the first business day of the month following the effective month, as specified by various laws including P.L. 98-369 and P.L. 99-177. Additionally, P.L. 99-509 reinstated COLAs after they were suspended for FY1986 and subsequent years to meet deficit reduction targets. P.L. 99-509 reinstated COLAs for programs previously suspended under P.L. 99-177 for FY1987-FY1991. P.L. 100-119 permanently exempted these programs from COLA suspensions. P.L. 103-66 postponed COLAs' effective date from December to March for FY1994-FY1996 without changing the CPI measurement period."
