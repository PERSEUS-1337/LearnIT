    "content": "The Act titled \"Prescription Drug Price Comparison for Savings Act of 2004\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that access to prescription drugs is crucial for all Americans, but many cannot afford them, leading to skipping doses or splitting pills. This financial burden may force individuals to prioritize drug costs over other health-related expenses. Medicaid aims to assist low-income families and individuals in achieving independence. Some states, like Maryland, have implemented measures to address this issue. Some States, like Maryland, have websites with pharmacy price information for residents to compare prescription drug prices. Requiring all States to collect and report pharmacy prices to establish a national comparison shopping website aligns with Medicaid program goals.
