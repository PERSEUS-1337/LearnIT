NTIA works with other agencies to develop the Administration's position on key policy matters, including international negotiations on the Internet and spectrum management. The agency is headed by the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, who advises the President on telecommunications and information policy matters. The NTIA is responsible for coordinating federal government communication systems, assisting in national telecommunications policy, and receiving funding from various sources. Its budget is organized into four program categories, including Spectrum Management and Broadband Programs. The agency also supports public safety initiatives, such as the First Responder Network Authority. The Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) was established by Congress in 2012 as an independent agency within the NTIA. The NTIA collaborates with the FCC on spectrum management and policy, works with the Department of State on international spectrum issues, and participates in interagency efforts to develop Internet policy. The NTIA also collaborates with the NIST on research projects in Boulder, CO. The NTIA collaborates with NIST, FCC, and other federal agencies on research projects and broadband grants. They are scaling down BTOP grants administration and increasing focus on BroadbandUSA program for assisting communities with broadband deployment. NTIA administers policies through six main offices, including the Office of Spectrum Management. The Office of Spectrum Management (OSM) formulates plans for spectrum use, including public safety operations. The Office of Policy Analysis and Development (OPAD) conducts research and prepares policy recommendations. The Office of International Affairs (OIA) enhances U.S. companies' policies. The Office of International Affairs (OIA) develops policies to help U.S. companies compete globally in ICT sectors. OIA works with other U.S. agencies and the private sector to promote open ICT markets and supports Internet policies with international scope. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) is NTIA's research and engineering laboratory, providing technical support for advancing telecommunications and information infrastructure development. Its focus includes research, development, and testing of technologies to support efficient use of the radio spectrum. The Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications (OTIA) focuses on research, development, and testing of technologies for first-responder communications and resolving interference issues. OTIA administers grant programs to deploy technology and support national priorities. The Office of Public Safety Communications (OPSC) was created to administer provisions of the Spectrum Act and provides support for FirstNet. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request for the NTIA was $50.8 million for salaries and expenses across various program categories. This request was $1.6 million more than the FY2016 request and $11.3 million more than the FY2016 enacted amount. The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed $39.5 million for salaries and expenses, while the House Committee on Appropriations proposed $36.3 million for FY2017. The NTIA's funding for FY2017 varied throughout the year, starting at $36.3 million and ending at $32.0 million, which was $7.5 million less than the previous year. The White House's budget blueprint for FY2018 supported NTIA's role in Internet governance and digital commerce. The White House's budget blueprint for FY2018 supports NTIA's role in Internet governance and digital commerce, with proposed funding cuts for the Department of Commerce but no specified cuts for NTIA. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request included an increase in funding for Domestic and International Policies, staff, and initiatives in Internet policy and the digital economy. The Department of Commerce established a Digital Economy Agenda during the Obama Administration, focusing on promoting a free and open Internet worldwide, trust online, access to fast broadband for all, and innovation. This agenda led to the creation of a Digital Economy Board of Advisors, with NTIA providing assistance. The NTIA issued a green paper on the benefits, challenges, and potential government roles in advancing IoT technologies. They requested public comment to inform future actions, collaborating with other government agencies through the Internet Policy Task Force. The NTIA played a key oversight role in ICANN, an international entity that coordinates the Internet naming system. NTIA allowed its contract with ICANN to expire in 2016 after approving the transition of IANA functions to the private stakeholder community. The NTIA's contract with ICANN expired in September 2016, but it still has an advisory role in ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget included $8.9 million for Spectrum Management, a 4.7% increase from the previous year. This increase was to meet the requirements of the Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2015 and increase the number of FTEs to 40. Obama's Wireless Initiative tasked the NTIA with identifying spectrum for commercial wireless use. The Spectrum Act and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 require the NTIA to identify federal spectrum for commercial use, manage the transfer process, and coordinate with the FCC to assign additional spectrum for nonfederal use. This is part of the Wireless Initiative's goal to add 500 MHz of spectrum for wireless broadband. The NTIA assists federal agencies with spectrum management, charges fees for services, and reimbursable obligations in FY2016 totaled $57.6 million. Proposals for commercial mobile broadband services include clearing federal users from designated frequencies, sharing frequencies with commercial users, improving federal spectrum use efficiency, and using emerging technologies for spectrum sharing. NTIA produced a 10-year plan with input from the PPSG to support spectrum clearing efforts. The NTIA, with input from the Policy and Plans Steering Group (PPSG), developed a 10-year plan and timetable for identifying spectrum bands available for commercial wireless broadband services. A \"Fast Track Evaluation\" was prepared to assess and recommend spectrum for future availability. By June 2016, 245 MHz of spectrum had been made available in coordination with the FCC. Advisory committees and the Interdepartmental Radio Access Committee (IRAC) assist the NTIA in spectrum management decisions. The NTIA is also advised by the Commerce Spectrum Management Advisory Committee. The NTIA is advised by the Commerce Spectrum Management Advisory Committee (CSMAC) and the Office of Management and Budget influences agency spectrum management through budget planning. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request for Advanced Communications Research included an increase in funding and FTEs. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) in Boulder, CO, is the research and engineering arm of the NTIA, providing telecommunications research and engineering services. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) in Boulder, CO, provides research and engineering services to evaluate and promote new technology deployment, advanced telecommunications, and more efficient use of spectrum. The Center for Advanced Communications (CAC) focuses on interdisciplinary research in wireless technology and spectrum sharing for public safety and commercial broadband communications. Activities include developing technologies for spectrum sharing, collaborative research with FirstNet and NIST, and influencing communications standards. The ITS provides research services to federal agencies and private entities on a reimbursable cost basis. Reimbursable project obligations for telecommunication sciences research in FY2016 totaled $10.8 million. The FY2017 budget request for broadband programs was $12.9 million, an increase of $1.1 million (9%) over the FY2016 enacted amount. NTIA's broadband deployment programs, including BTOP grants, have been a major focus since 2009. NTIA is scaling down administration of BTOP grants through 2020 and consolidating efforts under the BroadbandUSA program. The BroadbandUSA program, announced by the White House in 2015, supports initiatives for expanding broadband deployment. The FY2017 budget requested an increase to enlarge the program, with funds redirected from the BTOP grant program. Ongoing program features include oversight of BTOP grants, community outreach for digital literacy, and sharing best practices for deploying broadband. The Spectrum Act directs revenue from auctions of spectrum licenses into the Public Safety Trust Fund for public safety purposes. The NTIA is responsible for supporting FirstNet in building a nationwide broadband network. Funding from the Fund includes $2 billion for FirstNet and $115 million for the Next Generation 9-1-1 Implementation Grants program. All funding obligations have been met with proceeds from auctions in 2014-2015, with remaining balances reverting to the Treasury in 2022 for deficit reduction. In FY2010, the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) received $20.0 million in funding, representing half of the NTIA's budget appropriations. Congress terminated grant funding for the PTFP in FY2011, leading to an increase in total enacted budget appropriations for the NTIA by 4% to $41.6 million. The increase in funding was largely due to administrative expenses and salaries. Between FY2012 and FY2015, NTIA's funding requests for broadband grant program administration declined significantly. In FY2012, $32.3 million was requested, representing 70% of the budget. This decreased to $12.2 million in FY2015. The requested increase in FY2015 was $5 million over the enacted FY2014 budget. The NTIA requested a $46.0 million increase in funding for FY2015, focusing on policy oversight and expanding broadband availability. New programs included the Center for Advanced Communications and an Internet Policy Center. Congress appropriated $38.2 million for NTIA salaries and expenses, supplemented by $4.7 million in unobligated balances. Significant increases were proposed for Advanced Communications Research and Domestic and International Policies in the FY2016 budget request. The FY2016 budget request for Advanced Communications Research and Domestic and International Policies saw significant increases, although enacted funding did not meet the requested levels. The budget request for Advanced Communications Research was $12.6 million, a 61.5% increase over FY2015, with $10.1 million enacted. The request for Domestic and International Policies was $15.2 million, double the FY2015 amount, with $9.1 million enacted. NTIA also receives reimbursable funding from sources like fees for spectrum management services. The NTIA received reimbursable funding of $36.1 million in FY2015, $57.7 million in FY2016, and projects $44.1 million for FY2017, with a significant portion coming from spectrum management fees. The projected FTEs for FY2017 would have been 347, an increase from 320 in FY2016. The Senate committee requested a report on reimbursements from other agencies. The FY2017 budget request included 177 FTEs for programs funded through appropriations, compared to 160 FTEs in FY2016 and 121 FTEs in FY2015. This marks an increase from the total number of 320 FTEs in FY2016 and 260 FTEs in FY2015 for all NTIA programs."
