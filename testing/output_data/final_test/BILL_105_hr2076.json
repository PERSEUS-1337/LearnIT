The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is being amended to remove certain sections and make conforming amendments related to the uniform mail voter registration form. This includes changes to sections 4(a), 7(a)(6)(A), and other conforming amendments. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is being amended by removing section 6 and making changes to section 8(a)(5) by removing references to sections 5 and 6. SEC. 2. REQUIRING APPLICANTS REGISTERING TO VOTE TO PROVIDE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. SEC. 2 amends the National Voter Registration Act to require applicants to provide their Social Security number for voter registration. The amendments made by this section will take effect on January 1, 1998, and will apply to applicants registering to vote in Federal elections on or after that date. Proof of citizenship is required for voter registration when applying for a driver's license or through voter registration agencies. The amendments require voter registration applicants to provide proof of US citizenship. SEC. 3. REMOVAL OF CERTAIN REGISTRANTS FROM OFFICIAL LIST OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS. Section 8(d) of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is amended to allow states to remove the name of a voter from the eligible voter list if the voter has not participated in elections for a certain period after confirmation notice is sent. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 allows states to remove a voter's name from the eligible voter list if the voter has not participated in elections after receiving a confirmation notice. The notice includes criteria such as not voting in the first two general elections for Federal office and failing to notify the State of any change in residence. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 allows states to send a return card to registrants to update their address and voting eligibility. Failure to respond may result in removal from the voter list. An amendment is made to include subsection (d)(3) in the Act. SEC. 4.

SEC. 5 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is amended to allow registrants changing residence to update their voting records for future elections at their current address. They may also vote in the present election if permitted by State law. SEC. 6 states that these amendments apply to Federal elections after December 1997."
