    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. CYBERSECURITY OF AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEMS.\" is about the cybersecurity measures related to automated driving systems. The text chunk discusses the requirement for manufacturers of automated driving systems to have a cybersecurity plan in place to detect and respond to cyber attacks and unauthorized intrusions before selling or introducing their vehicles into commerce. The text chunk outlines the need for manufacturers of automated driving systems to have a cybersecurity plan in place to identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities from cyber attacks or unauthorized intrusions, including false messages and malicious commands. It also requires a process for preventive and corrective actions, such as incident response plans, intrusion detection systems, and updates based on changed circumstances. The text chunk outlines requirements for manufacturers of automated driving systems, including the identification of a cybersecurity point of contact, limiting access to systems, employee training, and an effective date for implementation. Enforcement authority and a clerical amendment are also addressed. The text outlines requirements for manufacturers of automated driving systems, including cybersecurity measures and enforcement authority. Additionally, a new item relating to section 30129 is added. The text introduces definitions related to automated driving systems, specifically defining \"automated driving system\" and \"dynamic driving task\" within the context of cybersecurity measures and enforcement authority for manufacturers. The text defines the \"dynamic driving task\" as the real-time functions needed to operate a vehicle in traffic, excluding strategic functions like trip planning. It includes lateral and longitudinal vehicle control, monitoring the environment, response execution, maneuver planning, and enhancing visibility. The curr_chunk introduces new definitions related to highly automated vehicles, operational design domain, and vehicles performing partial driving automation. It also includes revisions to certain definitions. The curr_chunk introduces revisions to certain definitions related to highly automated vehicles, operational design domain, and vehicles performing partial driving automation. If SAE International revises certain terms, they must notify the Secretary for review and public comment. The Secretary may update definitions related to highly automated vehicles, operational design domain, and partial driving automation without following the usual regulatory process. If SAE International revises a definition, the Secretary must review it, and if accepted, make necessary regulatory amendments. The Secretary can update definitions for highly automated vehicles, operational design domain, and partial driving automation without standard regulatory procedures if there are significant changes in circumstances affecting vehicle safety."
