    "content": "The USMS categorized federal facilities into five classes based on building size, agency mission, tenant population, and public access levels, with corresponding security standards for each class. The Interagency Security Committee was established to oversee security measures. The Interagency Security Committee (ISC) was established in 1995 to address government-wide security for federal facilities. Initially part of GSA, it was later transferred to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. Chaired by the GSA Administrator, the ISC consisted of representatives from executive branch agencies and was authorized to establish security policies, develop standards, and ensure compliance for federal facilities. The Interagency Security Committee (ISC) was established in 1995 to address government-wide security for federal facilities. It is chaired by the GSA Administrator and consists of representatives from executive branch agencies. The ISC develops security policies, standards, and oversees compliance. It also takes actions to enhance security and protection in federal facilities, such as sharing security-related intelligence, assessing technology for cost-effective improvements, developing construction standards for high-threat locations, evaluating standards for day care centers, and maintaining a centralized security database. The Interagency Security Committee (ISC) was established in 1995 to address government-wide security for federal facilities. In May 2001, the ISC issued Security Design Criteria for New Federal Office Buildings and Major Modernization Projects, focusing on security technology, cost considerations, and balancing security standards with public access. This included requirements for window glazing protection, minimum distances between buildings and streets, vehicular access control, and securing air intake vents. The September 2001 terrorist attacks further emphasized the need for enhanced security measures in federal buildings. The ISC issued revised procedures for new federal buildings to be constructed at a minimum distance from perimeter barriers to mitigate vulnerability to violence or bombings. Despite completing security design criteria, a 2002 GAO report criticized the ISC for lack of progress in other responsibilities due to GSA's lack of leadership and support. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 centralized federal efforts to enhance physical security for federal facilities. The ISC's chairmanship was transferred to the DHS Secretary in 2003 and then delegated to the Director of the Federal Protective Service in 2004. A 2004 GAO report recommended that DHS direct the ISC to develop a plan to fulfill its responsibilities. DHS, through the ISC, is establishing a centralized security database for federal facilities and updating standards. This includes Physical Security Performance Measures, Facility Security Level Determinations, Physical Security Criteria, Design-Basis Threat Report, and ISC Best Practices for Safe Mail Handling. The ISC, under DHS, oversees federal agencies' physical security plans to protect critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks. This includes implementing safe mail-handling practices and reviewing security plans for federal facilities. The ISC, under DHS, oversees federal agencies' physical security plans to protect critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks. The ISC does not have the authority to enforce standards on other federal departments and agencies, relying on their willingness and abilities to implement security standards. Various agencies, such as the CIA's Security Protective Service and the DOD's Pentagon Police Directorate, are responsible for federal building security. The Federal Protective Service is the primary agency for protecting federal facilities. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for protecting almost half of all GSA owned or leased property within DHS's National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). FPS focuses on security and law enforcement activities to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats, including risk assessments, countermeasures, law enforcement response, and safety education programs. They also assist other federal agencies with additional security measures. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for protecting GSA owned or leased property within DHS's National Protection and Programs Directorate. FPS employs law enforcement officers, investigators, and administrative personnel, along with contract security guards. The FY2012 appropriations for FPS were recommended at $1.2 billion by the Senate and $1.3 billion by the House. The responsibility to protect federal buildings was given to the Federal Works Agency in June 1948. The Federal Works Agency was responsible for policing public buildings and areas under its jurisdiction, with special policemen enforcing laws for protection and prevention of disturbances. After its abolition in 1949, these functions were transferred to GSA. In 1961, GSA was authorized to appoint non-uniformed special policemen for investigations and law enforcement on federal property, including making arrests without a warrant for felony offenses. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) was established in January 1971 by the GSA Administrator to protect federal property and buildings. It was later transferred to the Department of Homeland Security under ICE, and then to the National Protection and Programs Directorate in 2010. The FPS officers, under DHS, have the authority to enforce federal laws, protect federal property, carry firearms, make arrests, serve warrants, conduct investigations, and perform other activities for homeland security. Their responsibilities also include federal building access control, identification checks, security equipment monitoring, and patrols of federal property. FPS contracts with private security guard companies to provide guards for federal facilities in the National Capital Region. Task orders detail terms of service, including building protection, guard post locations, armed status, and staffing numbers. The DHS Inspector General notes that contract guard services make up a significant portion of FPS's budget. The FPS operating budget for FY2006 is estimated at $487 million. Judicial security remains a concern following various incidents, including murders and threats against judges and court facilities. Efforts to improve security have been spurred by these events, such as a plan to bomb a federal building in Springfield, IL, and a shooting at a courthouse in Las Vegas in 2010. Possible threats in the first week of 2010 included suspicious substances in letters sent to courthouses in Alabama, prompting a need for increased oversight and security enhancements at federal courthouses. The three branches of the federal government have unique roles in ensuring judicial security, with Congress authorizing security programs and funds, and the Judicial Conference's Committee on Judicial Security monitoring judiciary safety. The United States Marshals Service (USMS) is responsible for the security of federal judges and court personnel at over 400 court facilities nationwide. The Judicial Security Division (JSD) within USMS provides security services and staff support for the federal judiciary, including personal protection for judges and physical security for federal court facilities. The US Marshals Service is responsible for the security of federal judges and court personnel at over 400 court facilities nationwide. This includes personal protection for judges, physical security for federal courthouses, and oversight of court security officers. District U.S. marshals oversee security using USMS resources and contract employees for various security measures. The US Marshals Service is responsible for the design, installation, and maintenance of security systems, oversight of communications equipment, and conducting investigations of threats against federal judges and court personnel. They assign resources for security plans and ensure safety, with deputy marshals attending court sessions and judicial security inspectors evaluating courthouse security. The Office of Protective Intelligence (OPI) was established in 2004 to review and analyze intelligence information for those under protection. The Office of Protective Intelligence (OPI) analyzes intelligence information for those under US Marshals Service protection. OPI issues security advisories, bulletins, and alerts to ensure protective measures are taken. USMS collaborates with the FBI to assess threats. In GSA-managed buildings with court facilities, USMS and FPS share security responsibilities as per MOAs and MOUs. USMS has primary security responsibility in buildings where the court is the sole tenant, with FPS providing perimeter support if needed. The US Marshals Service (USMS) and Federal Protective Service (FPS) share security responsibilities in GSA-managed buildings with court facilities. USMS controls access to judicial space while FPS is responsible for perimeter security and other interior spaces. FPS conducts risk assessments, deploys officers and contract guards for protection, and investigates crimes at the facilities. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) has duties including visitor entry processing, roving patrols, garage access control, and mail screening, in addition to perimeter security responsibilities. The Judicial Conference's Committee on Judicial Security coordinates security issues at national and district levels with US Marshals Service (USMS), Department of Justice (DOJ), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). USMS collaborates with the AOUSC Office of Court Security and the Office of Facilities and Security on security, legal, and budget matters. Meetings between the Committee on Judicial Security and USMS senior management address security issues and budget concerns. Working sessions are held to discuss security system purchases, CSO staffing, and budget issues. The US Marshals Service collaborates with the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and the Office of Facilities and Security on security, legal, and budget matters. They meet with the district chief judge at court security committee meetings to review and implement security plans, including the purchase and installation of security systems. USMS also consults on security considerations in the construction of new courthouses and implemented a pilot program for perimeter security at selected courthouses previously under FPS responsibility. The pilot program covers five courthouses in Chicago, Detroit, Phoenix, New York, and Tucson, and two in Baton Rouge. The Marshal of the Supreme Court oversees Court operations, manages employees, and directs the Supreme Court Police Force. The police force's jurisdiction includes the Court building, grounds, and adjacent streets. Federal building security involves daily interactions between FPS and federal customers, coordination between USMS and FPS in multi-use buildings, and communication with contract security guard companies. Federal agencies also collaborate with state, local, and private sector entities to ensure security. Recently, the FBI has worked with Members of Congress due to increased threats. Communication of potential threats to states, localities, and private sector entities is crucial for federal building security. Federal agencies lease, build, and occupy facilities in local jurisdictions, integrated with the general populace and other entities. Local jurisdictions could be affected by terrorist attacks on federal buildings, and federal agencies rely on state and local law enforcement. The Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS) was used to communicate threats, providing recommended protective measures for federal departments to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. The Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS) disseminated terrorist threat warnings to various entities, including federal departments, state and local agencies, and the public. Protective measures were only provided for federal departments, with communication through multiple systems and public announcements. In 2009, the HSAS was replaced by the National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS), which aims to provide detailed terrorism threat information to the public, government agencies, first responders, and the private sector. Some federal entities have developed mechanisms for notifying other federal departments and agencies in response to specific threats, such as the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response coordinating with DHS, federal intelligence, and law enforcement communities. The FBI has liaison relationships with DHS, DOE, and DOD to coordinate response efforts in case of nuclear threats or incidents. The Office of Operations Coordination within DHS is responsible for monitoring the situation. The Office of Operations Coordination within DHS is responsible for monitoring the nation's security situation daily through the National Operations Center (NOC) and coordinating activities among various entities. Information on domestic incident management is shared through the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) and state and local intelligence fusion centers. Congress may need to address issues related to federal building security, including FPS operations, coordination of security information, Facility Security Committees, and resources. The threat of terrorism post-9/11 has increased focus on federal property security. GAO identified concerns about FPS operations, including lack of risk management framework, strategic human capital plan, technology use, information sharing, and data management system. The GAO recommended improving the fee-based system for tracking security service costs at GSA facilities. Congress may need to require DHS to develop an accurate method for assessing security service costs. Additionally, GAO suggested evaluating the use of the current fee-based system for funding FPS operations. Congress could also consider having the DHS IG review the fee-based system versus direct appropriations for FPS. Congress may want to review FPS operations further through oversight hearings or require FPS and DHS to report on actions taken to address GAO and DHS IG findings, including concerns with contract security guards' training and certifications. FPS has issues with monitoring contract guard training and certification, lacks national guidance on guard inspections, and has inconsistent inspection quality. They have taken steps to address these issues, such as authorizing overtime for monitoring guards and implementing penetration tests. Additionally, a new directive clarifies FPS responsibilities for inspections and evaluations. In FY2010, Congress required FPS to maintain a minimum staff of 1,200 full-time equivalent personnel and 900 full-time law enforcement officers. Increasing law enforcement officers may not immediately solve issues with contract security guards due to time constraints and resource strains. Terrorism threat information sharing and security coordination require constant attention. The government's efforts to ensure national security involve sharing terrorism threat information and coordinating facility security. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated the creation of an Information Sharing Environment (ISE) to facilitate the sharing of terrorism information among various entities. However, challenges have arisen in coordinating and sharing federal building security information. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted inconsistencies in information sharing between the Federal Protective Service (FPS) and General Services Administration (GSA) regarding security information. Despite established communication processes, there is disagreement on what information should be shared. FPS has not consistently provided quarterly briefings at the regional level as specified in the memorandum of agreement with GSA. GSA officials noted that the briefings primarily focused on crime statistics and lacked comprehensive threat analyses. DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano acknowledged the lack of a unified process for sharing terrorism intelligence among federal, state, and local entities. The Secretary highlighted issues with the current system of sharing terrorism intelligence among federal, state, and local entities. Congress could require federal agencies to report periodically on coordination and sharing of terrorism threat information. GAO reported limited success with the implementation of the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) since 2004, noting a lack of guidance on accountability and progress assessment. Congress could request information on how federal agencies train personnel on sharing terrorism threat information and review the coordination of information sharing systems. GAO noted in 2007 that integrating or sharing similar information among multiple agencies can lead to redundancies. However, these options do not address how specific federal facilities interact with federal security entities like FPS. The Facility Security Committee (FSC) in federal buildings considers building security matters, as mentioned in a House Committee on Homeland Security hearing. GAO reported smuggling bomb-making components into high-security federal facilities, raising concerns about dangerous items allowed in federal buildings. The GAO reported smuggling bomb-making components into high-security federal facilities, highlighting the lack of a standard list of prohibited items. Congress may need to consider establishing a standard list and regular evaluations to enhance security. The lack of established standards for Federal Security Committees (FSCs) poses security risks. The Interagency Security Committee is addressing FSC operations to ensure security. Key areas for examination include FSC membership, voting procedures, allocation of security costs, and meeting frequency. The need for mandatory scheduled FSC meetings, possible standards for meeting records, tenant appeal processes, efficient approval processes, communication with law enforcement, and congressional review of FCS operations were highlighted in legislation introduced in the 112th Congress to enhance FPS protection of federal facilities. On January 5, 2011, Representative Bennie G. Thompson introduced H.R. 176, the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2011, aimed at reforming the FPS inspector force, security practices, and contract oversight capacity. The bill directs the DHS Secretary to maintain at least 1,350 full-time equivalent positions in the FPS inspector force. The Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2011 aims to establish Federal Facility Security Officers and law enforcement officers for security assessment and physical law enforcement at FPS-protected facilities. It includes a pilot program to convert contract guard positions to federal employee positions at high-risk federal facilities, with oversight by a FPS contract oversight force and periodic review by the GAO Comptroller General. The GAO Comptroller General would review the current FPS fee-based funding system and recommend changes. H.R. 176 expresses Congress's sense that security standards for federal facilities should be implemented. Senator Lieberman introduced the SECURE Facilities Act of 2011 to improve security and modernize FPS. On May 11, 2011, the committee adopted an amendment by Senator Tom Coburn to increase the guard workforce and stabilize FPS management. The bill requires training and assessments of guard capabilities. It mandates maintaining a minimum number of full-time equivalent employees in FY2012 and beyond. The FPS will increase training for contract guards, maintain testing programs, and establish procedures for retraining or terminating guards. FPS officers will be authorized to carry firearms on or off duty. The DHS Secretary will coordinate with the ISC to develop standards for checkpoint detection technologies at FPS-protected federal facilities. ISC's authority to enforce security standards for federal buildings will be increased. The DHS Secretary will report to congressional committees if any facility is non-compliant with ISC security standards. The ISC security standards require federal agencies' representatives on the Federal Security Committee to be trained on security matters. The committee must meet quarterly, maintain official records, and the DHS Secretary must report on FPS funding within 180 days. Communication and coordination among law enforcement agencies would be enhanced for trials of individuals charged with terrorist acts. Communication and coordination among law enforcement agencies, including federal, state, and local entities, along with the judiciary, are crucial for the security and safety of all parties involved in trials of individuals charged with terrorist acts. Additional security enhancements such as staff, training, technology, and equipment are necessary. Assessing the impact of security measures on the local community, businesses, residences, and traffic around courthouses is important. Considerations for airspace surveillance and perimeter extension for security may be needed. Coordination of expenditures and jurisdictional responsibilities of each entity, including national intelligence agencies, should be taken into account. Planning for multi-year appropriations is crucial for federal entities involved in trials that could last for several years. Congressional oversight is necessary to maximize funds and resources under fiscal constraints. If adequate funding is not provided in a timely manner, Congress should consider allowing entities to transfer resources from other programs. Direct appropriations to the Federal Protective Service (FPS) could provide more stable funding and reduce administrative costs for both FPS and federal courts. The federal government faces the daily task of securing a large portfolio of buildings. Congress could address concerns to ensure effective federal agency operations and the well-being of federal employees and the public."
