    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Economic Growth and Development Act\". Congress expresses a sense on United States development assistance. Congress believes that US development assistance is most effective in countries with governments committed to the rule of law, human rights, combating corruption, and enabling economic growth through trade and investment. Assistance should align with recipient countries' priorities, promote private sector-led growth, and complement government investments in key sectors. Domestic resource mobilization should be guided by a unified strategy with ambitious targets and robust monitoring. It should target recipient countries to advance the rule of law, strengthen civic institutions, address economic constraints, catalyze private sector investment, and promote transparency. United States development finance programs aim to mobilize private capital for development objectives and may surpass traditional grant-based assistance programs in total investments. These programs should be leveraged to complement resources supporting enhanced trade capacity and fairer trade with partner countries. The United States development finance programs aim to mobilize private capital to complement other forms of private capital, drive inclusive economic growth, and provide stability through multi-year authorization. SEC. 3. INTERAGENCY MECHANISM TO COORDINATE UNITED STATES DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT. The President will establish an interagency mechanism to coordinate US development assistance programs with private sector investment activities. This mechanism will streamline private-sector liaison, coordination, and investment promotion functions, facilitate the use of development and finance tools, and provide a single point of contact for partnership opportunities. The President will establish an interagency mechanism to coordinate US development assistance programs with private sector investment activities. An annual report will be submitted to evaluate the progress of the mechanism in carrying out its duties. SEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES. The heads of Federal departments and agencies overseeing U.S. development assistance abroad must ensure that a thorough analysis of constraints to economic growth in recipient countries guides development strategies. Coordination with private sector activities in these countries is also required. The analysis should identify constraints related to critical infrastructure, education, rule of law, and taxation. The analysis of constraints to economic growth in recipient countries should focus on critical infrastructure, education, rule of law, tax and investment codes, and economic sectors like agriculture, transportation, energy, education, and financial services. Results should be incorporated into development strategies and used to guide resource allocation for U.S. development assistance overseas. The term \"development strategy\" refers to any global, sectoral, or country development strategy of the United States, including integrated country strategies, regional strategies, country development cooperation strategies, and mission strategic resource plans."
