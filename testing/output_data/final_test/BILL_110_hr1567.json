    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Tuberculosis (TB) Now Act of 2007\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that tuberculosis is a major infectious cause of death worldwide, killing 1.6 million people annually. One-third of the global population is infected with the tuberculosis bacterium, with 8.8 million developing active tuberculosis each year. Tuberculosis is a leading killer among HIV-positive individuals and women of reproductive age. 22 countries, including China and India, account for 80% of the global tuberculosis burden. China and India contribute to 36% of new tuberculosis cases annually. Africa has seen a doubling of tuberculosis rates due to HIV/AIDS. Drug resistance, including MDR-TB and XDR-TB, poses a global health threat. XDR-TB, the most severe form of tuberculosis, is a global health threat that is closely linked to the HIV epidemic. It has been confirmed on six continents and has shown high lethality rates, as seen in an outbreak in South Africa in 2006. Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in preventing, detecting, and treating XDR-TB due to capacity gaps. Foreign-born individuals contribute to over 50% of tuberculosis cases in the United States, highlighting the impact of international travel and migration. Investing in tuberculosis control abroad, where costs are lower, is a cost-effective strategy to reduce tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality in the United States. The global spread of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis poses a threat to Americans, making DOTS a crucial intervention. The Stop TB Strategy, developed by the World Health Organization, aims to expand DOTS coverage, address challenges like multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and strengthen health systems. It involves collaborating with healthcare providers to reduce tuberculosis prevalence, mortality, and incidence. The Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015, developed by the Stop TB Partnership, aims to cut tuberculosis deaths and disease burden in half by 2015 and eliminate tuberculosis as a global health problem by 2050. It includes actions such as engaging healthcare providers, empowering individuals and communities, and promoting research for new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines. The Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility has made treating tuberculosis more affordable, but millions still lack access to effective treatment. Increased global investment in fighting tuberculosis requires corresponding technical and program assistance. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria aims to combat these diseases that kill millions annually. The United States Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are actively involved in global tuberculosis control efforts, with a focus on expanding effective treatment programs. Congress has urged the CDC to increase its involvement in international tuberculosis control efforts, as the global epidemic directly impacts tuberculosis in the United States. The United States Agency for International Development partners with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the President's Emergency Plan for HIV/AIDS Relief to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with tuberculosis globally. They aim to enhance country capacity for tuberculosis prevention and treatment, focusing on countries with high burdens of tuberculosis, HIV, and MDR-TB. The United States Agency for International Development partners with other organizations to combat tuberculosis globally. Their focus is on enhancing country capacity for tuberculosis prevention and treatment in high burden countries. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 aims to prioritize controlling tuberculosis in countries with high burden rates. Goals include reducing tuberculosis death and disease burden by half from 1990 levels and detecting and curing at least 70% of sputum smear-positive cases by December 31, 2015. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prioritizes controlling tuberculosis in high burden countries. Amendments include changing \"Authorization\" to \"Assistance Required\" and giving priority to activities in the Stop TB Strategy. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prioritizes controlling tuberculosis in high burden countries through various measures such as treatment for individuals with tuberculosis and HIV, funding for research on new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines, and program-based operational research. The Act also emphasizes the use of International Standards for Tuberculosis Care and strengthening health systems. The President must ensure a minimum allocation of funds for implementing the Stop TB Strategy and contributing to the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility. Additionally, assistance for WHO and the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership is further amended by redesignating subsections. The President is authorized to provide increased resources to the World Health Organization and the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership to improve countries' capacity to implement the Stop TB Strategy and address extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. The Stop TB Strategy aims to reduce tuberculosis through various measures such as diagnosis, treatment, vaccines, and monitoring, as well as ensuring a reliable drug supply and strengthening public health systems. It includes promoting the use of International Standards for Tuberculosis Care, bacteriology quality assessment, short-course chemotherapy, and effective reporting systems. The strategy was developed by the World Health Organization and is outlined in the Global Plan to Stop TB 2007-2016. The Global Plan to Stop TB 2007-2016 outlines actions to achieve the goal of reducing tuberculosis deaths by half by 2016. An amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act includes providing assistance for diagnosis and treatment in high burden countries. $400 million is authorized for fiscal year 2008. The President authorized $400 million for fiscal year 2008 and $550 million for fiscal year 2009 for section 104B of the Foreign Assistance Act. Additionally, $70 million for fiscal year 2008 and $100 million for fiscal year 2009 is allocated for global tuberculosis activities through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Amounts appropriated are in addition to other funds allocated. Amounts authorized for specific purposes are to remain available until expended. The House of Representatives passed the bill on November 5, 2007."
