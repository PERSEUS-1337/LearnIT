    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 987.8 of the Penal Code is amended. Section 987.8 of the Penal Code allows the court to impose a lien on the defendant's real property if they are unable to afford counsel. The lien must be recorded with the county recorder and has priority over other liens. The county can enforce the lien for payment of legal assistance to the defendant. The county can impose a lien on a defendant's real property for legal assistance payment, but cannot enforce it on the defendant's primary residence through a writ of execution. The lien is not effective against a buyer without notice of it. The court may determine a defendant's ability to pay for legal assistance after the conclusion of criminal proceedings, and may order the defendant to appear for an inquiry into their ability to pay. The court may assess a defendant's ability to pay for legal assistance if they hire private counsel, if the public defender proceeds with the case despite the defendant not being indigent, or if the defendant appears to have assets to repay the cost of legal assistance. The court can order the defendant to repay the cost in installments if able, and this applies to a county upon the board of supervisors' resolution. If the defendant fails to appear before a county officer within 20 working days after proper notice, the officer will recommend to the court that the defendant pay the full cost of legal assistance provided. The defendant must be informed of the cost, procedural rights, response time limit, and consequences of non-appearance. At a hearing, the defendant has the right to be heard in person. The defendant has several rights in court, including the right to be heard in person, present witnesses and evidence, confront adverse witnesses, and receive a written statement of the court's findings. If the court determines the defendant can pay, they must reimburse the costs in a reasonable manner. Failure to appear may result in the defendant paying the full cost, enforced like a money judgment. Prior to providing legal assistance, the court must notify the defendant of a potential hearing to determine their ability to pay for counsel. If deemed able, the defendant will be ordered to pay the costs, enforced like a civil judgment. (g) \"Legal assistance\" includes legal counsel, medical and psychiatric examinations, investigative services, and expert testimony to help the defendant with their case. \n(2) \"Ability to pay\" refers to the defendant's financial capability to reimburse the costs of legal assistance, considering their current financial position. The court considers the defendant's present and future financial position, employment prospects within six months, and any other factors relevant to their ability to reimburse the county for legal assistance costs. A defendant can petition the court to modify or vacate a judgment based on a change in circumstances regarding their ability to pay. This right must be advised by the court when rendering the judgment. This section applies to all proceedings where the party is represented by a public defender or appointed counsel."
