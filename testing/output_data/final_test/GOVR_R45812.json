    "content": "The illicit drug supply chain for plant-based drugs destined for the United States begins with cultivation in remote and insecure locations by cash crop farmers. Factors like crop productivity and location variability impact the process. Drug crop productivity varies with each harvest and location, influenced by factors like weather, plant disease, soil fertility, field maturity, and farming techniques. Officials and analysts face challenges in detecting and measuring illicit drug cultivation, relying on satellite imagery with varying quality. Surveillance programs for coca bush and opium poppy crops in source countries are ongoing but do not capture all global cultivation. Techniques like interspersing illicit crops between legitimate ones can obscure the true scale of cultivation. Estimates of illicit drug production are challenging to determine accurately due to various factors such as unreliable cultivation estimates, changes in survey methodologies, and variations in refining processes. Satellite imagery, crop yield studies, and government-reported eradication data are used to estimate production, but errors can occur, especially when eradication data cannot be verified independently. The refining process introduces variables that further limit the accuracy of drug production estimates. The origin, quality of raw materials, processing methods, lab size, worker expertise, and enforcement responses all impact drug production estimates. Calculations are based on \"potential pure\" illicit drugs, assuming all harvested crops are converted, but this may not always be the case. Variables at each stage of production complicate accurate estimations. Unlike plant-based drugs, the conversion of opium into heroin in Asia is unknown, adding to the challenges of estimating illicit drug production. The illicit supply chain for synthetic drugs destined for the United States starts in chemical manufacturing and pharmaceutical facilities. International regulations control some chemical inputs used in illicit synthetic drug production, but data limitations hinder efforts to track production and demand. The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 requires economic analyses on precursor chemicals used in methamphetamine production, but data constraints impede accurate assessments. The State Department faces challenges in obtaining data on synthetic drug production and precursor chemicals due to outdated, insufficient, and unreliable data. The proliferation of new psychoactive substances (NPS) further complicates the analysis, as these substances are molecularly altered variants designed to evade detection by authorities. Law enforcement authorities are also concerned about fentanyl analogues entering the United States. Law enforcement authorities worldwide have reported over 850 uncontrolled new psychoactive substances (NPS) to the United Nations by the end of 2018. The next step in the supply chain of illicit drugs destined for the United States involves the transit of these substances into the country. The United States is a major consumer of illicit drugs, but it is just one of many drug consumption markets globally. Some drugs produced may be consumed locally, while others are intended for the U.S. market. Challenges in estimating drug flows include degradation or loss during transit, seizures by law enforcement, and reaching the U.S. border. The challenge of estimating drug flows in transit is longstanding, with no comprehensive dataset detailing the amount of each illicit drug produced in each source country bound for the United States. The Consolidated Counterdrug Database (CCDB) records drug trafficking events, detections, seizures, and disruptions, vetted quarterly to minimize duplicate reports. The Consolidated Counterdrug Database (CCDB) records drug trafficking events, detections, and seizures to estimate illicit drugs, like cocaine, destined for the United States. The amount of drugs seized at the border serves as a reference for policy debates on border security and drug flows. There is no exact data on the total quantity of foreign-produced illicit drugs entering the country. The total flow of drugs crossing the US border is unknowable. Illicit drugs are either detected and seized at the border or not seized. Seized drugs are quantifiable, while those not seized are not quantifiable initially. Some smuggled drugs may be seized later. Foreign-produced drugs not seized at the border are divided into two categories. Inbound inspections at the US border categorize drugs as seized or not seized by officials. Seized drugs can be of foreign or domestic origin and may be intercepted within the country or at outbound inspections. Policymakers use drug seizure data to understand drug flow across borders. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the primary agency responsible for seizing illicit drugs at the U.S. borders. The Office of Field Operations (OFO) staffs Ports of Entry (POEs) where drugs are seized, while the Border Patrol patrols land borders and coastal waters. CBP publishes enforcement statistics on drug seizures, showing larger quantities seized at POEs than between them. CBP seizes significant amounts of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl at Ports of Entry (POEs) compared to between ports. From FY2012 to FY2018, CBP seized 388,970 pounds of cocaine at and between POEs, with 86.1% seized at POEs. Methamphetamine seizures increased three-fold during this period, with 82.2% seized at POEs. Heroin seizures totaled 35,193 pounds, with 88.0% seized at POEs. From FY2012 to FY2018, CBP seized significant amounts of heroin, fentanyl, and marijuana at Ports of Entry (POEs) and between ports. Heroin seizures totaled 35,193 pounds, with 88.0% seized at POEs. Fentanyl seizures increased from 70 pounds in FY2015 to 2,173 pounds in FY2018, with 85.5% seized at POEs. Marijuana seizures totaled 14,023,570 pounds at and between POEs, with a greater quantity being seized between ports. Marijuana seizures by CBP decreased significantly from over 2.8 million pounds in FY2012 to 761,319 pounds in FY2018. Border Patrol seized 77.1% of the marijuana between POEs, while OFO seized the remaining 22.9% at the ports. Policymakers and the media often rely on CBP data for drug seizures, but the foundational seizure data provide a more nuanced view. The foundational seizure data provide additional information such as the type of POE where drugs were seized and whether the drugs were seized during inbound inspections, outbound inspections, or in operations away from the POEs. CRS analysis of OFO drug seizure data from FY2014 to FY2018 shows that about 65% of seized illicit drugs by weight were confiscated at land POEs, 28% at air POEs, and 5% at sea POEs. Nearly 97% of seized drugs were confiscated during inbound inspections. Outbound inspections at POEs may result in seizures of illicit drugs, with most smuggling attempts occurring at southwest land POEs. CBP seizes over 65% of illicit drugs during inbound inspections at land POEs along the Southwest border. There is no central database for illicit drug seizures in the US, with various law enforcement agencies involved in enforcement actions that may include drug seizures. Information on drug seizures is scattered across different datasets and systems, making it challenging to compile comprehensive data on illicit drug seizures nationwide. Law enforcement case information, including drug seizure data, may change throughout investigations. Case management systems may not always be updated with final information, such as results of forensic lab tests on seized drugs. Data from law enforcement agencies in the US provide limited insight into illicit drug smuggling, as foreign-produced drugs can enter the country without being seized. Illicit drugs entering the US market may not always be seized at the border, making seizure data unreliable for determining the source country. This is especially true for marijuana, with increased domestic cultivation and decreased Mexican production. CBP seizure data includes drugs from both inbound and outbound inspections, and some seizures have unknown intended flow direction. Despite the imprecision in seizure data, the National Seizure System (NSS) run by the DEA through the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) provides information on illicit drugs seized in the United States. Certain federal law enforcement agencies are required to report drug seizures above certain thresholds, but reporting by other agencies is voluntary. The NSS contains mandatory reported data on drug seizures of certain sizes made by law enforcement entities. The National Seizure System (NSS) provides data on drug seizures in the United States, but it only represents a subset of total illicit drugs seized. The data helps officials understand the illicit drug market, trafficking activity, and enforcement strategies. The National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) collects forensic analysis results from various entities to provide further insight into drug chemistry analysis. The NFLIS reports on drug cases submitted to laboratories for testing and the number of distinct drug reports made from those cases, representing 283 individual laboratories. It helps law enforcement and analysts understand trends in drug reports in the United States. The quantities of illicit drugs produced in other countries and successfully smuggled into the U.S. are unknown, so officials rely on seized drugs and drug intelligence to estimate the drug market. The DEA conducts chemical analysis on illicit drugs seized in the United States to determine their source countries and production methods. The heroin signature program helps identify the geographic source of heroin through analyzing its \"signature\" linked to specific production processes in certain regions. The DEA's Heroin Signature Program (HSP) analyzes heroin seized at U.S. ports of entry to determine its geographic source, with 86% originating from Mexico in 2016. The Cocaine Signature Program (CSP) analyzes cocaine samples to trace their origin and processing methods, with 93% of samples in 2017 originating from Colombia. The DEA's Methamphetamine Profiling Program (MPP) analyzes methamphetamine samples to determine production methods. 97% of samples analyzed were produced using the reductive amination method with P2P as the precursor chemical. Domestic production commonly involves pseudoephedrine/ephedrine tablets and household items. The DEA's Fentanyl Signature Profiling Program (FSPP) analyzes fentanyl samples to identify trafficking networks. Fentanyl from China has high purity levels, while fentanyl from Mexico has lower purity levels. Seizure data provides insight into drug flows and smuggling points into the United States. In current policy discussions on border security, CBP drug seizure data can inform decisions on counterdrug resource placement. Analyzing drug seizures can reveal the geographic sources of illicit drugs in the US, aiding policymakers in targeting resources effectively against drug trafficking. Border seizure data can inform efforts to combat drug trafficking by revealing where illicit drugs are most often smuggled into the United States. Lawmakers and enforcement officials can use this data to assess the effectiveness of existing enforcement efforts and prioritize areas with the highest flow of specific categories of illicit drugs, such as opioids. The DEA National Drug Threat Assessment highlights that heroin is frequently smuggled through ports of entry, leading to higher seizures by CBP at these locations compared to between them. Congress may need to consider reallocating resources for screening and intercepting illicit drugs at ports of entry (POEs) to address the threat posed by opioids. Border seizures do not provide a complete picture of drug transportation and distribution in the U.S., as they mainly reflect drugs detected during inbound inspections. This focus on border seizures also overlooks illicit drugs produced domestically. The current chunk discusses the need for enhanced data collection on drug seizures in the United States, including both inbound and outbound inspections. Policymakers could improve data availability by consolidating information from federal agencies and conducting a study on drug seizures. This would provide a more comprehensive view of drug trafficking within the country. Lawmakers could request a study by the GAO to improve data collection on drug seizures in the United States. Congress could mandate federal law enforcement agencies to report all drug seizures to a central database like the NSS. Another option is to incentivize states to collect and report drug seizure data by providing grant funding. Enhanced data on drug seizures away from the border could offer a more detailed perspective on the issue. The Department of Homeland Security uses a risk management approach to counter threats at U.S. borders, including those from terrorists, transnational criminals, and unauthorized migrants. Risks are assessed based on the likelihood of threats being realized and their potential consequences. Threat actors are strategic and adaptive in their behaviors, making threat assessment complex. Threat actors are strategic and adaptive in their behaviors, making threat assessment complex. Assessing the likelihood and consequences of threats, such as drug smuggling into the United States, is challenging due to various factors. Officials rely on intelligence and seizure data from unsuccessful smuggling attempts to inform their expectations. Seizures vary across border sectors and transport modes. Border officials use intelligence and seizure data to assess drug trafficking risks and allocate resources effectively. Policymakers question the effectiveness of DHS's risk management approach in countering drug threats at the borders. The United States implements strategies to reduce drug trafficking at its borders by evaluating data on drug flows to measure progress towards goals outlined in the National Drug Control Strategy. Measures include reducing the availability of illicit drugs by preventing production outside the US, disrupting online sales, and stopping drug flow through mail, express courier services, and borders. The National Drug Control Strategy aims to reduce drug trafficking by evaluating data on drug flows, including production outside the US and drug movement through mail, express courier services, and borders. Measures of effectiveness include reduced availability of illicit drugs, increased drug seizures at US ports of entry, and changes in drug prices and purity in the US. Intelligence on drug flows and seizures can help determine the impact of US drug control efforts and other factors influencing drug trafficking. The National Drug Control Strategy evaluates data on drug flows to reduce trafficking, including production outside the US and movement through borders. Policymakers question fluctuations in drug seizures at ports of entry and other drug supply factors to assess progress. Strategies like the National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy aim to reduce drug trafficking, but more specific data on illicit drug production and seizures is needed for better evaluation."
