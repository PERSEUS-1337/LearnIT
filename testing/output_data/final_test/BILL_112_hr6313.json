FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the South China Sea is crucial for commercial shipping and access between the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean, serving as a lifeline to Taiwan, Japan, and the Korean peninsula. Multiple countries have disputed territorial claims over the Spratly and Paracel Islands. China's introduction of the 9-dotted line claims a significant portion of the South China Sea. The United States, although not directly involved, has economic and security interests in the region.
