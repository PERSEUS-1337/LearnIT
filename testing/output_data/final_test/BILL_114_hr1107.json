    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bureau of Reclamation Transparency Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of the Bureau of Reclamation's aging water infrastructure, valued at $94.5 billion in 2013, which supports various sectors in 17 states. Efforts have been made to manage these assets, including an annual review called the \"Asset Management Plan\". Actionable information on infrastructure conditions at the asset level, including maintenance needs due to aging infrastructure, is crucial for Congress to oversee Reclamation facilities and meet public needs. The curr_chunk is a section header for \"DEFINITIONS\" in a document. The curr_chunk defines \"asset\" as various assets used by the Bureau of Reclamation to manage water resources, including facilities, equipment, and structures. The curr_chunk defines \"Asset Management Report\" as the annual plan prepared by the Bureau of Reclamation to evaluate and manage infrastructure assets. It also defines \"major repair and rehabilitation need\" as major nonrecurring maintenance at Reclamation facilities. The curr_chunk defines \"Reclamation facility\" as infrastructure assets owned by the Bureau of Reclamation at a Reclamation project, including reserved works and transferred works. Reserved works are buildings, structures, facilities, or equipment owned by the Bureau of Reclamation for which operations and maintenance are performed by Bureau employees or through a contract. The term \"transferred works\" refers to a Reclamation facility where operations and maintenance are carried out by a non-Federal entity under a formal agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation. SEC. 4. Asset management report enhancements for reserved works. The Secretary must submit an Asset Management Report to Congress within 2 years of this Act, detailing efforts to maintain reserved works at Reclamation facilities and standardize data reporting. The report must also include a comprehensive assessment of major repair needs. The Asset Management Report must include a detailed assessment of major repair and rehabilitation needs for all reserved works at Reclamation projects, along with an itemized list of needs for individual facilities. The list should include cost estimates and categorical ratings for each item. The rating system must be consistent with specified requirements. The Secretary must issue guidance on the rating system for Reclamation facilities and make the Asset Management Report publicly available, including on the Internet. The Secretary may exclude sensitive or classified information from the public version of the Asset Management Report but must provide a version containing this information to specific committees. The report must be updated every 2 years and consultation is required as needed. The Secretary must consult with the Secretary of the Army and water and power contractors to prepare and update the Asset Management Report. SEC. 5. ASSET MANAGEMENT REPORT ENHANCEMENTS FOR TRANSFERRED WORKS. The Secretary will coordinate with non-Federal entities for reporting on major repair needs of transferred works similar to section 4(b). A rating system for transferred works will be developed based on input from water and power contractors, and included in updated Asset Management Reports. The Secretary will coordinate with non-Federal entities to report on major repair needs of transferred works, and a rating system for transferred works will be developed based on input from water and power contractors, included in updated Asset Management Reports."
