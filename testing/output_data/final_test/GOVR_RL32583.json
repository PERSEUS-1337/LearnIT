The shortage of domestic refining capacity has led to a need for substantial gasoline imports, which currently make up slightly over 10% of the nation's supply. Policy concerns include the availability of foreign supplies meeting U.S. specifications and the speed at which they can be provided to meet domestic demand. Legislative interest has been sparked by the nation's strained gasoline supply capacity. The House recently considered two bills related to increasing gasoline supply capacity. The Gasoline Price Reduction Act (H.R. 4545) aimed to simplify fuel blend requirements and allow waivers during supply disruptions. The United States Refinery Revitalization Act (H.R. 4517) focused on providing incentives to increase refinery capacity and centralizing the environmental permit process for new projects. Gasoline demand in the United States continues to grow, accounting for virtually all of the increase in total oil demand. Between 1999 and 2003, petroleum consumption increased by half a million barrels per day, with gasoline consumption rising from 8.4 mbd to 8.9 mbd. Gasoline use has continued to grow during the first half of 2004. Gasoline demand in the United States has continued to grow in the first half of 2004, with almost 9.0 mbd supplied to consumers, an increase of about 1.9% from the previous year. High pump prices may be slowing demand growth, but it is too early to determine if this trend will continue for the rest of the year. Gasoline is produced in U.S. refineries and imported from foreign refiners to meet demand. The United States imports slightly more than 10% of the gasoline it consumes to fill the gap between production and demand. Total gasoline imports have been rising, peaking at about 1.1 mbd in the summer of 2004. Ethanol-blended gasoline is replacing MTBE as an oxygenate additive in some states. Total gasoline imports in the United States peaked at about 1.1 mbd in the summer of 2004. Imports include conventional gasoline and Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) with specific environmental standards. RFG is used in areas with ozone problems and must contain oxygenates to meet requirements. Gasoline components, including oxygenates like MTBE or ethanol, are imported to meet the 2% oxygen requirement. RFG is in high demand during summer, comprising 29% of national demand. Refiners import 50% of gasoline components, blending them to meet U.S. specifications. Different types of gasoline are sold in the U.S. to comply with Clean Air Act requirements and state mandates. The trend towards ethanol blends in gasoline may continue due to the need to replace MTBE. Ethanol blends cannot be transported by pipeline and must be mixed near the point of consumption. Imported gasoline components are blended locally at terminals to meet market demands. Refiners benefit from blending gasoline from component parts as it provides a small supply bonus. U.S. refiners have the flexibility to purchase components on world markets and manufacture the rest in their own facilities, allowing them to produce around 8.0 mbd of gasoline per month. With demand just under 9.0 mbd, imports of finished gasoline and components bridge the gap, averaging about 900,000 barrels per day. The increasing use of blending components in building up the gasoline pool is seen in the rise of components as a proportion of nationwide gasoline inventories. Total gasoline stocks remained stable from 2003 to 2004, but blending components held in inventory increased significantly to meet the demand for locally-mixed ethanol blends and boutique fuels in fifteen states. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has raised concerns about the ability of refiners to provide diverse boutique fuels required by fifteen states during summer months to address clean air issues. Geographically isolated fuel programs may experience supply shortfalls and volatile prices when the entire fuel market is stressed. During the spring of 2000, the Chicago metro area faced a supply shortfall of gasoline components due to a pipeline failure from the Gulf Coast refining area. This, combined with difficulties in producing reformulated gasoline blendstock locally, led to a tight regional supply situation and volatile prices in the isolated fuel market. The Chicago metro area experienced a supply shortfall of gasoline components in spring 2000 due to a pipeline failure and difficulties in producing reformulated gasoline locally. This led to volatile prices in the isolated fuel market. The spike in prices nearly doubled in May and June but returned to normal levels by July due to supply from other sources and restored pipeline flow. Stakeholders are concerned about the proliferation of boutique fuels in the future and would like to see limits on new boutique fuel requirements. EPA notes that such disruptions have been limited in geographical scope and duration. Currently, one-third of gasoline imports in the U.S. come from Canada and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with another third from various countries like Argentina, the Netherlands, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela. Trends in gasoline imports and suppliers' shares are shown in Figure 5, highlighting fluctuations in supply amounts. Canada is the leading supplier of gasoline, with exports steadily increasing in recent years. The U.S. Virgin Islands houses the Hovenessa refinery, jointly owned by Amerada Hess. The U.S. imports gasoline from various countries, with Canada and the U.S. Virgin Islands being major suppliers. Venezuela's gasoline exports to the U.S. have decreased since a workers' strike in 2002. Efforts to regain market position by PDVSA may benefit supply, but refinery operations are still recovering. Additional gasoline imports now come from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. PDVSA has enhanced the supply of imported gasoline by exporting the complete cocktail for ethanol blended gasoline without the ethanol. They plan to export 1 million barrels per month of this high-priced component called RBOB. The extra barrels in the U.S. market have increased competition for comparable cargoes from Europe, impacting U.S. gasoline prices. Foreign gasoline components continue to attract foreign refiners due to high U.S. prices. Foreign refiners are attracted to U.S. gasoline prices, with PDVSA planning to export 12 RBOB cargoes to the United States in September. Valero Energy is revitalizing a refinery in Aruba to increase gasoline component production from low-quality crudes. The Aruba refinery has a capacity of 275,000 barrels per day, potentially impacting Gulf and East Coast gasoline supplies. Concerns arise over the dependence on imports for over 10% of national gasoline needs, which could contribute to high prices in 2004. Factors like cost, timeliness, and meeting U.S. specifications can affect price and supply at the gas pump. The cost of shipping gasoline and refined products is higher due to the need for clean vessels, resulting in higher unit costs compared to crude carriers. Imported products cost more than domestically refined ones due to transport costs, impacting the last units of gasoline supply and providing a price umbrella for domestic refiners. The importation of gasoline creates a price imbalance, leading to higher prices compared to domestic production. Foreign refiners may not respond quickly to price signals from the US market, potentially delaying the adjustment of supply to meet demand. The response of foreign refiners to U.S. prices is immediate, but it can take a month or more for the physical supply to arrive. Manufacturing fuel for the U.S. market may be delayed due to the production of certain substances not typically made in foreign refineries. Importing gasoline for over 10% of the nation's supply may lead to price increases and supply lags. The policy concern of foreign refined product dependence includes evaluating the availability of supplies meeting U.S. specifications, speed of incremental supply, delivered price compared to domestic output, and potential impact on prices. The nation lacks a defined policy on refined oil product imports. The nation lacks a defined policy on refined oil product imports and gasoline prices. Policymakers are concerned about price volatility and spot shortages at gas stations. Some policy initiatives in the 108th Congress focus on regional gasoline blends and expanding refinery capacity, such as H.R. 4545, the Gasoline Price Reduction Act. The Gasoline Price Reduction Act, aimed at addressing boutique gasoline blends and supply disruptions, failed to pass in the House. The bill proposed EPA waivers for boutique fuel requirements to increase supply fungibility but did not offer solutions to boost domestic gasoline production. Another bill, the Refinery Revitalization Act, passed the House to expedite environmental reviews for increasing refinery capacity. The Refinery Revitalization Act aims to fast-track environmental reviews and permits for new refineries in designated zones to increase capacity. Critics are concerned about potential environmental impacts and state clean air program overrides. H.R. 4545 raises concerns about the cost of gasoline and aims to address a 1 mbd gasoline production shortfall through domestic refinery capacity growth. This could reduce transportation costs and provide a quicker supply response to changes in demand, potentially shortening disruptive price spikes. However, the proposal does not address the historic lack of profitability in the refinery industry. The current refining situation may be profitable for many refiners in 2004, with record earnings in the first and second quarters. However, long-term profitability in the industry remains uncertain, hindering significant investments in capital equipment. Improved refining margins could lead to increased capacity investment, but it may take several years of high margins to convince firm managers and bankers. Improved refining margins could lead to increased capacity investment, but it might take several years of high margins before firm managers and bankers are confident enough to make substantial capital commitments."
