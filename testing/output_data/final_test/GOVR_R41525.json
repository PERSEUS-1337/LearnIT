    "content": "The Bureau of Prisons' mission is to confine offenders in safe, humane, and secure facilities while providing opportunities for self-improvement. Rehabilitative programs aim to prevent idleness and aid in inmates' reentry into society. Data analysis from 1997 and 2004 shows an increase in federal inmates needing rehabilitative programming and their participation in such programs. Between 1997 and 2004, there was an increase in the likelihood of inmates with reported needs participating in rehabilitative programs. The report discusses the resources available to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for providing these programs and the incentives for inmate participation. BOP, a component of the Department of Justice, is responsible for federal prisoners' custody and care. The report also includes a brief overview of BOP, its main rehabilitative programs, research on their effectiveness, and selected issues for Congress to consider. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was established in 1930 to centralize the administration of federal prisons. By 1940, BOP had opened 24 facilities to accommodate the growing inmate population. From 1940 to 1980, the number of prisons operated by BOP nearly doubled, with a focus on smaller facilities catering to specific security needs. Currently, BOP operates 117 correctional facilities housing around 178,000 inmates, with 82% in BOP-operated facilities and the rest in contract facilities. BOP correctional facilities are classified into five security levels: minimum, low, medium, high, or administrative, based on features like patrols, security barriers, and staff-to-inmate ratio. Residential Re-entry Centers (RRCs) provide assistance to inmates nearing release, offering structured environments, job placement services, and programs to help inmates reintegrate into the community. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) aims to reestablish ties to the community and supervise inmates' activities in Residential Re-entry Centers (RRCs) for successful reentry. BOP offers rehabilitative programs like work assignments through Federal Prison Industries (FPI), educational programs, and substance abuse treatment. Inmates are required to work if medically able, which helps with inmate management, teaches skills, and promotes a good work ethic. Inmates in Federal Prison Industries (FPI) jobs must have a high school diploma or GED. They are paid between $0.23 and $1.15 per hour. Inmates can participate in job training related to their assignment if they have enough time left on their sentences. FPI also offers scholarships for postsecondary education. 9.0% of inmates had an FPI work assignment in FY2010. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) provides inmates with education programs such as Literacy/GED and Occupational Education. BOP is required to offer functional literacy programs for capable inmates and literacy/GED programs for those without a high school diploma. Inmates must make progress towards earning a GED to receive good time credit. The literacy program helps inmates develop reading, math, and writing skills to prepare for a GED. Inmates without a high school diploma or GED are required to enroll in the adult literacy program for a minimum of 240 hours or until a GED is earned. Completing 240 hours allows inmates to opt out, but this may affect their ability to earn good time credit. Inmates without a high school diploma or GED must enroll in the adult literacy program for a minimum of 240 hours or until a GED is earned. Not participating in the literacy program or earning a GED can limit job assignments for inmates. BOP offers occupational education programs at most facilities, requiring a diploma, GED, or enrollment in a GED program. Training includes exploratory and marketable options for general knowledge or specific skill development. Inmates in federal facilities can participate in occupational education programs to train for post-release employment in various trades. The Bureau of Apprenticeship Training collaborates with the institution's education staff to develop registered apprenticeship programs. Inmates may need to make a co-payment for enrollment, limited to the cost of books. About 6.4% of federal inmates took part in occupational education courses in FY2010. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) offers drug abuse treatment programs for federal inmates, including education courses, non-residential treatment, residential treatment, and community transition treatment. Inmates convicted of nonviolent crimes can have their sentence reduced by completing a residential substance abuse treatment program. BOP screens new inmates for drug abuse issues and makes treatment referrals based on interviews and record reviews. Inmates sentenced or returned to custody due to parole violations after September 30, 1991, must participate in a drug abuse education course if alcohol or drug abuse contributed to the offense, led to the violation, or was recommended by the sentencing judge. The course educates inmates on the impact of drug abuse on crime and motivates them to seek further treatment. Inmates not required to participate in the drug abuse education course may volunteer for the non-residential drug abuse treatment program, which is designed to meet the treatment needs of inmates. Specific populations targeted for this program include those with minor drug abuse issues, those with time constraints, and those with longer sentences awaiting placement. Inmates with longer sentences awaiting placement in the residential drug abuse treatment program, those identified with a drug use history preparing for community transition, and those required to continue treatment in the general inmate population after completing the program. BOP reported 8.4% participation in non-residential drug abuse treatment in FY2010, with residential treatment available in 61 institutions. Eligibility for residential treatment requires a documented drug abuse problem, no serious mental impairment, agreement to program responsibilities, and voluntary participation. Inmates in residential drug abuse treatment programs spend half their day in treatment and the other half in education, work skills training, or other programs. The program lasts 6 to 12 months with a minimum of 500 hours. 10.9% of federal inmates participated in residential drug abuse treatment in FY2010. Inmates must also complete follow-up treatment with a community-based provider for early release eligibility. According to BOP, 9.8% of federal inmates participated in community transition drug abuse treatment in FY2010. Research suggests that inmates who participated in various educational and vocational programs were less likely to recidivate. However, studies on rehabilitative programming have limitations, including a lack of scientific rigor and varying definitions. Alternative explanations for the treatment's effect include different definitions of recidivism and follow-up periods in studies. Selection bias is common as inmates often volunteer for rehabilitation programs, leading to difficulties in determining causation. Attrition from the treatment group is often not controlled for in many studies. Many studies lack control for attrition in the treatment group, making it crucial to compare those who complete treatment with dropouts and non-treated inmates. Even with rigorous methodologies, studies struggle to pinpoint specific program aspects that influence outcomes. Differentiating between types of programs is often overlooked, with inmates participating in multiple interventions. Data collection on variables affecting recidivism chances is also lacking in some studies. Some studies lack data on variables affecting recidivism chances or the impact of interventions. An analysis found that less methodologically rigorous studies were more likely to report a treatment effect and larger effect sizes. This trend persisted even when comparing randomized to high-quality non-randomized studies. The researchers found that high-quality non-randomized studies, where researchers attempted to control for differences between treatment and control groups, were more likely to show positive effects. This suggests that research design impacts study outcomes in criminal justice. The analysis also examined changes in the need for rehabilitative programming between 1997 and 2004 using data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics' Survey. The analysis of federal inmates between 1997 and 2004 using data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics' Survey shows an increased need for drug abuse treatment programs, while the need for literacy/GED and occupational education programs remained unchanged. In 1997 and 2004, a quarter of federal inmates lacked a GED or high school diploma, and about 30% were unemployed before arrest. In 2004, inmates were more likely to have used drugs regularly and before arrest. The report analyzes inmate participation in rehabilitative programs like FPI work assignments and education. Between 1997 and 2004, there was a decrease in inmates with FPI work assignments but an increase in those participating in drug education programs. Logistic regression analysis showed that unemployed inmates before arrest were not significantly more likely to have FPI work assignments. In both 1997 and 2004, inmates who were unemployed before arrest were less likely to participate in occupational education programs. Those without a GED or high school diploma were more likely to be in a literacy/GED program. Inmates with drug use history were more likely to be in drug abuse treatment programs. There was no significant difference in programming participation for inmates with rehabilitative needs between 1997 and 2004. The analysis suggests that inmates with rehabilitative needs were not guaranteed to participate in programs addressing their needs, with less than a 50% probability. For instance, the likelihood of an unemployed inmate having an FPI work assignment was about 1 in 5 in both 1997 and 2004. The analysis indicates that inmates with rehabilitative needs had a low probability of participating in programs to address those needs. For example, the likelihood of an unemployed inmate participating in occupational education courses was about 2 in 5 for both 1997 and 2004. Additionally, inmates with a history of drug use had a 1 in 10 chance of participating in drug abuse treatment in both years. The probability of participation in drug abuse education courses increased from 1 in 5 in 1997 to 3 in 10 in 2004 for inmates with drug use history. Inmates without a GED or high school diploma were more likely to participate in literacy/GED courses, with a 1 in 2 chance in 1997 and a 3 in 5 chance in 2004. The analysis suggests that the highest-participating inmates had low probabilities of participating in rehabilitative programs. For instance, in 1997, the probability of these inmates with a history of drug use participating in a residential drug abuse program was about 3 in 10, which increased to 2 in 5 by 2004. Additionally, the likelihood of unemployed inmates engaging in occupational education courses was approximately 3 in 5 in 1997 and 3 in 10 in 2004. The participation rates in rehabilitative programs among inmates with specific needs varied over time. In 1997, about 1 in 5 inmates in a drug abuse program increased to 3 in 10 by 2004. The likelihood of high-participating inmates with drug use history attending drug education courses was 1 in 2 in both years. Similarly, inmates without a GED or high school diploma had a 3 in 5 chance of participating in literacy/GED programs in both 1997 and 2004. However, the data used for analysis is outdated, raising questions about potential changes in participation rates since 2004. The participation rates in rehabilitative programs among federal inmates have remained steady from FY2000 to FY2011, except for a decrease in those with FPI work assignments. The proportion of inmates in drug abuse education courses increased in FY2010 and FY2011 compared to FY2000-2009, but this is the basic form of drug abuse treatment offered. Data suggests that unless inmates with rehabilitative needs increased after FY2004, overall participation trends have not changed significantly. The data from BOP suggests that trends in rehabilitative programming observed in 1997 and 2004 surveys may still apply to current federal inmates. It is unclear if BOP is providing programming to all inmates in need or if inmates are choosing not to participate. Congress may need to consider if BOP has enough resources to provide rehabilitative programming effectively. The BOP has been facing challenges in managing the increasing federal inmate population while ensuring their care and safety, as well as that of BOP staff and surrounding communities, within budget constraints. Despite increased appropriations, a growing percentage of the budget is allocated to mandatory requirements like inmate medical care and staffing. The inmate-to-staff ratio has also increased over the years, with fewer staff members per 1,000 inmates. Congress is overseeing BOP's operations to ensure efficient use of resources. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has seen a rise in its inmate population from 242.0 in FY2000 to 202.2 in FY2011. Congress is examining whether BOP has sufficient staffing levels and facilities to effectively rehabilitate inmates. BOP opened 50 new prisons between FY1991 and FY2012 to provide more classrooms and factories for rehabilitative programs and reduce crowding. However, crowding in BOP institutions remained high, averaging 37% over capacity between FY2005 and FY2012. BOP plans to add 12,000 new bedspaces between FY2012 and FY2018. BOP plans to add 12,000 new bedspaces between FY2012 and FY2018, but still projects prison crowding to increase. Congress may need to consider increasing funding for BOP to expand capacity and reduce crowding. Another issue is whether low and medium security offenders should be placed in privately operated prisons. The abolition of parole for federal inmates under the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 was not due to a single event but a culmination of critiques on sentencing policy since the 1970s. In the 1970s, there were debates over judicial and parole board discretion in sentencing. Some saw it as arbitrary, while others viewed it as coddling criminals. By the late 1970s, states and the federal government began limiting judicial discretion with determinate sentences and \"truth-in-sentencing\" laws. Congress also reduced incentives for inmates by eliminating parole and modifying good time credit. Congress reduced incentives for inmates to participate in rehabilitative programs and earn good time credit by modifying parole considerations and industrial good time credit eligibility. The law reduced incentives for inmates to participate in rehabilitative programs and earn good time credit by limiting industrial good time credit eligibility to prisoners performing exceptionally meritorious service or duties of outstanding importance. Under current law, inmates may not receive full good time credit if they do not make satisfactory progress towards a high school diploma or GED. Even with full credit, inmates serve about 85% of their sentence, longer than before. The Bureau of Prisons can reduce a nonviolent inmate's sentence by up to one year for participating in substance abuse treatment. Policymakers could consider offering more good time credit or longer treatment to incentivize participation in rehabilitative programs, such as earning a vocational degree for additional credit. Providing additional good time credit for inmates to participate in rehabilitative programming may incentivize participation solely for reducing prison time, rather than for reentry preparation. This could lead to resource restrictions preventing some inmates from benefiting and releasing unrehabilitated inmates early. The analysis conducted for this report used data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics' Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional. The Bureau of Justice Statistics' Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities collects data on inmates' offenses, criminal history, family background, drug use, gun possession, and prison activities. Interviews for the survey were conducted in 1997 and 2004 using a two-stage sampling design. In 2004, female and male prisons were selected with certainty. Male prisons were grouped into five strata based on security level, while female prisons were grouped into two strata. Samples were selected based on prison population size. In the second stage, inmates were selected using a predetermined skip interval. The federal prison population was oversampled to ensure enough non-drug offenders were included in the sample. In the 1997 survey, 4,041 out of 4,479 selected inmates were interviewed, representing 89,072 federal inmates. In the 2004 survey, 3,686 out of 4,253 selected inmates were interviewed, representing 129,299 federal inmates. The survey data is available for download. The survey data from 2004 represented 129,299 federal inmates. Certain variables were redacted to protect inmate privacy, requiring a restricted data use agreement with NACJD. Logistic regression models were used to test relationships between variables. Logistic regression models were used to test the relationship between six dependent variables related to inmate programs and four indicators of rehabilitative need. Dummy coded variables were analyzed using the SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure in SAS 9.2. The analysis utilized dummy coded variables and the SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure in SAS 9.2 to adjust standard errors for the complex sampling design. Inmates who were held in prison but not incarcerated were excluded from the analysis. Missing data were imputed logically by reviewing the survey instrument, with the MI procedure used for data that could not be logically imputed. The analysis used dummy coded variables and the SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure in SAS 9.2 to adjust standard errors for the complex sampling design. Missing data were imputed logically, with the MI procedure used for data that could not be logically imputed. Coefficients were estimated using 1997 and 2004 data, with significance tests conducted to compare coefficients. The estimated effect of variables on inmate participation in rehabilitative programs was calculated using a formula by Paul Allison. This formula, along with coefficients from Table A-1 and Table A-2, can be used to calculate the probability of inmate participation in different groups. The formula allows comparison of inmate participation in rehabilitative programming between different groups or across different years. Data limitations include the age of the data, with the most recent being over six years old, potentially impacting the accuracy of trends observed. Self-reported survey data may introduce measurement errors due to inaccurate inmate recollection. The survey data on federal inmates may have limitations as it did not collect data on all variables, such as parole eligibility. This could lead to biased coefficients in the analysis. Caution is advised when interpreting the likelihood of inmates with rehabilitative needs participating in programs. The variables \"regularly used drugs\" and \"used drugs before arrest\" are rough proxies for a diagnosis. The variables \"regularly used drugs\" and \"used drugs before arrest\" may not accurately diagnose drug abuse in federal inmates."
