    "content": "Strong relations between the United States and Israel have led to bilateral cooperation in various areas, including addressing threats and shared concerns about Iran. Other significant matters include tension with Iran and Hezbollah at Israel's northern border, Israeli-Palestinian issues, and domestic political issues in Israel. Israel relies on strengths like robust military capabilities and close cooperation with the US to manage security threats. It maintains military superiority over neighbors and Palestinians, updating efforts to project strength and defend borders. Israel has reduced unconventional threats through missile defense systems, cyber defense, and heightened security measures. Israel has a robust homeland security system with early warning practices, border controls, and reinforced buildings. They have proposed a national border fence network and a separation barrier in the West Bank. Israel maintains a policy of \"nuclear opacity\" and is estimated to possess around 80-85 nuclear warheads. Israel's nuclear ambiguity has been supported by the United States since 1969, with estimates of around 80-85 warheads. Israel may have nuclear weapons deployable via various means. Israeli officials closely consult with the U.S. to influence decision-making on regional issues. The U.S. commits to providing Israel with military aid and joint missile defense programs. Israel and the United States collaborate on joint missile defense programs, with Israel receiving $500 million annually from FY2019 to FY2028. Israeli officials are concerned about Iran's influence and nuclear program, leading to closer relations with Arab Gulf states to counter Iran. Prime Minister Netanyahu aims to influence U.S. decisions on the Iran nuclear agreement. Prime Minister Netanyahu opposed the JCPOA and supported President Trump's decision to withdraw from it in May 2018. He presented Israeli intelligence information to question Iran's credibility and warned about its nuclear ambitions post-JCPOA. Netanyahu also claimed Iran has a secret atomic warehouse in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly in September 2018. An unnamed U.S. intelligence official stated that the facility identified by Netanyahu would not allow Iran to accelerate its nuclear breakout. Former Israeli officials speculated on potential actions against Iranian nuclear facilities if Iran violates the JCPOA. Netanyahu clarified that he was not seeking a military confrontation with Iran, despite tensions between the two countries over Iran's presence in Syria. Israel has used airstrikes to prevent Iranian weapons shipments to Hezbollah in Lebanon during the early years of the Syria conflict. Israeli leaders have pledged to prevent Iran from establishing bases in Syria with Iranian backing. Israeli and Iranian forces have targeted each other in Syrian and Israeli-controlled areas since 2018. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that Israel has targeted Iranian and Hezbollah targets in Syria \"hundreds of times.\" Limited Israeli strikes could escalate into wider conflict, especially with U.S. involvement in Syria influencing Israeli decisions. Israeli officials support continued U.S. presence in Syria to counter Iran's efforts to supply weapons to Lebanon. Israeli officials are preparing for the possibility of taking direct responsibility for countering Iran in Syria, as Russia's advanced air defense systems there could hinder Israeli operations. Russia has deployed S-400 and S-300 systems in Syria but has not interfered with Israeli air strikes against Iranian or Syrian targets. Israel and Russia maintain communication to avoid conflicts in their operations. Since September 2018, Israel has been cautious about Russian S-300 air defense systems in Syria, which could impact Israeli military actions. Israeli air strikes have decreased, and President Trump recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel in March 2019. President Trump's proclamation recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel, changing long-standing U.S. policy. Israel gained control of the Golan from Syria in 1967 and annexed it in 1981. The international community insists the Golan's status has not changed, with Congress introducing bills in reaction to the proclamation. In February 2019, Congress introduced bills (S. 567 and H.R. 1372) supporting Israeli sovereignty claims to the Golan Heights. Israeli leaders had previously engaged in talks with Syria for returning parts of the Golan, but due to the civil war and Iran's presence in the region, Netanyahu shifted focus to gaining international support for Israel's sovereignty claims. Iran has targeted Israeli positions in the Golan during conflicts with Israel. The Syrian government denounces the U.S. policy change on the Golan Heights as illegal and vows to recover the territory. Observers believe the policy change could strengthen Syrian President Bashar al Asad by uniting nationalistic sentiment against Israel and diverting attention from Iran's activities in Syria. The UNDOF has patrolled the Golan Heights since 1974, with Israel facing minimal military resistance despite security threats. Periodic U.N. resolutions have criticized Israel's actions. Periodic U.N. resolutions have criticized Israel's occupation and settlement activities in the Golan Heights. Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah persist, with concerns about wider conflict and Hezbollah's buildup of weapons. Israeli officials highlight Hezbollah's use of Lebanese civilian areas as strongholds. Ongoing tension between Israel and Iran in Syria raises the potential for Hezbollah to open another front against Israel. Lebanon is preparing to open a new front against Israel by transferring weapons to Hezbollah and building military infrastructure. Israel conducted \"Operation Northern Shield\" to seal Hezbollah attack tunnels. Israeli officials aim to deter Hezbollah while consulting with UNIFIL. President Trump has shown interest in brokering Israeli-Palestinian peace. President Trump's Administration has prepared a proposal for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, but its release has been repeatedly delayed. Factors contributing to the delays include U.S. actions on Jerusalem, tensions in Gaza, reduced Palestinian funding, Israeli settlements, and political constraints. The U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital has strained relations with the Palestinians and faced opposition from other countries. Countries opposed President Trump's actions on Jerusalem at the United Nations, leading to Palestinian leaders breaking off high-level political contacts with the U.S. The Palestinian Authority continues security coordination with Israel in the West Bank, despite tensions. U.S. funding to the Palestinians has been cut off, affecting prospects for Israeli-Palestinian talks. PLO Chairman/PA President Abbas criticized Administration actions that he claimed took disputed issues off the negotiating table. Funding for economic and humanitarian needs in the West Bank and Gaza is at stake. In response to Israel withholding tax revenue, the PA rejected monthly transfers, which make up 65% of its budget. Seeking financial support from the private sector and Arab League for a \"financial safety net.\" The U.S. ended bilateral aid to the Palestinians in January 2019 due to the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act. The PA refused aid that subjected it to federal court jurisdiction. U.S. aid may resume if Congress amends the ATCA or the Administration changes how the aid is provided. Jared Kushner plans to release a peace plan after Israeli national elections in April 2019. In 2019, Kushner revealed a peace plan with detailed proposals for Israel and the PLO. Despite skepticism, the Administration aims for realistic solutions and Arab states' support. Key Arab states may assist in countering Iranian influence and warming Arab-Israeli ties. Reports suggest that key Arab Gulf states remain reluctant to embrace formal relations with Israel without a resolution of the Palestinian issue. Saudi Arabia expressed concerns over the U.S. recognition of Israel's claims in the Golan Heights, warning of negative effects on the peace process. Prime Minister Netanyahu's statement on retaining territory captured in defensive wars raised speculation about potential annexation of the West Bank. Days before the April elections, Netanyahu vowed to apply Israeli law to West Bank settlements if he wins. The upcoming Israeli national elections on April 9, 2019, and the subsequent government formation process will have significant implications for the country's leadership and future policies. Netanyahu faces a challenge from the centrist Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid. Despite setbacks such as corruption indictments and misconduct allegations, Likud could still potentially win. In July 2018, the Knesset passed a Basic Law defining Israel as the national homeland of the Jewish people, sparking concerns about the place of Arabs in Israeli society. Netanyahu's Likud party could potentially form the next coalition despite possibly getting fewer Knesset seats than Blue and White. Netanyahu's statements about Israel being a Jewish state have reignited debate about the 2018 law and sought support from sympathetic voter groups during the election campaign."
