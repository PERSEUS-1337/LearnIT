    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Veterans Freedom of Healthcare Act\". Congress finds that all veterans deserve the opportunity to seek healthcare at a facility of their choice, regardless of logistical impediments such as travel, wait times, and enrollment difficulty. These barriers are widely cited among veterans and have been reported on extensively, including instances of veterans' deaths. In 2014, Congress investigated pervasive and systemic impediments in the VA healthcare system, highlighted by the deaths of 40 veterans at the Phoenix Veterans' Hospital. Approximately 867,000 veteran applications were pending for health care enrollment, with over half of them having unknown wait times. The VA struggled to meet the goal of one psychiatrist per 1,000 mental health patients, with 70% of hospitals lacking sufficient psychiatrists to meet demand. The Inspector General found that many VA psychiatrists saw over 800 to 900 veterans per year, leading to some veterans only being seen once annually due to high demand. A study by the National Institutes of Health identified barriers for female veterans seeking care, such as lack of female-specific services and long wait times. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 aimed to provide veterans with more healthcare options, but the eligibility metrics are deemed insufficient. Many veterans face obstacles in accessing healthcare at VA medical facilities, such as long commutes and crossing state lines for care. Despite these challenges, veterans appreciate the specialized care provided by VA hospitals and should have the choice to continue receiving care within the VA system. Expansion of choice program for Department of Veterans Affairs. Expansion of choice program for Department of Veterans Affairs includes the elimination of sunset provision and expansion of eligibility criteria. Expansion of eligibility criteria for Department of Veterans Affairs choice program to include veterans enrolled in patient enrollment system seeking initial appointment for care or services. The Secretary shall make changes to eligibility criteria for the Department of Veterans Affairs choice program, including veterans seeking initial appointments for care. This involves adjustments to subsections (f)(1), (g), and (p)(2)(A) of the Veterans Health Administration. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must ensure that veterans with service-connected disabilities rated 50 percent or greater receive timely and high-quality healthcare at Department medical facilities, focusing on treating ailments unique to the veteran population, including mental health services. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must report to Congress on the effectiveness of the Veterans Choice Program and ensuring access to healthcare for veterans enrolled in the system. The amendments made by this section will apply to hospital care and medical services for veterans 90 days after the enactment of the Act."
