If summoned by a motor club, they need the club's business name. When a towing company is requested to stop at the scene by the owner of a disabled vehicle, they must have specific information in writing, including the person who requested the stop, details of the disabled vehicle, and the time of the request. If summoned by a motor club, they also need the club's business name, referral identification number, and summoning date and time. The towing company summoned by a law enforcement officer must have specific written information before leaving the scene, including the identity of the agency. The towing company summoned by a law enforcement officer must have specific written information, including the agency's identity, log number, date, and time of the incident. The towing company or tow truck operator must provide written information to law enforcement upon request and maintain it for three years. The information must be available for inspection within 48 hours of a written request from authorized agencies. Prior to attaching a vehicle to the tow truck, the towing company must provide the vehicle owner with a written itemized estimate of all charges and services to be performed, including details such as company information, tow truck details, operator names, service descriptions, and costs. The tow truck operator must obtain the vehicle owner's signature on the itemized estimate before towing the vehicle. The towing company or tow truck owner must keep written documents for three years and make them available for inspection within 48 hours upon request from law enforcement agencies. The towing company or tow truck operator cannot charge fees exceeding specified limits, except in certain circumstances such as when summoned by a motor club or law enforcement. The towing company cannot charge fees exceeding specified limits, except in cases where requested by a law enforcement agency under an agreement or within 48 hours of a written request from specified authorities. A person who willfully violates specified sections may face a misdemeanor charge with a fine of up to $2,500 or imprisonment for up to three months, or both. This section does not apply to certain circumstances. The law does not apply to certain vehicles, such as those owned by motor clubs providing uncompensated services or tow truck operators employed by law enforcement agencies. A business taking possession of a vehicle from a tow truck must document specific details including the towing company's information, tow truck operator's details, vehicle information, and the date and time of possession. If the vehicle is dropped off after hours, the information must be obtained the next day.
