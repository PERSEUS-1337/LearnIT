Amendment to the Internal Revenue Code regarding exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence for employees of the uniformed services, Foreign Service of the United States, and the intelligence community. Definition of an employee of the intelligence community is provided. The term 'employee of the intelligence community' refers to an employee of various intelligence agencies, as defined by section 2105 of title 5, United States Code. The term 'employee of the intelligence community' includes employees from various intelligence agencies within the Department of Defense, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, FBI, Treasury, Energy, Coast Guard, and State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research. The special rule relating to the intelligence community states that an employee must have moved from one duty station to another to be considered serving on qualified extended duty. The amendment specifies that for an employee to be considered serving on qualified extended duty in the intelligence community, they must have moved from one duty station to another, with at least one station located outside specific metropolitan areas. The heading for the relevant section in the Internal Revenue Code is also updated. The effective date for these changes is retroactive to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The amendment allows for a waiver of limitations on tax refunds or credits if prevented by law, including res judicata, as long as a claim is filed within one year of the enactment of the Act."
