    "content": "Recent interest in potential changes to Senate procedural rules has sparked renewed discussion about the procedures for considering such changes. This report focuses on the rules governing how the Senate can address changes in procedural rules, particularly when controversial, and special considerations at the start of a new Congress. The \"cloture rule\" and rules related to filibusters have been the main focus of recent discussions. The term \"filibuster\" is informally used to describe actions that delay Senate business. It historically involved extended debate but now includes various obstructive tactics. Recent discussions focus on proposals to change Senate rules to restrict filibusters, which could also be filibustered. The report focuses on procedural mechanisms for changing Senate rules, specifically through adoption of a Senate Resolution. It does not address recent proposals to change the cloture rule or specific features of Senate rules related to filibustering. Each house of Congress has plenary power over its own rules, and the Senate typically uses a simple resolution for rule changes. The Senate adopts its rules through simple resolutions, with some standing orders lasting for the duration of a Congress and others continuing unless altered. Special procedures are used for specific measures. The Senate adopts rules through simple resolutions, with some standing orders lasting for a Congress. Special procedures are used for specific measures, understood as enacted pursuant to the chamber's constitutional rulemaking power. Procedural precedents are established by rulings of the chair and Senate votes on appeals. Proposed procedural changes are typically sought in the form of a simple resolution amending the Standing Rules of the Senate. Key elements in considering controversial resolutions include adoption by a simple majority vote. The Senate adopts rules through simple resolutions, with special procedures for controversial measures. A supermajority vote may be needed to limit consideration time and amendments. The resolution must be reported from committee or reach the order of business for consideration. Simple resolutions changing Standing Rules follow standard procedures in the Senate. The Senate can agree to measures by a simple majority vote, with a quorum present. The Constitution requires a majority of all Senators for a quorum. The Senate has the power to establish supermajority requirements, but some argue against it. Proponents of change may argue that a higher standard than a simple majority is unconstitutional. The Senate can establish supermajority requirements for adopting rules, but some argue it may conflict with the constitutional grant of rulemaking power. The Senate has changed its Standing Rules with less than a supermajority, as seen in the example of repealing Senate Rule XXXVI. Resolutions to change Senate Rules are debatable, with no general limits on debate. Senate Rules do not have general limits on debate for debatable questions, except through cloture. Cloture limits further consideration to 30 hours. Resolutions to change Senate rules can be amended, with restrictions imposed by unanimous consent or cloture. Amendments may be offered under cloture. Senate Rules do not have general limits on debate for debatable questions, except through cloture. Cloture limits further consideration to 30 hours and requires a supermajority vote. Amendments may be considered only if they are germane to the matter on which cloture was invoked and were filed in advance. Invoking cloture requires three-fifths of the full Senate membership. The Senate Rules require a supermajority vote for cloture to limit debate to 30 hours. A supermajority is also needed to bring the Senate to a point where it can vote on amending the Rules, but a simple majority can then adopt the proposal itself. The Senate can take up a measure for consideration by unanimous consent or a motion to proceed. For controversial rules changes, a motion to proceed is necessary, which can be filibustered. Cloture may need to be invoked on the motion to proceed for the Senate to vote on the measure. The Senate may require a two-thirds supermajority vote to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed to consider a rules change resolution. This would then lead to a simple majority vote on the motion, followed by another two-thirds supermajority vote to limit debate on the resolution itself. Additionally, the motion to proceed can only be offered on a measure that has been on the Calendar of General Orders for at least one legislative day. The Senate must intervene between placing a measure on the Calendar and proceeding to consider it. Senate resolutions are typically reported from committee before reaching the Calendar. If a resolution is referred to committee, the Senate cannot consider it until the committee reports it back. A simple resolution can be brought to the floor through an alternative procedure involving unanimous consent. When a resolution is \"laid over\" for consideration in the Senate, it can only be taken up during the \"morning hour\" on a subsequent legislative day if the Senate finishes routine business within a two-hour period. If not completed, the resolution is placed on the Calendar of General Orders for further consideration. When a resolution is \"laid over\" for consideration in the Senate, it can only be taken up during the \"morning hour\" on a subsequent legislative day if the Senate finishes routine business within a two-hour period. The resolution may be called up for further consideration by unanimous consent or motion to proceed, which could be subjected to filibuster. The Senate typically gives unanimous consent not to have a morning hour, and opponents can delay the resolution by engaging in tactics until the two-hour morning hour expires. Additional restrictions apply to resolutions proposing changes in Standing Rules. Proposing a change in Standing Rules requires one day's notice in writing. The Senate could consider a rules change resolution immediately upon submission if the required notice had been given on a previous day. Supporters of a proposed change might avoid difficulties by framing it as a standing order established through a simple resolution. The requirement for a supermajority of two-thirds of Senators present and voting to invoke cloture applies only to changes in the Standing Rules. For all other matters, including simple resolutions establishing standing orders, cloture requires a supermajority of three-fifths of the full Senate membership (60 votes). If a resolution establishing new procedures is framed as a standing order, it may be easier to meet the cloture requirement. The procedure for a resolution establishing a standing order is similar to one changing the Standing Rules, as it would be debatable. A standing order, like a change to the Standing Rules, would be debatable and amendable. The motion to proceed to its consideration would also be debatable. If immediate consideration is objected to, the resolution would either be referred to committee or considered in a morning hour on a subsequent day. Procedural changes could be included in a bill or joint resolution, with different cloture requirements depending on the type of regulation established. The Senate has procedures for proposing changes to Standing Rules or standing orders, with different requirements for consideration. Bills and joint resolutions are typically referred to committee before receiving floor consideration, unless considered immediately by unanimous consent. Additionally, Rule XIV allows for direct placement of a bill or joint resolution on the Senate floor. Rule XIV is a procedure in the Senate that allows a bill or joint resolution to bypass committee referral and be placed directly on the Calendar of General Orders after being introduced. This process involves several steps that must occur on different legislative days, typically taking two or three days to complete. Once on the Calendar, the measure can be considered under normal Senate procedures. Unlike a simple resolution, a bill under Rule XIV is not restricted to specific times for consideration. Additionally, changes to Senate procedure can be included in a concurrent resolution. A concurrent resolution in the Senate follows similar procedures as simple resolutions, including the possibility of being laid over to a subsequent day. If not considered or laid over, it would be referred to committee and could only receive floor consideration if reported by the committee. Provisions amending Standing Rules in a concurrent resolution would require a debatable motion to proceed, with one calendar day's notice. This notice requirement also applies to proposals amending Standing Rules, but not to those establishing a standing order or procedural regulation. The process of enacting bills and joint resolutions requires participation from the House and the President, while a concurrent resolution only needs approval from both the Senate and House. Approval by the Senate alone is not sufficient to enact procedural changes, as final approval from both chambers is necessary. The potential difficulty in changing Senate procedures is the filibuster by opponents, requiring a supermajority vote for cloture. Supporters seek alternative paths to avoid this, such as establishing new precedents or reinterpreting existing regulations to allow a simple majority to bring about a vote on rule changes. Changing Senate procedures by establishing new precedents or reinterpreting existing rules to allow a simple majority to bring about a vote on rule changes has been referred to as the \"nuclear option\" or \"constitutional option.\" The Senate has always had the power to interpret its own rules, but historical experience shows that it is challenging to do so in the face of filibustering opposition without violating existing rules and practices. The \"nuclear option\" involves changing Senate procedures to allow a simple majority to bring about a vote on rule changes, potentially violating existing rules and practices. The Senate's power to interpret its own rules could lead to procedural questions that would need to be framed and accepted by the Senate to establish new precedents. The procedural question must be framed in a way that allows the Senate to reach a vote without facing a filibuster. Without this, opponents could filibuster the procedural question, making it difficult to establish new precedents. This is illustrated through the consideration of the \"nuclear option\" in recent discussions. The proposed proceeding for the Senate is based on the argument that a simple majority should be able to close consideration of proposals to establish or amend Senate rules. This is in response to the Senate's practice of treating rules as continuously in effect from one Congress to the next. In 1959, Rule V paragraph 2 was established to declare the perpetual applicability of Senate rules for considering business and rule changes. The Senate's Rule V paragraph 2 states that Senate rules continue from one Congress to the next unless changed. This is based on the idea that the Senate is a \"continuing body\" and does not need to start afresh each Congress. If a filibuster occurs against a rule change proposal, a supermajority vote may be needed to overcome it. The Senate, as a continuing body, maintains a quorum even at the start of a new Congress. The decision to keep rules in effect is known as the \"continuing body doctrine,\" separate from the simple fact of the Senate's continuity. The Senate could choose to change this decision. The Senate's decision to treat its rules as continuously in effect has implications for changing rules, making it difficult to overcome filibusters. The existing rules tend to prevent changes, but the Senate can still adopt changes by a simple majority vote. Supporters of changing Senate rules argue that the current requirement for a supermajority for cloture restricts the power of a simple majority to determine the rules. They believe the Senate should be able to make decisions without needing a supermajority. The Constitution allows a new Senate to change rules without needing a supermajority, as argued by supporters of Senate rule changes regarding the filibuster. The Senate has considered such arguments but has never fully endorsed them, even though there was a vote in support in 1975. The Senate has debated the issue of rules changes and the continuing-body doctrine, with supporters arguing that rules can be changed at the beginning of a new Congress without needing a supermajority. However, the Senate has not fully endorsed this argument, despite a vote in support in 1975. The debate has raised questions about whether the rules of the previous Congress are in effect until the Senate takes action to accept them. Advocates argue that Senate rules can be changed at the beginning of a new Congress without a supermajority. The debate questions whether previous Congress rules are in effect until the Senate accepts them. The cloture rule and layover requirements for resolutions are examples of rules that could be rejected. The Senate's legislative day may continue for weeks, supporting the argument that it is still at the beginning of its session. Resolutions must be laid over for consideration on a subsequent day. Bills must go through several steps before being placed on the Calendar for Senate consideration. If referred to committee, a bill may only be considered if the committee reports it. The Senate's legislative day can last for weeks, suggesting it is still at the beginning of its session. Bills must go through steps before being placed on the Calendar for consideration, only if the committee subsequently reports them. The Senate may not take up a measure with rule changes until a new legislative day, potentially affecting the argument for rule changes by a simple majority process. The Senate may preserve special conditions at the beginning of a Congress by unanimous consent. Rules regarding layover requirements and rule changes may not apply until re-adopted. Supporters of rule changes may consider a \"nuclear option\" to bring about Senate acceptance of proposed procedural principles at the start of a new Congress. The \"nuclear option\" in the Senate involves using a procedural tactic to establish desired rule changes at the beginning of a new Congress. This tactic involves raising a point of order, appealing the chair's ruling, and then moving to lay the appeal on the table to overrule it and affirm the chair's decision. This approach bypasses traditional parliamentary procedures. The chair in a deliberative assembly must rule in accordance with existing rules and precedential interpretations, even if it goes against a new interpretation. This ruling is crucial for opponents to appeal and supporters to establish their new interpretation through a non-debatable motion. The Senate has the power to determine its own rules and can potentially overturn old precedents by a simple majority vote on an appeal. Appeals are generally debatable, allowing opponents of change to filibuster and prevent the establishment of a new precedent. Supporters of change may struggle to establish a new precedent by filibustering the vote on the appeal. If the motion to table the appeal wins, the old precedent would be reaffirmed, and if it loses, the filibuster could continue. Supporters might find it challenging to secure their desired result without a way to limit consideration of the appeal by a simple majority vote. This situation could replicate the initial difficulties supporters of change were facing. Supporters may face challenges in changing Senate practice through procedural means, especially if a constitutional question is involved. The chair cannot rule on procedural questions with constitutional implications and must submit them to the Senate for decision. Resolving such situations favorably to procedural change without being subject to filibuster remains unclear. The Senate can establish new interpretations through a simple majority vote, but procedural questions are debatable and subject to filibustering. To successfully change procedures, supporters must present a question that, if agreed upon by a majority, would limit debate on the rules change proposal. This could involve immediately putting the proposal to a vote and raising a point of order if challenged. The Senate rules do not recognize a motion that is out of order, creating a dilemma for supporters of procedural change. The chair can choose to submit the point of order directly to the Senate for a decision, even if it involves a constitutional question. This discretion has been used in the past to allow the Senate to vote on procedural questions. The chair has discretion to submit procedural questions to the Senate for decision, potentially subject to filibuster but also to a motion to lay on the table. Tabling a point of order is equivalent to overruling it, allowing a simple majority to proceed with a vote on a rules change proposal. The Senate's decision on a point of order could set a precedent for changing rules without a supermajority vote. This departure from established practice was seen in 1975 but later reversed. The Senate's decision on a point of order in 1975 set a precedent for changing rules without a supermajority vote, which was later reversed due to the complexity of the motion involving multiple questions. In 1975, the Senate admitted a compound motion for consideration, which opponents then demanded to be divided for debate and voting. The Senate proceeded to consider the first division of the motion, but had not yet acted on the second division. The Senate did not act on the second division of the motion, leading to extended debate on the first division. A compromise resolution was negotiated to address the issue, involving a compound motion or one purporting to provide for its own disposition."
