    "content": "Beginning in early 2001, Presidents George W. Bush and Vicente Fox of Mexico engaged in discussions on migration and border security issues, building on past policies despite challenges such as the 9/11 attacks and disagreements over Iraq. They focused on immigration reforms dating back to 1986 and 1996, as well as initiatives by previous administrations. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, also known as the LIFE Act of 2000, included penalties for employers hiring undocumented workers, increased border control, anti-discrimination measures, and provisions for legalizing certain undocumented migrants with ties to the US. In 1996, Congress passed two major immigration reform measures to control illegal immigration and limit alien eligibility for federal programs. One was the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), which increased penalties for unlawful presence in the US. The other was the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which aimed to control illegal immigration and welfare reform. The Clinton-Zedillo Initiatives were part of the efforts to address immigration issues, including border security and drug control, in collaboration with the administrations of Presidents Clinton and Zedillo. The initiatives aimed to complement the 1996 immigration reform measures, which included increased penalties for unlawful presence in the US and restrictions on alien eligibility for federal programs. The Clinton-Zedillo Initiatives focused on migration, border security, and drug control. They established bilateral consultations, issued a Binational Study on Migration, and launched a Border Safety Campaign. The governments also addressed concerns of private ranchers detaining Mexican migrants in Arizona by announcing prosecution for unlawful behavior and combatting migrant smugglers. In the counter-narcotics area, they formed the High Level Contact Group for anti-drug coordination. The countries developed a joint anti-drug strategy in early February 1998, adopted extensive anti-money laundering measures in 2000, and facilitated U.S. training of law enforcement and military units involved in counter-narcotics activities. The U.S. Congress shifted policy towards a more lenient immigration approach in 2000, with support for established illegal immigrants, universal enforcement of workers' rights, and the Legal Immigrant Family Equity (LIFE) Act of 2000. The Legal Immigrant Family Equity (LIFE) Act, supported by Representatives Henry Bonilla and Lamar Smith, and Senator Hatch, was signed into law as part of H.R. 4942 (P.L. 106-553). The legislation created and expanded visa categories for family unification applications, allowed certain aliens in class action court cases to adjust to LPR status, and reinstated Section 245(i) of the INA until April 30, 2001. Additionally, Congress increased the number of temporary H-1B professional workers. President Fox and President Bush were involved in the background discussions. President Fox and President Bush engaged in extensive consultations on migration and border issues, with Mexican cooperation on security matters increasing after the 9/11 attacks. During President Bush's visit to Guanajuato in February 2001, migration issues, including proposals for legalizing undocumented Mexican workers, were discussed. President Fox advocated for amnesty or guest worker arrangements to protect their human rights. In a joint communique, Presidents Bush and Fox agreed to engage in high-level negotiations to address migration and labor issues between their countries. President Bush expressed confidence in President Fox's efforts to combat drug trafficking and both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to enhance border safety and address migration issues. Press reports suggested proposals to regularize the status of Mexican workers. President Bush and President Fox engaged in high-level negotiations to address migration and labor issues between their countries. President Fox called for reaching agreement on migration proposals by the end of the year. The Joint Statement of September 6, 2001, summarized the progress made by the joint working group on migration. President Bush and President Fox engaged in high-level negotiations on migration and labor issues. Attorney General Ashcroft praised the fruitful dialogue on border safety initiatives. Both leaders renewed their commitment to safe, orderly, legal, and dignified migration, emphasizing the importance of respecting human dignity and shared responsibility. They agreed on a framework for ongoing efforts to match workers with employers and meet social and economic needs while enriching societies. Discussions will continue to ensure migration occurs through safe and legal channels. The Presidents emphasized the importance of safe, legal, and orderly migration, discussing border safety, a temporary worker program, and the status of undocumented Mexicans in the United States. They launched the Partnership for Prosperity to promote economic development in Mexico. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the U.S. focused on strengthening border security and immigration procedures. Laws like the USA Patriot Act and Enhanced Border Security Act were passed. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 created the Department of Homeland Security. Other immigration actions during the 107th Congress included expanding food stamp eligibility for non-citizens and extending benefits for certain refugee categories. President Bush's visit to Monterrey, Mexico in March 2002 launched the Border Partnership (\"Smart Border\") Agreement with President Fox, focusing on greater cooperation and technological enhancements at the border, public-private initiatives for investment in less developed areas with high migration rates, and seeking legislative support to expand the North American Development Bank's mandate. The Presidents agreed to seek legislative support to expand the mandate of the North American Development Bank (NADBank) and the Border Environmental Cooperation Commission (BECC) to finance environmental infrastructure along the border. They also noted Mexico's successes in fighting narco-trafficking and emphasized the importance of judicial cooperation. Additionally, they committed to continuing cabinet-level talks to achieve safe, legal, and orderly migration flows between the countries. During President Fox's State Visit to Washington in September 2001, a joint statement was issued to enhance migrant safety and reduce illegal crossings. The Cabinet level migration group was tasked with creating a new framework for safe and orderly migration between the US and Mexico, with continued work during Binational Commission Meetings in Mexico City in November 2002. During the cabinet-level Binational Commission (BNC) meetings in Mexico City in November 2002, Secretary of State Powell and Foreign Secretary Casta\u00f1eda reaffirmed their commitment to continue talks on a migration agreement. Powell emphasized that President Bush and President Fox prioritize the bilateral migration agenda, with plans to develop initiatives over the next six months to a year. On January 11, 2003, President Fox appointed Luis Ernesto Derbez as Mexico's new Foreign Minister, replacing Jorge Casta\u00f1eda. Mexico reiterated its stance on Iraq's disarmament through peaceful means and multilateral mechanisms on March 17, 2003. Mexico ordered 18,000 soldiers to secure access points to the United States on March 21, 2003. Enhanced bilateral cooperation for a smart border was announced on April 23, 2003. On May 7, 2003, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez met with Secretary of State Colin Powell in Washington, D.C., to strengthen bilateral cooperation for a smart border. The House International Relations Committee reported out H.R. 1950 on May 16, 2003, regarding a possible migration accord between the United States and Mexico. Representative Ballenger offered a substitute amendment modified by Representative Gallegly. Section 731 stated the sense of Congress for negotiations on a migration accord with Mexico, addressing key issues and opening PEMEX to U.S. oil companies. Mexican officials criticized provisions related to PEMEX and extradition as interference in domestic affairs. The Mexican Presidency acknowledged the priority of a migration agreement but opposed linking it to foreign investment in PEMEX. In May 2003, 19 migrants died in Texas due to asphyxiation and heatstroke in a trailer truck. President Fox appealed for U.S. action on immigration and led a strike force against human smuggling. In June 2003, police and soldiers launched an offensive against human smuggling rings, seizing operatives of six organizations. A joint effort named Operation Desert Safeguard was announced to deploy more Border Patrol agents and take forceful measures against smugglers. Additionally, initiatives were announced to support growth in areas of Mexico with high rates of migration to the United States. In July 2003, Mexican Secretary of Government Santiago Creel called for a bilateral migration agreement with the United States to enhance security by giving legal status to undocumented Mexican migrants. President Bush proposed an overhaul of the U.S. immigration system in January 2004 to match foreign workers with U.S. employers. The proposal included temporary legal status for new foreign workers and undocumented workers already employed in the U.S. for three years, with incentives to encourage workers to return to their home countries. President Bush's immigration reform proposal in 2004 aimed to match foreign workers with U.S. employers. Congressional initiatives included new temporary foreign worker programs and streamlining the H-2A agricultural worker program. More comprehensive proposals granted temporary legal status to foreign and undocumented workers, with provisions for adjusting to legal permanent resident status. In 2004, President Bush proposed immigration reform to match foreign workers with U.S. employers.

In February 2004, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and Mexican Government Secretary Santiago Creel met in Mexico City to review progress under the U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership, signing agreements on border safety and repatriation of Mexican nationals. They also committed to developing new lanes for pre-screened travelers and pre-cleared cargo. President Bush and President Fox also met in March 2004 to resolve some border issues. In March 2004, President Fox visited President Bush in Texas, exempting Mexicans with border-crossing cards from US-VISIT program requirements. In June 2004, Mexican and U.S. officials signed a social security totalization agreement to eliminate dual taxation and protect employees working in both countries. The agreement is pending congressional approval. Hayworth proposed an amendment to prohibit payment under the totalization agreement in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act. The 9/11 Commission recommended collaboration with other countries and stricter border control standards. In the 108th Congress, bills were passed to implement these recommendations. The Mexican Foreign Ministry expressed regret over the passage of Proposition 200 in Arizona, which requires proof of citizenship for voting and public assistance. Secretary of State Colin Powell highlighted increased cooperation on counter-narcotics and border security at a Binational Commission meeting in November 2004. The bilateral cooperation between the countries includes a new Working Group on Cyber-Security. Immigration reform for Mexican workers in the US is a priority. Educational, housing, agricultural, and environmental agreements have been made to promote competitiveness and conservation. The Partnership for Prosperity programs have reduced transfer fees, brought leaders together, and financed infrastructure projects. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 was approved by Congress, implementing recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. This included strengthening border control and identity card standards. Additionally, the establishment of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in Mexico is expected to provide significant financing and insurance to U.S. businesses in the country. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) was signed into law by the President on December 17, 2004. The legislation includes provisions for more law enforcement personnel for immigration enforcement, closer monitoring of alien entry and exit, and standards for identification documents and drivers' licenses. Certain provisions dropped from the House bill would be addressed in the 109th Congress, including banning Mexican consular ID cards, prohibiting driver's licenses for undocumented aliens, and completing a section of the border fence in California. Mexican officials argued in January 2005 that guides for Mexican migrants aim to protect them from dangers. In early January 2005, Mexican officials defended the Guides for Mexican Migrants, stating they were meant to protect migrants in dangerous terrain and promote legal entry into the United States. They emphasized Mexico's commitment to safe and orderly migration. Diplomatic exchanges between the United States and Mexico on border violence occurred in late January 2005. In late January 2005, the U.S. State Department issued a Public Announcement regarding the security situation along the U.S.-Mexico border due to increased violence among drug traffickers.

Mexico shares the concerns and is taking action against drug trafficking, emphasizing the need for shared responsibility in addressing the issue. President Bush addressed the outdated immigration system in the State of the Union Address in early February 2005, emphasizing the need for reform to better align with the country's economic needs and values. He called for an immigration policy that does not punish hardworking individuals, supports businesses with willing workers, and maintains border security. The House passed the REAL ID Act in February 2005 with immigration provisions and identity card standards, aiming to close the border to drug dealers and terrorists. The Act permits temporary guestworkers to fill jobs Americans won't take and rejects amnesty. The bill H.R. 418 aimed to revise asylum standards, expand grounds for deportability of aliens for terrorist activities, establish identity card standards for driver's licenses, and provide waivers for expeditious construction of a border fence near San Diego, California.

Concerns were raised about the REAL ID Act, vigilantism, and the need for comprehensive immigration reform. In late June 2005, U.S., Mexican, and Canadian officials released a report to leaders under the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America. The report highlighted proposed initiatives for common screening methods, a trusted traveler program, and infrastructure protection in the security area. In the prosperity area, agreements were made on principles for electronic commerce and liberalization of rules for household appliances and machinery. In late July and early August 2005, U.S. and Mexican officials reacted to continuing violence in the border town of Nuevo Laredo.

The United States proposes the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, requiring valid passports for entry by January 1, 2008. Currently, U.S. and Canadian citizens do not need passports to enter the U.S. from the Western Hemisphere, except for Cuba. Mexican citizens can enter with Border Crossing Cards. On September 1, 2005, the Departments of Homeland Security and State proposed new documentation requirements for travelers entering the United States from the Western Hemisphere. Passports or acceptable documents will be required by December 31, 2006 for air and sea travel, and by December 31, 2007 for land border crossings. SENTRI, FAST, and Border Crossing Cards will still be accepted at land ports of entry. Final travel document requirements will be determined after considering public comments on the proposed rule.

Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff launched the \"Secure Border Initiative\" in November 2005, a plan to secure U.S. borders with increased funding. Mexico emphasized shared responsibility in managing migration and security challenges. President Bush announced a plan to enhance America's security through comprehensive immigration reform during visits to Arizona and Texas borders in late November 2005. The strategy includes securing the border with increased manpower, new technology, physical barriers, and repatriation of illegal immigrants. Additionally, enforcement of immigration laws within the United States will be improved through interior investigation, work-site enforcement, and programs for employers. The President's proposed temporary worker program would allow foreign workers with tamper-proof ID cards to fill unfilled jobs for a fixed period without a path to citizenship. The House passed H.R. 4437 in December 2005, strengthening border security, mandating employer checks for eligibility, and making it a crime to be in the US illegally.
