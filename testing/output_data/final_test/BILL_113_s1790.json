    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Repeal Existing Policies that Encourage and Allow Legal HIV Discrimination Act of 2013\" or the \"REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act of 2013\". The Congress finds that many states have criminal statutes based on perceived exposure to HIV, rather than actual transmission, leading to prosecutions for nondisclosure or unintentional transmission. People living with HIV have received harsh sentences based on exaggerated fears, despite CDC stating HIV is only transmitted through specific bodily fluids. State and Federal criminal laws do not reflect medical advances in HIV transmission and treatment. Condom use is effective in preventing transmission, but laws do not consider it as a mitigating factor. Antiretroviral medications reduce HIV to undetectable levels, lowering transmission risk. \"Despite medical advancements in HIV treatment and transmission prevention, HIV-specific laws continue to stigmatize and criminalize individuals living with the virus. These laws do not effectively reduce risky behavior or promote disclosure, and may even discourage testing. Placing legal responsibility solely on those diagnosed with HIV is counterproductive.\" The focus on individuals with HIV in legal matters undermines the broader public health message of practicing safe behaviors. Accused individuals face public exposure, loss of employment, and violation of privacy rights. Convicted individuals may be labeled as sex offenders, leading to destroyed employability and fractured family relationships. The United Nations and UNAIDS recommend limiting criminalization of intentional HIV transmission cases. The Global Commission on HIV and the Law calls for repealing punitive laws and enacting effective HIV responses. The Global Commission on HIV and the Law recommends repealing punitive laws and enacting laws that facilitate effective HIV responses, discouraging laws criminalizing HIV transmission, exposure, or non-disclosure of HIV status. The President's National HIV/AIDS Strategy also addresses the negative impact of HIV-specific criminal laws on disclosure and discrimination. The President's Advisory Council on AIDS recommends aligning U.S. laws with current medical and scientific knowledge on HIV transmission to support public health goals. The President's Advisory Council on AIDS recommends aligning U.S. laws with human rights-based approaches to disease control and prevention, avoiding unwarranted punishment based on health and disability status. The Sense of Congress regarding laws or regulations directed at people living with HIV/AIDS is highlighted in Section 3. The sense of Congress is that laws and regulations regarding individuals with HIV/AIDS should not impose additional burdens based on their HIV status. These laws should be public health-oriented, evidence-based, and consider factors like transmission routes, health implications, benefits of treatment, and the impact of punitive measures.
