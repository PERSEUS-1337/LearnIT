    "content": "In the United States, the majority of the population has private health insurance coverage, with 55% having private group coverage and 13.5% having private individual coverage in 2017. Private health insurance plans must comply with state and federal requirements, including regulations on coverage, benefits, pricing, and the prohibition of preexisting condition exclusions. However, not all private health coverage arrangements adhere to these requirements. The report identifies exempted and noncompliant private health coverage arrangements in the US market. It aims to help policymakers understand the scope of available health plans and limitations of federal requirements. The individual health insurance market segment allows individuals and families to purchase plans independently. In the group health insurance market, employers offer coverage to their employees through fully insured or self-insured plans. States regulate the business of health insurance, requiring issuers to be licensed to sell plans. State-licensed health insurance issuers must adhere to unique requirements set by each state, which vary across market segments. Self-insured plans, funded directly by sponsors, are generally not subject to state regulations. The federal government also regulates state-licensed issuers and self-insured plans, with requirements potentially applying differently across market segments. Federal health insurance requirements are codified in three statutes\u2014Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), Part 7 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and Chapter 100 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). These standards establish a minimum level of requirements (federal floor), with states able to impose additional requirements on issuers and health plans. The requirement to cover preexisting health conditions applies uniformly across individual, small-group, and large-group markets, as well as self-insured plans. However, the mandate to cover a core package of 10 \"essential health benefits\" only applies to health plans in the individual and small-group markets. The report focuses on health coverage arrangements that do not comply with federal health insurance requirements codified in Title XXVII of the PHSA, Part 7 of ERISA, and Chapter 100 of the IRC. States enforce private health insurance requirements, but the federal government steps in if a state fails to enforce the provisions adequately. The report focuses on health coverage arrangements listed in Table 1, categorized as Exempted and Noncompliant Health Coverage Arrangements. Each summary includes a description, compliance status with federal requirements, history, and state regulatory authority. The arrangements discussed in this section meet a federal definition of health insurance but are exempt from some federal health insurance requirements. Fully insured and self-insured group health plans covering fewer than two current employees are exempt from all federal health insurance requirements, including retiree-only plans. The exemption for retiree benefits from federal health insurance requirements under HIPAA ceased to exist after the ACA reorganized Title XXVII of the PHSA. The Department of Health and Human Services stated it would not enforce HIPAA or ACA requirements for grandfathered plans. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will not enforce HIPAA or ACA requirements for group health plans covering fewer than two current employees, including retiree-only plans. States can impose their own requirements on fully insured plans, but not on self-insured plans. No Administration has reconsidered enforcement, and there are no estimates of enrollment in these plans. Excepted benefits in group health plans covering fewer than two current employees are exempt from federal health insurance requirements under HIPAA. These benefits include auto liability insurance, dental and vision benefits, long-term care, specific disease coverage, and supplemental Medicare plans. There are four categories of excepted benefits, with one category exempt from all requirements and the other three exempt under specified conditions. These exemptions were established under HIPAA, Title XXVII of the PHSA, and Part 7 of ERISA. The ACA modified PHSA exemptions for excepted benefits, but ERISA and IRC exemptions remained unchanged. HHS and states are not enforcing HIPAA or ACA requirements on excepted benefits, except for self-insured plans. States can impose requirements on excepted benefits. STLDI is defined as health insurance with a coverage period of less than 12 months. No estimates of enrollment in excepted benefit plans were found. The federal definition of Short-Term Limited Duration Insurance (STLDI) must have an expiration date within 12 months of the contract's effective date, with a maximum duration of 36 months. The definition has evolved through regulations issued in 1997, 2016, and 2018. Despite changes, federal health insurance requirements still apply to STLDI. The federal definition of Short-Term Limited Duration Insurance (STLDI) requires an expiration date within 12 months, with a maximum duration of 36 months. While federal health insurance requirements apply to STLDI, it is excluded from the federal definition of individual health insurance coverage, allowing it to be exempt from these requirements. State regulations on STLDI vary, with some states imposing more restrictive limitations than federal law, such as shorter expiration dates. States can also impose additional restrictions not covered by federal law. States have additional restrictions on STLDI not addressed under federal law, including access to external appeals processes and rate restrictions. Some states ban the sale of STLDI altogether. The most recent change to STLDI definition is less than a year old, with no enrollment data available yet. Student health insurance is limited to students and their dependents at higher education institutions. Student health insurance coverage for students in higher education institutions must meet specific conditions, including exclusivity to students and their dependents, non-discrimination based on health status, and compliance with state laws. It falls under individual health insurance requirements but is exempt from certain regulations. This exemption was established in response to ACA Section 1560(c) through the rulemaking process. The exemption for student health insurance coverage from certain regulations was established in response to ACA Section 1560(c) to allow institutions of higher education to offer these plans without restrictions. This exemption went into effect for student health insurance coverage starting on or after July 1, 2012. The exemption from rate review requirements for student health insurance plans began on or after July 1, 2018. HHS cannot regulate self-insured student health plans, so federal requirements and exemptions apply only to fully insured plans. States have authority over both types of student health plans. In 2017, there were 1.1 million student health insurance policies and 1.3 million covered lives. Nonfederal governmental plans are sponsored by entities like states, counties, school districts, and municipalities. Nonfederal governmental plans, sponsored by entities like states, counties, school districts, and municipalities, can offer self-insured or fully insured plans. Sponsors can choose to exempt self-insured plans from federal requirements, with the exemption being modified under the ACA to opt out of only four requirements as of September 2010. As of June 21, 2019, 174 nonfederal governmental entities across 35 states have exempted at least one self-insured plan from certain requirements. Most exempt plans from mental health parity, fewer from other requirements, and 11% exempt from all four. Enrollment data for these plans is not available. Grandfathered health plans and insurance coverage are exempt from certain federal requirements under the ACA if they were enrolled before March 23, 2010. These plans must comply with pre-ACA federal health insurance requirements that do not conflict with the ACA's rules. Grandfathered plans in the individual market have fewer ACA requirements to follow compared to non-grandfathered plans. Grandfathered health plans can maintain their status by meeting specified conditions and avoiding certain changes. Once a plan loses its grandfathered status, it cannot be regained, and generally, new enrollees are not eligible for grandfathered plans. As of the date of this report, no repository for enrollment data for grandfathered plans was found, but the federal government has commented on enrollment. In October 2018, the Departments of HHS, Labor, and the Treasury stated that only a small number of individuals are currently enrolled in grandfathered individual health insurance coverage, and the number of individuals with such coverage has been declining each year since the ACA was enacted. The number of grandfathered group health plans and insurance coverage continues to decline each year. Data shows a decrease from 72% to 22% in employers offering grandfathered plans and from 56% to 13% in covered workers since 2011. The percentage of covered workers under grandfathered plans decreased from 56% in 2011 to 13% in 2019. States can regulate grandfathered plans like non-grandfathered plans, as long as state requirements do not conflict with federal law. Federal requirements under the ACA applied to health insurance coverage and entities offering such coverage, with most becoming effective for plan years starting on or after January 1, 2014. In 2013, issuers began notifying enrollees of non-compliant individual and small-group plans that would be canceled due to ACA requirements. CMS issued guidance for transitional plans, allowing non-compliant plans to be renewed for plan years between January 1, 2014, and October 1, 2014. State insurance commissioners had flexibility in enforcing compliance. State insurance commissioners had the flexibility to enforce compliance with ACA requirements for individual and small-group markets between January 1, 2014, and October 1, 2014. Issuers could choose to renew coverage for enrollees of non-compliant plans if compliance was not enforced. Transitional plans must comply with federal health insurance requirements pre-ACA and all ACA requirements pre-2014. The guidance initially applied to plans renewed during the specified period and has since been extended. The transitional plan guidance, initially applicable from January 1, 2014, to October 1, 2014, has been extended multiple times. States may allow issuers to continue covering individuals under transitional plans through 2020 if continually renewed since 2014. Issuers in states permitting transitional plans can choose to continue or discontinue them, with discontinued plans unable to be revived. Transitional plans are generally not available to new enrollees, only to continually covered individuals, new dependents, and new employees in the small-group market. In 2019, transitional plans are available in both individual and small-group markets in 32 states, with most states allowing them to continue through 2020. Four states allow transitional plans in both markets but issuers have stopped offering them in the individual market. Fifteen states no longer allow transitional plans. Enrollment in transitional plans has likely declined as they can only be renewed by current enrollees and not sold to new consumers. The text discusses two health coverage arrangements that do not comply with federal health insurance requirements. These arrangements, including health care sharing ministries, share common characteristics of not being explicitly exempted by the federal government. It is challenging to compile a comprehensive list of such arrangements due to the lack of discussion by the government on their status. Health care sharing ministries (HCSMs) involve pooling financial resources among religious community members to cover medical expenses. Originating with the Amish and Mennonites, HCSMs require regular contributions based on religious beliefs. Funds are distributed to members in need, but coverage may exclude certain illnesses or treatments. HCSMs do not guarantee payment and are not considered insurance by the federal government. The federal government has not defined Health Care Sharing Ministries (HCSMs) for regulatory purposes. States have the option to regulate HCSMs, with 30 states exempting them from insurance laws if certain requirements are met. In the remaining states, HCSMs are not explicitly exempted, but this does not always mean they are regulated. In states that exempt HCSMs from insurance laws, regulators ensure compliance for exemption. In states without exemption, regulators can investigate and regulate HCSMs as unauthorized insurers. Regulators also investigate fraud and assist consumers. There are 104 HCSMs in 29 states, with 7 open to new members and an estimated enrollment of nearly 970,000. The American Farm Bureau Federation, established in 1919, advocates for farmers and ranchers. Local farm bureau offices in all states offer tiered membership with benefits like discounts on products and services. State farm bureaus also help members with insurance. Membership in HCSMs is estimated at just under 970,000. State farm bureaus assist members with obtaining health insurance through agents, sponsored coverage, and insurance companies. Iowa, Kansas, and Tennessee allow farm bureaus to offer non-insurance health benefits. Iowa, Kansas, and Tennessee farm bureaus offer non-insurance health benefits that do not have to comply with state or federal insurance requirements. Tennessee Farm Bureau had 23,000 individuals with coverage in 2017. Iowa and Kansas recently passed laws allowing farm bureau coverage. Kansas Farm Bureau estimates that 11,000-42,000 residents will be covered by its health benefits. Table A-1 shows federal health insurance requirements for grandfathered and transitional plans. Grandfathered plans can be any type, while transitional plans are limited to small-group and individual-market plans. Check marks in the table indicate compliance, N.A. means the requirement doesn't apply, and Exempt means the plan is exempt. Grandfathered or transitional plans are exempt from certain requirements. The ACA's rate review requirement applies only to fully insured small-group and individual market plans. Grandfathered plans are exempt, while transitional plans must comply. The requirement does not apply to fully insured large-group or self-insured plans."
