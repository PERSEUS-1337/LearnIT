    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 3.67 of the Health and Safety Code in California introduces regulations for online child care job posting services, defining them as platforms that connect parents with unlicensed child care providers like nannies or babysitters. The owner of such a service is responsible for compliance with the new regulations. An online child care job posting service in California must include information about the Trustline registry for child care providers, including a description, toll-free number, website link, and availability of free child care referrals in every county. Trustline is the official background check program for unlicensed child care providers like babysitters and nannies. The state-funded child care resource and referral program provides free child care planning services, including referrals to licensed caregivers, information on choosing child care, community resources, and help paying for child care. To find your local program, call 1-800-KIDS-793 or visit www.mychildcareplan.org. Oliver's Law gives parents the right to receive information about any complaints against child care providers by contacting a local licensing office. Contact information can be obtained by calling 1-800-KIDS-793 or visiting www.ccld.ca.gov. The online child care job listing service must provide a one-click link on each child care provider profile for a written description of the background check offered. This description should include an overview of what is included in the background check and a chart listing the databases checked for each county in California. The child care job listing service must provide a clear description of the background check offered, including the date range of data, update frequency, checking methods, counties with no data, and number of counties without background check data. Additionally, lists of statewide/national and other background checks conducted must be included. Upon receiving a complaint, the department will review the child care job posting service's website for violations. If a violation is found, a written notice will be served to the owner, detailing the violation, the opportunity for a fair hearing, and potential fines for subsequent violations. In case of alleged noncompliance, the department will notify the owner in writing, allowing 30 days to correct the violation or request a hearing. The owner can provide evidence of compliance through various means accepted by the department. Regulations will be developed for the notice, hearing, and evidence submission, ensuring due process. After a written notice and opportunity to correct violations, subsequent violations may result in a $1,000 fine per violation. Fines collected will go to the Child Health and Safety Fund."
