    "content": "The \"Biogas Production Incentive Act of 2008\" may be cited as the SEC. 45Q for the production of biogas from certain renewable feedstock. The qualified biogas production credit under section 38 is based on the amount of biogas produced from qualified energy feedstock at a qualified facility and sold to an unrelated person or used as fuel by the taxpayer during the taxable year. The term 'biogas' refers to a gas derived from processing a qualified energy feedstock, containing at least 60% methane, carbon dioxide, and trace gases. Qualified energy feedstock includes livestock manure, organic agricultural or food industry byproducts, and waste materials. The term 'biogas' refers to a gas derived from processing renewable biomass, harvesting residue, waste from fermentation processes, ethanol and biodiesel production, livestock slaughter, food production, processing, or service, as well as other organic wastes. It also includes solid wood waste materials, agricultural or forestry crops. The term 'renewable biomass' refers to materials from pre-commercial thinning or invasive species from National Forest System land and public lands that are removed for disease containment, insect infestation reduction, or ecosystem health restoration. The term 'renewable biomass' includes materials from National Forest System land and public lands used for ecosystem health restoration, following specific guidelines. The term 'renewable biomass' includes organic matter available on a renewable basis from non-Federal land or land held by Indian tribes, such as plant material and waste material like crop residue and animal byproducts. The term 'qualified facility' refers to a facility in the United States that uses anaerobic digesters or other processes to convert energy feedstock into biogas, is owned by the taxpayer, and was placed in service between the enactment date and January 1, 2018. Livestock includes poultry, cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and other equines. The term 'qualified facility' refers to a facility in the United States that uses anaerobic digesters to convert energy feedstock into biogas, marketed through interconnection with a gas pipeline, as a fuel, or to offset consumption of fossil fuels. Special rules include an increased credit for qualified cellulosic energy feedstock. The tax credit for biogas produced from qualified cellulosic energy feedstock is increased to 125 percent of the original amount. Qualified cellulosic energy feedstock includes lignocellulosic or hemicellulosic matter. If multiple owners are involved in a facility, regulations will determine the production attribution to the taxpayer. The production from a qualified facility will be allocated among owners based on their ownership interests in gross sales. Related persons are treated as a single employer. In the case of corporations in an affiliated group, biogas sales to an unrelated person are treated as such. Rules for estates and trusts will be similar to those for pass-thru entities. The regulations prescribed by the Secretary state that rules similar to subsection (d) of section 52 apply. The amount of biogas produced and sold by the taxpayer will be reduced by the amount taken into account under sections 45K and 45 for producing fuel from a nonconventional source and producing electricity from renewable resources, respectively. In the case of government-owned biogas facilities, the credit can be transferred through assignment to another person with the Secretary's consent to ensure it is claimed only once. Regulations will be prescribed to prevent reassignment. The dollar amount under subsection (a)(1) is adjusted for inflation by multiplying it by the inflation adjustment factor for the calendar year of the sale. The Secretary determines and publishes the inflation adjustment factor annually. The inflation adjustment factor is a fraction based on the GDP implicit price deflator, calculated annually by the Department of Commerce. This factor is used to adjust the dollar amount for inflation in the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new paragraph regarding the qualified biogas production credit under section 45Q. Additionally, the credit determined under section 45Q can now be allowed against the Alternative Minimum Tax. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of the Internal Revenue Code. The amendments made by this section apply to biogas produced and sold in taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
