    "content": "The \"Child Poverty Reduction Act\" aims to reduce poverty of families with children in the United States by adding child poverty reduction bonus grants to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Section 403(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include a bonus grant for states that reduce child poverty starting in fiscal year 2003. The grant amount is based on the number of children under 18 in qualified states. The bonus grant for states reducing child poverty is calculated based on the number of children under 18 in qualified states and the amount appropriated for the fiscal year. The grant amount for child poverty reduction states is set at a minimum of $1,000,000 per fiscal year, with a maximum limit of 5% of the State family assistance grant. If the available grant funds exceed the required payments, a pro rata increase will be applied. The grant amount for child poverty reduction states is adjusted to ensure total payments equal available funds. If grant funds are insufficient, payments to states will be reduced proportionally. The grant amount for child poverty reduction states is adjusted to ensure total payments equal available funds. States must use the grant for eligible purposes.

The term 'child poverty rate' refers to the percentage of children in a State whose family income is below the poverty line. The term 'average depth of child poverty' is the average amount by which family income falls below the poverty line for children in the State.
