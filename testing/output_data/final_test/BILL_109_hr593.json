    "content": "Section 1 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include a new section on international transportation and disposal of municipal solid waste. A State has the authority to impose limitations on foreign municipal solid waste disposal without unduly burdening interstate and foreign commerce. Definitions include foreign municipal solid waste as waste generated outside the US and municipal solid waste as all discarded waste materials. The definition of municipal solid waste includes waste materials discarded by households, hotels, commercial, institutional, municipal, and industrial sources, as long as they are similar to household waste and disposed of with other municipal solid waste. The definition of municipal solid waste includes various materials like food waste, paper, clothing, appliances, and household hazardous waste. It also encompasses debris from construction, remodeling, and repair activities. Debris from construction, remodeling, repair, or demolition is not considered municipal solid waste. This exclusion also applies to hazardous waste identified under specific regulations and waste resulting from environmental response actions. The curr_chunk discusses various types of materials that are exempt from being classified as hazardous waste, including recyclable materials separated from waste, scrap rubber for fuel, and returned materials to manufacturers. The curr_chunk defines solid waste generated by an industrial facility and transported for treatment, storage, or disposal to a facility owned by the generator or an affiliated company. The curr_chunk lists specific types of waste that can be disposed of in a facility owned by the generator or an affiliated company, including medical waste, sewage sludge, combustion ash, and waste from manufacturing or processing operations. The curr_chunk amends the table of contents of the Solid Waste Disposal Act to include a new item related to waste disposal operations. The curr_chunk adds a new section titled \"International transportation and disposal of municipal solid waste\" to the Solid Waste Disposal Act."
