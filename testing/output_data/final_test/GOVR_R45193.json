From 2007 to 2016, the program cost the federal government about $72 billion, with the majority of the funds benefiting producers and private insurers. The program's cost is compared to other titles in the 2014 farm bill, and previous farm bills have made modifications to the program. The federal crop insurance program has seen significant growth since its establishment in 1938, becoming a key element of federal agricultural support. Various farm bills, including H.R. 2, have proposed changes to the program. The report discusses the program's history, market penetration, policy types, claim payments, and financial aspects. The federal crop insurance program has grown significantly since 1938 and is a key element of federal agricultural support. The program's history, market penetration, policy types, claim payments, and financial aspects are discussed. The report does not analyze specific legislative proposals or address intricacies of funding, accounting, or oversight issues. Total net cost of the program from 2007 to 2016 was about $72 billion, with projected annual outlays of $7.7 billion for FY2018 through FY2027. The federal crop insurance program, with a projected annual cost of about $7.7 billion, is permanently authorized and receives mandatory funding. Congress may debate modifications to the program as the 2014 farm bill expiration approaches. Agricultural insurance market historically underdeveloped compared to other markets due to unique challenges in pricing. Providers of crop insurance faced challenges that limited product availability and government intervention. Challenges include lack of crop data, production and price variations, and evolving climate risks. Farm income instability is influenced by variable production and commodity prices. Commodity prices are influenced by supply and demand in domestic and international markets, leading to volatility. Geographically correlated risks involve pooling of risk in insurance to spread uncorrelated risks across the pool, reducing overall risk. Geographically correlated risks, like droughts and floods, can cause high losses in a specific area. Insuring these risks in agriculture has been a challenge for the private market. Multiple peril policies cover a broad range of risks, unlike named-peril policies that only cover specific risks. Multiple-peril policies cover all risks within broadly defined categories in the agricultural sector, leading to challenges for insurers operating in small geographic areas. Adverse selection and moral hazard are major causes of difficulties in the private insurance market, with higher-risk farmers more likely to purchase insurance than lower-risk farmers at the same premium rate. This stems from farmers having more information about the risk of loss than insurers. The federal government spent \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" from 1923 to 1938 to assist farmers after crop failures. The USDA believed in an insurance program to help farmers instead of direct relief. In 1938, the Agricultural Adjustment Act created FCIC for federal crop insurance, initially self-insured without private companies until 1980. In the early years of federal crop insurance, policies were available for only a few principal crops in limited counties. Major changes in 1980, including federal premium subsidies and private insurance company participation, led to a significant increase in enrollment. The Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 is the permanent statutory authority for the program. Enrollment grew from 26.6 million acres in 1980 to about 238 million acres in 2015. The federal crop insurance program has seen significant growth since its inception, with enrollment increasing from 26.6 million acres in 1980 to about 238 million acres in 2015. The number of crops insured also rose from 28 to 123, with over 20 types of policies now available. Participation in the program has increased as a share of total planted acres, particularly following the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994. This act required producers to enroll in crop insurance to be eligible for other federal farm programs and introduced the catastrophic (CAT) coverage level with minimal producer payment. Following the spike in insured acres in 1995, participation in the federal crop insurance program dipped after the 1996 farm bill but increased from 1998 to 2017. The Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 played a role in boosting participation by increasing premium subsidy levels, making crop insurance more affordable for farmers. The Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 increased premium subsidy levels, making crop insurance more affordable for farmers. The policy aimed to reduce reliance on disaster assistance payments, but its effectiveness is difficult to assess. Some argue that crop insurance costs more than the assistance it replaces. Since the Agricultural Act of 2014, the federal crop insurance program has become a key agricultural support program, providing $102.5 billion of insurance protection in 2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 authorized $2.36 billion in disaster assistance for crop losses from hurricanes and wildfires in 2017. In 2015, the federal crop insurance program provided approximately $102.5 billion in insurance protection for over 100 crops on 238 million acres. The total premium for crops was about $9.8 billion, with premium subsidies amounting to $6 billion. Corn and soybeans were the predominant crops insured, with liabilities of $40.3 billion and $24.3 billion respectively. The federal crop insurance program in 2015 had a total liability of $102.5 billion, with corn and soybeans accounting for 63% of the liability. The four largest crops in the US (corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton) made up 75% of enrolled acreage and 80% of claims paid. Different types of federal crop insurance policies are available, including individual or area-wide policies based on yield or revenue. In 2016, the top two federal crop insurance policies by premium were individual revenue (84%) and individual yield (11%). Since the late 1990s, individual revenue policies have replaced individual yield policies as the dominant type. The top three policies by liability in 2017 were Revenue Protection, Actual Production History, and Yield. In 2017, the top three federal crop insurance policies by liability were Revenue Protection, Actual Production History, and Yield Protection, accounting for 88% of total liabilities. Three conservation provisions, including sodsaver, sodbuster, and swampbuster, could impact a producer's eligibility for premium subsidies. The 2008 farm bill made native sod acreage ineligible for subsidies if tilled for an annual crop, known as \"sodsaver.\" The 2014 farm bill expanded the sodsaver provision to include native sod in six states, lowering yield guarantees and crop insurance subsidies by 50% for the first four years of planting. Native sod could include untilled land or land with no tilling history. Governors of states with cropland in the Prairie Pothole National Priority Area did not participate in the program. The 2014 farm bill added insurance premium subsidies to USDA program benefits that could be lost for non-compliance with conservation provisions like sodbuster and swampbuster. Producers had to certify compliance with these provisions to receive subsidies, with USDA evaluating certifications. Non-compliant producers would lose premium subsidies, but the loss was not retroactive. The bill also extended exemptions for new producers to comply with conservation plans before losing access to federal crop insurance. The federal crop insurance program requires producers to develop and comply with a conservation plan to maintain access to premium subsidies. Unlike other farm subsidy programs, federal crop insurance does not limit subsidy amounts or eligibility based on income. The program is funded by taxpayers and producers, with private insurance companies as primary insurers. The Federal Crop Insurance Program provides subsidies to producers through Administrative and Operating subsidies (A&O) and pays for catastrophic risk protection loss adjustment expenses (CAT LAE). The Risk Management Agency (RMA) drafts policies, sets premium rates, and regulates Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs). Producers pay a $300 administrative fee for each crop insured at the CAT level, while at higher coverage levels, FCIC pays part of the premium with producers covering the rest. The financial agreement between FCIC and AIPs is outlined in the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) signed annually. The Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) is signed annually by each Approved Insurance Provider (AIP) with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC). The SRA outlines the terms for sharing underwriting losses and gains, as well as the division of risk pools between \"commercial\" and \"assigned risk.\" FCIC pays A&O subsidies and CAT LAE to AIPs for specific policy coverages. The SRA was last renegotiated in 2011, allowing for renegotiation every five years. The 2011 Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) and subsequent annual SRAs through 2019 are substantially identical. Any renegotiations must be budget-neutral, as mandated by the 2014 farm bill. The Federal Crop Insurance Program is permanently authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980, providing mandatory funding for various purposes. In contrast, RMA's discretionary funding for employees and resources has been around $75 million per fiscal year. The federal crop insurance program incurred a total direct cost of $72 billion to the government from 2007-2016. This cost was divided with 60% benefiting producers, 39% going to AIPs, and 1% to RMA appropriations. The program includes producer premium subsidies, A&O and CAT LAE expense payments to AIPs, and shared underwriting risk with AIPs. The costs can be categorized into delivery costs, total indemnities, underwriting gains, and RMA appropriations, excluding premium subsidies. The federal crop insurance program incurred a total direct cost of $72 billion to the government from 2007-2016, with costs divided between producers, AIPs, and RMA appropriations. External funding sources include producer-paid premiums, CAT fees, and underwriting losses attributed to AIPs. The federal government pays large underwriting costs to AIPs, but in 2012, AIPs made a positive underwriting transfer to the government. This is illustrated in Figure 9, showing the net cost of federal crop insurance for crop years 2007-2016. In the context of crop insurance funding, RMA appropriations and producer-paid CAT fees are small compared to other factors. External funding sources include CAT fees averaging $48 million/year, producer-paid premiums averaging $3.8 billion/year, and underwriting losses of $1.3 billion paid by AIPs to FCIC in 2012. Government costs include delivery costs, indemnities, underwriting gains, and RMA appropriations. The category \"Underwriting Loss Paid by AIPs to FCIC\" only occurred in crop year 2012. In 2012, AIPs had underwriting gains except for that year due to a severe drought. AIPs collect premiums and transfer funds to FCIC, with premium subsidies accounted for in underwriting gains. AIPs have escrow accounts funded by FCIC for indemnity payments, settled monthly based on risk retention and premium payments. The annual settlement process calculates risk-sharing terms of the SRA for all crops, determining how underwriting gains and losses are divided between FCIC and AIPs. FCIC premium subsidies are considered in this division, not shown as a cash-flow category. Premium subsidy rates are set by the Federal Crop Insurance Act. Premium subsidy rates for crop insurance have been increased by Congress five times since 1980. Rates generally decrease as coverage levels rise, except for shallow-loss policies like SCO and STAX which have static rates of 60% and 80%. Buy-up coverage for higher levels of coverage ranges from 38% to 80%, while CAT coverage has a 100% subsidy. Indemnity payments are considered a cost to FCIC, with the division between FCIC and AIPs outlined in the SRA. Indemnity payments between FCIC and AIPs, as outlined in the SRA, impact the sharing of underwriting gains and losses. Producers received $65 billion more in claim payments than premiums from 2000 to 2016. Regional variations in benefits under the crop insurance program are evident, with some producers experiencing negative returns. FCIC subsidizes AIPs' delivery costs for program \"delivery\" activities. FCIC subsidizes AIPs' delivery costs by paying A&O subsidy and CAT LAE, which are calculated as a percentage of premium. A&O ranges from 12% to 21.9% depending on policy type, with a bonus \"snapback\" in states with high loss ratios. CAT LAE is fixed at 6% of premium. The 2011 SRA set a maximum A&O subsidy cap of $1.3 billion and a minimum of $1.0 billion, which has remained unchanged in subsequent SRAs. The 2011 SRA set limits on the amount AIPs are allowed to pay agents, with a maximum A&O subsidy cap of $1.3 billion and a minimum of $1.0 billion. AIPs compete for business by establishing relationships with agents and focusing on customer service. The federal crop insurance agent market is competitive, with AIPs unable to compete based on price due to RMA determining premium rates. AIPs may not pay more than 80% of A&O and CAT LAE by state as base commission. The 2011 SRA set limits on AIPs paying agents, with a maximum A&O subsidy cap of $1.3 billion. AIPs compete by establishing relationships with agents. AIPs may pay up to 100% of A&O and CAT LAE by state under certain conditions. There is no limit on individual agent compensation as long as it stays within state maximums. Federal crop insurance differs from other sectors in underwriting gains/losses calculation due to expenses being reimbursed through A&O and CAT LAE. The Federal Crop Insurance Program calculates underwriting gains/losses without considering expenses. Net underwriting gains/losses from 2007 to 2016 totaled almost $16 billion, with $2.6 billion going to FCIC and $13.4 billion to AIPs. AIPs had a larger share of gains relative to taxpayers. The Federal Crop Insurance Program saw $13.4 billion (84%) going to AIPs, with underwriting losses in various years for both FCIC and AIPs. The SRA sets the methodology for dividing gains and losses, with an implicit target rate of return for AIPs. The program is a key part of federal support for agriculture and is often targeted for budgetary savings in Congress. Multiple bills in the 115th Congress aim to modify key financial components of the program. The Federal Crop Insurance Program involves subsidies, underwriting gains and losses division between FCIC and AIPs, and A&O and CAT LAE payments to AIPs. Congressional oversight plays a crucial role in ensuring program efficiency. The top three crop insurance policies by liability in 2017 were Revenue Protection, Actual Production History (APH), and Yield Protection (YP), accounting for 88% of total liabilities. Individual yield policies insure a producer's historical yield at a set price determined by RMA each spring. The Federal Crop Insurance Program offers two main types of yield policies: APH and YP. Both policies use a producer's historical yield guarantee, the APH, which is determined by RMA using records submitted by the producer. If producers do not have four years of records, RMA substitutes a transition or \"T yield\" based on the 10-year average county yield. Growers with no records are assigned 65% of the T yield as their APH yield. For APH and YP policies in the Federal Crop Insurance Program, producers can receive 80% to 100% of the T yield for missing years if they have less than four years of records. RMA determines projected prices using various tools, such as commodity exchanges for YP policies. Producers choose coverage levels between 50% and 75% of their APH yields and between 55% and 100% of projected prices. Indemnities are paid if actual yields fall below the yield guarantee, with higher coverage levels resulting in lower payouts. RMA offers CAT coverage to individual producers at 50% of the APH yield and 55% of the projected price for an administrative fee of $300 per crop per county. Indemnities are triggered only if actual yields fall below the yield guarantee, with payouts based on the difference between the yield guarantee and actual yield times the price guarantee and number of insured acres. Individual Revenue Protection policy (RP) is a prevalent revenue product that insures against revenue loss using APH yield and either a projected or harvest price. The Revenue Protection policy uses an individual producer's APH yield and the higher of the projected or harvest price to set a revenue guarantee. Indemnities are triggered if the actual revenue is lower than the guarantee, which is calculated based on the APH yield and selected guarantee level. Actual revenue is determined by the producer's actual yield and the harvest price. The Revenue Protection policy uses the producer's actual yield and the harvest price to set a revenue guarantee. RMA does not offer CAT coverage for RP policies. RP with Harvest Price Exclusion uses only the projected price. Other policies include whole-farm revenue protection and margin insurance products, making up 11.8% of liabilities in 2017. Federal crop insurance premiums are billed at the end of the insurance cycle. Federal crop insurance premiums are billed at the end of the insurance cycle."
