    "content": "The \"Railroad Shipper Protection Act of 1997\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Key findings are outlined in Section 2. The Congress finds that the railroad industry has consolidated significantly since the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, leading to limited competitive options for shippers. The financial health of the industry has improved, but captive rail shippers are still present and increasing in number. Increased competition among railroads and a streamlined process for determining rates will benefit rail shippers. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Transportation. The term ``Surface Transportation Board'' or ``Board'' means the Surface Transportation Board established under section 701 of title 49, United States Code.\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSES. The Act aims to clarify the rail transportation policy, ensure rail competition for shippers, guarantee reasonable rates for captive rail shippers, and remove unnecessary regulatory burdens from the rate reasonableness process of the Surface Transportation Board.\n\nSEC. 5. CLARIFICATION OF RAIL TRANSPORTATION POLICY. SEC. 5 amends Section 10101 of title 49, US Code to clarify rail transportation policy by ensuring competition among rail carriers and maintaining reasonable rates. Upon request, a rail carrier must establish a rate for transportation between any two points on its system for the shipper. The rate applies regardless of whether it is part of a through transportation route or if the shipper has made other arrangements. Review of rate reasonableness is also amended in the code. Rail carriers must establish rates for transportation between any two points on their system upon request by the shipper. The shipper has the right to challenge the reasonableness of the established rate or the aggregate rate for part of a through route. SEC. 7. SIMPLIFIED STANDARD FOR MARKET DOMINANCE. Section 10707(d) of title 49, United States Code is amended to include criteria for determining market dominance of a rail carrier when establishing rates. The carrier must be the sole provider on the route and demonstrate that the rate charged results in a revenue-variable cost percentage of at least 180 percent. The Board will consider transportation competition at origins or destinations where 2 or more rail carriers provide service when making a market dominance determination. SEC. 8 amends rail transportation policy and revenue adequacy determination in title 49, United States Code. SEC. 9 focuses on reducing procedural barriers for small shippers. The Surface Transportation Board will review and potentially change rules and procedures that are burdensome to small shippers within 180 days of the Act's enactment. If further changes are needed, the Board will notify relevant committees in Congress. The Surface Transportation Board will recommend changes in rules and procedures to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment."
