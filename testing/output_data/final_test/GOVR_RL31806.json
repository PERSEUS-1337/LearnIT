It included an across-the-board cut of 0.59% for Interior and related agencies. The bill funds agencies and programs in four federal departments and various smaller agencies and bureaus. The FY2004 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, H.R. 2691, funds agencies in the Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy, and Department of Health and Human Services, along with various related agencies like the Smithsonian Institution and National Endowment for the Arts. The FY2004 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, H.R. 2691, funded agencies in the Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy, and Department of Health and Human Services, along with related agencies like the Smithsonian Institution and National Endowment for the Arts. The appropriations for FY2003 totaled $19.79 billion, with additional emergency funding of $324.0 million enacted through P.L. 108-83 for various agencies including the Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Forest Service. The Administration requested emergency FY2003 supplemental funding of $289.0 million for wildland firefighting efforts, with $253.0 million for the Forest Service and $36.0 million for the Bureau of Land Management. The funding was intended for fire suppression and emergency rehabilitation activities to ensure sufficient funding for the 2003 fire season. The Senate passed H.R. 2657 on July 11, 2003, containing the requested level of funding. The Senate passed H.R. 2657 on July 11, 2003, providing $289.0 million in supplemental funding for wildfires. An additional $25.0 million was added for removing dead trees in forests. The House Committee on Appropriations ordered a draft measure with $319.0 million in FY2003 supplemental funds for firefighting. However, the House passed H.R. 2859 on July 25, 2003, without supplemental funds. The Senate passed the bill on July 31, without amendment. The law (P.L.108-69) did not include supplemental funds for firefighting, but Congress later included funding in the FY2004 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act. The FY2004 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-83) allocated $319.0 million for wildland firefighting in FY2003, with $36.0 million for the Bureau of Land Management, $283.0 million for the Forest Service, and $5.0 million for the Fish and Wildlife Service. The Senate proposed an additional $400.0 million in emergency funding for wildfire fighting, with $75.0 million for BLM and $325.0 million for the Forest Service. The President requested $400.0 million in supplemental fire funding, with $99.0 million for BLM and $301.0 million for the Forest Service. The FY2004 law included $98.4 million in emergency funding for BLM firefighting efforts. The FY2004 law provided $397.6 million in emergency funds for wildland fire fighting, with $98.4 million for BLM and $299.2 million for the Forest Service. President Bush's FY2004 budget for Interior and related agencies totaled $19.89 billion. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reported bills for Interior and related agencies totaling $19.60 billion and $19.61 billion for FY2004, respectively. The House passed H.R. 2691 with $19.60 billion, and the Senate passed its version with $19.61 billion plus $400.0 million in emergency funding for wildland fire management. The Senate passed a bill totaling $20.01 billion, including $400.0 million in emergency funding for wildland fire management. This amount was $411.2 million more than the House's version and $121.3 million more than the Administration's request. The Senate's FY2004 level was $99.2 million less than the total appropriated for FY2003. Conferees were appointed by both the Senate and House, with a formal conference committee meeting held on October 27, 2003. In 2003, a conference committee meeting was held to discuss the FY2004 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The bill narrowly passed the House and Senate, with the President signing it into law on November 10, 2003. The Act contained $20.01 billion for FY2004, with an across-the-board cut of 0.646%. The FY2004 enacted level had an across-the-board cut of 0.59%, slightly lower than FY2003. Funding for wildland firefighting and land acquisition were major issues debated, with $2.76 billion allocated for wildland firefighting, 13% less than FY2003. The FY2004 enacted level had a 0.59% cut compared to FY2003, with $2.76 billion allocated for wildland firefighting, 13% less than the previous year. The law included $263.4 million for land acquisition, a 36% decrease from FY2003. Controversial issues were addressed, such as the renewal of grazing permits and leases, extension of the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program, and modifications to judicial procedures. The FY2004 law included provisions such as modified procedures for judicial review of timber sales in Alaska, capped funds for competitive sourcing efforts, and a stay on a court decision regarding Indian trust funds. It also dropped language barring funds for certain activities related to BLM regulations, the Klamath Fishery Management Council, and Outer Continental Shelf leasing activities. During FY1994 to FY2003, Interior appropriations increased by 50% in current dollars, reaching $20.11 billion by FY2003. The growth was mainly in the latter years, with a 41% increase from FY1999 to FY2003. During FY1999 to FY2003, funding for Interior and Related Agencies increased by 41% in current dollars, reaching $20.11 billion. The largest increase occurred from FY2000 to FY2001, with a 27% rise in current dollars. Much of the funding was allocated to land management agencies for conservation and fire management. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages 261.5 million acres of public land for various uses including energy development, grazing, recreation, and preservation. They also oversee federal subsurface mineral resources and wildland fire management on 370 million acres of land. The FY2004 appropriations law allocated $1.79 billion for BLM, a decrease from the previous year. The FY2004 appropriations law provided $839.8 million for BLM land programs, including protection, recreational use, improvement, development, disposal, and administration. Funding for realty and ownership management saw a $4.6 million increase to $93.2 million, with a focus on expediting native allotment applications and land selections in Alaska. The FY2004 appropriations law allocated $66.4 million for managing recreation on BLM lands, representing an 11% increase from FY2003. Additionally, $80.3 million was provided for transportation and facilities maintenance, a 3% reduction from the previous year. The law also allocated $110.0 million for Energy and Minerals programs. The FY2004 appropriations law provided $110.0 million for the energy and minerals program, including Alaska minerals, an increase over FY2003 and the President's request. Both the House and Senate recommended increases, with a focus on processing energy permits. The Senate expressed concern with the backlog in processing oil and gas permits and suggested a pilot program in 5 states to address it. The conferees modified the Senate report language to make the pilot program optional due to progress made by BLM in addressing the backlog. The FY2004 law addressed the backlog of oil and gas permits, continued the moratorium on mining and mill site claims on federal lands, and did not include language on disclaimers of interest. The House revised DOI regulations on disclaimers, limiting it to certain lands like national monuments and wildlife refuges. Opponents fear it may confirm \"RS2477\" highway rights, while supporters see it as a way to resolve property ownership for potential development. The FY2004 law also addressed grazing permits renewal. The FY2004 law addressed the automatic renewal of grazing permits and leases issued by the Secretaries of the Interior or Agriculture until the renewal process is completed, with annual reporting requirements on completion of necessary analyses. Secretaries have discretion on prioritizing environmental analysis of grazing allotments. The Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed frustration with escalating problems in the Wild Horse and Burro Program, requesting a program audit and cost analysis of alternatives to adoption. The FY2004 appropriations law for Wildland Fire Management saw a significant reduction from the previous year, with funds provided to replace money borrowed for fire fighting in the prior year. The FY2004 law allocated $98.4 million for fire fighting, a decrease from the previous year. The funds were used for fire fighting on Interior Department lands and the Forest Service's fire programs. Both departments focus on the National Fire Plan, which aims to reduce hazardous fuels to prevent catastrophic fires. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about funding levels for readiness. The Appropriations Committee expressed concern about funding levels for public safety readiness and directed DOI to analyze readiness levels. The Senate Committee on Appropriations highlighted deteriorating forest health as a cause of wildland fires and urged BLM to quickly implement Stewardship Contracting. Both the House and Senate supported $186.2 million for hazardous fuels reduction, including in the wildland-urban interface. The PILT program compensates local governments for federal land within their jurisdictions, but funding has been less than authorized amounts in recent years. The Administration proposed shifting the PILT program from the BLM budget to Departmental Management in DOI for FY2004. The FY2004 law reflected a move to Departmental Management and funded the PILT program at $224.7 million, an increase over the President's request. The Administration proposed examining the PILT distribution formula for more equitable payments to local governments. For Land Acquisition, $18.4 million was appropriated, mainly for 12 acquisitions, a 45% reduction from FY2003. The FY2004 law included a $14.9 million (45%) reduction in funding for land acquisition compared to FY2003. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the direction of the land acquisition program and directed the Secretaries of DOI and Agriculture to develop a plan outlining acreage goals and conservation objectives. Alternatives to fee title land purchases, such as land exchanges and conservation easements, were considered as less expensive approaches. Funding for land acquisition comes from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The FY2004 law included a reduction in funding for land acquisition compared to FY2003. Concerns were expressed about the direction of the program, and alternatives to fee title land purchases were considered. Funding for land acquisition comes from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The FY2004 law included a reduction in funding for land acquisition compared to FY2003. Concerns were expressed about the direction of the program, and alternatives to fee title land purchases were considered. Funding for land acquisition comes from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Administration requested $1.29 billion for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for FY2004, with the House approving $1.30 billion, the Senate $1.34 billion, and the conference approving $1.31 billion. The FY2004 funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) was $956.5 million, a 4% increase from the previous year. The largest portion of the annual appropriation is for the Resources Management account, which includes the Endangered Species Program, Refuge System, and Law Enforcement. Funding for the Endangered Species program was controversial, with the final appropriation being $137.0 million, a 4% increase from the Administration's proposal. The final appropriations for the Fish and Wildlife Service in FY2004 was $137.0 million, a 4% increase from the previous year. Funding for related programs benefiting conservation of endangered species also saw increases, such as the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund and the Landowner Incentive Program. In FY2004, the final appropriations for the Fish and Wildlife Service were $137.0 million, a 4% increase from the previous year. Funding for endangered species programs also increased, with an overall funding increase of $53.4 million (25%) from FY2003, primarily due to rescission of prior year funding. The enacted level for FY2004 was $255.6 million, a 21% increase from the previous year. In FY2003, funding was appropriated for renovations and activities to celebrate the centennial of the first National Wildlife Refuge. The President proposed a 9% decrease in operations and maintenance funding for FY2004, but it ended up with a 7% increase to $391.5 million. Infrastructure improvements funding request of $53.4 million was rejected. The NWRS budget activity includes programs like the recovery of the Salton Sea and management of migratory birds. The NWRS budget includes programs for the recovery of the Salton Sea, management of migratory birds, and law enforcement operations. Funding for FY2004 included $53.7 million for law enforcement and $43.1 million for land acquisition, a decrease from previous years. The FY2004 budget for the National Wildlife Refuge System included $43.1 million, a 41% decrease from previous years. The funding was primarily for land acquisition, with a portion allocated to related functions like acquisition management and emergency acquisitions. Additionally, the National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands within the NWRS, but receipts from activities on these lands are insufficient for full funding. The Administration requested $14.4 million for FY2004 for the Multinational Species Conservation Fund (MSCF), which benefits various endangered species. The President's budget proposed moving funding for the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund into the MSCF, but Congress rejected this transfer in FY2002, FY2003, and FY2004. The FY2004 enacted level for the MSCF was $14.2 million, covering 49% of the authorized full payment. The proposed transfer to the Multinational Species Conservation Fund was rejected in FY2002, FY2003, and FY2004. The FY2004 enacted level for the MSCF saw a 16% increase. The State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program helps conserve species and lacks an authorizing statute. The State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program funds conservation plans and projects, with a portion allocated for competitive grants to tribal governments. The President proposed a 7% decrease, but the enacted level increased by 7% to $69.1 million in FY2002. Administrative expenses were limited to 3% of the total appropriation. The National Park Service (NPS) manages the National Park System, which includes 388 diverse units covering over 84 million acres. The NPS protects natural and historic areas representing American cultural identity, with close to 280 million annual visits. The NPS also supports land conservation outside the park system. The NPS budget for FY2004 is $2.26 billion, slightly higher than FY2003 but below the President's request. The Senate passed $2.32 billion, the House $2.24 billion. Amendments affecting NPS were rejected, including one to phase out snowmobile use in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. The FY2004 appropriations law included various provisions such as capping study expenditures for the Administration's competitive sourcing initiative, limiting commercial sponsorship displays on the National Mall, and addressing a controversial land exchange proposal involving Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The FY2004 appropriations law allocated $1.61 billion for National Park Service operations, slightly below the Administration's request. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about the erosion of NPS operating funds due to unbudgeted costs from management initiatives. Park advocacy groups estimate that national parks operate with two-thirds of needed funding. Appropriations for NPS in FY2003-FY2004 included $329.9 million for construction, $559.2 million for facility operation and maintenance. The FY2004 appropriations for the National Park System were $39.2 million more than the FY2003 appropriation, totaling $889.1 million. The Administration requested $897.0 million for construction and maintenance, with $705.8 million for projects and $191.2 million for facility operations. The maintenance backlog for the NPS, estimated at $5.4 billion, remains a controversial issue. The National Park Service's maintenance backlog, estimated at $5.4 billion, has been a controversial issue and a priority for the Administration and some Members of Congress. The United States Park Police (USPP) received $77.9 million in FY2004 to support their programs, with a focus on border park security problems. The USPP was criticized for not implementing recommendations to address budget accountability and management issues. The FY2004 budget priorities for the National Park Service focus on border park security issues. Funding for park recreation and resource protection programs was reduced to $47.9 million, with variations in funding amounts between the House-passed bill, Senate-passed bill, and the final FY2004 law. The law also established the Blue Ridge National Heritage Area and directed a heritage area study for Muscle Shoals. The National Park Service was directed to conduct a heritage area study for Muscle Shoals, AL, with no funds appropriated. The Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program received $30.0 million in funding from the FY2001 Interior Appropriations Act. Funding for UPARR was not requested in FY2002, but Congress allocated $30.0 million. In FY2003, only $298,000 was provided for program administrative costs. For FY2004, $305,000 was agreed upon for UPARR. In FY2004, $305,000 was allocated for the administration of previously awarded grants, with no new grants funded. The total funding for Land Acquisition and State Assistance was $135.6 million, with $41.8 million for federal land acquisition and $93.8 million for state assistance. This was $103.0 million less than the Administration's request and $35.7 million less than the FY2003 enacted level. The federal program acquires lands for the National Park System, while the state assistance program is for park land acquisition and recreation planning. The House passed bill contained $131.2 million, and the Senate $158.5 million. In FY2004, funds were allocated to states through a formula for spending priorities. The Recreational Fee Demonstration Program allowed federal land management agencies to retain and spend entrance and user fees for maintenance projects. The program was extended through FY2008 for fee expenditures. The House bill proposed a two-year extension, while the Senate bill did not include the provision. The Recreational Fee Demonstration Program was extended through FY2008 to allow federal land management agencies to retain and spend entrance and user fees for maintenance projects. The House amendment to limit the extension to national park units was defeated. The Historic Preservation Fund, administered by the NPS, provides grants for activities specified in the National Historic Preservation Act. The Historic Preservation Fund provides funding for cultural heritage projects for Indian tribes, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. The FY2004 appropriations law allocated $73.6 million for the fund, including grants for states, Indian tribes, Save America's Treasures, and restoration of buildings on HBCU campuses. The federal government has provided specific appropriations for Millennium projects under Save America's Treasures to preserve nationally significant artifacts and historic structures. Concerns about geographic diversity led to a requirement for project recommendations to be approved by the Appropriations Committees before funds are distributed. The FY2004 law allocated $32.6 million for Save America's Treasures. The FY2004 law allocated $32.6 million for Save America's Treasures, with $3.0 million earmarked for preservation projects for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) buildings listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Funding for HBCUs was restored in FY2004 through competitive grants administered by the National Park Service. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, previously funded through the Historic Preservation Fund Account, no longer receives permanent federal funding. The National Trust, chartered by Congress in 1949, aims to protect historic American sites but has not received direct federal funding since FY1998. However, the FY2004 appropriations law provided $0.5 million for the National Trust's endowment fund for the care of endangered historic places. The Historic Preservation Fund in the 2004 budget has major components listed under the \"conservation spending category.\" The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is the nation's primary science agency providing earth and biological science information related to natural hazards, environment, energy, mineral, water, and biological sciences. It is also the federal government's main civilian mapping agency and a primary source of data on the nation's water resources. The USGS budget for FY2004 was $938.0 million, exceeding the Administration's request of $895.5 million. Funding for five out of six activities increased compared to the previous year, with Science Support receiving $0.7 million less than requested. The FY2004 USGS budget was $938.0 million, exceeding the Administration's request. The National Mapping Program received $129.8 million, with sub-programs funded at levels lower than FY2003. The Landsat 7 Satellite Program was discussed in the conference report for improvements. The conference managers recommended securing data purchase agreements to establish stable funding for the Landsat 7 satellite program. They also suggested consulting with users to determine if degraded data can still be used. Additionally, they supported initiatives to improve data management at the EROS Data Center, including converting archived data to a modern storage system and implementing remote mirroring technology for faster access. The FY2004 appropriations law allocated $234.2 million for Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes activities, with funding for hazard assessments, landscape and coastal assessments, and resource assessments. This included $75.3 million for geologic hazards, $78.4 million for landscape and coastal assessments, and $80.5 million for resource assessments. The FY2004 law allocated $16.0 million for inquiries into economic impacts on mining and materials processing industries. There were increases in funding for volcanic monitoring, National Cooperative Geological Mapping program, and Minerals at Risk program in Alaska. The Administration requested a decrease in funding for aggregate and industrial mineral studies. Both the House and Senate supported the USGS mineral resources program for national security and infrastructure development. The FY2004 law appropriated $215.7 million for Water Resources Investigations, exceeding the Administration's request and FY2003 enacted levels. Various programs within this heading received increased funding, including Ground Water Resources, National Water Quality Assessment, Toxic Substances and Hydrology, Hydrological Research and Development, National Streamflow Information, and Hydrological Networks and Analysis. Additionally, $6.4 million was provided for Water Resources Research Institutes. The FY2004 budget request sought to discontinue USGS support for Water Resources Research Institutes due to their success in leveraging funding from non-USGS sources. Congress restored funding for the Institutes in FY2002 and FY2003. Funding for biological research in FY2004 increased, with specific restrictions on conducting surveys on private land without written authorization. The FY2004 budget allocated funding for biological information management, invasive species research, and chronic wasting disease research. Funding for Science Support and Facilities was also provided, with a focus on modernizing infrastructure and maintenance of facilities. The FY2004 budget allocated $93.0 million for Facilities, slightly above the Administration's request and $2.2 million more than FY2003. Conference managers acknowledged the budget may not cover all facility costs and directed USGS to develop a funding strategy by March 2004. An additional $3.0 million was added to counter streamlining reductions, to be distributed to program areas pro-rata. The Minerals Management Service administers the Offshore Minerals Management Program and the Minerals Revenue Management Program. They anticipate collecting $5.8 billion in revenues in FY2004 from federal leases. Revenues are distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs. The FY2004 law allocated funds from offshore leases to coastal states, Land and Water Conservation Fund, Historic Preservation Fund, and the U.S. Treasury. The MMS programs were funded at $270.5 million, with $7.0 million for oil spill research and $263.5 million for Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management program. Funding breakdown includes $139.3 million for OMM, $79.7 million for MRM, and $44.5 million for administrative activities. $100.2 million came from offsetting collections, and $170.3 million from direct appropriations. The Administration's proposed budget for MMS for FY2004 was $271.5 million, with $7.1 million for oil spill research and $264.4 million for Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management. The Senate approved a budget of $273.3 million for MMS in FY2004, with $7.1 million for oil spill research and $266.2 million for Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management. Revenue estimates for mineral leasing were higher in FY2004 compared to FY2003, with estimates of $5.8 billion and $5.1 billion respectively. Price fluctuation was a significant factor in revenue swings, with royalties from natural gas production accounting for 40%-45% of annual MMS receipts. Oil royalties accounted for no more than 25% of receipts. The FY2004 appropriations law continued leasing moratoria in various offshore areas, including the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, and parts of Alaska. However, it omitted language prohibiting funding for leasing activity in the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area, sparking controversy. Industry groups argue for expanded sales due to resource potential, while environmental groups and state officials raise concerns about risks to the environment and local economies. The North Aleutian Basin Planning Area is currently under a leasing moratorium, with some interest in opening it for oil and gas development to offset the fishing industry decline in Bristol Bay. Environmentalists oppose this effort. The area is not in the current 5-year leasing plan. Controversy surrounds MMS oil and gas leases in offshore California, with congressional interest and requirements for consistency with state coastal zone management plans. In offshore California, 36 out of 40 leases were granted lease suspensions, but the State of California challenged this in court. The U.S. Court for the Northern District of California sided with the state, leading to an appeal by the Bush Administration to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal was unsuccessful, and the Department of the Interior is now working with lessees to resolve the issue. Additionally, nine oil companies have filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against MMS seeking $1.2 billion in compensation for undeveloped leases. Companies are seeking $1.2 billion in compensation for undeveloped leases. House-Senate conferees on the energy bill did not include language for an inventory of OCS oil and gas resources. Supporters argue it would enhance domestic supply, while opponents fear it could remove leasing moratoria. For more information on the Minerals Management Service, visit http://www.mms.gov. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to ensure mined land is restored. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) to ensure coal-mined land is restored. SMCRA also created an Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) fund for reclaiming hazardous sites. OSM oversees state regulatory programs and received $296.0 million in FY2004 for reclamation efforts. The Administration requested $174.5 million for the AML Fund in FY2004, slightly higher than the previous year but lower than approved by Congress. The total provided was $190.6 million, with the House approving $194.5 million. The Senate supported an increase to $190.9 million for the AML fund. The Administration requested $106.7 million for Regulation and Technology programs in FY2004, including funding for the Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative and the Small Operators Assistance Program. The enacted level was slightly lower at $105.4 million. Grants to states from AML appropriations are based on coal production levels, with \"minimum program states\" receiving a minimum funding level of $2.0 million. In FY2003 and FY2004, Congress allocated $1.5 million to minimum program states for Abandoned Mine Land (AML) reclamation. Some states have been advocating for increased AML appropriations due to an unappropriated balance of $1.75 billion in the fund by FY2004. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) offers various services to federally-recognized tribes, including government operations, law enforcement, education, and economic development. For more information on the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, visit http://www.osmre.gov/osm.htm. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides various services to federally-recognized tribes, including government operations, law enforcement, education, economic development, and trust asset management. In FY2004, the BIA received $2.30 billion in direct appropriations, an increase from FY2003, with key issues including reorganization and trust asset management functions. In FY2004, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) received $2.30 billion in direct appropriations, with key issues including the reorganization of the BIA and problems in the BIA school system. The reorganization, initiated by Secretary of the Interior Norton in April 2003, focused on trust asset management functions and was related to the reform and improvement of trust management. Trust assets managed by the BIA include trust lands and their economic resources. The Bureau of Indian Affairs manages surface and subsurface economic resources on tribal trust land and individual Indian trust land. Historically, there were issues with mismanagement of Indian trust funds and assets, leading to trust reform in 1994 and the creation of the Office of Special Trustee. The OST oversees trust management reform, with trust fund management transferred from the BIA in 1996. Efforts at trust management reform in the 1990s were unsuccessful, leading the DOI to contract with a management-consultant firm. The management reform in the 1990s led the Department of the Interior (DOI) to contract with a management-consultant firm for recommendations on trust management and agency reorganization. This resulted in the current reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs (AS-IA), and Office of the Special Trustee (OST) focusing on trust management structures and functions. The reorganization includes splitting off BIA's trust operations at regional and agency levels, with trust officers overseeing trust management and providing information to Indian trust beneficiaries. Additionally, a trust management improvement project is being implemented to enhance trust asset systems, policies, and historical accounting. The Department of the Interior (DOI) implemented improvements in trust asset systems, policies, and procedures, including reducing backlogs and maintaining the improved system. Many Indian tribes and tribal organizations, as well as plaintiffs in a court case, have criticized the reorganization. Despite consultation meetings with tribes in 2002, an agreement was not reached before the reorganization was announced. Tribes argue that the reorganization is premature as new trust procedures and policies are still being developed, and it lacks clarity on new OST duties. Congress has supported the BIA/OST reorganization, with the House Appropriations Committee urging DOI to implement it quickly for FY2004. The Senate rejected an amendment to stop the reorganization and added a provision to the FY2004. The Senate added a provision to the FY2004 appropriations bill, excluding certain tribes from reorganization. The BIA funds 185 schools educating 48,000 students in 23 states. Some schools are operated by tribes under self-determination contracts. Key issues include low student achievement and inadequate facilities. The Bush Administration suggested privatization in FY2003, but Appropriations Committees disagreed. The FY2004 bill included a provision for a $3 million fund to support tribal school boards in taking over BIA-operated schools. Many BIA school facilities are in poor condition, with a backlog of $942 million in needed repairs. Construction appropriations have not been sufficient to address the backlog. In FY2004, Indian tribes urged Congress to explore additional sources of construction financing for education. The FY2004 Act authorized a demonstration program for tribes to help fund construction of BIA-funded schools, with provisions for non-BIA-funded schools to participate. The law also included a controversial land exchange between the Eastern Cherokee Tribe of North Carolina and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park for building replacement schools. For more information on education programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, visit its website. The Bureau of Indian Affairs education programs information can be found on their website at http://www.oiep.bia.edu. The main BIA website is offline due to a court order related to trust funds litigation. The National Indian Gaming Commission oversees tribal regulation of gaming activities and faces funding adequacy issues. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) receives funding mainly from tribes' Class II and III operations fees, with a cap of $8 million per year. In FY2003, Congress raised the fee ceiling to $12 million for FY2004. The Administration proposed a formula-based fee ceiling amendment to accommodate industry growth, but gaming tribes opposed it, calling for a review of NIGC's budget first. The FY2004 act extended the temporary $12-million fee ceiling for the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) through FY2005. Funding for NIGC activities from fees with no direct appropriations was seen from FY1999-FY2003. The FY2004 conference report expressed concerns about tribes establishing gaming operations in states without reservations or traditional connections, directing the NIGC and Interior Department to implement existing statutes and regulations in such cases. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians, authorized by the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, oversees the reform of Interior Department management of Indian trust assets and funds. Trust fund management was transferred from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the OST in 1996. Indian trust funds managed by the OST include tribal funds owned by about 290 tribes. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians manages two sets of funds: tribal funds owned by about 290 tribes totaling $2.8 billion, and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts with a total asset value of $400 million. Funds come from various sources including claims awards, land settlements, and investment income. FY2003 funding for the OST was $148.3 million, with $140.4 million for federal trust programs and $7.9 million for the Indian land consolidation pilot project. The land consolidation project aims to purchase and consolidate fractionated ownerships. The land consolidation project aims to purchase and consolidate fractionated ownerships of allotted Indian trust lands to reduce management costs. In FY2004, the House approved $240.6 million for the OST, including $219.6 million for federal trust programs and $21.0 million for the Indian land consolidation pilot project. The Senate approved $242.6 million for the OST. The Senate approved $242.6 million for the Office of Special Trustee (OST), with $2.0 million more for the land consolidation project than the House. The FY2004 law provided $209.0 million for the OST, $60.7 million over FY2003 but $86.6 million less than the request. Key issues include reorganization, historical accounting for tribal and IIM accounts, and litigation. The Office of Special Trustee and Bureau of Indian Affairs are undergoing reorganization, including the creation of OST field operations with fiduciary trust officers. Many Indian tribes are against parts of the reorganization and have asked for further consultation with Congress. $15.1 million of the proposed FY2004 increase was allocated for the new field operations, which were approved by the House, Senate, and enacted bill. The Senate did not explicitly endorse or oppose the reorganization. The Senate did not explicitly endorse or oppose the OST/BIA reorganization but defeated a proposed amendment to stop reorganization by transferring $79.3 million from OST to the Indian Health Service. The historical accounting project aims to assign correct balances to tribal and IIM accounts, involving a large and time-consuming reconciliation process. The Interior Department proposed a five-year, $335 million project to reconcile IIM accounts, with a significant increase in funding from $17.5 million in FY2003 to $130 million in FY2004 for historical accounting. The historical accounting project funding increased from $17.5 million in FY2003 to $130 million in FY2004, with $112.5 million allocated for IIM accounts and tribal accounts. However, the total historical accounting funds were reduced to $44.4 million in the enacted conference report, primarily for short-term activities related to the Cobell v. Norton class-action lawsuit. The appropriations issue revolves around the historical accounting method for estimating IIM accounts' balances. The DOI's method costs $335 million over five years, estimating a low total owed, while the plaintiffs' method suggests $176 billion owed. A trial in 2003 determined the accounting method to use. In the previous phase of the Cobell case in 1999, the court found breaches by DOI and the Treasury Department in trust duties. The final phase of the lawsuit will decide the amount owed to the plaintiffs based on historical data. The final phase of the Cobell lawsuit will determine the amount of money owed to the plaintiffs based on the historical accounting method chosen. Congress has been concerned about the costs of the lawsuit and has required reports on the costs and benefits of historical accounting methods. In the FY2003 Interior appropriations act, Congress required a summary of a full historical accounting for five plaintiffs and authorized the Interior Secretary to help employees pay for legal costs related to the lawsuit. The historical accounting for the five plaintiffs was summarized in 2003, showing a low error rate in transactions. Congress retained provisions for FY2004, including capping court officials' compensation. The court rejected both plaintiffs' and DOI's accounting plans, ordering DOI to account for all trust fund transactions since 1887. The Interior Department was ordered to conduct a historical accounting of all trust fund transactions since 1887, estimated to cost $6-12 billion. A provision in the FY2004 Interior appropriations conference report aimed to delay this accounting until Congress delineates specific obligations or December 31, 2004. Opponents argued that the provision was unnecessary. The FY2004 conference report included a provision that opponents argued was of doubtful constitutionality and unjust to plaintiffs. It passed both the Senate and House, leading to an appeal by the DOI and a temporary stay of a court order by the U.S. Court of Appeals.

The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) provides financial assistance to U.S. territories and former insular areas, manages relations with the federal government, and aims to build fiscal and government capacity. OIA funding for FY2004 is $366 million, a 5% reduction from the President's request. Permanent and indefinite appropriations historically make up 70-80% of the budget. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) budget for FY2004 is $366 million, with historically 70-80% consisting of permanent and indefinite appropriations. The remaining balance (20-30%) is discretionary and current mandatory funds, with $284 million allocated as follows: $162 million to three freely associated states and $122 million in fiscal assistance to U.S. territories. Discretionary funding for FY2004 was set at $82.1 million, with Assistance to Territories (AT) funded at $75.7 million and Compact of Free Association (CFA) at $6.4 million, a 15% decrease from the previous amount. The FY2004 budget for the Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) is $366 million, with $284 million allocated for freely associated states and U.S. territories. Funding for Assistance to Territories (AT) was set at $75.7 million and Compact of Free Association (CFA) at $6.4 million, a 15% decrease from the previous amount. Congress continues to monitor economic development and fiscal management in insular areas. The FY2004 law included a Forest Service budget of $4.54 billion, with $348.9 million in emergency funding. The Senate and House debated significant amendments to Forest Service (FS) management, including modifications to procedures for judicial review of timber sales in FS Region 10. Amendments to prohibit funding for implementing National Forest System planning regulations and changes to the Protection of Roadless Areas rule were defeated. The FY2004 budget for the FS was $4.18 billion, with additional emergency funding of $180.9 million. Changes to the Protection of Roadless Areas rule were finalized in 2001 by the Clinton Administration, leading to debates on fire funding and protection programs during the FY2003 Interior appropriations bill. The Senate faced challenges passing the bill due to disputes over fire funding and wildfire protection programs. Discussions continued in the FY2004 appropriations bill regarding funding levels and locations for fire protection treatments, environmental analysis, public involvement, and challenges hindering fuel reduction activities. The National Fire Plan was a focal point in the FY2004 funding debate. The FY2004 funding debate focused on wildfires and the National Fire Plan, which aimed to enhance fire control and protection. The plan allocated $1.8 billion for BLM and Forest Service lands for wildfire operations, fuel reduction, and community assistance. Congress approved much of the proposal for FY2001, increasing funding for fire preparedness and restoration programs. Total appropriations for the FY2001 National Fire Plan, covering BLM and FS fire funds, were $2.86 billion. The FY2004 law contained National Fire Plan funding of $2.76 billion, including emergency borrowing repayment. The Senate had included emergency borrowing repayment authority of $400.0 million in the bill. The President subsequently asked for a $400.0 million emergency appropriation to repay borrowed monies for fire fighting. In FY2004, there was an emergency appropriation of $400 million to repay borrowed monies for fire fighting, with $99 million allocated for BLM and $301 million for the FS. Additionally, the FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act included $49.7 million in FS emergency funding for fuel reduction and state fire assistance. In FY2004, there was an emergency appropriation of $400 million to repay borrowed monies for fire fighting, with $99 million allocated for BLM and $301 million for the FS. The FS and BLM wildland fire line items include funds for fire suppression, preparedness, and other operations. The FY2004 budget request and enacted levels for suppression were significantly higher than FY2003 appropriations, but included less emergency wildfire funds. The FY2004 law reduced BLM wildfire funding to $783.6 million, slightly below the request. The FY2004 law allocated varying levels of emergency funding for BLM and FS fire operations. It reduced funding for fire preparedness and shifted funds from fire suppression to other fire operations. FS wildfire funding in FY2004 was $2.00 billion, including emergency funding, which was higher than the Senate and House levels. The FY2004 law allocated emergency funding for BLM and FS fire operations, with FS wildfire funding at $2.00 billion. Funding for fire preparedness was reduced, and funds were shifted from fire suppression to other fire operations. An amendment for additional funding in FY2003 was withdrawn with promises to address the funding shortfall later. Emergency supplemental funding of $289.0 million was requested for FY2003 FS and BLM firefighting efforts. The Senate passed a bill containing supplemental funding for firefighting efforts, including funds for removing dead trees in forests. Additional funding was allocated for State and Private Forestry programs, amidst ongoing debates about wildfire funding. Private Forestry (S&PF) programs received $329.2 million in funding for FY2004, with $64.5 million coming from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The funding levels varied within S&PF, with $98.6 million allocated for forest health management, which was more than the Senate and request but less than the House-passed level. The House, Senate, and enacted bills rejected the request for additional funding. For FY2004, Congress provided $63.3 million for S&PF cooperative fire assistance, including $24.9 million in emergency supplemental funding. This total is significantly above the Senate, House, and requested levels. Additionally, the FY2004 Interior act included $59.2 million in cooperative fire assistance for other wildfire operations. The FY2004 Interior act included $59.2 million in cooperative fire assistance for other wildfire operations, with differences in funding levels compared to the Senate, House, and Administration requests. The law also allocated funds for cooperative forestry programs, with major variations in forest legacy and economic action programs. The FY2004 law allocated $90.8 million for the S&PF Economic Action Program (EAP) and $31.6 million for Infrastructure Improvement, with differences in funding levels compared to the Senate, House, and Administration requests. The EAP funding was not included in other wildfire operations appropriations, and the Infrastructure Improvement funding aimed to reduce the agency's backlog of deferred maintenance. The FY2004 law allocated $66.4 million for Land Acquisition, with differences in funding levels compared to the Senate, House, and Administration requests. Most of the difference is in land purchases, with $51.3 million provided for purchases. The FY2004 law allocated $266.4 million for FS Research, $1.37 billion for the National Forest System (NFS), and included an FS administrative provision allowing transfers for consultations under the Endangered Species Act. For more information on the U.S. Forest Service, visit http://www.fs.fed.us/. The FY2004 law funded fossil fuel research and development programs at $672.8 million, including $169.9 million for the Clean Coal Power Initiative and $8.9 million for the FutureGen R&D project. The FY2004 law allocated $130.0 million for fossil fuel research and development programs, including $8.9 million for the FutureGen R&D project of the Department of Energy. Additionally, the law deferred spending $97.0 million from the Clean Coal Technology account and established a separate account of $988,000 for the U.S./China Energy and Environmental Center. The FY2004 budget allocated $130.0 million for fossil energy research, including the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) with a $2 billion, 10-year commitment for advanced research and development in coal-fired power generation technologies. The House and Senate approved different amounts for fossil energy programs, with a key difference being the House's funding for the clean coal program administration. The CCPI, similar to the CCTP, is being phased out. The Senate bill allocated $8.9 million for the FutureGen project. The Administration proposed significant cuts to natural gas and petroleum R&D funding. The FY2004 law supported higher funding levels for these programs. The House Committee disagreed with the Administration's approach to fossil energy R&D funding for FY2004, criticizing the lack of emphasis on traditional energy sources like oil and natural gas. Despite the Administration's proposal to reduce funding for the fuels program, the House and Senate supported higher funding levels, resulting in $31.2 million allocated for FY2004. Funding for Sequestration R&D also saw an increase under the FY2004 law. The House and Senate approved flat funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in FY2004, with $40.3 million allocated. The SPR, authorized in 1975, stores over 600 million barrels of crude oil for emergency use. For more information on DOE and Fossil Energy, visit their respective websites. President Bush ordered the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to be filled to capacity with 700 million barrels of oil in mid-November 2001. This was done using royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil, which is oil given to the federal government as payment for production from federal leases. Acquiring oil for the SPR through RIK avoids the need for Congress to allocate funds for direct purchases, but it also results in a loss of revenue to the Treasury. Deliveries of RIK oil began in the spring of 2002, with the fill rate varying based on geopolitical and market conditions. Deliveries of RIK oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) began in the spring of 2002, with fill rates varying based on geopolitical and market conditions. By the summer, deliveries exceeded 200,000 barrels per day. The Administration is currently filling the SPR at a rate of about 100,000 barrels per day. The costs of transporting RIK oil to SPR sites are now borne by contractors, with no new money recommended for the SPR Petroleum Account for FY2004. The approved FY2004 budget request for the SPR was $180.1 million, including funds for storage facilities development, operations, and the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR). The full Senate provided $178.1 million, a decrease of $2.0 million. The full Senate provided $178.1 million for the Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR), a decrease of $2.0 million from the request. The FY2004 law allocated $175.9 million, with $155.0 million for storage facilities development and operations, $15.9 million for management of the SPR sites, and $4.9 million for the NHOR. The FY2004 law did not include Senate language to develop procedures for minimizing acquisition costs and maximizing domestic supply. The NHOR, established by the Clinton Administration, houses 2 million barrels of home heating oil in above-ground facilities in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. Savings in the cost of leasing these facilities has reduced the cost of maintaining the NHOR. The FY2004 law contained $4.9 million for the NHOR, with Congress not satisfied with the current drawdown formula in place. The FY2003 appropriation provided $179.6 million for the SPR, including funds for storage facilities development, operations, management, transportation of RIK oil, and the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve. The FY2003 law reauthorized the SPR through FY2008 and proposed filling it to 700 million barrels with a potential expansion to 1 billion barrels. H.R. 6 also aimed to permanently authorize the Reserve, but the outcome of comprehensive energy legislation was uncertain. The outcome for comprehensive energy legislation in 2003 is unclear. The Naval Petroleum Reserves were transferred to DOI, with the U.S. retaining a 9% royalty interest in NOSR-2. DOE returned the undeveloped NOSR-2 to the Ute Indian Tribe in 2000. The U.S. retains a 9% royalty interest in NOSR-2 for remediation costs near Moab, Utah. The Naval Petroleum Reserves program has two small oil fields generating $6.9 million in revenue for FY2003. The FY2004 request was $16.5 million, with $5.6 million for environmental remediation at NOSR-3. The House approved a budget increase to $20.5 million, including funding for the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $17.9 million in funding for the Naval Petroleum Reserves program, with additional funds allocated for the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center. However, only $500,000 was approved for restoration activities, a significant reduction from the requested amount. California will receive 9% of the proceeds from the Elk Hills sale after deducting sale costs. The agreement between DOE and California included five annual payments of $36.0 million starting in FY1999, with the balance to be paid in equal installments in FY2004 and FY2005. The FY2003 budget requested an advance appropriation of $36.0 million for the Elk Hills School Lands Fund, enacted in the FY2003 appropriations law. The FY2004 budget sought an appropriation of $36.0 million, with the House agreeing to make it an advance appropriation payable on October 1, 2004. The FY2004 law maintained $36.0 million plus an advance appropriation for FY2005 of $36.0 million for a total of $72.0 million. The FY2004 budget request emphasized the Administration's energy efficiency programs to enhance economic growth, energy security, and the environment. The proposed budget structure reflected the reorganization of DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), with a decrease in conservation funding from $891.8 million in FY2003 to $875.8 million in FY2004. The main initiatives included a $22.4 million increase for Fuel Cell Technologies to reduce foreign oil dependence, enhance electric power infrastructure security, and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The FY2004 budget request focused on energy efficiency programs to boost economic growth, energy security, and the environment. Key initiatives included increased funding for Fuel Cell Technologies to reduce oil dependence, enhance power infrastructure security, and cut greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, funding was allocated for the National Climate Change Technology Initiative and the Weatherization grants program to promote competitive project solicitations and improve energy affordability for low-income families. The FY2004 budget request proposed cuts in overall funding, with R&D funding decreasing by $74.7 million. The House approved $879.5 million for DOE energy conservation funding, including an additional $15.0 million for Weatherization grants. The report (H.Rept. 108-195, p. 12) highlighted the need for DOE to improve measuring program success and discontinuing ineffective programs. The Committee emphasized the importance of incremental technology improvements for energy efficiency and emission reductions. Additionally, it restored DOE-proposed energy conservation reductions to avoid discontinuing research investments prematurely. The Committee also agreed on eliminating positions based on EERE reorganization and implementing recommendations from the National Academy of Public Administration's review. The Senate approved $861.6 million for FY2004 DOE energy conservation funding, with a decrease of $14.1 million compared to the Administration's request. This included a cut of $35.9 million for R&D and an increase of $5.8 million for grants. The report emphasized the need for DOE to improve program success measurement and discontinuing ineffective programs. The Senate approved funding for DOE energy conservation in FY2004, with a total of $878.0 million enacted after a 0.59% rescission. This included a cut of $16.6 million for R&D and an increase of $2.9 million for grants. The Interior Appropriations conference approved $883.2 million for energy conservation funding. The conference managers agreed on directives for energy conservation in FY2004, excluding two Senate recommendations. The Secretary of DOE can add measures like electric thermal storage to eligible weatherization measures. Key provisions include support for the Climate Change Technology Initiative and funding for natural gas vehicle infrastructure and research on fueling stations. The DOE Secretary is empowered to consider making electrochemical storage technology eligible for weatherization grants. No funding is provided in FY2004 for the Energy Efficiency Science Initiative. A technology transfer effort should be applied to new conservation technologies developed at national laboratories. For more information on energy conservation, visit the DOE website. The Indian Health Service provides medical and environmental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides health services for approximately 1.5 million to 1.7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through a system of federal, tribal, and urban Indian operated programs and facilities. IHS operates hospitals, health centers, school health centers, health stations, and residential treatment centers. Tribes and tribal groups also operate facilities under IHS contracts and compacts. IHS funding is separated into services and facilities categories. The FY2004 IHS appropriations totaled $2.92 billion, with 87% allocated for health services and 13% for health facilities. A Senate amendment for an additional $292 million was rejected due to violating the Budget Act. Senator Daschle argued for more funding citing unmet health needs and disparities in healthcare spending between American Indians and federal prisoners. The Senate rejected an amendment to strike funding for the reorganization plan for the BIA and OST and transfer the funds to the IHS. They agreed to ensure that IHS funds are not redirected to unjustified programs. The FY2004 law prohibited the use of funds for assessments not approved by the Appropriations Committees and restricted reductions in IHS personnel. In recent years, IHS services are funded through congressional appropriations, private health insurance, and federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The IHS is estimated to collect $567.6 million in reimbursements in FY2004, a 26% increase from FY2003. The budget for clinical services in FY2004 was $2.02 billion, with increases for hospital and health clinic programs over the President's request. In FY2004, funding for hospital and health clinic programs increased over the President's request. Specifically, $1.25 billion (62%) supported hospitals and clinics, with additional funding for dental health, mental health, and substance abuse treatment. Contract health services received $479.1 million, a decrease from the President's request. Preventive health services received $106.9 million, an increase from the previous year. The FY2004 law allocated funding for preventive health services, including public health nursing, health education, immunizations, and the community health representatives program. Other health-related activities received a total of $398.5 million, with decreases from the previous year and the President's request. This included support for off-reservation urban health projects, scholarships for healthcare professionals, tribal management grants, and IHS administration. The FY2004 law allocated funding for tribal management grants, IHS administration and management costs, self-governance, and contract support costs. Contract support costs are awarded to tribes for administering programs under contracts or compacts authorized under the Indian Self-Determination Act. The IHS's facilities category includes money for the construction, maintenance, and improvement of health and sanitation facilities. The FY2004 law allocated $391.4 million for Indian Health Service facilities, a 5% increase from FY2003. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation was created in 1974 to resolve a land dispute between the tribes, involving voluntary relocation and new homes at federal expense. Congress has expressed concerns about the relocation process and avoiding forced relocations or evictions. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) is involved in housing acquisition, land acquisition, infrastructure construction, post-move family support, and certification of families' eligibility for relocation benefits. In FY2004, ONHIR received $13.4 million in appropriations, a decrease from the previous year. Relocation efforts began in 1977, with a backlog of approved relocatees awaiting replacement homes. Most families affected are Navajo, with a majority already relocated but 190 Navajo families still pending relocation. The House Appropriations Committee estimated in 2003 that 190 Navajo families still need to complete relocation, with most not living on Hopi land and not starting the process for replacement housing. By FY2002, all but one of the 27 Hopi families had relocated. ONHIR aimed to finish relocation by FY2006 and post-move assistance by FY2008, depending on infrastructure and relocatees' decisions. Congressional committees have not criticized the current pace of relocation. Some Navajo families have resisted relocation, while the Hopi Tribe has pushed for it. About 16 of the remaining Navajo families are still on Hopi land. In 1996, Congress approved \"accommodation agreements\" with 75-year leases for Navajo families on Hopi partitioned land. Most families signed, but some refuse to relocate. ONHIR is prohibited from evicting Navajo families without providing replacement homes. Forced eviction may become an issue in the future as the backlog of relocatees is reduced. The Smithsonian Institution receives federal funding and is responsible for numerous museums and research facilities. In FY2004, it was allocated $596.3 million, $12.6 million above the House-passed level. The Smithsonian Institution received $596.3 million in FY2004, which was $12.6 million above the House-passed level. The enacted level was an increase over the FY2003 appropriation, primarily for operations of the National Museum of the American Indian, renovation at the National Zoo, revitalization of deteriorating buildings, and security. Salaries and Expenses were provided $488.7 million, an increase of $12.1 million above the FY2004 request. Facilities Capital received $107.6 million for revitalization, construction, and facilities planning and design. The FY2004 law allocated $107.6 million for \"Facilities Capital,\" with $89.6 million for \"revitalization\" to address deterioration in SI buildings and make critical repairs. The National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) received $38.1 million for operations, but no new construction funds were specified. The NMAI project was controversial, with arguments for and against its construction. The Smithsonian Institution allocated funds for the construction of the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) in Washington. The groundbreaking ceremony took place in 1999, with an estimated opening in 2004. There was controversy over the proposed closing of the Smithsonian Institution Center for Materials Research and Education (SCMRE), which was ultimately retained after a report by a Science Commission in 2003. The Smithsonian Institution's science programs have faced funding challenges, with declining support for salary increases noted in 2003. The FY2004 law provided level funding for the SCMRE. The institution receives trust funds from various sources, including private contributions, government grants, and revenue from business ventures like the Smithsonian magazine and retail shops. Government grants and contracts were projected to be $87.0 million for FY2003. In FY2003, the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a plan for the Smithsonian Institution to track trust fund expenditures. There was a discrepancy between approved budgets and actual expenditures, but this issue has been resolved. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities provides federal support for arts and humanities through organizations like the NEA, NEH, and IMS. For more information on the Smithsonian Institution, visit http://www.si.edu/. The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Institute of Museum Services (IMS) are now part of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) with an Office of Museum Services (OMS). The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act expired in 1993, but NEA and NEH have been operating on temporary authority. The 104th Congress established the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Office of Museum Services. Congress debates whether federal funding for arts and humanities is appropriate, with opponents suggesting abolishing NEA and NEH, while proponents argue for federal support. Proponents argue that federal support for arts and humanities is crucial, as the NEA provides grants for national touring theater and dance companies. In FY2004, Congress allocated $121.0 million for NEA, supporting approximately 1,600 grants, with over 40% going to state arts agencies. The Challenge America Arts fund received $21.7 million for arts education and outreach in rural and under-served areas. The NEA is required to submit a detailed report to Congress on the use of funds for the Challenge America program. Congressional support for the NEA is increasing, but debates often arise regarding past questionable grants. Congress continues to emphasize funding priorities and restrictions on grants, such as no seasonal support for groups and limited grants for individuals. The NEH supports grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public programs. The NEH receives funding for humanities programs and regional centers, including a Challenge Grant program to match private donations. In FY2004, $135.3 million was allocated, with $9.9 million for the \"We the People Initiative grants\" to improve humanities education in schools. The Office of Museum Services provides grants to museums for leadership, conservation, assessment, and General Operating Support. In FY2004, IMLS received $262.2 million, with $31.4 million for OMS, $198.2 million for Library services, and $32.6 million for specified projects. The funding was moved to the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL31803. In FY2004, funding for Arts and Humanities, including the National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, and Institute of Museum Services, was included in the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. For more information, refer to CRS Report RS20287. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is primarily used by agencies like Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and Forest Service for land acquisition. Congress has also allocated LWCF funds for recreational development and other related activities. The LWCF is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015, with a total potential appropriation of $27.2 billion since its inception, but actual appropriations have only been $13.6 billion. The LWCF has had total appropriations of $13.6 billion since its inception. In recent years, funding for federal land acquisition and state grants has fluctuated, with a decrease in appropriations from $573 million in FY2002 to $263 million in FY2004. This decrease is evident in the FY2003 and FY2004 appropriations, which were lower than previous years. In recent years, LWCF funding for federal land acquisition and state grants has fluctuated, with appropriations decreasing from $573 million in FY2002 to $263 million in FY2004. Congress has also allocated funds for other conservation programs, with reductions in FY2003 and FY2004. In FY2003 and FY2004, funding for land acquisition decreased significantly compared to previous years, with appropriations falling from $573 million in FY2002 to $348 million in FY2004. The legislative process saw a decline in funding requests, with the House, Senate, and conference committee all approving lower amounts than initially requested. In FY2004, there was a large reduction in funding for land acquisition compared to previous years. The Administration requested $554 million for programs other than land acquisition and stateside grants. Specific programs funded using the LWCF included Forest Service's Forest Stewardship Program, Forest Legacy Program, Urban and Community Forestry Program, Department of the Interior's interagency Cooperative Conservation Initiative, and Fish and Wildlife Service's State and Tribal programs. In FY2004, the Administration allocated funding for various conservation programs, including Landowner Incentive Grants, Stewardship Grants, Cooperative Endangered Species Grants, State and Tribal Wildlife Grants, and State and Private Forestry Programs. The House and Senate provided differing amounts of funding, with the FY2004 law ultimately allocating $221 million. The Administration sought funding for the Cooperative Conservation Initiative in FY2004, but Congress did not allocate any funds for this program. The FY2004 law ultimately allocated $221 million for various conservation programs, including Forestry Programs. The Conservation and Reinvestment Act (CARA) amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to create the Conservation Trust Fund, combining funding for multiple resource protection programs. This initiative aimed to increase conservation funding, with total spending authorized to grow annually from $1.6 billion in FY2001 to $2.4 billion in FY2006. The funding for conservation programs increased from $1.6 billion in FY2001 to $2.4 billion in FY2006. Disagreements exist on how to categorize funding for certain programs, such as the Cooperative Conservation Initiative. Appropriations history shows that in FY2001, $1.68 billion was appropriated, exceeding the target. In FY2002, Congress almost reached the target of $1.76 billion with an appropriation of $1.75 billion. In FY2002, Congress appropriated $1.75 billion for conservation programs, almost reaching the target of $1.76 billion. For the Interior portion, Congress provided $1.03 billion, falling short of the authorized target of $1.44 billion. The FY2003 request was $1.67 billion, below the target of $1.92 billion, and Congress appropriated $1.51 billion. The Administration's FY2004 request was $1.33 billion, below the target of $2.08 billion, with $1.00 billion allocated for the Interior portion. For FY2004, funding levels for the CSC were not identified in most bills or committee reports, except for the House Appropriations Committee report. Representatives Obey and Dicks inserted a table showing the difference between the target funding and the estimated total funding for CSC programs. An amendment to fund this difference by rescinding a portion of tax cuts for high-income taxpayers was rejected. The table in Table 19 has not been updated for FY2004. The CSC funding levels for FY2004 were not specified in most bills or reports, except for the House Appropriations Committee report. A table showing the difference between target funding and estimated total funding for CSC programs was included by Representatives Obey and Dicks, but an amendment to fund this difference was rejected. The table in Table 19 has not been updated for FY2004. The table presents the current and proposed distribution of conservation funds, with dashes indicating zero funding for certain programs. In FY2003, funding for the CSC was not specified in the House, Senate, or appropriations law. Most programs did not receive separate funding under conservation spending for FY2001-FY2003 or as proposed in the FY2004 budget. The table shows the distribution of conservation funds, with most programs previously funded under the CSC continued in FY2003. The FY2004 funding was not updated, with $50.0 million allocated for a new Cooperative Conservation Initiative and $150.0 million for states' land acquisition activities. Additionally, $3.0 million for Departmental Management/BIA Water Settlement in FY2003 is not included in the total. The FY2004 appropriations history shows that the Incentive Grant programs and Stewardship grants programs were sustained in FY2002. Funding for FWS Migratory Bird Fund and FWS Multinational Species fund in FY2003 was $3.0 million and $4.8 million respectively, with a request of $0 and $7.0 million in FY2004. Forest Stewardship funds were not part of the CSC in FY2001 and FY2002, proposed at $49.5 million in FY2003 but did not receive funding. FY2003 appropriations and FY2004 request total for BLM, FWS, and NPS. The FY2004 appropriations history shows sustained funding for Incentive Grant programs and Stewardship grants programs in FY2002. Funding for FWS Migratory Bird Fund and FWS Multinational Species fund in FY2003 was $3.0 million and $4.8 million respectively, with a $7.0 million request in FY2004. The final total includes $7.8 million from the FWS Migratory Bird Fund and FWS Multinational Species Fund. The alterations of the natural flow of water in South Florida are believed to be the leading causes of environmental deterioration. In 1996, Congress authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a plan to restore the South Florida ecosystem, including the Everglades. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was completed in 1999, with federal involvement authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. This act is considered the primary law for Everglades restoration, with collaborative efforts ongoing between federal, state, local, and tribal entities. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) aims to redirect excess freshwater to restore the South Florida ecosystem. The federal government covers half of the $7.8 billion cost, with the rest shared by the State of Florida and other stakeholders. CERP consists of 68 projects to be implemented over 36 years. Funding for restoration projects in the South Florida ecosystem, including CERP and non-CERP activities, is provided through various appropriations bills to DOI agencies such as the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and Bureau of Indian Affairs. Additional appropriations are allocated to other restoration projects through agencies like the Corps, NOAA, EPA, and U.S. Department of Agriculture. From FY1993 to FY2003, federal appropriations for South Florida ecosystem restoration exceeded $1.9 billion, with state funding over $3.6 billion. The average annual federal cost for restoration activities in Southern Florida over the next 10 years is estimated to be around $286 million. In FY2004, the Administration requested $311.0 million for Everglades restoration, $46.9 million more than FY2003. $48.0 million was allocated for CERP implementation. DOI received $69.1 million for CERP and non-CERP activities in South Florida ecosystem restoration for FY2004. In FY2004, federal appropriations for Everglades restoration were $43.2 million below the requested level of $112.3 million. NPS received $44.3 million for construction and research activities, FWS received $16.3 million for refuges and ecological services, USGS received $7.8 million for research, and BIA received $0.5 million for water projects on tribal lands. DOI received $8.8 million for conducting CERP activities. In FY2004, federal appropriations for Everglades restoration were $43.2 million below the requested level of $112.3 million. The largest difference in funding for DOI restoration in South Florida was $40 million requested for mineral rights acquisition in Big Cypress Preserve. Collier Resources Company has reached an agreement to sell mineral rights to DOI. In FY2004, federal appropriations for Everglades restoration were below the requested level. The largest difference in funding was $40 million for mineral rights acquisition in Big Cypress Preserve. Collier Resources Company reached an agreement to sell mineral rights to DOI, but funding was not included in the appropriations due to an ongoing DOI inquiry. The FY2004 law exempted funds for Everglades restoration from certain restrictions on DOI appropriations. The law also allowed for funds to be transferred among restoration activities in the Everglades. The Secretary of the Interior was authorized to transfer funds for Everglades restoration activities, including monitoring water quality, eradicating invasive plants, and recovering endangered species. Funds could also be used for water quality improvement technologies in the Everglades ecosystem affecting the LNWR, helping Florida meet water quality standards. Remaining funds could be used for DOI lands with approval from House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations requested provisions regarding land acquisition for the implementation of CERP in Florida. Concerns were raised about phosphorus mitigation in the Everglades due to a new law extending deadlines for mitigation efforts, potentially compromising restoration. The new law extending phosphorus mitigation deadlines for the Everglades may compromise restoration efforts and jeopardize federal appropriations for CERP. Some Members of Congress and Florida State Legislature reacted unfavorably, leading to conditions in the FY2004 law tying funds for restoration to water quality standards achievement. Funds for the Modified Water Deliveries Project are contingent on approval from four federal departments/agencies. The Interior, Army, EPA, and Attorney General jointly file an annual report until 2006 on water quality in the A.R.M. Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge and Everglades National Park. House and Senate Committees disapprove further funds if standards are not met. Similar conditions are in Energy and Water Development Appropriations bills.

The Bush Administration is considering privatizing government jobs through competitive sourcing to save money. Websites for more information on Everglades Restoration include http://www.sfrestore.org and http://www.evergladesplan.org/. Several CRS reports provide background on Everglades Restoration and Phosphorus Mitigation. The Bush Administration is considering outsourcing government jobs to private businesses for cost savings. Concerns have been raised about the quality of services and potential savings. The competitive sourcing initiative is being examined for various agencies, including the National Park Service and the Forest Service. Over 11,000 Park Service jobs are being considered for outsourcing. The Forest Service is considering outsourcing a quarter of its 40,000 jobs, with concerns raised about the significant costs and reprogramming of funds without approval. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have included language on outsourcing in their bills. The House and Senate bills addressed outsourcing studies, with the House bill facing a veto threat over funding restrictions. The Senate rejected a similar amendment but required annual reports on outsourcing from the Secretary of the Interior. Spending limits for outsourcing studies in FY2004 were set, with the Forest Service limited to $5.0 million, DOI to $2.5 million, and DOE also included. The FY2004 law set spending limits for outsourcing studies, capping DOI at $2.5 million and DOE at $0.5 million unless additional funds are approved by Congress. For studies involving more than 10 federal employees, the contracted function must be 10% or $10.0 million cheaper. Agencies must report annually to Congress on outsourcing activities, including costs, savings, and impacts on federal employees. The FY2004 law requires agencies to submit competitive sourcing proposals within 60 days of enactment. Annual budget requests must specify funding for outsourcing studies. Concerns were raised about the fast pace of outsourcing initiatives and potential costs. No provision in the law prohibits Interior Department funding for the Klamath Fishery Management Council. The House provisions regarding water allocations in the Klamath River Basin sparked controversy among interested parties. The Bureau of Reclamation is currently operating the Klamath Project under a one-year plan while working on a 10-year plan. The FWS and NOAA Fisheries completed consultation on a 2002 10-year plan, but the Bureau rejected their biological opinions. The FWS and NMFS/NOAA Fisheries completed consultation on a 10-year operating plan for the Klamath Project but controversies persist over the science and data used. Recent court decisions have addressed these concerns. In July 2003, the House rejected an amendment related to bear baiting in the FY2004 appropriations process. Opponents of bear baiting amendment in FY2004 appropriations process cited states' control over wildlife management on federal lands. Procedural questions on H.R. 1472 hearings were raised by Members. Amendment proponents argued banning bear baiting is cruel and unsportsmanlike, with little impact on bear populations in states that disallowed it. The House Appropriations Committee and Congressional Record show figures for Departmental Offices, including Insular Affairs and the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program. FY2003 enacted figures include cuts and funds for wildland fire emergencies. FY2003 Supplemental appropriation added funds for various agencies. FY2004 figures reflect across-the-board cuts in appropriations law. The FY2004 appropriations law (P.L.108-108) included a 0.59% across-the-board cut. Historical data from FY2000 to FY2003 shows funding details for various agencies, including the Departmental Offices and the National Endowment for the Arts. The FY2003 consolidated appropriations law (P.L. 108-7) also included a 0.65% across-the-board cut. The FY2003 appropriations law (P.L. 108-7) allocated funds for wildland fire emergencies, including amounts for BLM and the Forest Service. An FY2003 Emergency Supplemental Appropriation (P.L. 108-83) added funds for BLM, FWS, and FS.
