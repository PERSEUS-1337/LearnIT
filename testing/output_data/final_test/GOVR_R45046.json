    "content": "In March 2015, the Saudi-led coalition was established to engage in military operations in Yemen against the Ansar Allah/Houthi movement. The United States provided logistical and intelligence support to the coalition's operations without direct military action in Yemen. Since March 2015, the United States has supported Resolution 2216 at the UN Security Council, imposing an arms embargo on Houthi-Saleh forces in Yemen. Congress has been actively debating policies to reduce civilian casualties, improve humanitarian conditions, combat Iranian support for the Houthis, and counter Al Qaeda and Islamic State forces in Yemen. Members are also focused on preserving maritime security in the Bab al Mandab Strait. The U.S. is involved in countering Al Qaeda and Islamic State forces in Yemen, with Congress debating the conflict in the context of regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Lawmakers are concerned about the U.S.-Saudi relationship, especially after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. There have been discussions in Congress about limiting defense sales to Saudi Arabia and strengthening the role of Congress in foreign policy. The debate over Yemen has highlighted bipartisan interest in asserting legislative branch prerogatives. Congressional interest in asserting legislative branch prerogatives has grown gradually, focusing on limiting executive branch power in U.S. military involvement in coalition operations, including in Yemen. This interest has led to legislative changes in global authorities, such as the Department of Defense's ability to enter agreements with partner militaries. Initially, congressional focus in 2015 was on the Iran nuclear deal and Operation Inherent Resolve against ISIS, but interest in Yemen conflict has since increased due to lack of conclusive victory by the Saudi-led coalition. In 2015, the Saudi-led coalition faced mounting international criticism for civilian casualties from air strikes in Yemen. Congressional lawmakers expressed concern about the humanitarian situation, with some advocating for a halt to U.S. support until safeguards were in place to prevent civilian casualties. Senator Markey highlighted the need for diplomacy and restraint in addressing the crisis. The Obama Administration faced criticism for its support of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, with lawmakers expressing concern over U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Senators requested prior notification of shipments of precision guided munitions to the kingdom, marking a new use of notification authority. No joint resolutions of disapproval were made at that time. In response to concerns over U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, legislation was introduced in April 2016 to place conditions on future proposed sales of precision guided munitions (PGMs). Proposed amendments to defense legislation in FY2017 aimed to add similar conditions or prohibit the transfer of cluster munitions to Saudi Arabia. The cluster munitions amendment was narrowly defeated in a June 2016 House vote. In the summer of 2016, the United Nations held peace talks in Kuwait to end the conflict in Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition temporarily halted airstrikes on Sanaa from April to August 2016. However, when peace talks collapsed in August, the bombing resumed and the war escalated. The Obama Administration reduced some U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's air campaign by withdrawing personnel from a joint planning cell. Despite this, U.S.-Saudi cooperation continued, and a proposed sale of tanks to Saudi Arabia was notified to Congress in August 2016. Some lawmakers raised concerns about the sale due to the situation in Yemen. In September 2016, joint resolutions of disapproval of a proposed tank sale to Saudi Arabia were introduced in Congress. The Senate voted to table a motion to discharge the SFRC from further consideration of the resolution. Following a Saudi airstrike in Yemen, the Obama Administration initiated a review of U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia, leading to a hold on a planned sale of precision guided munitions and limited intelligence sharing. In the final months of the Obama Administration, U.S. Armed Forces exchanged fire with forces in Yemen. Houthi-Saleh forces launched anti-ship missiles at U.S. Navy vessels, prompting U.S. strikes in self-defense. Secretary of State John Kerry's peace initiatives were rejected by the parties involved. During the 114th Congress, efforts to broker peace in Oman were rejected by the parties involved. Lawmakers increasingly criticized the U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen due to the worsening humanitarian situation. Some viewed Iran's backing of the Houthi movement as evidence of its regional destabilization efforts. The Houthis' attacks on Gulf state infrastructure were seen as a threat to U.S. and Gulf security. During the 114th Congress, lawmakers debated U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, with some viewing it as a test of U.S. commitments to Saudi Arabian security. Supporters argued that cutting off arms sales would weaken a vital partner threatened by the Iran-backed Houthis. Others criticized continued support for damaging U.S. reputation for upholding international law and human rights. Legislation to limit arms sales to Saudi Arabia was not passed, sparking a broader congressional debate. During the 114th Congress, lawmakers debated U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, with some viewing it as a test of U.S. commitments to Saudi Arabian security. The Obama Administration had taken steps to limit U.S.-coalition cooperation, but human rights organizations deemed it insufficient. President Donald Trump showed strong support for the Saudi-led coalition. President Donald Trump has shown strong support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen as a countermeasure against Iranian interference. He reviewed U.S. policy towards Yemen, including lifting restrictions on arms sales and intelligence sharing imposed by the Obama Administration. Trump proceeded with proposed sales of precision guided munitions technology and increased training for Saudi Arabia's air force. Congress debated a resolution of disapproval regarding these actions. President Trump directed his Administration to focus on ending the war in Yemen, avoiding regional conflict, and defending Saudi Arabia's territorial integrity. The coalition launched an offensive to take the strategic port city of Hudaydah, sparking calls from Congress to improve aid access and negotiate a cease-fire. In March 2017, House Members urged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to open the Yemeni port of Hodeida to humanitarian aid. Another group of House Members called for Congress approval before providing support to the coalition's offensive against Hudaydah. The Senate debated a resolution to disapprove of direct sales of weapons to Saudi Arabia, considering issues like the U.S.-Saudi relationship and involvement in the Yemen war. Some lawmakers raised concerns about alleged violations enabled by U.S. arms sales and military support. During Senate debate, Senator Graham argued for U.S. arms sales to coalition for precision weapons to minimize civilian casualties. Senator Murphy countered, urging Saudis to use munitions only for military purposes and address humanitarian crisis. Senate rejected motion to discharge Foreign Relations Committee from further consideration (47-53, Record Vote 143). In a bid to end U.S. support for the coalition's military intervention in Yemen, Representative Ro Khanna introduced a concurrent resolution (H.Con.Res. 81) pursuant to the War Powers Resolution. The House agreed to delay expedited consideration of the resolution until after the November 2016 election and adopted a nonbinding alternative (H.Res. 599). President Trump sought to improve relations with Saudi Arabia and counter Iran while also emphasizing the need for coalition members to improve humanitarian access and pursue a settlement to the conflict in Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition imposed a blockade on Yemen's ports, worsening the humanitarian crisis. President Trump urged Saudi Arabia to allow essential supplies into Yemen. The coalition later announced a 30-day lifting of the blockade on Hudaydah port. The White House welcomed Saudi Arabia's humanitarian actions in Yemen amid the ongoing conflict. Efforts in the Senate and House were made to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition's military intervention in Yemen. Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a resolution to remove U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities in Yemen not authorized by Congress. A resolution directing the President to remove U.S. forces from Yemen was tabled in favor of a House-passed nonbinding resolution. There was disagreement in 2018 between Congress and the Trump Administration regarding whether U.S. forces assisting the Saudi-led coalition were involved in active or imminent hostilities. Some Members argued that U.S. forces supporting the coalition had been introduced into a situation indicating imminent hostilities, while the Trump Administration disagreed. The Acting Department of Defense General Counsel outlined the extent of U.S. support to the Saudi-led coalition, including defense articles, air-to-air refueling, intelligence support, and military assistance. On March 20, 2018, the Senate debated S.J.Res. 54, focusing on issues like Yemen's humanitarian crisis and Congress's role in authorizing military force abroad. Senator Bob Corker pledged new legislation and hearings on U.S. policy in Yemen, leading to a majority vote to table further consideration of the resolution. Senator Robert Menendez expressed conditional support for Corker's approach, echoed by other Senators who voted to table the motion. The Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on Yemen a month later, where U.S. defense officials stated that while the United States refueled Saudi aircraft and provided advice on targeting techniques, CENTCOM did not track coalition aircraft after refueling. U.S. officials acknowledged that pressure from Congress has altered how the Administration deals with the coalition over the Yemen conflict. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's efforts have been crucial in addressing concerns over restrictions on humanitarian and commercial goods entering Yemen. The committee proposed legislation to place conditions on U.S. assistance to the coalition, aiming to limit funds for in-flight refueling operations of Saudi-led coalition aircraft. This message from the Executive Branch and the committee is significant in addressing the conflict in Yemen. The Senate Armed Services Committee incorporated provisions from S.J.Res. 58 into the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act, requiring certifications for coalition aircraft operations. President Trump objected to these provisions in P.L. 115-232, stating they should only apply to feasible and consistent actions. The Saudi-led coalition launched \"Operation Golden Victory\" to retake the Red Sea port city of Hudaydah, leading to increased fighting and humanitarian concerns in Yemen. Senators expressed concerns about exacerbating the crisis with pending military operations. The UAE and its Yemeni partners' military operations in Yemen will worsen the humanitarian crisis by disrupting aid delivery and damaging infrastructure. Senator Menendez has concerns about the potential U.S. sale of precision guided munitions to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, fearing they may not be used strategically to address the conflict and humanitarian suffering. The coalition airstrike in Yemen killed 51 people, including 40 children, prompting calls for a transparent investigation. Members of Congress are seeking more information on U.S. operations in the region. Several Senators submitted an amendment to the FY2019 Defense Department appropriations act (H.R. 6157) to prohibit funds supporting the Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen until the Secretary of Defense certifies compliance with civilian protection rules. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo certified the use of funds for in-flight refueling of coalition aircraft, despite criticism from some Members of Congress. Several House Members introduced H.Con.Res. 138 to direct the President to remove U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities in Yemen within 30 days, unless authorized under the 2001 AUMF. The Administration argued that U.S. forces supporting the Saudi-led coalition are not engaged in hostilities in Yemen. Pressure from potential famine and international criticism over Jamal Khashoggi's killing pushed for peace talks in late 2018. In late 2018, pressure from potential famine and international criticism over Jamal Khashoggi's killing led to calls for peace talks in Yemen. Secretary Mattis announced the coalition would use its own military capabilities for operations in Yemen. A cease-fire was brokered by the UN in Hudaydah as part of the Stockholm Agreement. The United Nations chaired a Redeployment Coordination Committee to monitor the cease-fire and redeployment in Yemen. The international community praised the Stockholm Agreement as a step towards de-escalation and peace. The Senate passed resolutions directing the President to remove U.S. forces from hostilities in Yemen, except those targeting Al Qaeda. The Senate also passed a resolution holding Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible for certain actions. The 115th Congress debated US involvement in the Yemen civil war, questioning adherence to existing laws on security assistance and human rights standards. New legislation was enacted to restrict the use of US funds for activities related to Yemen and increase oversight over executive branch policy. The House and its Rules Committee voted on resolutions regarding war powers and Yemen. The House and Rules Committee voted on resolutions regarding war powers and Yemen, showing increased congressional opposition to U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led coalition intervention. Despite shifting votes in favor of critical measures, consensus on Yemen remains elusive. Many lawmakers aim to maintain U.S.-Saudi relations, express concerns about Iranian activities, and support humanitarian efforts to end the conflict. Some lawmakers support expanded humanitarian access and efforts to end the conflict in Yemen, while others oppose U.S. involvement citing moral concerns and the risk of famine. The conflict's continuation is seen as benefiting Iran and Sunni extremist groups. Congressional consideration of Yemen legislation may signal a broader effort to assert congressional prerogatives in U.S. foreign policy. The 116th Congress may debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Yemen's chronic instability. Yemen remains the world's worst humanitarian crisis, requiring sustained international attention and financial assistance. The 116th Congress may face questions about U.S. diplomacy, security support, and assistance for Yemen's political settlement, requiring international attention and financial assistance."
