    "content": "The \"National Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act of 2000\" establishes a pilot program to provide confidential assistance to small businesses, improve their compliance with federal regulations, create partnerships among federal agencies for outreach, gather unbiased feedback on the regulatory environment, and utilize Small Business Development Centers to assist with regulatory compliance. The Act establishes a Small Business Regulatory Assistance Pilot Program under the Small Business Act to provide confidential assistance to small businesses for regulatory compliance. The definitions in this section clarify terms like Administrator, Association, participating Small Business Development Center, pilot program, and regulatory compliance assistance. The Small Business Administration will establish a pilot program to provide regulatory compliance assistance to small business concerns through Small Business Development Centers, the Association, and Federal compliance partnership programs in various states and territories. The Small Business Administration will establish a pilot program with Small Business Development Centers to provide access to information, training, and one-on-one counseling for small business owners on federal regulations. The pilot program with Small Business Development Centers offers regulatory compliance assistance, technical support, and referrals to experts. Participating centers must submit quarterly reports to the Administrator detailing the assistance provided and data obtained from federal agencies. The Small Business Development Centers must submit quarterly reports to the Administrator on regulatory compliance assistance provided to small businesses. Reports must be in electronic form, with the option to submit interim reports as needed. The Administrator cannot require disclosure of the names or addresses of small businesses assisted. The Administrator, through the office of the Associate Administrator for Small Business Development Centers, will serve as a data repository and clearinghouse for information submitted by Small Business Development Centers under the pilot program. This data will be transmitted to the President and the Committees on Small Business of the Senate and House of Representatives. The Administrator will provide an annual report to the Committees on Small Business of the Senate and House of Representatives, including data on the types of assistance, number of small businesses contacted, and number of small businesses assisted by participating Small Business Development Centers under the pilot program. The annual report will include data on outreach activities, cases of conflicting advice, and recommendations for improving small business regulation by Small Business Development Centers. The Small Business Development Center must be certified to receive assistance under the pilot program, with a waiver option available if certification is being pursued in good faith. The subsection will be effective on October 1, 2000. The Administrator will select two participating centers in consultation with the Association. The Administrator will choose two Small Business Development Centers from different groups of states to join the pilot program, excluding selecting two from the same state. The groups of states include Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Vermont, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, District of Columbia, Delaware, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota. The Administrator will select two Small Business Development Centers from different groups of states to participate in the pilot program within 60 days of promulgating regulations. Matching requirements do not apply to assistance under the program, and an evaluation report is due within 3 years. The Comptroller General will evaluate the pilot program within 3 years and submit a report with recommendations to extend it to all Small Business Development Centers. The Administrator can only use funds specifically appropriated for the program. After consulting with the Association, the Administrator will promulgate final regulations within 180 days to implement the Act. These regulations will establish priorities for assistance, standards for services provided by Small Business Development Centers, national service delivery standards, and work plan requirements for participating centers. The Act was passed by the House of Representatives on September 26, 2000."
