    "content": "On August 7, 1998, the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed, resulting in 252 deaths and over 5,000 injuries. Secretary of State Albright vowed to track down and punish those responsible. The United States launched missile strikes in Afghanistan against groups linked to terrorist financier Usama bin Laden, who was believed to be a key figure in the bombings. Additionally, a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan with ties to bin Laden was also targeted. This action was part of the U.S.'s history of retaliating against anti-U.S. operations, such as in Libya in 1986 and Iraq in 1993. The U.S. has taken a proactive approach in targeting terrorist organizations since 1993, with roughly 10 suspects brought to trial. The recent military strike against a terrorist network signals a shift towards preemptive action in counter-terrorism policy, showing a more global and less constrained approach. Administration officials have emphasized this new direction through press conferences and interviews. The U.S. has shifted towards preemptive action in counter-terrorism policy, emphasizing a long-term, proactive approach to combat terrorist threats. Key officials stress the need for offensive measures and readiness to confront groups seeking weapons of mass destruction. The U.S. has launched preemptive strikes against terrorist organizations seeking chemical weapons and other dangerous weapons. This marks a shift towards proactive counter-terrorism policy, targeting multiple terrorist targets in foreign nations. The strikes aim to dismantle organizational infrastructure posing long-term threats. The shift in counter-terrorism policy towards a more proactive and global approach, focusing on national security and military force, with less reliance on traditional law enforcement methods. This includes the use of preemptive strikes against terrorist organizations and a willingness to act unilaterally when necessary. The shift in counter-terrorism policy towards a proactive deterrent approach, emphasizing the need for aggrieved nations with the most at stake to lead the battle and take strong measures alone. This policy aims to show strength, provide disincentives for terrorists, be cost-effective, disrupt the enemy, and garner support from other nations. The U.S. government employs various policy tools to combat international terrorism, including diplomacy. Arguments against a proactive military approach include violating sovereignty, increasing terrorism, alienating allies, being anti-Islamic, radicalizing populations, and causing unintended consequences. The U.S. government uses a range of policy tools to combat international terrorism, including diplomacy, economic sanctions, covert action, and military force. Military response is more likely after a terrorist attack to establish accountability. Pressuring sanctuary states and neighboring states can restrict terrorist activities. Legal approaches like criminal prosecution and extradition are gaining prominence. Collaboration with victim states through the U.N. and other organizations is also an option. Enhanced intelligence targeting of non-state \"amorphous\" groups and coordination among agencies, governments, and private security is critical. Developing more effective human intelligence sources is necessary. Avoid overpersonalizing conflicts against terrorist organizations and networks. Publicly focusing on individuals like bin Laden glamorizes them and misses the purpose of countermeasures. Enhanced unilateral use of covert operations holds promise as an effective long-term policy alternative to high-profile military force. The United States must institutionalize covert action capability to tap into the best each agency has to offer. Private funding is becoming critical to terrorist enterprises, making terrorist front businesses and banking accounts potential targets for covert operations. To support effective law enforcement efforts in curbing money flows to terrorists, their organizations, and front companies, assisting personnel in other countries may be necessary. \"Grey\" or \"black\" area information operations targeting vulnerabilities in key terrorist leaders, promoting paranoia, and inter-organizational rivalries should receive increased attention. The U.S. terrorism policy lacks a proactive multifaceted information offensive aspect. Congress should focus on domestic and overseas preparedness for terrorist attacks and retaliatory strikes. The need for consultation with Congress over policy shifts related to terrorist attacks and sustaining public support for long-term costly policies is highlighted. The importance of advance intelligence in preparedness for domestic and overseas terrorist attacks is emphasized. Intelligence and good relationships with foreign intelligence services are crucial for preparedness against terrorist attacks. Other key elements include thwarting terrorist actions, enhancing physical security, limiting loss of life and mass hysteria, and coordinating dissemination of life-saving information. Prompt dispatch of emergency teams to multiple disaster sites is essential. Consultation with Congress over policy shifts related to undeclared wars is a central concern. The Administration's efforts to inform Congress about the military response to terrorist activities have been reasonable. However, questions remain about whether Congress has been adequately briefed on new policy shifts or changes in emphasis. The Clinton Administration justifies the U.S. missile response under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter by invoking Section 324(4) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. This allows the President to use all necessary means, including covert action and military force, to disrupt international infrastructure used by terrorists. Some analysts question the broad authority granted by 22 USC 2377 for counter-terrorism, suggesting it could lead to unconventional violent exchanges. Others argue it is necessary for the president to have flexibility in addressing terrorist threats, with oversight from Congress. The issue of the presidential ban on assassinations (E.O. 12233) and its potential modification in a more proactive terrorism policy is also raised. The potential costs and consequences of future anti-terrorism efforts raise questions about public readiness to accept casualties and financial burdens. A more active federal role in public education is suggested to ensure an informed and engaged public to sustain an effective anti-terrorism response."
