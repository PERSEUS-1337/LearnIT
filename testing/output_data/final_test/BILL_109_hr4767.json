    "content": "The Act titled \"Tanning Accountability and Notification Act of 2006\" is also known as the \"Tanning Act.\" It includes findings related to tanning practices. The Congress finds that skin cancer is a significant health concern in the United States, with approximately one million Americans affected each year. Melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, is on the rise, with an estimated 111,900 new cases in 2006. Studies have linked skin cancer to excessive ultraviolet light exposure. Environmental Health Sciences identified broad spectrum ultraviolet radiation from artificial light sources as a known carcinogen, adding it to the list of substances linked to cancer. The FDA, along with other health organizations, discourages the use of tanning beds and sun lamps, stating that indoor tanning can be as harmful as outdoor tanning. Concerns have been raised about the high number of people, especially teenagers, visiting tanning salons daily in the United States. The FDA warns that indoor tanning devices emit harmful ultraviolet radiation similar to the sun, causing skin cancer, eye damage, and premature aging. Exposure to UV radiation from tanning equipment is not necessary for vitamin D levels. The February 2006 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology confirms that excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation is unnecessary for maintaining vitamin D levels and can lead to skin cancer and irreversible skin damage. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends warning labels on tanning devices about the risks of UV radiation. The FDA is required to report on the link between indoor tanning devices and skin cancer or other skin damage. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, will determine if labeling requirements for indoor tanning devices provide sufficient information on risks to consumers. This includes assessing the effectiveness of adding additional warnings to communicate the risks of indoor tanning. The Secretary will conduct consumer testing and public hearings to determine if indoor tanning device labels effectively communicate risks. A report will be submitted to Congress within one year, outlining measures to reduce associated risks."
