The Congress finds that Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, brother of the UAE president, was involved in severe torture and abuse of an Afghan grain dealer, Mohammed Shah Poor, captured on video and circulated online. In 2009, longer footage of Sheikh Issa's torture and abuse was presented in a US civil court. The UAE Ministry of Interior, led by another brother of Sheikh Issa, failed to investigate the matter despite Human Rights Watch condemning the government's lack of prosecution for the incident. Sheikh Issa faced charges in a UAE court after international outcry. He was acquitted of rape and other charges due to drug influence. Bassam and Ghassan Nabulsi were convicted and sentenced in absentia. Sheikh Issa faced charges in a UAE court and was acquitted of rape and other charges due to drug influence.
