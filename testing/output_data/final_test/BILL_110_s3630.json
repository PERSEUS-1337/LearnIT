    "content": "The \"AmericaView Authorization Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. Key findings are outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that increased access to Federal remote sensing data benefits State and local governments, educational institutions, and user communities by enabling the development of new applications, tools, and research opportunities. This is exemplified by the success of pilot projects like OhioView and Gateway to the Earth. Access to State data archives also supports educators in training students for technology careers in remote sensing. Universities and government agencies utilize remote sensing data for practical purposes, including training teachers and students in elementary and secondary education, partnering with historically black colleges and universities, and providing Native Americans with education on remote sensing applications and satellite-based resource management. The AmericaView program utilizes remote sensing data for various practical purposes, such as monitoring national land and forests, assessing crop progress and predicting yields, aiding in urban transportation and land-use planning, managing human disease outbreaks, and handling natural disasters. It also helps each state address remote sensing data infrastructure issues and expands the use and benefits of this data. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the AmericaView program, including Americaview program, Americaview project, Americaview, and educational institution. The curr_chunk defines terms such as institution, EROS Data Center, and National Spatial Data Infrastructure related to education and data management. The curr_chunk defines terms related to remote sensing data, the Secretary of the Interior, and StateView program. The curr_chunk introduces the Americaview program under SEC. 4. The AmericaView program, established by the Secretary, aims to advance the use of remote sensing data and technology nationwide. Its purposes include increasing accessibility to remote sensing data for various entities, assisting states in setting up data infrastructure, and ensuring the availability of the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive. The AmericaView program, established by the Secretary, supports remote sensing data research and educational programs in each State through identifying new data needs and maintaining data infrastructure. The AmericaView program in each State aims to develop a remote sensing data archive, establish consistent standards, increase remote sensing courses, research, and workforce knowledge. The AmericaView program aims to promote remote sensing data sharing, partnerships with local governments, cooperation among states, and grants for StateView programs. The Secretary maintains an advisory committee for the AmericaView program, consisting of representatives from AmericaView, US Geological Survey, Department of Agriculture, and other federal agencies as needed. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2009 through 2014 is provided to the Secretary to carry out the Act."
