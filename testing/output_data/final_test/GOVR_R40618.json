    "content": "In 2009, teen births in the United States accounted for 10.1% of all births and 21.4% of nonmarital births. The teen birth rate increased in 2006 and 2007 but dropped in 2008 and 2009. Despite a general decline in teen birth rates over the years, the U.S. still has higher rates compared to other industrialized nations. Preventing teenage pregnancy is a major public policy goal, with various federally funded programs providing information and services. The federal teen pregnancy prevention program focused on adolescent sexuality, pregnancy, and parenting. Abstinence-only education was heavily used from 1996 to 2009, but President Obama's FY2010 budget proposed a shift towards comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention programs. Funding for abstinence-only education in FY2009 was $149.7 million, which was replaced in FY2010 with $177.6 million for comprehensive programs. The Consolidated Appropriations for FY2010 included a new discretionary teenage pregnancy prevention program, providing grants for programs that reduce teen pregnancy. $110 million was allocated for the Teen Pregnancy Prevention program, with an additional $4.5 million for evaluations. No mandatory block grant to states was included in the funding. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed increased funding for teen pregnancy prevention. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed increasing funding for the discretionary teen pregnancy prevention program to $129 million, but P.L. 112-10 allocated $109.5 million for the program in FY2011. Mandatory block grant funding for teen pregnancy prevention programs was not included in previous legislation, but was part of health care reform bills. The House bill (H.R. 3962) proposed a $50 million per year block grant for teen pregnancy prevention, while the Senate bill (H.R. 3590) suggested $75 million per year for the Personal Responsibility Education program. The Senate bill also allocated $50 million annually for the Title V Abstinence Education block grant. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) included these provisions from the Senate bill. This report discusses the debate between comprehensive sex education and abstinence education. The curr_chunk discusses evaluations of comprehensive sex education and abstinence education programs, youth programs addressing teen pregnancy, the Teen Pregnancy Prevention program established by P.L. 111-117, programs authorized in PPACA (P.L. 111-148), and teen pregnancy prevention legislation in the 111th Congress. It also mentions the debate on abstinence-only education during the 1994-1996 welfare reform and the growing consensus on teen pregnancy prevention success. Advocates of comprehensive sex education argue that youth need information and decision-making skills to make realistic decisions about sexual activities, including abstinence, setting relationship limits, resisting peer pressure, and using contraceptives. This approach is seen as more effective in reducing teen pregnancy compared to abstinence-only education programs. Advocates argue that abstinence-only messages provide no protection against pregnancy and STDs for sexually active high school students. Efforts are being made to persuade young women to abstain from sexual activity or use condoms to prevent pregnancy and reduce the risk of STDs. Comprehensive sexuality education programs include information on abstinence, condom use, and other forms of contraceptives. Until recent legislation (P.L. 111-117 and P.L. 111-148), there were no federal funding streams exclusively for comprehensive sex education in schools. Federal programs provided information about contraceptives, contraceptive services to teens, and counseling services related to reproductive health. Federal programs provide funding for reproductive health services, including Medicaid Family Planning, Title X Family Planning, Adolescent Family Life demonstration grants, and other Department of Health and Human Services programs. Two programs established in the 111th Congress, Teen Pregnancy Prevention and Personal Responsibility Education Program, offer exclusive funding for comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention initiatives. The Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program provides grants to public and private entities for programs that reduce teen pregnancy. $110 million was appropriated for FY2010, with $75 million for replicating effective programs, $25 million for research and demonstration grants, and $10 million for program support. The program is administered by the Office of Adolescent Health within HHS. Additionally, $4.5 million was allocated for evaluations of teenage pregnancy prevention approaches. P.L. 112-10 included funding of $109.5 million for the TPP program. P.L. 112-10 provided $109.5 million in funding for the Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program for FY2011, with $105 million for grants and $4.455 million for program evaluation. P.L. 111-148 established a new state formula grant program with $375 million allocated over five years for a comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention program that includes education on abstinence, contraception, and various adulthood preparation topics. The Personal Responsibility Education program focuses on financial literacy, parent-child communication, educational and career success, and healthy life skills. The AFL program, funded at $16.7 million for FY2010, is mandated to provide evidence-based, medically accurate, and age-appropriate programs. In FY2011, $12.5 million was allocated for comprehensive sex education-type programs under the AFL program. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy highlighted five effective teen pregnancy prevention programs that were subjected to a random assignment, experimentally designed study. These programs focus on convincing teens about the importance of abstinence or consistent contraceptive use, lasting a sufficient length of time, being led by trained individuals, and actively engaging participants. Advocates of abstinence education argue that teenagers need a clear message that sex outside of marriage is harmful. They believe in empowering youth to say no to sex and view supporting both abstinence and birth control as hypocritical. Research shows that teens who pledge abstinence tend to delay having sex longer. Advocates of abstinence education argue that teens who publicly pledge to postpone sex until marriage delay intercourse for about a year and a half longer than those who do not make such a commitment. They believe abstinence is 100% effective in preventing unwanted pregnancy and STDs, including HIV/AIDS. Federal programs for abstinence education received funding until FY2010, totaling $149.8 million in FY2009. The Title V Abstinence Education Block Grant provides federal funding to states for abstinence education programs. It was authorized under the 1996 welfare reform law, providing $50 million per year for five years. States must match funds and use them exclusively for teaching abstinence. The Title V Abstinence Education program requires states to match federal funds for abstinence education, totaling at least $87.5 million annually. The program was reauthorized and funded for five years through P.L. 111-148. Additional funding for abstinence-only education programs was provided through competitive grants for public and private entities. The CBAE program, funded from $20 million in FY2001 to $108.9 million in FY2008, aimed to provide abstinence education for adolescents ages 12 through 18 nationwide. Funding dropped to $94.7 million in FY2009 and was not funded in FY2010. $4.5 million annually was allocated for program evaluation from FY2004 to FY2009. In FY2010, funding was redirected to the TPP program for evaluation. Additionally, $4.5 million was included for TPP program evaluation in FY2011. The AFL demonstration program funded abstinence-only education projects according to the Title V Abstinence Education Block Grant. Funding for the \"prevention\" component varied from $9.0 million to $13.1 million annually from FY1998 to FY2009. A report by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. in April 2007 focused on the impact of abstinence-only programs for elementary and middle school students. The report presented estimated program impacts on sexual abstinence, pregnancy, and STD risks among youth aged 10 to 14. Findings showed no significant differences between program and control group youth in terms of sexual behavior and knowledge of risks. Both groups had good understanding of pregnancy risks but lacked clarity on STDs and their consequences. The HHS response to the report on abstinence-only education programs focused on high school students to reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies. A study on African-American students in 6th and 7th grades showed positive results for abstinence-only interventions. The study compared different interventions for sexual behavior among students, including abstinence-only, safer sex, comprehensive interventions, and a control group. Results showed that fewer students in the abstinence-only group reported engaging in sexual intercourse compared to the control group. The study found no significant difference in consistent condom use between abstinence-only intervention participants and the control group. Youth programs incorporate various components to address teen sexual activity, funded by a variety of sources including government and nonprofit organizations. Sex education in youth programs often includes an abstinence message. There is a debate between abstinence-only interventions and comprehensive sex education programs that include information on contraceptives. A recent survey shows that most adults and teens agree on promoting abstinence until out of high school, but also want more information on both abstinence and contraception. The American public, both adults and teens, support encouraging teens to delay sexual activity and providing information about contraception. Some youth programs aim to decipher the root reasons behind teen pregnancy, such as loneliness, carelessness with birth control, or meeting partner expectations. Some youth programs aim to prevent teen pregnancy by offering mentoring, enhanced case management, home visits, and parenting classes. Research shows that these programs can effectively reduce subsequent childbearing by teens. The study found that teens who excel in school, attend religious services, participate in sports, have friends with high educational aspirations, avoid risky behaviors, and perform well academically are more likely to delay sexual initiation. Despite a decrease in the U.S. teenage birth rate in recent years, it remains higher than in most industrialized nations. In 2007, one-third of 9th graders reported having had sexual intercourse. Researchers are investigating the increase in teen birth rates in 2006 and 2007, noting factors such as a rise in sexual activity among high school-age children, a decrease in contraceptive use, and the growing share of Hispanics in the teen population. Social and economic changes, as well as teens' relationships, are also significant contributors to teenage pregnancies. The recent increase in teen birth rates has prompted a renewed focus on reducing teen pregnancy. Factors such as social and economic changes, relationships with parents and peers, and teens' attitudes play a role in teenage pregnancies. The Obama Administration shifted towards teaching abstinence along with contraception to prevent teen pregnancy, moving away from abstinence-only education. The Obama Administration redirected funds from ineffective abstinence-only education programs to new teen pregnancy prevention initiatives in FY2010. These initiatives aimed to provide comprehensive sex education in schools based on successful models. The Obama Administration redirected funds from abstinence-only education programs to new teen pregnancy prevention initiatives in FY2010, totaling $164.5 million. This initiative aimed to support evidence-based models and develop new approaches to reduce teenage pregnancy. The FY2010 budget allocated $110 million for a competitive teen pregnancy prevention grant program, focusing on evidence-based models to reduce teen pregnancy rates and promote contraception use. The initiative also included funding for community and faith-based organizations, outreach, training, and evaluation. The proposed teen pregnancy prevention budget initiative aims to fund effective programs and explore new approaches. Grants would be awarded to non-profit organizations for programs targeting youth aged 12 to 19, lasting 3-5 years with an average of $350,000 provided and a 25% match requirement. $75 million of the $110 million discretionary funds would be used to replicate successful curriculum-based models. Applicants must agree to random assignment for national evaluation. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget allocates $25 million for grants to develop and test effective models for preventing teen pregnancy. Grantees must use age-appropriate and medically accurate curriculum. Additional funds will support activities to help parents communicate with their children about teen pregnancy and high-risk behaviors. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget allocated $4.5 million for a rigorous evaluation of pregnancy prevention initiatives and sought authorization for a new $50 million teen pregnancy prevention grant. Additionally, $50 million in mandatory funds would be used for a broader teen pregnancy prevention initiative, redirecting $13.1 million from the AFL program previously used for abstinence-only education. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget allocated $177.6 million for a teen pregnancy prevention initiative, with $9,840,000 for programs proven to delay sexual activity and $3,280,000 for research grants. This funding included redirecting $13.1 million from the AFL program previously used for abstinence-only education. The Obama Administration allocated $177.6 million for a teen pregnancy prevention initiative in FY2010. This funding included $110 million for discretionary grants, $50 million for states, tribes, and territories, $13.1 million for abstinence-only education programs, and $4.5 million for program evaluation. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed to increase funding for the program to $129 million. The Obama Administration allocated $177.6 million for teen pregnancy prevention in FY2010, including funding for proven approaches, research grants, program evaluation, and program support. An additional $50 million was requested for state and tribal efforts. Funding for AFL \"care\" demonstration projects and research, as well as evaluation of TPP programs, was also included. The Obama Administration allocated $177.6 million for teen pregnancy prevention in FY2010. The Administration's FY2011 budget request included funding of $200 million for teen pregnancy prevention initiatives. The proposed Prevention First Act introduced new grants for teenage pregnancy prevention programs. The bills proposed funding for teenage pregnancy prevention programs through age-appropriate and medically accurate information on contraception. Grants would be awarded for research and evaluation of these programs. The bills proposed funding for teenage pregnancy prevention research and education programs, including abstinence and contraception education. Grants would be provided to states for family life programs, with funding allocated for national and state evaluations. Administrative expenses were limited to 7% of grant funds, with 10% allocated for national and state program evaluations. The proposed bills aimed to allocate grant funds for teenage pregnancy prevention programs, with restrictions on evaluation expenses. They also aimed to ensure age-appropriate and medically accurate information on contraceptives, expand Medicaid coverage for family planning services, and include Medicaid rebates for outpatient drugs. The Responsible Education About Life Act was introduced in March 2009 by Representative Lee and Senator Lautenberg. The bill S. 611, introduced by Senator Lautenberg in 2009, aimed to fund sex education programs for preventing teenage pregnancy and STDs. It included both abstinence and contraception information, required age-appropriate and medically accurate content, and allocated $50 million annually for grants. Grant funds had restrictions on administrative and evaluation expenses. The Consolidated Appropriations for FY2010 (H.R. 3288) was signed into law as P.L. 111-117 on December 16, 2009. It does not fund the Community-Based Abstinence Education (CBAE) program but includes a new Teenage Pregnancy Prevention program under the HHS Office of the Secretary receiving $110 million for FY2010. Grants and contracts are provided for preventing teenage pregnancy. The President's FY2010 budget, as outlined in P.L. 111-117, allocates $75 million for replicating effective teen pregnancy prevention programs and $25 million for research grants. An additional $16.7 million is designated for the AFL care program, and $4.5 million is set aside for program evaluations. Introduced by Representative Obey, the bill focuses on funding medically accurate and age-appropriate programs to reduce teen pregnancy. The bill H.R. 3312, introduced by Representative Ryan, aimed to provide grants for comprehensive education on preventing teen pregnancies through proven programs. The House passed H.R. 3293 in July 2009, but it did not pass the Senate. H.R. 3312 aimed to delay sexual activity, improve contraceptive use, and reduce teenage pregnancy through age-appropriate and medically accurate education programs. It would have funded a teenage pregnancy prevention grant program and provided incentive grants for states to implement prevention strategies. The bill also required the HHS Secretary to commission program evaluations and establish a national goal to prevent teen pregnancy. H.R. 3312 aimed to prevent teen pregnancy by establishing a national goal and providing grants for innovative approaches. It also included provisions for supporting parents, media campaigns, and state education programs. H.R. 3590 was the Senate vehicle for health care reform legislation introduced in 2009. H.R. 3590, passed as P.L. 111-148 on March 23, 2010, authorized funding for a new Personal Responsibility Education state block grant program. The program allocated $75 million per year for five years to support programs for adolescents focusing on pregnancy prevention, sexually transmitted diseases, and various adulthood preparation subjects. Additionally, $50 million annually was appropriated for Title programs. President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) on March 23, 2010, which included provisions for teen pregnancy prevention. The act allocated $75 million annually for a new state grant program and restored funding of $50 million annually for Title V Abstinence Education block grants for FY2010-FY2014. Additionally, the Affordable Health Care for America Act (H.R. 3962) was introduced in 2009 and passed by the House and Senate. H.R. 3962, passed in 2009, included funding for a Healthy Teen Initiative to prevent teen pregnancy. However, the Senate bill did not include this provision. H.R. 6283 and S. 3878, introduced in 2010, aimed to amend Title V of the Social Security Act to eliminate abstinence-only programs. The America's Healthy Future Act of 2009 proposed to eliminate abstinence-only education programs, reprogram unobligated funds for the Personal Responsibility Education Program, and authorize funding for a new Personal Responsibility Education state block grant program. It also included provisions for teen pregnancy prevention similar to H.R. 3590."
