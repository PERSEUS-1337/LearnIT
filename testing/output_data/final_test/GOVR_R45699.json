They plan to combat robocalls, make communications accessible for people with disabilities, and reform their processes for transparency and accountability. The FCC aims to modernize operations, improve decision-making, and reduce regulatory burdens. Commission management annually sets targets and measures for performance goals, published in the FCC's Performance Plan and submitted with the annual budget request to Congress. Results are detailed in the FCC's Annual Performance Report each February, along with a Summary of Performance and Financial Results. Funding for the FCC has been through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill since the 110th Congress. Regulatory fees are collected annually to offset agency costs. The FCC collects regulatory fees annually to fund its operations, derived from license holders and certain entities. These fees, known as \"Section (9) fees,\" do not apply to governmental, nonprofit, or amateur radio entities. The FCC reviews and adjusts the fees each year based on changes in its appropriation. The Regulatory Fee Collection Program was implemented in 1994, with the most recent fee order issued in 2018. The FCC's budgets from FY2010 to FY2020 are shown in Figure 1. The FCC collects regulatory fees annually to fund its operations, derived from license holders and certain entities. The 2018 Act requires the FCC to transfer excess collections to the U.S. Treasury for deficit reduction. In FY2020, the FCC requested $335,660,000 in budget authority from regulatory fee offsetting collections. The FCC requested $335,660,000 in budget authority from regulatory fee offsetting collections for FY2020, which is a decrease from the previous authorization levels. Specifically, the budget request for the spectrum auctions program is $132,538,680, representing an increase from the FY2019 appropriation. The FCC requested funding to support reimbursement for stations affected by the incentive auction, make more spectrum available for 5G, and educate consumers. The spectrum auctions program has generated over $114.6 billion for the government, with costs less than $2.0 billion. The FCC was reauthorized through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The FCC's Strategic Plan for 2018-2022 guides the development of its Performance Plan and Performance Budget. These reports, including the Agency Financial Report and Annual Performance Report, track the agency's performance against its goals and objectives. The FCC's performance is tracked through reports available on their website. A hearing in the 116th Congress addressed issues such as 5G deployment, merger reviews, robocalls, and net neutrality. The FCC operates under a public interest mandate established in the 1927 Radio Act. The FCC's public interest mandate, established in the 1927 Radio Act, is pursued through regulation and market efficiency promotion. The agency's interpretation of the public interest standard is flexible, leading to changes in regulation over time. This evolution is reflected in shifts in strategic goals from former Chairman Tom Wheeler to current Chairman Ajit Pai, resulting in the repeal of net neutrality rules in 2017 and structural changes in 2019. The FCC's priorities can be seen through changes in its quadrennial Strategic Plan. Chairman Wheeler's strategic goals in the FY2015-FY2018 Strategic Plan focused on protecting and benefiting the public through regulation, emphasizing the rights of users and responsibilities of network providers. In contrast, Chairman Pai's goals in the FY2018-FY2022 Strategic Plan also aim to protect and benefit the public, but with a different approach. Chairman Pai's regulatory philosophy focuses on promoting market incentives and efficiency, reducing regulatory burdens, and ensuring regulations reflect the current marketplace to support entrepreneurship and economic opportunity. This approach is evident in the net neutrality debate and the restructuring of FCC offices. Chairman Pai's regulatory philosophy emphasizes market incentives, efficiency, and reducing regulatory burdens. He criticized the 2015 net neutrality rules as unnecessary regulations hindering investment and innovation. The contrast between Pai and Wheeler's regulatory approaches is evident in the net neutrality debate. The FCC's 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom Order has sparked debate over net neutrality. In January 2019, the FCC voted along party lines to replace the Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis with a new Office of Economics and Analytics. The FCC established the new Office of Economics and Analytics to enhance economic analysis in policy making, improve auction processes, and implement data practices. This aligns with the goal of modernizing operations, reducing regulatory burdens, and adapting to the current marketplace. The FCC's regulatory philosophies may influence its long-term goals and organizational structure. The FCC's regulatory philosophies may affect how the agency structures itself and decides regulatory questions, including net neutrality. Congress has not introduced legislation on this topic, indicating a potential continuation of allowing the FCC to define it. Senate and House hearings in the 115th Congress regarding the FCC's operation are detailed in tables."
