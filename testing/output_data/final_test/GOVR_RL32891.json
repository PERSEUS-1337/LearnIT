    "content": "Funds for NBACC programs are provided through the DHS Science and Technology Directorate for research conducted at the NBACC laboratory in Fort Detrick, MD. The construction of the facility cost $128 million and began in June 2006. The NBACC facility operates as a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) under the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity. The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity released an RFP for the operation of the NBACC facility, which was awarded to Battelle National Biodefense Institute. The facility is government-owned but contractor-operated, similar to DOE National Laboratories. The identity of NBACC facility component centers has evolved over time. Secretary for Science and Technology Albright announced that NBACC would consist of four centers: the Biodefense Knowledge Center (BKC), the Bioforensics Analysis Center, the Biothreat Assessment Support Center, and the Bio-Countermeasures Testing and Evaluation Center. The configuration of NBACC evolved over time, with different organizational units mentioned in budget justifications and testimonies. The final configuration in the FY2006 DHS budget included two component centers: the National Bioforensic Analysis Center and the Biological Threat Characterization Center. The Biological Threat Characterization Center and the National Bioforensic Analysis Center are operating in interim facilities pending construction of the NBACC laboratory building. The NBFAC is currently housed at USAMRIID and operates as a joint federal effort. The Biodefense Knowledge Center is located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and operates independently. The Biodefense Knowledge Center (BKC) at Livermore National Laboratory collaborates with other national laboratories and Department of Homeland Security University Centers of Excellence. It is funded independently and coordinates its activities with the federal biodefense research network. The NBACC program collaborates with other network members to understand biological threats, assess vulnerabilities, and provide forensic analysis capabilities for bio-crimes and terrorism. The Biological Threat Characterization Center conducts studies to address critical gaps in understanding threats and assess potential impacts. The program aims to provide a science-based approach to biodefense. The NBACC program aims to provide a science-based assessment of biological threats, focusing on high consequence pathogens. Research includes investigating biothreat pathogens, studying pathogen stability and lethality, and developing strategies to defeat genetically engineered pathogens. The National Bioforensic Analysis Center is designated as the lead federal facility for technical forensic analysis. The National Bioforensic Analysis Center (NBFAC) is the lead federal facility for analyzing evidence from bio-crime or terrorist attacks to identify perpetrators and determine the origin and method of attack. NBFAC is developing forensic tools, methods, and strain repositories for pathogens of concern. The Biodefense Knowledge Center supports NBACC facility component centers by providing scientific assessments and information to the Homeland Security Operations Center regarding potential bioterrorism events. The Biodefense Knowledge Center (BKC) is a repository of biodefense information, including genomic sequences for pathogens, vaccine locations, bioforensics data, and details on potential bioterrorism agents. The NBACC facility construction cost is $141 million, with completion projected for FY2008. Community response to the construction has been mixed. The construction of the NBACC facility at Fort Detrick has sparked investment in the area, but faced protests over security and secrecy concerns. The DHS operates NBACC as an FFRDC, with a contractor responsible for implementing projects. This includes transitioning existing interim centers to the new facility and continuing biological risk assessments. The transparency and oversight of NBACC research programs, especially regarding classified research and compliance with the BWC, have raised concerns among biosecurity advocates. The lack of transparency at the facility could impact international relations and treaty compliance, but experts believe that establishing a review process for treaty compliance could address these issues. The Department's efforts to address these concerns are discussed below. The NBACC facility is being constructed to be certified as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) to accommodate classified research activities. The extent to which classified research will be utilized is undetermined, with the possibility of increasing or decreasing based on evolving research priorities. The FFRDC contractor operating the facility must have employees cleared at the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) level. The NBACC FFRDC RFP outlines expectations for the contractor's workforce, with a majority needing TS/SCI clearance. This requirement offers advantages in workforce management and flexibility. Increased flexibility in workforce management due to changing workload and increased synergy between research skills and knowledge with a larger pool of qualified researchers. Concerns raised about potential proliferation of dual-use research results and biological techniques in sensitive research topics, with risks of diversion of material, information, or scientific technique to others. Arms control experts and stakeholders express concerns about research at NBACC facility in Fort Detrick. The research activities at the NBACC facility in Fort Detrick are raising concerns about potential violations of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. International observers may lack confidence in these activities, but strong internal oversight and review processes are in place to ensure compliance with arms control agreements. DHS has established a compliance assurance program office and a Compliance Review Group to ensure NBACC research activities comply with the BWC. The Compliance Review Group, consisting of senior DHS officials, reviews all research activities before they begin. Additional information may be required if compliance concerns arise. The Compliance Review Group within DHS ensures research activities comply with the BWC. If consensus is not reached, the DHS Secretary makes the final judgement. Critics suggest interagency review for greater expert input. The Department of Health and Human Services has established the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity to assess federal research programs with dual-use capabilities and provide guidance on minimizing misuse. The NSABB focuses on local oversight at research institutions but does not assess classified research programs. Selective transparency at the NBACC facility is seen as crucial for maintaining international confidence in the US biodefense program. Some experts believe that maintaining openness in the US biodefense program is crucial for international confidence, but it must also protect sensitive national security information. Finding the right balance between transparency and information restriction is a contentious issue. Arms control experts suggest that the US model should be followed by other countries, while biosecurity experts emphasize the need to prevent the inadvertent release of information that could reveal vulnerabilities. One proposed solution is to involve local community members in overseeing NBACC research. The DHS plans to establish an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) at the NBACC facility to oversee research programs, including classified or law-enforcement sensitive activities. The inclusion of community members on the IBC may pose challenges due to the nature of some research. This move aims to provide potential public oversight into the research activities at NBACC. The establishment of an IBC at NBACC aims to provide public oversight of research activities. Some critics suggest independent external oversight using scientific experts from the National Academies. The DHS has set up an advisory committee through the National Academies for input on NBACC research, but its activities are not widely known. Critics may push for formalizing the committee's input mechanism or increasing the dissemination of its activities to address concerns. The Department of Homeland Security assures that their research is for defensive purposes, aligns with treaty obligations, and will be published in open scientific literature. They are committed to reducing biodefense vulnerabilities, following scientific standards, and maintaining openness. Critics raise concerns about the lack of a clear research plan for NBACC programs and facility. The lack of a clear research plan for NBACC programs and facility has raised concerns among critics. Research conducted aims to fill knowledge gaps on pathogens, test biological countermeasures, and assess risks in biological science. Experts worry that research priorities at NBACC may not be based on risk but on other factors, potentially leading to an arms race in the biodefense community. The NBACC program's lack of a clear research plan has raised concerns among critics, as research priorities may not be based on risk, potentially leading to an arms race in the biodefense community. Some argue for a robust prioritization and planning mechanism to bolster confidence in the process, while others believe existing structures are sufficient. Developing metrics to assess the efficacy of planning and prioritization poses a challenge. The NBACC facility will include Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory space for experiments with dangerous pathogens like Ebola virus. Federal efforts are increasing available BSL-4 space, with new facilities funded by NIAID at the University of Texas Medical Branch and Boston University Medical Center. Additional BSL-4 space is proposed for the National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility. The increase in BSL-4 laboratory space at the National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility may lead to more scientists trained in handling deadly pathogens. Some fear this could result in the dissemination of biothreat information to those who oppose the United States, while others believe it will enhance biodefense capabilities. Concerns about pathogen leakage, theft, and indirect health impacts have been raised regarding the construction of BSL-4 facilities. The NBACC program and facility coordinate efforts with federal agencies, attracting Congressional interest. Programs addressing biological threats were under HHS, while nonmedical countermeasures were transferred to DHS. Research at NBACC closely relates to HHS activities, informing policy and research agendas in other departments. The DHS Secretary coordinates homeland security research and development activities across the federal government, which could inform HHS strategic deliberations. Effective coordination is crucial to avoid overlap and duplication of effort between agencies. Coordination between the NBFAC and FBI is necessary for a prompt forensics response to bioterrorism incidents. The FBI has completed processing forensic samples for bioterror/biocrime cases and has contracts with Department of Energy Laboratories for nuclear forensics. Lessons learned may improve interagency actions post-biological attack. DHS is coordinating with various agencies for biomedical research at Fort Detrick. The interagency group includes participants from various organizations like the Agricultural Research Service, CDC, and Army Surgeon General. Feasibility study for NBACC identified different construction routes. The BKC was established separately at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, independent of NBACC facility and program. The BKC, established independently at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, has data collection and analysis capabilities similar to the NBACC program. Efficient information sharing and planning between the two centers are crucial for maximizing their effectiveness."
