The Congress finds that higher nurse staffing levels lead to better patient outcomes, but there are challenges in recruiting and retaining nursing staff. Job dissatisfaction and overtime work contribute to nurses leaving the profession.

Limiting mandatory overtime will ensure public safety, quality care, and nurse retention. SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS ON MANDATORY OVERTIME FOR NURSES.

Exceptions apply during declared states of emergency for providing emergency medical services to the community. During declared states of emergency, a nurse can only be required to work beyond specified limits if the provider has tried to fill staffing needs through alternative means and the work requirement ends when the state of emergency ends. During declared states of emergency, a nurse can file a complaint with the Secretary against a provider of services who violates the provisions of this subsection, and the Secretary will investigate and take actions if a violation is found.
