    "content": "In FY2015, the Department of Defense faced a legally binding cap on national defense spending, set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and modified by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. President Obama's DOD budget request and the National Defense Authorization Act complied with this cap, as did the Defense Appropriations Act passed by the House and Senate. In FY2015, the Department of Defense's budget request complied with the spending cap set by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. The Administration requested $495.6 billion for DOD's base budget, totaling $522.6 billion for national defense-related spending, which met the FY2015 cap on national defense discretionary budget authority. The President's FY2015 budget request for DOD complied with the spending cap set by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. However, an additional $27.7 billion in defense-related spending was requested as part of the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative (OGSI), which would exceed the FY2015 defense cap. This would trigger sequestration unless current law was amended. Additionally, projected DOD budget requests for FY2016 through FY2019 would exceed the statutory defense spending cap by an average of nearly $31 billion annually. President Obama's FY2015 budget request for national defense-related activities amounts to $522.6 billion in discretionary budget authority, consistent with the defense spending cap set by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. The base budget for DOD military activities is $495.6 billion, roughly 95% of the discretionary national defense-related base budget for FY2015. Additionally, $18.0 billion is allocated for defense-related nuclear energy activities conducted by the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy conducts nuclear energy activities, with the largest share of $8.3 billion for nuclear weapons. Other components include $4.9 billion for environmental cleanup, $1.6 billion for non-proliferation work, and $1.4 billion for nuclear reactors on Navy ships. The remaining $8.0 billion is for defense-related activities by other agencies, with $4.9 billion going to the FBI for counterintelligence operations. The FY2015 budget request for Overseas Contingency Operations was amended three times to include funding for DOD activities beyond combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. The FY2015 budget request for Overseas Contingency Operations was amended to include $53.8 million for activities in Afghanistan and Iraq, along with funds for new DOD programs like the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund. The FY2015 budget request for Overseas Contingency Operations was amended to include $4.0 billion for a new Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF) to support partner states' counterterrorism efforts, $925 million for a European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) to reassure NATO allies, and a rescission of $117.0 million for Army helicopter modernization. The Senate Appropriations Committee acted on this version of the OCO budget request. The President requested emergency appropriations for Ebola outbreak and domestic public health systems, including funding for DARPA for medical technology development. Additional budget authority was requested for Operation Inherent Resolve against the Islamic State in FY2015. The President requested emergency appropriations for Ebola outbreak and domestic public health systems, including funding for DARPA for medical technology development. In addition, operations conducted by U.S. forces against the Islamic State were supported with $1.62 billion for an Iraq Train and Equip Fund, $2.46 billion for military personnel and Operation and Maintenance costs, and $972.5 million for equipment procurement and development. The November 2014 adjustments increased the Administration's FY2015 OCO request to $63.7 billion, assuming a decrease in U.S. troops in Afghanistan and OCO funding. OCO funding is expected to decline slower than troop numbers due to various reasons, including the presence of U.S. forces in the Middle East. The FY2015 OCO request of $63.7 billion includes costs for base closure, ordnance disposal, equipment return, and munitions replacement. Funding for U.S. forces in Afghanistan would decrease by 60%, while other activities related to Afghanistan would see smaller reductions. The President's FY2015 request for the Department of Defense includes $9.2 billion for equipment and munitions replacement, a nearly 5% increase from FY2014. The base budget request is $495.6 billion, slightly lower than FY2014. FY2015 would mark the third year with a budget around $495-496 billion after a $35 billion drop between FY2012 and FY2013. The FY2015 base budget request is 1.8% below FY2014 in real terms. The FY2015 DOD budget request is 1.8% below FY2014 in real terms, lower than the peak year of 1985 but slightly higher than the average budget since 1975. Mandatory spending caps since 2011 have restrained DOD spending increases. The BCA required annual reductions in discretionary spending totaling $2.1 trillion, affecting both defense and non-defense programs. The DOD budget for FY2012 was reduced due to the BCA, FY2013 was reduced by sequestration, and FY2014 exceeded the modified cap. Congress raised spending caps for FY2014 and 2015 with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2014. Future DOD budgets are projected to remain flat in real terms. Since 2012, Congress has adjusted spending caps twice to lessen their impact on budget requests. DOD's long-term spending plans have been reduced annually since 2011. The FY2015 DOD request of $496 billion is 18% lower than projected in 2010. Even with an additional $26.4 billion, the base budget authority would still be 15% lower than projected. The DOD's FY2015 base budget request is 23% higher in real terms than in 2000. However, the department may face tough budget choices due to statutory caps restricting future defense budgets. The cost-per-active-duty-troop has been steadily increasing, with military personnel funding per capita rising by nearly 27% since 2000. Increased housing allowances aim to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for personnel not in government-provided housing, along with policy changes boosting pay and medical benefits for military retirees. Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding has been growing for over three decades, with an average annual increase of 2.7% above inflation. Spending on acquisition per troop has risen in real terms due to advancements in technology, making new weaponry more expensive but more capable. Combat in Iraq and Afghanistan has led to new procurement requirements for force protection, communications, and transportation. If DOD discretionary spending remains flat, reductions in force size/readiness and modernization may be necessary. The $495.6 billion budget request supports the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review's national strategy by reducing force size and modernizing while accommodating changing security needs and budget constraints. The Administration's FY2015 base budget request focuses on modernizing the Army and Marine Corps for a broader range of missions. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is mandated to delineate a national defense strategy, determine force structure, modernization plans, and craft a budget plan. Critics faulted the 2014 QDR for focusing on near-term security issues and accepting budget limitations. The 2014 QDR outlined DOD priorities based on the Defense Strategic Guidance, focusing on rebalancing global posture towards the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. It aimed to reshape the defense establishment by 2020, emphasizing the ability to win a major conventional war while operating in multiple regions simultaneously. The 2014 QDR outlined DOD priorities to rebalance global posture towards the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East, emphasizing the ability to win a major conventional war while operating in multiple regions simultaneously. DOD will not maintain a large active-duty force for prolonged stability operations but will focus on projecting military power in regions where adversaries may deny access. Forces will train for a spectrum of conflicts, including major wars, peacekeeping, and stability operations, investing in capabilities like Special Operations Forces and Intelligence. The Administration's FY2015 budget request projected a reduction in active-component personnel, with the Army and Marine Corps absorbing most of the reduction. By FY2017, the Army was planned to drop to 490,000 active-duty soldiers, while the Marine Corps would drop to 182,100, ending up slightly larger than they were in 2001. The FY2015 budget request projected a reduction in active-component personnel, with the Army and Marine Corps absorbing most of the reduction. By FY2019, the Army will be further reduced, stabilizing at between 440,000 and 450,000 active-duty personnel. If the BCA caps remain in force, the projection is for an Army of 420,000 and a Marine Corps of 175,000. Compared to their manpower in FY2001, the two services had grown by about 18% in FY2010, their peak year of their post-9/11 end-strength. The Administration's FY2015 budget plan includes a reduction in reserve component personnel, with the Army Reserve and Army National Guard facing the largest cuts. The combined end-strength of these two components would decrease by 5% if budget caps are lifted and by 10% if the caps remain in place by FY2019. Additionally, over one-third of the Department of Defense's annual budget is allocated to pay and benefits for military personnel. The FY2015 budget includes reductions in reserve component personnel, with the Army Reserve and Army National Guard facing the largest cuts. Over one-third of the Department of Defense's budget is allocated to pay and benefits for military personnel, including nearly 800,000 civilian employees. The budget request proposed changes in compensation policy to slow the rising costs, such as a 1% increase in basic pay for active-duty servicemembers in FY2015 and FY2016. Generals and admirals would not receive a pay increase in FY2015. The FY2015 budget includes reductions in reserve component personnel, with the Army Reserve and Army National Guard facing the largest cuts. Over one-third of the Department of Defense's budget is allocated to pay and benefits for military personnel. The Administration's plan for FY2015 includes a slower increase in Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) until it covers 95% of rent and utility costs, requiring servicemembers to cover the remaining 5%. The subsidy for commissaries would be reduced by $1 billion over three years. Additionally, new fees and copayment requirements for TRICARE beneficiaries are proposed in the FY2015 DOD budget. The FY2015 DOD budget includes $47.4 billion for the health care system, with $32.0 billion allocated to the Defense Health Program (DHP) for operating hospitals, clinics, and private sector care. The budget also covers pay and benefits for civilian and uniformed medical personnel. The FY2015 DOD budget includes $47.4 billion for the health care system, with $32.0 billion allocated to the Defense Health Program (DHP) for operating hospitals, clinics, and private sector care. The budget also covers pay and benefits for civilian and uniformed medical personnel, many of who support the noncombat health care mission directly or indirectly; and $6.2 billion in payments to the Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. The FY2015 request incorporated proposals to slow the rate of growth of DOD's health care costs, with the health care system accounting for 9.4% of the base budget request. The FY2015 DOD budget includes $47.4 billion for the health care system, with $32.0 billion allocated to the Defense Health Program (DHP) for operating hospitals, clinics, and private sector care. The budget also covers pay and benefits for civilian and uniformed medical personnel. The Administration proposed consolidating TRICARE options, increasing copayment fees for pharmaceuticals, and reorganizing DOD health care facilities for savings. Additionally, an enrollment fee for military retirees joining TRICARE-for-Life program was suggested. The Administration proposed deeper reductions in defense spending if caps were not raised. The Army planned to decrease the number of brigade combat teams and combat aviation brigades to save costs. This included disposing of helicopters and transferring Apache attack units to active-component Army units. The plan involves transferring Apache attack helicopters from National Guard units to active-component Army units, while moving Blackhawk troop-carrying helicopters from the active Army to Guard units. The Navy's budget includes removing spent nuclear fuel from the U.S.S. George Washington aircraft carrier, with the possibility of retiring the ship if defense spending caps are not lifted. Additionally, the Navy plans to modernize and put back into service half of its Aegis cruisers and three amphibious landing ships to save money. The Administration planned to retire certain aircraft fleets to reduce costs, including the U-2 and A-10 planes. They proposed replacing them with long-range drones and other aircraft using precision-guided bombs. Future budgets may also include retiring KC-10 tankers and one version of the Global Hawk drone. The FY2015 DOD budget request aims to modernize the military force with a focus on systems to outmatch high-tech adversaries. The budget includes funding for a new long-range bomber to replace aging B-52s and sustain the strategic nuclear weapons triad. The FY2015 DOD budget request includes funding for a new long-range bomber to replace B-52s and a new missile-launching sub to replace Ohio-class ships. The Army and Marine Corps shifted focus from advanced armored combat vehicles to less complex programs, cancelling the Ground Combat Vehicle program. This move will reduce budgets by $3.7 billion from FY2015-FY2019. Additionally, $92.4 million was allocated for the development of an Advanced Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV). The Marine Corps allocated $105.5 million in their FY2015 budget to develop an Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) to replace aging AAV-7 amphibious troop carriers. This new vehicle may travel on wheels instead of tracks and would be carried close to shore. The FY2015 budget request prioritized funding for two Virginia-class submarines and two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers with Aegis anti-missile systems, reflecting a focus on high-tech conventional warfare. Additionally, three Littoral Combat Ships were funded instead of four, as the emphasis was on systems capable of intense combat. Defense Secretary Hagel directed the Navy to halt additional LCS purchases beyond those requested for FY2015. The FY2015 budget requested funding for various aircraft programs, including the F-35 Joint Strike fighter and the KC-46A mid-air refueling tanker. Despite initial plans to halt additional LCS purchases, the Navy announced continued procurement of both LCS versions with enhancements. The FY2015 budget requested funding for aircraft programs like the F-35 Joint Strike fighter and the KC-46A mid-air refueling tanker. The Navy continued procurement of both LCS versions despite initial plans to halt additional purchases. DOD characterized the budget as a blueprint for revitalizing conventional warfighting capabilities after years of counterinsurgency operations. Budget constraints from deficit reduction measures have impacted readiness. The FY2015 budget requested funding for aircraft programs like the F-35 Joint Strike fighter and the KC-46A mid-air refueling tanker. DOD's base budget request for operations and maintenance (O&M) accounts in FY2015 amounted to $198.7 billion, 3.1% more than FY2014. Budget constraints have impacted readiness due to constrained budgets for training, equipment maintenance, and facilities upkeep. Maintenance of large forces in Iraq and Afghanistan required frequent deployments without adequate rest and rehabilitation time. Training and equipment were focused on specific war types, neglecting preparation for conventional combat against technologically advanced adversaries. In the FY2015 budget, Congress shifted $9.15 billion for O&M activities from war costs to the base budget. This resulted in a 1.6% reduction in the FY2015 O&M request. The budget included organizational and management initiatives to reduce DOD operating costs, projecting savings of $73.3 billion in FY2015-FY2019. The FY2015 budget included initiatives to reduce DOD operating costs, projecting savings of $73.3 billion in FY2015-FY2019. This included a 20% reduction in headquarters budgets, cuts to training and travel costs, efficiencies in the Defense Health Program, and savings from contracting efficiencies. Additionally, reductions in manpower and military facilities construction funds were assumed, along with potential savings from a base-closure round. The House and Senate versions of the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorized DOD base budget appropriations exceeding the Administration's request by less than $500 million. The final version authorized $495.9 billion, $347 million more than requested. Funding levels for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) were not comparable across versions. The Administration's original OCO request of $79.4 billion was described as a placeholder. The House and Senate versions of the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act authorized DOD base budget appropriations exceeding the Administration's request by less than $500 million. The final version authorized $495.9 billion, $347 million more than requested. The Administration's original OCO request of $79.4 billion was described as a placeholder until decisions were made about the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The House passed H.R. 4435 authorizing the placeholder amount, while the Senate Armed Services Committee reported S. 2410 providing a blanket authorization for OCO appropriations. House and Senate negotiators considered total FY2015 OCO funding requests totaling $63.7 billion, including funds for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, a Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund, and a European Reassurance Initiative. The FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act authorized DOD base budget appropriations exceeding the Administration's request by $495.9 billion. The bill included provisions to combat the Ebola virus, operations against the Islamic State, and limited steps towards implementing cost-reduction initiatives. The FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act authorized DOD base budget appropriations exceeding the Administration's request by $495.9 billion. The bill included provisions to combat the Ebola virus, operations against the Islamic State, and limited steps towards implementing cost-reduction initiatives, which could lead to eventual implementation of many of the Administration's proposals to reduce military compensation and retire some weapons. The Joint Explanatory Statement on H.R. 3979 mentioned the possibility of Congress agreeing to cost-reduction proposals in the future. The Senate bill's add-ons were less ambitious than those in the House bill. The Senate bill's add-ons were less ambitious than the House bill, with additional funds authorized for Navy items like refueling an aircraft carrier and buying an amphibious landing ship. The final bill provided increased authorizations closer to the House-passed amounts, adding nearly $1.7 billion for the carrier refueling and amphibious landing ship. Over $1.0 billion of the additional authorization applied to the OCO budget, exempt from the defense spending cap. H.R. 3979 authorizes reductions in active and reserve components of the services, with some programs receiving less funding than requested. Active component end-strength will decrease by 52,800 personnel, while reserve component end-strength will decrease by 12,900 personnel. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concern about the impact of reducing reserve component end-strength by 12,900 personnel to a total of 820,800. They are worried about the implications on the All-Volunteer Force's capacity and capability, especially with ongoing overseas commitments. The committee also directed the Government Accountability Office to investigate why a significant percentage of Army Reserve and Army National Guard personnel are not available for mobilization, mostly due to medical reasons. The House-passed version of the FY2015 NDAA would block the Administration's proposals to slow the growth in military pay and benefits. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concern about proposed changes in pay and benefits for junior enlisted personnel, recommending deferring any changes until the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission reports its findings. The Senate Armed Services Committee reluctantly supported restraints on pay increases and TRICARE co-payment requirements for FY2015 but called for deferring other proposed changes. The Senate committee called for deferring proposed changes in TRICARE and the commissary system pending MCRMC recommendations. The enacted bill steered a middle course between House and Senate bills, warning of potential budget cuts if sequestration-level budgets remain in effect. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have urged compensation adjustments to maintain readiness of the Armed Forces. The final bill freezes basic pay for generals and admirals in FY2015. The Senate Committee's bill authorizes a 1% raise in basic pay for other ranks starting January 1, 2015. The House Armed Services Committee endorses a 1.8% increase in basic pay tied to the Employment Cost Index. The enacted bill contains no provision relating to basic pay, except for generals and admirals. The President implemented a 1% raise instead of the 1.8% raise favored by the House committee. H.R. 3979 delays the reduction in the annual cost-of-living adjustment for military retired pay until January 1, 2016. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 reduced the cost-of-living adjustments for military retirees under 62 from CPI to 1% lower than CPI. Subsequent legislation exempted serving military personnel who joined before January 1, 2014. The enacted bill extends this exemption to those who joined before January 1, 2016, deferring any COLA changes until a compensation review is completed. The enacted bill defers any COLA changes for military retirees until a compensation review is completed in early 2015. The Senate bill authorizes a change in computing servicemembers' Basic Allowance for Housing to reduce growth in payments until they cover 95% of housing and utility costs. The House bill does not include a provision on the housing allowance change, but requests DOD to share analysis with the Military Compensation Commission. Section 604 of the final bill allows DOD to implement the planned reduction in growth for FY2015. The final version of the bill rejected the Administration's proposal to reduce the annual operating subsidy to the military commissary system by $200 million. H.R. 3979 authorizes restoration of the $200 million difference to the commissary budget, as the Senate bill would have done. The Senate committee directed the Secretary of Defense to present an analysis to the military compensation commission. The final bill rejected the Administration's proposal to reduce the annual operating subsidy to the military commissary system by $200 million. The House bill would have added $100 million to the commissary budget request. Section 634 of the final bill requires the Secretary of Defense to sponsor a review of the commissary system by an independent organization experienced in grocery retail analysis. The House bill also rejected proposed increases in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copays. The bill included a provision (Section 736) preventing the closure of DOD medical facilities until a report by the GAO is submitted. It also authorized a $3 increase in pharmacy copayments under TRICARE to promote generic medications and mail-order refills. The House and Senate bills built on changes to DOD policy and military law from the FY2014 NDAA. The FY2015 NDAA addressed various aspects of the sexual assault issue within the Armed Forces and included provisions related to ground force equipment funding. The House bill proposed prohibiting the transfer of Apache attack helicopters to active Army units, directing the GAO to review the Army's decision on the transfer, and allowing for the possibility of such a transfer in the future. The House bill proposed prohibiting the transfer of Apache attack helicopters to active Army units, directing the GAO to review the Army's decision on the transfer, and allowing for the possibility of such a transfer in the future. The Senate bill would have allowed DOD to transfer as many as 48 of the National Guard's Apaches to the active Army and added funding for new Black Hawks for the National Guard. Additionally, S. 2410 would have mandated the creation of an independent commission to make recommendations on the organization of the Army and the allocation of missions among the active Army, the Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. The FY2015 NDAA bill includes provisions related to the National Guard and the Air Force. It bars the transfer of Apache helicopters from the National Guard in FY2015 but allows for up to 48 transfers in the first six months of FY2016. The bill also establishes a commission to study the allocation of missions between the active-duty Army and its reserve components. Additionally, it authorizes larger amounts for tanks and armored combat vehicles. The FY2015 NDAA bill includes provisions for tanks and armored combat vehicles to sustain the industrial base. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees warned that the Army's budget request was inadequate. The final bill authorizes additional funds for Army trucks to even out annual funding and avoid inefficiencies. The FY2015 NDAA bill includes provisions for refueling and modernizing the aircraft carrier U.S.S. George Washington at a cost of $4.7 billion over nearly four years. DOD officials deferred a decision on this project until 2016 due to budget constraints. The FY2015 NDAA bill includes provisions for refueling and modernizing the aircraft carrier U.S.S. George Washington at a cost of $4.7 billion over nearly four years. Officials stated that the budget request for FY2016 would fund either modernization or retirement of the carrier, depending on future funding availability. The Navy planned to proceed with refueling and overhaul of the carrier following congressional support, with additional funding authorized by the House bill. The FY2015 NDAA bill authorizes $795.1 million to begin overhauling the aircraft carrier U.S.S. George Washington, with funds allocated for refueling and modernization work. The Navy is directed to only use the funds for necessary work related to the refueling and modernization plan. The Navy plans to keep 11 Aegis cruisers and 9 LSD-type amphibious landing transports in service, while tying up 11 other cruisers and 3 LSDs for modernization over several years. The ships will be returned to service as replacements as their sister ships retire, starting in the late 2020s. H.R. 3979 includes provisions to ensure the modernization of the laid-up ships and prohibits their premature scrapping. Section 1026 of the bill mandates the start of modernization work on two cruisers in 2015, prohibits the retirement of any ships, and requires detailed reports on the status of each ship to be submitted to Congress annually. The FY2015 NDAA authorizes $1.22 billion for developing new ballistic missile-launching submarines to replace the Ohio-class subs. This includes funds for design work and the new sub's nuclear power plant. A new budget account, the National Sea-Based Deterrent Fund, is created for construction. Navy officials emphasize the importance of cost control. The FY2015 NDAA authorizes $1.22 billion for developing new ballistic missile-launching submarines to replace the Ohio-class subs. A new budget account, the National Sea-Based Deterrent Fund, is created for construction. Navy officials highlight the importance of cost control. The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to transfer up to $3.5 billion for the new subs. Congressional action on funding for fixed-wing aircraft is also summarized. The House and Senate versions of the FY2015 NDAA aimed to block the Air Force's plan to retire A-10 ground-attack planes. Section 133 of H.R. 3979 prohibits retirement of any A-10s but allows the removal of up to 36 aircraft. The FY2015 NDAA authorizes $1.22 billion for developing new ballistic missile-launching submarines to replace the Ohio-class subs. A new budget account, the National Sea-Based Deterrent Fund, is created for construction. The bill also allows the Air Force to remove up to 36 A-10 aircraft from day-to-day operations if necessary to free up funding for readiness. Additionally, $331.2 million is added for continued A-10 operations in FY2015. The request for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) included $7.46 billion, with most going towards R&D for sensors and weapons to detect and destroy ballistic missiles. The House bill would increase MDA authorization by $363 million, the Senate bill by $190 million, and H.R. 3979 by $377.6 million, totaling $7.85 billion for MDA. The budget request also included $1.00 billion for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) to protect against intercontinental ballistic missiles. The final version of H.R. 3979 increases authorization by $40.0 million to improve the reliability of the missile defense system in California. It does not include planning for a third GBI deployment site on the East Coast, as proposed in the House bill. The House Armed Services Committee requested updates on the cost and planning estimates for a potential East Coast site to protect against missiles from Iran. The budget also includes $272.8 million for Israeli-designed missile defense systems. The final version of H.R. 3979 authorizes $571.6 million for Israeli missile defense systems, including $351.0 million for Iron Dome and $220.6 million for other systems. This is slightly more than double the budget request. The House bill had proposed $520.8 million for Israeli systems, while the Senate bill had proposed $447.8 million. The final version also extends restrictions on detainee transfers to the US through December 31, 2015. The final version of H.R. 3979 authorizes $571.6 million for Israeli missile defense systems, including $351.0 million for Iron Dome and $220.6 million for other systems. It extends restrictions on detainee transfers to the US through December 31, 2015, prohibiting the transfer of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay to the United States. The Senate bill had provisions allowing detainees to be brought to U.S. territory under certain conditions, which are not included in H.R. 3979. The FY2015 budget does not request funds for constructing additional detainee facilities at Guantanamo Bay. H.R. 3979 prohibits funding for new facilities unless they have enduring military value. The bill does not include provisions from the Senate bill such as prohibiting detainee transfers to Yemen or requiring a report to Congress. The FY2015 NDAA does not request funds for new detainee facilities at Guantanamo Bay. Section 1205 codifies DOD's \"building partner capacity\" authority to provide support to foreign security forces. The FY2015 NDAA does not request funds for new detainee facilities at Guantanamo Bay. Section 1204 of H.R. 3979 codifies the \"Leahy Law\" human rights condition on DOD assistance to foreign security forces, prohibiting aid to units with credible human rights violations. The FY2015 NDAA includes provisions prohibiting aid to foreign security units with credible human rights violations, except in certain circumstances. Section 1206 authorizes human rights training for security forces through FY2020, even for units restricted by the Leahy Law. The FY2015 NDAA includes provisions extending the DOD-State Department Global Security Contingency Fund through FY2017 for BPC counterterrorism programs and small-scale construction projects. It also requires the Secretary of Defense to report on specified DOD programs by 2016, 2018, and 2020. Section 1510 of H.R. 3979 authorizes up to $1.3 billion in FY2015 DOD appropriations for the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF) to support foreign security forces in counterterrorism activities. Section 1534 outlines the purposes and limitations of CTPF funds, focusing on activities within the U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility. The Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF) can only be used within the U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility, excluding Iraq. The Secretary of Defense can authorize funding elsewhere to counter national security risks if necessary. CTPF funds must be transferred to existing DOD accounts and used for programs under existing DOD authority. Up to $500 million of CTPF funds can be used to assist vetted Syrian forces under Section 1209 of the FY2015 NDAA. The Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF) can only be used within the U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility, excluding Iraq. CTPF funds must be transferred to existing DOD accounts and used for programs under existing DOD authority. The House passed H.R. 4435, the Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015, on May 25, 2014 by a vote of 325-98. The FY2015 Defense Appropriations Act appropriates $483.7 billion for DOD's FY2015 base budget, a reduction of $548 million compared to the Administration's request. The FY2015 Defense Appropriations Act reduces the base budget by $548 million, rejecting some cost reduction initiatives while adding funds for weapons programs and readiness improvements. Congressional additions are offset by shifting some costs to the Overseas Contingency Operations fund. The FY2015 Defense Appropriations Act, like the NDAA, rejects some cost reduction initiatives from the Administration's budget request. It bars proposals for military base closures, retirement of Air Force planes and an aircraft carrier, and changes in the military commissary system. However, it allows reductions in the rate of increase of military basic pay. The House bill would block reductions in military basic pay and housing allowances, appropriating billions more than budget requests with offsetting cuts. The enacted version includes reductions to compensate for added costs, some amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, justified by various reasons such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The FY2015 Defense Appropriations Bill includes provisions to restrain the increase in military compensation costs, such as a 1% raise in basic pay and reductions in housing allowances. Some funds requested in the base budget are provided in the OCO budget, exempt from the statutory cap on defense appropriations.
