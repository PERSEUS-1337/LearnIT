    "content": "When a Senator introduces a bill or joint resolution, it is usually referred to a Senate committee for further consideration. Senate rules require that bills and joint resolutions have three readings before passage, with the possibility of being read twice on the same day for reference. Most bills are referred to committee on the same day they are introduced or received from the House. The Senate rules dictate that bills and joint resolutions should be referred to the appropriate committee based on subject matter. The presiding officer formally refers these measures, with the parliamentarian often handling the referral process. Referral of bills and joint resolutions, including those from the House, typically occurs during \"morning business.\" Additional guidelines from Senate Rule XIV or unanimous agreements between committees may also influence the referral process. The Senate may bypass committee referral of a bill or joint resolution using Senate Rule XIV or unanimous consent. Measures can be held at the desk temporarily or truncated in committee consideration. Reasons for bypassing include placing the measure directly on the Senate's Calendar of Business or immediate consideration. Senators can convert bills into amendments for floor consideration. The Senate uses alternative procedures to bypass committee consideration of bills and joint resolutions, including introducing amendments on the Senate floor. This report does not cover using amendments to bypass Senate committees but focuses on how the Senate facilitates the consideration and passage of bills and joint resolutions through alternative procedures. The Senate uses alternative procedures to bypass committee consideration of bills and joint resolutions. A bill can be prevented from being referred to a committee and placed directly on the Senate's Calendar of Business through objection after two readings. This procedure is typically initiated by the majority leader or a Senator acting on their behalf. The Senate bypasses committee consideration of bills by objection after two readings. A bill (S. 1035) regarding surveillance authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was read for the first time. Majority Leader McConnell requested a second reading but objected to place it on the calendar. The bill will be read for the second time on the next legislative day. The Senate bypasses committee consideration of bills by objection after two readings. Majority Leader McConnell objected to further proceedings on bill S. 1035, related to surveillance authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The bill will be placed on the calendar after receiving its second reading. The presiding officer ordered bill S. 1035 to be placed on the Senate Calendar, bypassing committee consideration. This allows the full Senate to potentially consider the measure and prevents potential inaction or hostile action by a committee. In the 114th Congress, 82 bills were placed directly on the calendar using the Rule XIV procedure, including S. 1 for the Keystone XL pipeline construction approval. Senator John Hoeven introduced S. 1 on January 6, 2015, and it was quickly placed on the calendar for expedited consideration by the Senate. In the 114th Congress, S. 1 for the Keystone XL pipeline construction approval was expedited for consideration in the Senate. The majority leader swiftly moved to proceed with the bill, invoking cloture on January 12 and passing the bill on January 29 by a vote of 62-36. House-passed bills can also be placed directly on the calendar using the Rule XIV procedure in the Senate. The Senate committee is considering Senate companion legislation, with an amendment to the House measure already in discussion. The House-passed measure will serve as the Senate's legislative vehicle, supported more strongly in the full Senate than in the committee. House-passed measures on the calendar in the 114th Congress included the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act and the No Rate Regulation of Internet Broadnet Access Act. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee reported a companion bill related to the Internet Broadnet Access Act. Minority-party Senators use Rule XIV to give visibility to bills and avoid inaction in a Senate committee. A Democratic Senator used this procedure to put a bill on the calendar requiring presidential candidates to disclose tax returns. Bills can be read and placed directly on the calendar by unanimous consent. This procedure was used for bills like the GAO Mandates Revision Act in the 114th Congress. In the Senate, bills can be placed directly on the calendar by unanimous consent, as seen with the fiscal year 2014 continuing appropriations resolution. This process allows for quick consideration of measures, with Senate floor consideration typically following a two-step process. Senate floor consideration of a bill involves a two-step process: first, a decision on whether to consider the measure, and then debate, possible amendment, and a final vote on passage. Clearance and hotlining are informal processes used for noncontroversial legislation to expedite consideration without much debate or recorded votes. The majority leader uses clearance and unanimous consent to expedite the consideration of noncontroversial measures in the Senate, bypassing or truncating committee action. The Senate uses unanimous consent to quickly pass noncontroversial legislation, such as S. 1568 in the 113th Congress to replace a Veterans Administration medical center in Denver. The Senate quickly passed a bill to establish the John F. Kennedy Centennial Commission without objection. The Senate passed H.R. 5722 to establish the John F. Kennedy Centennial Commission without objection. Ms. Murkowski requested unanimous consent for the bill to be read three times, passed, and reconsidered without debate. The request also applies to joint resolutions with preambles. House bills and Senate bills may be received or introduced without immediate further proceedings. They can be held at the desk pending referral to committee, passage without committee consideration, or clearance from all Senators. For example, H.R. 5936, the West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016, was received in the Senate on September 13, 2016, and passed on September 19 by unanimous consent. Majority Leader McConnell requested unanimous consent for the Senate to proceed to immediate consideration. The Senate proceeded to consider H.R. 5936, a bill received from the House, which was passed without debate by voice vote. The Senate also amended H.R. 6302, the Overtime Pay for Secret Service Agents Act of 2016, and passed it by unanimous consent. The Senate in the 113th Congress anticipated House passage of a bill providing a short-term extension for special Iraqi immigrant visas. In response to exigent circumstances, they agreed by unanimous consent to automatic consideration and passage of major legislation, such as during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Hastert and Majority Leader Bill Frist called Congress back into session on September 1, 2005 for emergency supplemental appropriations to deal with Hurricane Katrina. The House passed H.R. 3645 on September 2, while Senator Thad Cochran made a unanimous consent request in the Senate for the same bill. The House bill, identical to the one at the desk, was passed by both the House and Senate on September 2. President George W. Bush signed it into law the same day (P.L. 109-61). Noncontroversial Senate bills and House-passed measures are often referred to committee, which can be discharged by unanimous consent if needed. For example, H.R. 1168, an amendment to the Social Security Act, was discharged by unanimous consent from the Senate Finance Committee on December 9, 2016. The Senate proceeded to consider bill S. 1168, which aims to amend the Social Security Act to preserve access to rehabilitation innovation centers under the Medicare program. Mr. Portman requested unanimous consent for the Kirk amendment to be agreed to, the bill to be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider to be laid upon the table, all of which were ordered without objection. Legislation can be discharged from a committee after formal action or hearings. For example, the Veterans' Affairs Committee was discharged from considering bills like the Veterans Education Improvement Act and the Department of Veterans Administration Dental Insurance Reauthorization Act. In another instance, the Judiciary Committee was discharged from considering the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act after ordering it to be favorably reported. Measures can also be discharged and considered en bloc."
