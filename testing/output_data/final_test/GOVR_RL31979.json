    "content": "In 1993, Russia applied for accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was taken up by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. Negotiations for Russia's accession to the WTO have faced challenges in recent years, with mixed signals from Russian leaders about the benefits of joining. Russia has changed trade rules, such as quotas on meat imports and tariffs on auto imports, contradicting commitments made during the WTO accession process. Despite criticism from the US and EU, Russia expressed commitment to joining the WTO in 2008. The 2008 conflict with Georgia led to a reevaluation of support from WTO members. In 2006, a bilateral agreement was signed between the US and Russia for WTO accession. Russia is in the process of joining the WTO, with the need to complete negotiations with a working party consisting of representatives from about 60 member countries. Congressional interest in Russia's accession is focused on ensuring terms align with U.S. economic interests and protecting import-sensitive industries. Some members advocate for Congress to have a formal role in approving conditions for Russia's WTO entry. Congress plays a crucial role in deciding Russia's permanent normal trade relations (NTR) status, impacting its WTO membership and trade relations with the U.S. The report analyzes Russia's WTO accession, focusing on implications for all parties involved, including economic conditions and reforms in Russia. It also discusses the status of Russia's accession application and outstanding issues, concluding with an analysis of the implications for Russia, the U.S., and the WTO. The WTO, with 153 member countries, was established in 1995 to administer trade agreements. Russia's accession to the WTO has implications for Russia, the U.S., and other members. The GATT/WTO membership has grown significantly. The WTO, with 153 member countries, was established in 1995 to administer trade agreements. The GATT was founded in 1947 by 23 countries and now has 153 members. Ukraine and Cape Verde are the newest members, joining in 2008. Membership in the WTO commits countries to trade principles like Most-favored nation treatment and National treatment. The GATT/WTO aims to promote free trade by prohibiting discrimination against imports in laws and regulations. Transparency is key, with government laws and regulations affecting foreign trade and investment being published and open. Negotiations have focused on lowering trade barriers, including tariffs and nontariff barriers like discriminatory practices and subsidies. The Uruguay Round (1986-94) resulted in significant rule expansion. The Uruguay Round (1986-94) expanded rules to cover trade in agricultural products, services, intellectual property rights, and foreign investment regulations. The WTO requires member countries to use tariffs instead of quotas for imports. Disputes between members are settled by the WTO, which also reviews trade regimes to ensure compliance with its rules. WTO members account for about 90% of world trade. The collapse of the Soviet Union and its East European Bloc and the movement of many developing countries towards liberal trade policies have increased interest in joining the WTO. The accession process involves a letter from the applicant to the WTO requesting membership, followed by the formation of a Working Party to consider the application. The U.S. delegation is part of the Working Party on Russia's accession to the WTO. The U.S. delegation, led by the Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for WTO and Multilateral Affairs, is part of the Working Party (WP) on Russia's accession to the WTO. The applicant submits a memorandum detailing its trade regime to the WP for negotiation on necessary changes to meet WTO requirements. The WP's findings are included in a \"Report of the Working Party\" and form the basis for the \"Protocol of Accession.\" Bilateral negotiations with interested WTO members also take place to determine concessions and commitments required for entry. The applicant submits a memorandum detailing its trade regime to the Working Party for negotiation on necessary changes to meet WTO requirements. The terms of the bilateral agreements are combined into one document which will apply on an MFN basis to all WTO members once the applicant has joined the WTO. The length of the accession process depends on various factors such as legislative changes, willingness to accept demands, and speed of making necessary changes. The WTO accession process requires the applicant to accept demands and gain a 2/3 majority vote. The process can be lengthy, as seen with China's 15-year application. The Soviet Union was not invited to join the GATT in 1947 due to conflicting trade policies. The Soviet Union's foreign economic policy focused on self-sufficiency and limited international trade with the Soviet Bloc. This approach contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. The formation of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) was a key initiative in this economic strategy. In 1990, the Soviet Union received observer status in the Uruguay Round negotiations of the GATT. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia retained observer status and formally applied to accede to the GATT in 1993, which later converted to an application to become a member of the WTO in 1995. Russia's progress towards WTO accession is ongoing. Russia's motivation for WTO accession is linked to dismantling the Soviet economic system and transitioning to a market-based economy. Entry into the WTO is a top priority for Russian leaders to overcome political obstacles hindering economic restructuring. Accession to the WTO has facilitated passing significant economic reform legislation in the Russian parliament. Economic experts argue that reforms are crucial for long-term economic growth. However, certain interest groups like agriculture, auto industry, and raw material producers oppose these reforms and Russia's WTO accession. Russia has experienced economic growth since 1999. Russia has experienced economic growth since 1999, attributed to factors like ruble depreciation and rising energy prices. However, economic problems persist, including high poverty rates and uneven growth across regions. Income inequality has also increased, with wealth concentrated among a small portion of the population. Russia's economic vulnerabilities emerged in 2008 due to plummeting oil prices and the global financial crisis, leading to a decline in the ruble's value and a drop in Russian stock market indexes. Since the Soviet Union's collapse, the Russian economy has become more open to foreign trade, with exports and imports equivalent to a significant portion of GDP by 2008. Foreign trade has diversified geographically, with a decreasing reliance on former Soviet states. Russia has seen increasing current account surpluses, mainly driven by the rapid growth in the value of exports. Russia's current account surpluses have been increasing due to the growth in exports of crude oil, natural gas, and other resources. In 2006, the surplus was $95.6 billion, rising from $29.1 billion in 2002 but declining to $78.3 billion in 2007. However, the surpluses may not last as Russia heavily relies on volatile market prices for raw materials. Diversifying trade structures could stabilize the situation. Imports of machinery, equipment, and processed foods have risen, and foreign direct investment has increased, showing some investor confidence in Russia's economic prospects. Foreign direct investment in Russia has surged in recent years, reaching $55.0 billion in 2007 from $3.5 billion in 2002. Despite government measures to re-nationalize the energy sector, investor confidence in Russian economic prospects remains. However, the level of FDI is still considered low given the size and needs of the Russian economy. Russia's transition from central planning has been more challenging due to the deeply entrenched communist system in the Soviet Union. The country lacks a legacy of a market economy, unlike some Central and East European countries. Russia has had to address the legacy of a Soviet economy focused on military needs, with civilian production and investment given low priority. Russia's economic problems during the transition period were due to policy failures, including loose monetary and fiscal policies. Structural issues like poorly executed privatization programs and control of assets by Soviet-era managers and oligarchs hindered economic growth. Inefficient banking, lack of land ownership protection, inadequate commercial laws, and corrupt bureaucracy also impeded development. Despite setbacks, Russia has made progress in some areas. Despite setbacks, Russia has eliminated price controls on most goods and services, allowing market forces to guide producers and consumers. Controls remain on energy, housing, and transportation but are to be removed eventually. The structure of Russian production resembles an open economy, with the services sector now accounting for more than half of national output. The private sector has grown significantly, representing roughly 3/4 of national output. President Putin initiated economic reforms upon taking office in 2000, leading to progress until 2004. Putin's economic reforms during his first term until 2004 included tax, land, government bureaucracy, judicial, and corporate governance reforms. Despite progress, Russia's economic growth is fragile due to weaknesses in the financial sector and commercial laws. The Putin government's economic reforms faced challenges due to a poorly developed financial sector and commercial laws. There were concerns over the implementation of restructuring laws and skepticism regarding Putin's commitment to reform. State control over critical sectors, especially energy, raised doubts about economic reform. The Medvedev/Putin government's response to the financial crisis increased worries about tightening state control over the economy. Russia has made significant strides in aligning its foreign trade and investment regimes with WTO rules. Key changes include eliminating the state monopoly on foreign trade and the ban on foreign investment in 1991, making the ruble convertible in 1992, and removing multiple exchange rates in 1999. The Central Bank imposed fixed exchange rates in the 1990s but allowed the ruble to float after the 1998 financial crisis. Since the 1998 crisis, the ruble floats with intervention from the Central Bank of Russia. The Harmonized Tariff System was adopted in 1992, with tariff rates ranging from 0 to 30%. Russia's Generalized System of Preferences program offers tariff advantages to some countries. The trade-weighted average tariff rate decreased from 16.0% in 1995 to 11.1% in 2001. The average tariff rate in Russia decreased from 16.0% in 1995 to 11.1% in 2001. Some products require licensing for exports and imports, such as pharmaceuticals and alcoholic beverages. Export tariffs on oil are applied to ensure domestic supply. In 2008, trade restrictions were implemented, including raised tariffs on foreign car imports. Russia also passed laws for antidumping and safeguards measures against imports. The Russian accession process to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is at a critical stage, with negotiations focusing on key areas such as privatization, property rights, price controls, government financial support for business, and tax regime implementation. The process involves submitting a description of the trade regime, followed by questions and replies from WTO members, establishing a benchmark for negotiations. The last stages of negotiations are typically the most challenging. The last stages of negotiations for Russia's accession to the WTO are the most difficult, with key issues including intellectual property rights, energy pricing, agriculture, trade in services, civil aircraft, and more. The energy sector is crucial for Russia's economy, dominated by oil, natural gas, and electricity, with Gazprom and United Energy Systems as major players. The energy sector in Russia is dominated by Gazprom and United Energy Systems, which are government-owned monopolies. Domestic energy prices are regulated by the government and are lower than world prices, leading to a significant gap. The process of reforming these companies has been slow and politically controversial. The EU and the United States have criticized Russia's \"dual pricing\" policy, where domestic prices for natural gas, electricity, and oil are much lower than world prices. The EU and the United States have raised concerns about Russia's dual energy pricing, which they believe gives Russian manufacturers an unfair advantage. This pricing policy could potentially violate WTO subsidy agreements, which only allow specific subsidies that distort international trade. The EU and the United States have raised concerns about Russia's energy pricing policies, particularly regarding subsidies that may violate WTO agreements. European and U.S. fertilizer producers are strong opponents due to the significant impact of natural gas prices on fertilizer production costs. The Russian government argues that energy prices are not a subsidy under WTO rules as they are available to all industries. An agreement was reached with the EU to gradually increase domestic energy prices as part of Russia's WTO accession. WTO members are urging Russia to comply with TRIPS on intellectual property rights. The TRIPS agreement mandates intellectual property rights protection in all WTO members, requiring national and most-favored-nation treatment. Russia has laws safeguarding copyrights, trademarks, and patents but faces criticism for inadequate enforcement, leading to intellectual property piracy. The United States and some other WTO members are concerned about Russia's revision of IPR laws in 2006, fearing a weakening of intellectual property rights protection. Russia has been on the Special 301 Priority Watch List for 12 years due to unauthorized reproduction of American copyrighted material. Piracy, especially in the form of pirated DVDs and websites, has been a significant issue. Russia-based websites distribute unauthorized music, films, and books, causing $1.4 billion in copyright piracy losses in 2007. Counterfeit American products dominate Russian purchases. Russia claims improved intellectual property rights enforcement and argues against singling out. Agriculture, politically significant despite its small GDP share, has struggled in the market economy transition. Agricultural production in Russia declined around 40% since 1991 due to factors like changes in Soviet agriculture policy and the transition to market prices after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This led to increased costs of meat production and challenges for Russian producers in the liberalized trade environment. Russian producers of poultry and meats struggled to compete with foreign producers after trade liberalization. Local and regional governments continue to support agriculture with equipment, credits, and subsidies to address food security and unemployment. The slow restructuring of Russian farms, mostly remaining as inefficient joint stock operations or cooperatives, also contributes to the decline in agricultural production. The Russian government is facing pressure to protect agriculture and make it competitive, leading to differences in negotiations with agricultural exporting countries like the US, Canada, and Australia over government support levels. Russian negotiators argue for higher support levels and longer phase-out periods than their counterparts are willing to accept, stating they should not have to drastically reduce support while others negotiate agriculture subsidies in the WTO. The WTO members are negotiating agriculture subsidies in the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). Russia's subsidies are seen as trade-distorting, giving its agriculture producers an unfair advantage. Russia argues it needs support to compete with the EU and U.S. in agriculture. Concerns have been raised over Russia's SPS standards. Russia's sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards are being questioned for not being scientifically based and discriminating against imports, violating WTO rules. The United States has expressed concern over Russia's SPS controls, particularly regarding a ban on U.S. poultry imports due to avian influenza. After negotiations, an agreement was reached in August. After negotiations, the United States and Russia agreed on a new veterinary certificate for U.S. poultry exports in August 2002. Technical issues initially delayed the process, but were resolved in April 2003, allowing inspections of U.S. facilities to resume. The U.S. is concerned about potential future restrictions and has urged Russia to comply with WTO requirements. Financial services are a growing sector in the Russian economy, previously government-owned under the Soviet Union. The services sector in Russia, including financial services, has grown rapidly during the transition to a market economy but has not fully matured. The United States, the EU, and other WTO members argue that Russia needs an efficient financial services industry for economic growth. Russian officials claim that their service industries need government protection as \"infant industries\" to prevent being wiped out by foreign competition too soon. The Russian insurance industry is still developing after the government monopoly was removed post-Soviet Union collapse. Foreign insurance companies are restricted in their involvement, with limitations on foreign capitalization, requirements for Russian leadership, and restrictions on participation based on foreign companies' experience and ownership structure. Foreign providers are also prohibited from certain activities like underwriting and reinsuring mandatory policies. Foreign providers are prohibited from underwriting and reinsuring mandatory insurance in Russia, including auto and health insurance. The Russian banking sector is underdeveloped, with two banks, Sberbank and Vneshtorgbank, dominating the market. Foreign participation in the banking sector is restricted, with foreign banks only allowed to operate as subsidiaries. Deposit insurance program is lacking, hindering the development of new private banks. The government in Russia backs deposits of Sberbank 100% and is considering establishing a deposit insurance program for all banks. Negotiators from the US and other countries are urging Russia to liberalize its banking sector to increase foreign participation, which they believe would enhance the competitiveness of Russian banks and boost the economy. In telecommunications, Russia allows 100% foreign ownership but has requested a commitment of only 49% foreign ownership. The Russian government has requested a 49% foreign ownership commitment in telecommunications, which is opposed by U.S. and EU negotiators. They view the Russian market as lucrative and want to liberalize the sector. The WTO rules on trade in services, like financial services, are governed by the GATS, which is less comprehensive than the GATT. The Russian government imposes a 20% tariff on imported aircraft to protect domestic manufacturers due to low demand and the need for modernization. Russia is under pressure from the United States and EU to sign the WTO Civil Aircraft Agreement, which eliminates tariffs on trade in civil aircraft. Despite a previous commitment in a 1996 bilateral agreement, Russia has hesitated to sign the CAA during accession negotiations. Russia grants tariff waivers for domestic airlines, with a recent preference for Airbus Industries. The United States is demanding equal treatment for all aircraft manufacturers. The United States, the EU, and other working party members have raised issues about Russia's trade and foreign investment regime as part of its WTO accession conditions. Russia has lowered tariffs on most products but maintains high tariffs on some items to protect industries. Concerns include high tariffs on autos, which can add over 70% to the delivery cost of imported cars. Russia also increased tariffs on used vehicles to protect domestic market. The Russian government maintains high tariffs on used vehicles to protect the domestic market, which has been a concern for U.S., Japanese, and Korean delegations. Some World Trade Organization members have criticized Russia's customs regulations for being inconsistent and hindering trade, with a new customs code pending in parliament. Import licenses are required for certain products like pharmaceuticals and sugar. Russia has implemented a tariff-rate quota on sugar, precious metals, stones, and alcoholic beverages. Some World Trade Organization members are concerned about additional licensing requirements that could hinder imports. Legislation to simplify import licensing procedures is pending in parliament. Members have requested Russia to join the Government Procurement Agreement. A bilateral agreement on Russia's WTO accession was signed in 2006. The bilateral agreement signed during the APEC summit in Hanoi marked a significant milestone in Russia's WTO accession process. The agreement addressed sensitive issues in economic relations with the United States, particularly regarding Russian imports of U.S.-origin beef. Russia had banned beef imports since a case of mad cow disease in 2003, but under the agreement, Russia agreed to permit immediate imports. Russia agreed to resume imports of de-boned beef, bone-in beef, and beef by-products from cattle younger than 30 months under a bilateral agreement with the United States in 2003. The agreement also allows imports of beef and beef by-products from cattle of all ages after a positive evaluation from the World Organization for Animal Health. Russia accepts USDA FSIS certifications for pork and poultry facilities, expedited certification procedures, and U.S. freezing as a measure to prevent trichinae infestation in pork. The bilateral agreement between the United States and Russia covers tariff-related measures, including provisions on meat imports and tariff-rate quotas. Russia has agreed to bind tariffs on some agricultural products at current levels, lower tariffs on others, and eliminate tariffs on information technology products by acceding to the WTO Information Technology and Telecommunications Agreement. Compliance with 95% of ITA commitments is expected within the first three years of WTO membership. Russia has agreed to comply with 95% of ITA commitments within its first three years of WTO membership. It did not agree to U.S. demands on the WTO Civil Aircraft Agreement but will reduce tariffs on wide-body aircraft, parts for civil aircraft, and leased aircraft. Russia will also reduce tariffs on narrow-body aircraft and establish procedures to expedite imports of encryption technology products. Foreign insurance companies can own 100% of insurance operations in Russia, but limits may be imposed on foreign direct investment in banking and insurance if it exceeds 50%. After five years, Russia will consider lifting restrictions on foreign investment in banking. Russia will consider lifting the discretionary restriction on foreign investment in banking and insurance. Additionally, Russia agreed to increase market access for foreign providers in various service areas such as telecommunications, audio-visual services, energy services, express delivery services, distribution services, business services, and environmental services. The agreement also includes commitments to strengthen enforcement of intellectual property rights, including shutting down plants producing optical disks and websites distributing pirated products, as well as enhancing border enforcement against pirated goods. Russia also committed to adhering to the WTO agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPs) and protecting proprietary information from pharmaceutical companies. Russia is still in negotiations with the working party and needs to finalize agreements with Saudi Arabia and Ukraine, both new WTO members. The United States and other working party members are monitoring Russia's progress on resolving issues related to government support for agriculture and fulfilling commitments on intellectual property rights and industrial goods trade. Formal meetings have been put on hold due to disputes with Georgia over exports and recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The Russian government is reconsidering some commitments made during the accession process. The Russian government is reconsidering commitments made during the WTO accession process, with Prime Minister Putin expressing doubts about the benefits. The United States has supported Russia's accession since 1993, providing advice on WTO compatibility and educating Russian firms. U.S. support is crucial for Russia's application, but it insists on commercial terms and immediate adherence to WTO agreements. This support is part of post-Cold War U.S. trade policy encouraging Russian economic endeavors. The United States has supported Russia's trade and economic endeavors since the post-Cold War era, aiming to anchor Russia in the world community and foster cooperation. This support includes technical assistance, trade preferences, and financial aid through various programs. Since 1992, the U.S. has granted Russia conditional normal trade relations status, leading to lower tariffs on Russian imports. The Bush Administration has shown interest in Russia's accession to the WTO. Since 1992, the United States has granted Russia conditional normal trade relations status. U.S.-Russian trade and investment flows have increased post-Cold War, with U.S. imports from Russia peaking at $19.3 billion in 2007. U.S. exports have also increased, reaching $7.4 billion in 2007. The United States has incurred growing trade deficits with Russia since 1994, peaking at $15.1 billion in 2006 but declining to $11.9 billion in 2007. Despite the increase in bilateral trade, the United States and Russia still account for small shares of each other's exports and imports. In 2007, Russia accounted for about 0.6% of U.S. exports and 1.0% of U.S. imports, while the United States accounted for 2.5% of Russian exports and 4.9% of Russian imports. Major U.S. exports to Russia in 2006 included machinery, vehicles, and meat, while major U.S. imports from Russia consisted of oil, steel, and aluminum. In 2007, the Russian airline Aeroflot signed a contract to purchase 22 Boeing 787 aircraft worth $3.5 billion. The United States also accounted for $4.6 billion in foreign direct investment in Russia in 2006. The United States and Russia have small shares of each other's exports and imports. U.S. exporters and investors are cautious about entering the Russian market due to various concerns, including accounting standards, intellectual property rights enforcement, taxation, and legal protection of contract sanctity. Russian policymakers argue that U.S. trade policy has been slow to adjust to the post-Cold War era. The U.S. Department of Commerce removed the nonmarket economy designation for Russia in antidumping cases, leveling the playing field for Russian imports. However, the U.S. still applies the Jackson-Vanik amendment to trade relations with Russia, affecting its NTR status. Section 401 of Title IV requires the President to deny NTR status to communist countries, except Poland and Yugoslavia. Section 402, the Jackson-Vanik amendment, denies NTR status and access to U.S. credit facilities for countries restricting freedom-of-emigration. The President can lift restrictions if a country complies, with Congress oversight. The Jackson-Vanik amendment allows Congress to overturn restrictions on NTR status for countries restricting freedom of emigration. The President can waive compliance if it promotes freedom of emigration, subject to annual renewal and congressional disapproval. A bilateral agreement is required for NTR status, with a joint resolution needed for it to take effect. In 1990, the US and Soviet Union signed a bilateral trade agreement, later applied to former Soviet states. The US granted NTR treatment to Russia since 1992, with extensions facing little opposition. Russian leaders seek to end Jackson-Vanik coverage, citing outdated conditions post-communism. The US granted NTR treatment to Russia in 1992, with extensions facing little opposition. Russian leaders seek to end Jackson-Vanik coverage, citing outdated conditions post-communism. Some former Soviet republics have been granted permanent NTR status, irking Russian leaders. Granting Russia permanent NTR status would symbolize normal trade relations and may provide a more stable business climate. The US granted NTR treatment to Russia in 1992, seeking to end Jackson-Vanik coverage. Granting Russia permanent NTR status symbolizes normal trade relations and may provide a more stable business climate. U.S.-Russian economic ties depend on Russia's economic reforms for trade and investment growth. WTO accession requires mutual unconditional MFN status, with major trade powers supporting Russia's entry. Negotiators are close to finalizing conditions for Russia's accession. Russian leaders aim to complete WTO negotiations by the end of 2009 to join by January 1, 2010. Putin emphasized the importance of joining the WTO for improving Russia's economic well-being and competitiveness in the international community. Disagreements on energy pricing, agriculture, services, civil aircraft, and intellectual property rights have slowed down the accession process. Russia aims to be strong and competitive in the global market by joining the WTO, which will help improve its economic well-being and competitiveness. By acceding to the WTO, Russia commits to conforming to its rules and opening up its foreign trade and investment regimes for scrutiny. This move will also provide a platform for Russia to settle trade disputes with other WTO members. Joining the WTO will integrate Russia into the international trade system, but it must first satisfy members that it is ready to meet obligations by making significant policy and regulatory adjustments. The impact of WTO accession on Russia will depend on the terms agreed upon with trading partners, likely involving reductions in tariffs and protective measures. Russia's WTO accession will require reducing tariffs and opening up key industries to foreign competition, potentially leading to job losses in certain sectors. However, it could also result in increased foreign investment and market opportunities for globally competitive industries. In the long run, trade liberalization is expected to make the Russian economy more efficient, raise living standards, and diversify industries. New industries may emerge in Russia with WTO accession, but there is division in the business community. Oleg Deripaska, a prominent business magnate, opposes accession due to concerns about increased competition and higher energy prices. Various sectors, including aviation, furniture, and agriculture, fear that Russia is not ready for the competition. Regional political leaders support accession. Putin and Russian political leaders prioritize economic growth and view WTO accession as crucial for development. Putin sees it as a way to push for necessary changes in government and industry. While Putin's political future may not hinge on WTO entry, it will be judged based on progress towards sustainable economic growth. Russia's potential WTO accession is seen as a step towards improving its economic standing and distancing itself from its Soviet past. For U.S. exporters and investors, this could lead to a more stable and open business climate in Russia by addressing issues such as poor intellectual property rights protection and inconsistent customs regulations. The U.S. may face increased competition from Russian producers if Russia joins the WTO. U.S. import-sensitive industries like steel may push for special safeguard provisions to mitigate the impact of a surge in Russian imports. This provision, similar to Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974 for China's accession, allows temporary restrictions on imports causing harm to domestic industries. Section 421 allows restrictions on imports from China if they cause injury to domestic industries, with lower thresholds than Section 201. Concerns in the U.S. revolve around ensuring Russia's WTO accession is commercially sound and minimally impacts U.S. industries. Russia's potential membership in the WTO is significant as it is the largest non-member country. Russia's potential membership in the WTO would expand geographical coverage of rules to major economies, increasing stability and transparency. However, it may also complicate consensus on important issues due to diverse membership. Trade disputes with Russia would be resolved through the WTO, adding to its caseload. Russia's entry would bring its unique perspective to negotiations, potentially challenging existing positions on subsidies and trade in services. The WTO is discussing subsidies in trade and the liberalization of trade in services."
