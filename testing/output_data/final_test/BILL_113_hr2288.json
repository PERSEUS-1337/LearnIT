    "content": "The \"Commuter Parity Act of 2013\" is also known as the Qualified Transportation Fringe Act. The Qualified Transportation Fringe Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to define qualified transportation fringe benefits provided by an employer to an employee, including transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit passes, qualified parking, and bicycle commuting reimbursement. The Act limits the exclusion of these benefits from an employee's gross income. The exclusion of qualified transportation fringe benefits from gross income is limited under the Qualified Transportation Fringe Act. The monthly limits are $220 for benefits described in subparagraphs (A) and (B), $220 for qualified parking, and $35 for qualified bicycle commuting reimbursement. No amount is included in an employee's gross income solely because they can choose between a fringe benefit and compensation. Definitions include transit pass as any pass, token, farecard, voucher, or similar item. The term 'transit pass' refers to any item entitling transportation on mass transit facilities or by a person in the business of transporting persons for compensation in a commuter highway vehicle meeting specific requirements. The term 'qualified parking' refers to parking provided to an employee on or near the business premises of the employer. The term 'qualified parking' includes parking near the employer's business premises or the employee's commuting location, excluding residential property. Employer-provided transportation in a commuter highway vehicle is considered employer-provided. The term 'employee' encompasses those defined in section 401(c)(1). For the purposes of this subsection, a qualified bicycle commuting reimbursement refers to employer reimbursement for expenses incurred by the employee for a bicycle used for travel between residence and work. Inflation adjustments apply to dollar amounts in taxable years after 2014. The text discusses adjustments to dollar amounts based on the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year. Increases are rounded to the nearest multiple of $5. The terms 'working condition fringe' and 'de minimis fringe' do not include qualified transportation fringe. Conforming amendments are made to sections 403(b)(3)(B) and 414(s)(2). Amendments are made to sections 403(b)(3)(B), 414(s)(2), and 415(c)(3)(D)(ii) of the tax code by striking a specific reference. The effective date for these changes is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2013."
