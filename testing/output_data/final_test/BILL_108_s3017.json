    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Swain County Settlement Act of 2004\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The \"Swain County Settlement Act of 2004\" acknowledges the unfinished construction of a road along the Fontana Reservoir, citing environmental concerns and damage to natural park values. The proposed road construction through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park faces environmental concerns such as the exposure of Anakeesta rock leaching acids and metals into streams. The National Park Service estimated the cost of the road to be $150 million in 2000. Public opinion favors a cash settlement over road construction, with the Swain County Board of Commissioners supporting a settlement as an alternative in 2003. The purpose of this Act is to settle and quiet all claims arising from the agreement, serving as a substitute for road construction. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"agreement,\" \"County,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State.\" The Secretary must compensate the County for the unbuilt road within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The County will receive payment within 60 days of accepting the offer. The compensation will be deposited in an account following regulations set by the North Carolina Local Government Commission. The County can only use the principal amount with approval from a resolution passed by a 2/3 majority. The County must use interest accrued on deposited amounts for approved purposes. No funds from the Act can be used to pay agents or attorneys for services related to settled claims. Acceptance of payment from the Secretary settles all claims against the United States, Department of the Interior, and Tennessee Valley Authority. SEC. 5. FUNDING. Authorization of Appropriations for carrying out this Act. Transfer of unobligated balance of $16,000,000 for North Shore Road construction and improvements to the Secretary."
