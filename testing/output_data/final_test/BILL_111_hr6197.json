Designating a peak in Alaska and an icefield in the Chugach Forest in his honor would be a fitting tribute to his legacy.

The Ted Stevens Icefield in the northern Chugach Forest in Alaska, covering approximately 8,340 square miles and including several glaciers, will be officially designated as the \"Ted Stevens Icefield\" by the Board within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Any previous references to the icefield will now refer to the \"Ted Stevens Icefield\"."
