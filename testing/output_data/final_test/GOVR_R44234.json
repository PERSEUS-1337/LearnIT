    "content": "The process of appointing a Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States is outlined in the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The President nominates a candidate, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. This report focuses on the debate and consideration of Supreme Court nominations by the full Senate. Many Senators participate in the debate on Supreme Court nominees, emphasizing the Senate's role in advising and consenting. Each Senator states their reasons for voting for or against a nominee, with criteria varying among Senators, including professional qualifications, character, judicial philosophy, and views on constitutional issues. Senators seek nominees with outstanding legal qualifications and merit. Senators emphasize the importance of nominees having outstanding legal qualifications and merit when discussing Supreme Court nominees. They highlight the professional achievements of nominees to meet the public's expectations of excellence. In recent decades, Senate debate on Supreme Court nominations has focused on nominees' judicial philosophy, ideology, and potential impact on the Court's ideological balance. Many controversial decisions have been closely decided by 5-4 votes, highlighting a divide between liberal and conservative members. New appointees could influence the Court's future rulings. During the George W. Bush presidency, Senate Judiciary subcommittee examined the role of ideology in selecting federal judges. Senators' concerns with a nominee's judicial philosophy may become heightened if controversial or if the President aims to shift the Court's ideological balance. During the Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on the selection of federal judges, Senator Schumer highlighted the influence of nominees' ideologies on the confirmation process. Senator Hatch argued against using political ideology as a measure of judicial qualifications, emphasizing the importance of nominees' ability to set aside personal opinions and uphold the law impartially. Senators consider various factors in their confirmation decisions, including a nominee's ideological disposition, peer influence in the Senate, views of constituents, and advice from advisers. These factors can play a significant role in shaping a Senator's stance on a Supreme Court nomination. Senators may consider various factors when evaluating a Supreme Court nominee, including party affiliation, geographic origin, ethnicity, religion, and gender representation on the Court. They may also take into account Senate institutional factors, such as the role of Senators from the nominee's home state and their support or opposition. Senators may be interested in the President's consultation with other Senators before selecting a nominee, as it conveys respect for Senate advice and consent in judicial appointments. The issue of whether the Senate should defer to the President and give a nominee the \"benefit of the doubt\" has been debated during Supreme Court nominations. During the Senate consideration of Supreme Court nominations, supporters of Clarence Thomas argued for deference to the President's judgment, while opponents rejected the idea of a presumption in favor of nominees. Once a nomination is reported by the Judiciary Committee, it is placed on the Executive Calendar with relevant information. The Senate considers nominations and treaties in executive session, with floor debates on Supreme Court nominations conducted in public since 1986. The decision to proceed to executive session is made while the Senate is in legislative session. The Senate considers nominations and treaties in executive session, with floor debates on Supreme Court nominations conducted in public since 1986. The majority leader schedules consideration of a nomination by consulting with the minority leader and interested Senators. Typically, a unanimous consent request is made to proceed to executive session to consider the nomination, with a specified time for debate and a date for the Senate to vote on the nomination. The Senate considers nominations and treaties in executive session, with floor debates on Supreme Court nominations conducted in public since 1986. The majority leader schedules consideration of a nomination by consulting with the minority leader and interested Senators. Typically, a unanimous consent request is made to proceed to executive session to consider the nomination, with a specified time for debate and a date for the Senate to vote on the nomination. Parties usually have their floor managers as the chair and ranking minority Member of the Judiciary Committee. If agreed to, a time limit on debate and a set date for the final Senate vote precludes delay and filibuster. If unanimous consent is not secured, the majority leader may make a nondebatable motion for the Senate to consider the nomination. The Senate has established a precedent for nondebatable motions to go into executive session for nominations. Senate rules have no time limits for floor consideration of nominations, allowing for filibusters. Cloture motions can limit debate to 30 hours. The Senate established a precedent for nondebatable motions on nominations, including Supreme Court nominations, with a majority of Senators voting required for cloture. This rule change allowed a majority vote to invoke cloture on Supreme Court nominations in 2017, replacing the previous supermajority requirement. The first use of cloture on a Supreme Court nomination occurred in 1968 for Justice Abe Fortas. In 1968, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the nomination of William H. Rehnquist to be Chief Justice, prompting President Lyndon Johnson to withdraw the nomination. However, in 1986, a cloture motion was successful in ending debate on Rehnquist's nomination, with the Senate voting 68-31 in favor. In 2006, a cloture motion was successfully invoked to end consideration of Samuel A. Alito Jr.'s Supreme Court nomination, with the Senate voting 72-25. The next day, the Senate confirmed the nomination by a vote of 58-42. Senators are traditionally hesitant to filibuster Supreme Court nominations, as seen with past nominees like Clarence Thomas in 1991. In 1991, the Senate confirmed Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court nomination with a 52-48 vote. Despite having enough opposition votes to defeat a cloture motion, filibuster was not used. Similar instances occurred in 1969, 1970, and 1987 with other unsuccessful nominations. There has been variation in the time from nomination to final Senate vote for Supreme Court nominees since 1975. The average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote for Supreme Court nominees since 1975 is 69.6 days, with Robert Bork waiting the longest at 108 days and John Paul Stevens the shortest at 19 days. Among current Justices, the average is 72.0 days, with Ruth Bader Ginsburg having the shortest wait. Among current Supreme Court Justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg had the shortest wait from nomination to confirmation (42 days), while Clarence Thomas had the longest wait (99 days). The time nominees have waited for a final Senate vote after being reported by the Judiciary Committee has varied. William Rehnquist and Antonin Scalia waited the longest (34 days) for a final vote, while Neil Gorsuch had the shortest wait (4 days). The average number of days from committee report to final Senate vote for Supreme Court nominations is approximately 12 days, with a median of 7 days. Among current Justices, Neil Gorsuch had the shortest wait (4 days) and Clarence Thomas had the longest wait (18 days) from committee report to confirmation. The presiding officer puts the question of confirmation to a vote after floor debate on a nomination. Since 1967, Senate votes on Supreme Court nominations have been by roll call, requiring a simple majority of Senators present. The procedure for casting votes has varied over the years, with Senators previously able to come and go during the roll call. Senate votes on Supreme Court nominations have been by roll call since 1967, with Senators asked to remain seated at their desks during the entire vote. This rule has been enforced in recent years for the special significance of confirming appointments to the nation's highest court. Vote margins on nominations have varied, with most being overwhelmingly in favor of confirmation. Since 1975, Senate votes on Supreme Court nominations have been by roll call, with most nominations overwhelmingly approved. Of the 15 nominations receiving a final floor vote, 14 were confirmed, with varying levels of support among Senators. Since 1975, Senate votes on Supreme Court nominations have been by roll call, with most nominations overwhelmingly approved. Of the 14 nominations approved by the Senate, 6 were approved despite receiving nay votes from a majority of Senators not belonging to the President's party. These six include the four most recent nominations to the Court, those of Neil Gorsuch (2017), Elena Kagan (2010), Sonia Sotomayor (2009), and Samuel Alito (2006). Additionally, a majority of Senators not belonging to the President party's voted against the Clarence Thomas nomination (1991), as well as the nomination of William Rehnquist to be Chief Justice (1986). In only one of the six cases identified above did the President's party not also hold a majority of seats in the Senate. Specifically, in 1991, President George H. W. Bush (a Republican) nominated Thomas\u2014who was opposed by a majority of Democratic Senators (and whose party was also the majority party in the Senate). In each of the other five cases, the majority of Senators opposed to the nomination belonged to the minority party in the Senate. The majority of Senators opposed to the nomination belonged to the minority party in the Senate. Of the 15 nominations presented, 7 were approved with fewer than 10 nay votes. The last nomination to fall into this category was Stephen Breyer in 1994. Figure 4 shows historical context for the number of nay votes received by recent nominations to the Court. Out of 34 nominations since 1945, 10 received the greatest number of nay votes, with 7 confirmed and 3 rejected. Since 1789, there have been 50 Supreme Court nominations that received a Senate floor vote, with 7 approved and 3 rejected. Recent nominations have faced more opposition from Senators not belonging to the President's party compared to historical trends. After 50 Supreme Court nominations, 10 had the highest percentage of Senators opposing them, including current Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, Alito, and Kagan. The median percentage of Senators voting \"nay\" was 16.6%. Senators can move to reconsider a nomination after a confirmation vote. The Senate Rule XXXI allows a Senator to move to reconsider a Supreme Court confirmation vote, with only one motion allowed per nomination. The Senate can table the motion to prevent further reconsideration. This process is typically done either immediately after the confirmation vote or in a unanimous consent agreement before the vote. However, the Senate has never adopted a motion to reconsider a Supreme Court confirmation vote. Opponents of a Supreme Court nomination may seek to delay the process by recommittal to the Senate Judiciary Committee. There have been eight attempts to recommit nominations, with only two successful instances. In 1873-1874, a nomination stalled in committee and was eventually withdrawn by the President. In 1925, a nomination was re-reported by the committee and confirmed by the Senate. On December 15, 1873, the Senate ordered the nomination of Attorney General George H. Williams to be Chief Justice to be recommitted to the Judiciary Committee due to new allegations of misconduct. Despite holding hearings, the Judiciary Committee did not re-report the nomination back to the Senate amid significant opposition. On January 8, 1874, President Ulysses S. Grant withdrew the Supreme Court nomination of Attorney General Harlan F. Stone at Williams's request. The Senate recommitted Stone's nomination to the Judiciary Committee on January 26, 1925, after facing opposition on the Senate floor due to concerns about his decision to expand a federal investigation of Senator Burton K. Wheeler. Senator Thomas J. Walsh demanded the nomination be returned to the Judiciary Committee. Senator Thomas J. Walsh demanded the nomination of Attorney General Harlan F. Stone be returned to the Judiciary Committee. The Committee held hearings where Stone defended his role in the Wheeler investigation. The nomination was reported favorably to the Senate and confirmed by a 71-6 vote on February 5, 1925. The Senate delayed its vote on the Thomas nomination to allow for additional hearings on sexual harassment allegations made against the nominee by Anita Hill. After three days of hearings, the Senate confirmed the nomination on October 15, 1991. The Senate confirmed the Thomas nomination on October 15, 1991, by a 52-48 vote. The Senate alone votes on presidential nominations, and once confirmed, the Secretary of the Senate attests to a resolution of confirmation and transmits it to the White House. The President signs a commission document appointing the individual to the Court, which is then engraved with the date of appointment and signed by the attorney general before being delivered to the new appointee. After Senate confirmation, new Supreme Court Justices take two oaths of office - a judicial oath and a constitutional oath. Traditionally, the judicial oath is taken in private at the Court, while the constitutional oath is taken in a televised ceremony at the White House. However, in 2009, Justice Sonia Sotomayor broke from tradition by taking both oaths at the Supreme Court in a private ceremony. In 2009, Justice Sonia Sotomayor broke tradition by taking both her constitutional and judicial oaths of office at the Supreme Court in a private ceremony. This was a departure from the usual practice of one oath being administered at the White House, with President Obama following suit for his second nominee, Elena Kagan. The investiture ceremony for a new Justice at the Supreme Court is a formal event held in the courtroom, attended by other Justices, family, friends, and dignitaries. It takes place before the new Justice begins their duties on the Court."
