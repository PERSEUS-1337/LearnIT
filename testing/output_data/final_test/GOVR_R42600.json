In recent years, Senate contention over processing U.S. court nominations in presidential election years has revolved around the pace of confirming judicial nominations. Senators disagree on whether Senate processing of judicial nominations slows down or stops altogether in anticipation of vacancies being filled by the next elected President. Some Senators cite the \"Thurmond Rule\" as supporting past Senate practice of ending processing of lower court nominations earlier in presidential election years. The Senate customarily slows down the process of confirming judicial nominations in presidential election years, with questions raised about the relevance of past Senate practice for the number and timing of confirmations. In 2012, Senator Grassley noted a significant number of judicial and executive nominees approved in 2011, but highlighted the slowdown in work during presidential election years as a factor affecting Senate action on nominations. Senator Leahy expressed concern that portrayals of past Senate practices in presidential election years might be used to justify blocking further confirmations of judicial nominations. Senator Leahy expressed concern over Senate Republicans potentially using the Thurmond Rule to block judicial confirmations in a presidential election year. He pointed out that in 2004 and 2008, the Senate confirmed nominations well into the election years. Senator Durbin also raised similar concerns about delays in considering judicial nominations due to political reasons. Republicans were accused of holding up nominees for political gain. Senator Leahy and Senator Durbin expressed concerns about potential delays in judicial confirmations by Senate Republicans in a presidential election year for political reasons. However, Senator Mike Lee and Senator Grassley argued that the Senate was actually confirming nominees at a brisk pace, well above historical standards for a presidential election year. Senator Lee refuted the notion that delays were due to election year considerations, stating that confirmations were almost double the normal pace. Senator Grassley also noted that the Senate was confirming nominees quickly, even during a presidential election year when nominations are typically limited to consensus nominees. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell decided to oppose further Senate floor votes on all circuit court nominations until after the November 2012 presidential election, invoking the \"Thurmond Rule\" which allows the opposition party to refuse votes on circuit court nominations within six months of a presidential election. District court nominees will likely continue to be confirmed until early September. Senator McConnell decided to oppose further Senate votes on circuit court nominations until after the November 2012 presidential election, invoking the \"Thurmond Rule.\" Republican colleagues welcomed the decision, while Senator Leahy criticized it, calling for continued voting on well-qualified nominees to address high vacancies. Senator Leahy continues to work with Senate leadership to confirm President Obama's judicial nominees to address high vacancies in the courts. The American Bar Association urges prompt confirmation votes for nominees with bipartisan support to alleviate the longstanding issue of judicial vacancies. The American Bar Association expressed concern over judicial vacancies and the Thurmond Rule, which sets a cut-off date for circuit court confirmations in presidential election years. The ABA did not take a position on the rule but noted historical trends of confirmations ending in June or July in past election years. The American Bar Association urged the Senate to schedule votes on three circuit court nominees to reduce the high vacancy rate in the federal judiciary. Senator Leahy supported the nominees as highly qualified and criticized the minority party for blocking votes on consensus nominees. Senator Grassley and Senate Republican Leader McConnell released a letter on the same day regarding the issue. Senator Grassley and Senate Republican Leader McConnell criticized the American Bar Association for urging confirmation of circuit court nominations despite the Thurmond Rule. They argued that the appellate courts are functioning well and questioned the timing of the ABA's recommendation. The McConnell/Grassley letter criticized the American Bar Association for urging circuit court nominations despite vacancies and questioned the Senate's handling of judicial nominees during a presidential election year. The report analyzes the number and timing of circuit court and district court nominations confirmed by the Senate in presidential election years dating back to 1980, comparing the processing of judicial nominations during these years and in 2012 through June. The report analyzes the confirmation rates of circuit and district court nominees by the Senate in presidential election years, comparing the processing of judicial nominations during these years. It also examines the drop-off in confirmations in the second half of election years, last dates of Senate actions on nominations, average confirmation rates, and judgeship vacancy rates. The report concludes by posing questions for the Senate to consider when evaluating past election year nomination processes. The report analyzes the confirmation rates of circuit and district court nominees by the Senate in presidential election years, comparing the processing of judicial nominations during these years. It shows that the number of circuit and district court nominees confirmed during presidential election years varied from 2 to 55. In 2012, 41.7% of pending circuit court nominees have been confirmed. The percentage of circuit court nominees confirmed was lower in recent presidential years compared to earlier years. The confirmation rates of circuit and district court nominees by the Senate in presidential election years varied, with lower percentages confirmed in recent years compared to earlier ones. In the 1996-2008 period, 26.4% of pending circuit court nominees were confirmed, while 58.5% were confirmed in the 1980-1992 period. In presidential election years from 1980 to 2008, the number of confirmed district court nominees varied. The years with the highest numbers were 1992 (55) and 1980 (53), while the lowest were 1996 (18) and 2008 (24). On average, 35 district court nominees were confirmed per election year. In 2012, 46.2% of pending district court nominees were confirmed. The Senate confirmed fewer district court nominees in the 1996-2008 period (105) compared to the 1980-1992 period (175). In the last four election years, there were fewer district court nominations (173) compared to the previous four years (259). The Senate confirmed a higher percentage of district court nominees than circuit court nominees in every presidential election year from 1980 to 2008. The confirmation rates were significantly higher in the most recent presidential election years, with 1996 seeing 46.2% of district court nominees confirmed compared to 22.2% of court of appeals nominees. Figure 1 displays the percentage of confirmed circuit and district court nominees approved by the Senate during each month across eight election years. The trend lines for both circuit and district nominees show similar patterns, with peaks in February, June, and October, and dips in March, July, and November. Most circuit court nominees were confirmed in February, May, June, and October, while most district court nominees were confirmed in February, May, June, September, and October. In contrast to district court nominees, circuit court nominees had a notable drop in confirmations in July and September during the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years. In 2012, there have been multiple circuit court and district court nominees confirmed each month from January through June. Senate confirmations of judicial nominations tend to drop off in the second half of presidential election years, with fewer nominees confirmed in the second half compared to the first half. During presidential election years from 1980 to 2008, a higher percentage of circuit court and district court nominees were confirmed in the first six months compared to the second half of the year. Confirmations dropped off after June, especially in the more recent election years from 1996 to 2008. Senate confirmation of circuit court nominees significantly decreased after June 30 in the more recent presidential election years from 1996 to 2008. In contrast, nearly all confirmed circuit court nominees during this period were approved in the first six months of the year. However, the confirmation pattern for district court nominees differed, with a higher percentage being approved in the second half of the year compared to the earlier presidential election years from 1980 to 1992. The confirmation pattern for district court nominees in the 1996 to 2008 election years showed a trend of post-June confirmations, with notable numbers confirmed in the second half of the year. For instance, in July 1996, 16 district court nominees were confirmed, and in September 2008, 10 nominees were confirmed. This was a departure from the earlier presidential election years from 1980 to 1992. In 2004, district court nominees were confirmed in a \"lame-duck\" congressional session, a rare occurrence during presidential election years. The Senate's decisions on lower court nominations in 2012 remain uncertain. Blocking circuit court nominations could mirror the confirmation pattern of 1996-2008, where only one nomination was confirmed in the second half of those years. Continuing district court confirmations in 2012 would align with the trend seen in previous election years. The Senate's decisions on lower court nominations in 2012 remain uncertain. The confirmation patterns of previous presidential election years suggest that if 2012 follows the trend of 1980 to 1992, circuit and district court nominees could continue to be confirmed in the second half of the year. The confirmation dates for nominees have varied widely in recent election years, as shown in Tables 2 and 3. In six of the eight presidential election years from 1980 to 2008, at least one circuit court nomination was submitted by the President to the Senate during the second half of the year, after June 30. The Senate Judiciary Committee continued its consideration of circuit court nominees during the second half of the year in seven of the eight election years from 1980 to 2008. In 2008, the Senate did not act on circuit court nominees after June 30. The last hearing for a circuit court nominee was on May 7, and the last report of a nomination was on June 12. The Senate confirmed its final circuit court nominee earlier in the year during recent presidential election years. The Senate has not confirmed circuit court nominees after July in recent presidential election years. Confirmations in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008 all occurred before June or July. The Senate Judiciary Committee and full Senate considered district court nominations during this period as well. In recent presidential election years, district court nominations were submitted to the Senate after June 30. The Senate Judiciary Committee continued to consider these nominations, holding hearings or reporting them, even after the traditional August recess. In most years, committee action on district court nominations occurred after August 31. Table 3 shows that in presidential election years from 1980 to 2008, district court nominees were typically confirmed in September or later, with the exception of 1996 when the last confirmation was on August 2. This contrasts with circuit court confirmations during the same period, where no nominees were confirmed after July. In presidential election years from 1980 to 2008, circuit court nominees were typically confirmed by July, while district court nominees were usually confirmed in September or later. Senators may compare current confirmation numbers with past years to gauge Senate's pace in processing judicial nominations. Figure 3 illustrates the average number of nominees confirmed by the Senate at different points in election years. The figure compares the number of circuit and district court nominees confirmed by the Senate in different months from February to October. It shows data from 1980 to 2008 and partial data for 2012, allowing for comparisons between nominee confirmation totals in 2012 and previous election years. For circuit court nominees, an average of 1.2 nominees were confirmed by the end of February in the 1980 to 2008 election years. The average number of circuit court nominees confirmed increased each month from February to October in the years 1980 to 2008, reaching six by September and seven by October. For district court nominees, an average of 4.4 nominees were confirmed by the end of February in these election years. The average number of district court nominees confirmed increased each month from February to October in the years 1980 to 2008, reaching 30.9 by September and 34.4 by October. The biggest monthly increase in nominees confirmed occurred in June, with an average increase of 7.0 nominees. Figure 3 shows the average month-to-month cumulative growth in judicial confirmations across eight presidential election years. During presidential election years from 1980 to 2008, there were instances where the Senate did not confirm circuit court nominations over several months leading up to November. In the most recent presidential election years (1996 to 2008), no circuit court nominations were confirmed from August to October. This pattern deviated from the overall trend of increasing confirmation numbers each month for both circuit and district court nominees. The average number of circuit court nominees confirmed annually did not steadily increase until the end of October, as shown in the 1980 to 2008 data. The growth in nominations stopped by the end of July during presidential election years. In 2012, the Senate confirmed the same number of circuit court nominees by the end of June as the average in past election years. The average number of district court nominees confirmed by the end of June was 21 from 1980 to 2008, compared to 24 in 2012. The Senate confirmed 21 district court nominees by the end of June, compared to 24 in 2012. To match the average number of circuit court nominations from 1980 to 2008, the Senate would need to confirm two more by October 2012. Additionally, 10 more district court nominations would need to be confirmed by October to match the average number of nominations in previous years. President Obama has had the fewest circuit court nominees approved during a first term compared to his recent predecessors. Concerns are raised in the Senate when vacancy rates in the U.S. circuit and district courts reach high levels. In presidential election years, the pace of Senate processing of judicial nominations can impact judicial vacancy rates in U.S. circuit and district courts. Data from 1980 to 2008 show mixed findings on vacancy rate trends during these years. During presidential election years from 1980 to 2008, judicial vacancy rates in U.S. circuit courts fluctuated. Some years saw increases in vacancy rates, while others experienced decreases. For instance, in six election years, the vacancy rate was lower on December 31 compared to January 1. The most significant decline was in 1980, dropping from 9.1% to 3.8%. Other years had more marginal declines, with the largest percentage decrease in 2004. The circuit court vacancy rate increased in the presidential election years of 1984 and 1996, with substantial increases from 2.8% to 14.9% in 1984 and from 7.3% to 12.3% in 1996. The U.S. district court vacancy rate declined in four of the eight most recent completed presidential election years, while it increased in the other four years. Specifically, the district court vacancy rate declined substantially in 1980, from 11.9% to 5.5%. In three other years\u20141988, 1992, and 2004\u2014the vacancy rate declines were more marginal. The circuit court vacancy rate increased in four presidential election years - 1984, 1996, 2000, and 2008. The increases ranged from substantial to marginal, with rates fluctuating between 3.3% to 13.1% in 1984 and 5.6% to 9.8% in 1996. As of January 1, 2012, the circuit court vacancy rate was 8.4%, decreasing to 6.7% by June 30, 2012. The district court vacancy rate was 10.0% on January 1, 2012, dropping to 8.9% by June 30, 2012. Senate confirmations of judicial nominations will impact vacancy rates over time. During certain presidential election years from 1980 to 2008, Senate confirmation rates were related to the rise or fall in judicial vacancy rates. In 1980, vacancy rates were significantly reduced by the Senate confirming a high percentage of nominees. Conversely, in 1996, low confirmation rates led to an increase in judicial vacancies. The Senate's low confirmation rates in 1996 led to an increase in judicial vacancies, with only 18.2% of President Clinton's circuit court nominees and 46.2% of his district court nominees being confirmed. This was the lowest confirmation rate in presidential election years from 1980 to 2008. In 1984, judicial vacancies increased significantly despite a high confirmation rate for nominees. This was due to the enactment of federal judgeship legislation authorizing new judgeships, leaving little time for nominations and Senate consideration. During the 1980 to 2008 presidential election years, low confirmation rates did not always coincide with an increase in judicial vacancies. In 2008, despite confirming only 23.5% of pending circuit nominees, the circuit court vacancy rate decreased from 7.8% to 6.7% by year's end. Similar trends were seen in 2000 and 2004. This analysis provides historical context for the Senate's processing of judicial nominations in 2012. The report analyzes U.S. circuit court and district court nominations confirmed by the Senate in presidential election years since 1980. It raises the question of how past practices should guide the Senate's handling of judicial nominations in the current election year. The Senate's consideration of past election years may raise specific issues, such as which periods are most relevant and whether the majority party alignment matters. The Senate's consideration of past election years may raise specific issues, such as whether the Senate and the President being of the same political party affects the processing of judicial nominations. Other relevant considerations include the number of vacant judgeships, judicial emergency classifications, and the timing of confirming circuit or district court nominees. The Senate's consideration of judicial nominations in past election years may be influenced by factors such as the number of vacant judgeships, judicial emergencies, and bipartisan home state Senator support for nominees. These considerations could impact whether the Senate follows established customs or deviates from them."
