Congress finds that over 158 million Americans use dietary supplements, with consumer spending reaching $17.1 billion in 2000. The FDA predicts continued growth in supplement use due to factors like aging populations and advances in science. The DSHEA was enacted in 1994 to regulate dietary supplements. DSHEA, enacted in 1994, regulates dietary supplements by ensuring truthful, non-misleading, and substantiated claims on labels. It sets manufacturing standards for potency, purity, and safety of ingredients. The FDA has updated its system for reporting adverse events related to dietary supplements. DSHEA provides authorities to remove unsafe supplements from the market and created the Office of Dietary Supplements for research and consumer information. The FDA has not effectively enforced DSHEA and requires more resources for implementation. The FDA has received additional funds beyond the President's budget to enforce DSHEA, totaling $9,700,000 in 2003. However, the FDA states that full implementation of DSHEA would require between $24,000,000 and $65,000,000 annually. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION AND APPROPRIATION OF RESOURCES.

The Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health is allocated $30,000,000 for 2006 and additional funds for 2007 to 2010 for research and consumer information development.
