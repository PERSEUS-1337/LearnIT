    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Health Equity and Access under the Law for Immigrant Women and Families Act of 2017\" or the \"HEAL for Immigrant Women and Families Act of 2017\". The purpose of the Act is outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that insurance coverage reduces health disparities by alleviating cost barriers to preventive health services, especially for low-income and underserved populations, including immigrant women who face legal restrictions on obtaining coverage. Lack of insurance contributes to disparities in health outcomes for immigrants and their families, particularly for reproductive-age women. Immigrant women face barriers to affordable health insurance coverage, impacting their sexual, reproductive, and maternal health outcomes. Denying coverage hinders their ability to take responsibility for their health and economic well-being. Access to healthcare, including family planning services, is essential for their full participation in society. The immigrant population in the United States is expected to continue growing. In the United States, one in four children is part of an immigrant family, making it important to remove legal barriers to affordable health insurance coverage based on immigration status. DACA recipients are excluded from health insurance coverage despite being authorized to live and work in the country. New immigration categories may be created for individuals with federally authorized presence. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that individuals with federally authorized presence are treated as lawfully present in the United States for eligibility in federally funded health care programs. SEC. 3. Removing barriers to health coverage for lawfully present individuals. Medicaid payment will be made for care and services provided to lawfully present aliens who meet eligibility requirements, regardless of aid receipt under certain programs. In Medicaid, changes are made to provide medical assistance to aliens under certain categories, including lawful residents and those lawfully present. The CHIP program also includes provisions for care and services for lawfully present aliens meeting eligibility requirements. The amendment to the Social Security Act expands coverage for lawfully present individuals under the CHIP program. The effective date for these changes is upon enactment of the Act, with a 90-day transition period for services to be implemented. State legislation is required for the plan to meet additional requirements imposed by the amendments. The State plan will not be considered non-compliant solely for failing to meet these requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's session. If a State has a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session. SEC. 4. CONSISTENCY IN HEALTH COVERAGE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH FEDERALLY AUTHORIZED PRESENCE, INCLUDING DEFERRED ACTION. For eligibility under certain provisions, individuals with federally authorized presence in the US other than as nonimmigrants are considered lawfully present. This includes eligibility for healthcare exchanges, reduced cost-sharing, premium subsidies, and Medicaid/CHIP. Effective date is specified. The Act specifies the effective date for individuals with federally authorized presence in the US to qualify for subsidies under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Services will establish a special enrollment period for individuals with federally authorized presence in the US to enroll in qualified health plans through Exchanges and qualify for subsidies under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The special enrollment period must begin within 90 days of the Act's enactment, and the Secretary retains the authority to establish additional special enrollment periods."
