Arrangements can be made for the shipment of potential nuclear weapons. The Task Force, established within the Department of Energy, can quickly access capabilities from federal departments and international organizations to arrange for the shipment of potential nuclear weapons materials to ensure national security objectives are met. Funds are provided to upgrade security at sites where materials will remain for an extended period. The Secretary of Energy, in coordination with other agencies, must submit a report to Congress listing priority sites for removing nuclear materials and an inventory of sites with highly-enriched uranium or plutonium, assessing terrorism and proliferation risks. The Secretary of Energy, along with other agencies, must provide a report to Congress identifying priority sites for removing nuclear materials and assessing terrorism and proliferation risks. The report should include recommendations on legislative actions or international agreements needed to achieve the Task Force's mission, along with a strategic plan and cost estimates for completing the mission. The Secretary of Energy must submit a report to Congress on priority sites for removing potential nuclear weapons material and assessing terrorism risks.
