A new program called the VXX Presidential Helicopter Program was proposed as a successor. The Navy issued a stop-work order and terminated the main contract for the VH-71 program. The Administration's proposed termination of the VH-71 program in the FY2010 DOD budget has sparked debate in Congress. The decision could impact DOD funding, helicopter replacements, and the industrial base. Presidential helicopters are operated by the Marine Corps in HMX-1 for safe transportation of high-profile individuals. Presidential helicopters, operated by the Marine Corps in HMX-1, provide safe transportation for high-profile individuals, including the president. Equipped with self-defense features and specialized communication systems, these helicopters are essential for carrying out critical command functions. The existing fleet includes 19 helicopters, with upgrades such as new rotor blades and improved communications. The presidential helicopter program is conducting a service life assessment program to maintain aging VH-3 and VH-60 helicopters in the fleet. Upgrades are being made to the cockpit of the VH-60, and structural issues are being addressed. The program is assessing what needs to be done to extend the life of the helicopters past 2018-2019. The VH-71 program, which started in the late-1990s, received approval for various documents and milestones in the early 2000s to provide replacement helicopters with an initial operational capability by FY2009. The VH-71 program received milestone approval in January 2005 with a sense of urgency due to security concerns post-9/11. The Navy led the acquisition program, aiming to field a new presidential helicopter quickly. The VH-71 program, previously known as the VXX program, involved industry teams led by Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin competing to provide a new presidential helicopter. Sikorsky proposed the S-92 helicopter, while Lockheed Martin offered the EH-101 made by AugustaWestland. The competition garnered attention for pitting a U.S. helicopter against a European design. On January 28, 2005, John Young announced Lockheed as the winner. Lockheed-led team won the VH-71 program competition over Sikorsky bid. EH-101 was chosen for meeting operational requirements on time and at a lower cost. Critics questioned the award decision due to foreign companies involved. Lockheed Martin System Integration (LMSI) is the prime contractor for the program. Major subcontractors include AugustaWestland and Bell Helicopter. Lockheed Martin won the VH-71 program competition over Sikorsky. General Electric is a major subcontractor for engines on the VH-71 helicopter. Lockheed Martin is revamping its missile-making Electronic Systems unit, potentially resulting in job losses. Lockheed Martin is restructuring its operations, with the ground-vehicle business moving to Dallas and the rest of Owego's business becoming part of the Maritime Systems and Sensors division. The company cut nearly 1,000 jobs at its Owego operations due to canceled weapons systems. The VH-71 program aims to provide 23 new presidential helicopters to replace the existing fleet. The VH-71 program aims to provide new presidential helicopters to replace the existing fleet. The program includes Increment I and Increment II helicopters, with a total of 34 government-funded helicopters planned. Increment I helicopters are near-term replacements, while Increment II helicopters fully meet requirements and enter service later. The VH-71 program includes 26 Increment II helicopters for operational service, with additional industry-funded test aircraft. Initially, plans included retrofitting four pilot production Increment I helicopters to Increment II standard, but this was later changed. The VH-71 program was changed to purchase 23 new Increment II helicopters instead of retrofitting four pilot production Increment I helicopters. The program is funded through the Navy's research and development appropriation account and the Navy's aircraft procurement appropriation account. The Navy requested $1,047.8 million for the program in FY2009. The Navy requested $1,047.8 million for the VH-71 program in FY2009, but Congress only appropriated $835.0 million. The FY2010 budget proposed $85.2 million for the program, with $55.2 million for Increment I termination, $30 million for VXX successor studies. As of April 10, 2009, about $3.3 billion had been obligated for the VH-71 program. The VH-71 program had an estimated total acquisition cost that grew from $6.5 billion in 2005 to $13.0 billion in 2008. This cost included $9.9 billion in RDT&E funding and $2.9 billion in procurement funding. The VH-71 program's estimated total acquisition cost grew from $6.5 billion in 2005 to $13.0 billion in 2008, with $9.9 billion in RDT&EN funding, $2.9 billion in APN funding, and $200 million in MilCon funding. A Nunn-McCurdy breach occurred due to the cost overrun, triggering a notification to Congress and potential program cancellation. The VH-71 program experienced significant schedule delays and cost growth, leading to a Nunn-McCurdy breach in late-January 2009. Original milestones for achieving operational capability were delayed by several years, with Increment I IOC slipping to mid-FY2012, Increment II IOC to late-FY2019, and FOC to late FY2021. Observers attribute cost growth and schedule delays in the VH-71 program to its aggressive original schedule, driven by the urgent need to replace 19 existing presidential helicopters. As of June 17, 2009, the status of the nine Increment I aircraft included completion of industry-funded test vehicle TV-4 and government-funded TV-3, TV-2, and TV-5 being used as air-quality trainers at Patuxent River, MD. The VH-71 program involved testing aircraft for handling characteristics and vibration. PP-2 and PP-5 were at Patuxent for test flights, while PP-1, PP-3, and PP-4 were in Owego for missionization. A 2009 GAO report noted technology and design maturity in the program. The Communication and Subsystem Processing Embedded Resource Communication Controller, part of the VH-71 program, has been tested in a lab but not in a realistic environment. 90% of Increment I engineering drawings were released by May 2008. Increment II lacks critical technologies, with 50% of designs expected to be common. Increment II will feature a larger blade with a new design, requiring a 30% scale-up. Production for Increment I is ongoing, but concurrent design, production, and testing pose program risks. Metrics for production evaluation have been identified, but specific targets have not been set. The VH-71 program faced quality concerns with initial aircraft, including foreign object debris, but these issues are only significant due to the high standards of a presidential aircraft. The program office is currently flight testing two Increment I aircraft, with delivery of the first missionized test article expected in April 2009. The program began with a compressed schedule after the 9/11 attacks, leading to confusion regarding specifications. The VH-71 program faced challenges with a compressed schedule, leading to confusion regarding specifications and increased program risk. Cost estimates were inaccurate, resulting in a Nunn-McCurdy breach expected in January 2009. Increment II is being restructured due to funding instability, with budget reductions slowing program progress. A stop work order has been in place since December 2007, and funding for Increment II was recommended to be $212 million less than requested in the 2009 Defense Appropriation Act. The VH-71 program faced challenges with a compressed schedule and inaccurate cost estimates, leading to a Nunn-McCurdy breach. Increment II funding was recommended $212 million less than requested, causing a further 18-month delay and $640 million in cost growth. Increment I aircraft have a short service life of 1,500 hours compared to Increment II's 10,000-hour service life, with remedies to extend Increment I's use taking about 4 years to implement. The VH-71 program lacks fail-safe design elements and faces challenges with an accelerated schedule. President Obama criticized the program in 2009, calling it an example of a flawed procurement process. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recommended terminating the VH-71 program as part of the Administration's FY2010 defense budget proposal, emphasizing the need for reform in military equipment acquisition to stay technologically advanced and cost-effective. To improve defense acquisition programs, it is essential to ensure reasonable requirements and mature technology, realistically estimate costs, provide budget stability, adequately staff acquisition teams, guard against requirements creep, validate technology maturity, fund programs to independent cost estimates, and demand stricter contract terms. Following these steps will lead to significant performance improvements. Fully reforming defense acquisition requires recognizing the challenges of today's battlefield and the need for greater urgency and agility in the acquisition system. There is a consensus on the necessity for reform in the Department of Defense, with a call for action rather than more studies or rhetoric. Now is the time for action to reform defense acquisition. It is recommended to terminate the VH-71 presidential helicopter program due to cost overruns and delays. Buying only the lower capability option is not advisable. Options for a follow-on program in FY11 will be developed. The FY2010 budget proposes terminating the VH-71 program due to cost overruns and delays. The program is six years behind schedule, with costs exceeding $13 billion. The Government Accountability Office and Congressional Research Service have raised concerns about future costs. The Administration suggests cancelling the current program, reviewing requirements, and establishing a new program. The Administration proposes to cancel the VH-71 program due to cost overruns and delays, and establish a new Presidential Helicopter replacement program. Funding in 2010 will cover termination costs and efforts to develop options for a new program. Ashton Carter issued a memorandum directing the cancellation of the VH-71 program, with the Navy issuing a stop-work order the same day. The Air Systems Command Contracting Office directed a stop-work order on VH-71 Systems Design and Demonstration activities, except for security requirements. This was due to cost growth exceeding Nunn-McCurdy act thresholds, leading to the cancellation of the program. The Navy will develop options for a new presidential helicopter replacement program. The Navy terminated the VH-71 program due to cost growth exceeding thresholds, leading to the cancellation of the System Development and Design contract. Options are being considered for legacy presidential helicopters and a replacement program. The Navy terminated the VH-71 program due to cost growth, leading to the cancellation of the System Development and Design contract with Lockheed Martin Systems Integration\u2014Owego. The program was intended to replace presidential helicopters, with estimated liability costs for termination at $555 million. The Navy terminated the VH-71 program due to cost growth, with estimated termination liability costs of $555 million. $150 million was allocated for Increment II, and $55.2 million for Increment I to cover termination costs. Lockheed has already built some VH-71 aircraft, and the Navy is considering options such as sales to interested parties or contractor buy-back. The Administration's proposed successor VXX Presidential Helicopter Program is not yet defined. Secretary Gates suggested procuring two different presidential helicopters - one for regular use and one for escape, due to feasibility concerns. The Navy is exploring options for the next-generation presidential helicopter, known as VXX, after the VH-71 program was canceled. All options, including the H-92 from Sikorsky, are being considered. Navy leadership is casting a wide net to assess and narrow down feasible choices. The Navy is actively working on exploring options for the next-generation presidential helicopter, VXX. The acquisition and requirements communities are conducting a quick analysis of alternatives process to narrow down feasible options. The findings will be reported to senior leaders for further assessment. The Pentagon is considering a replacement program for Marine One, aiming to have new helicopters in the fleet by 2019. The cost of the next U.S. presidential helicopter program is expected to be less than the canceled $13 billion VH-71 program. Pentagon Press Secretary Geoff Morrell stated that options are being reviewed, with a goal to field the new helicopters by 2020. The follow-on program is still in the initial stages of development, with options being considered that do not exceed $20 billion. The Pentagon is considering a replacement program for Marine One with a cost expected to be less than the canceled $13 billion VH-71 program. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell stated that options are being reviewed, aiming to field new helicopters by 2020. Morrell emphasized that a $20 billion cost for the program is not true and completing all 23 helicopters would cost $8 billion. He also mentioned that the current helicopters are not suitable for the presidential fleet. The Navy plans to extend the service lives of aging presidential helicopters instead of pursuing the costly VH-71 program. The estimated cost to complete the VH-71 aircraft was over $2 billion, with costs continuing to rise. The new program aims to be more cost-effective and has already ruled out high-cost approaches. The Navy will extend the current mission aircraft at a cost of approximately $500 million to provide 19 mission capable aircraft until the replacement program can be fielded. The first increment of VH-71 aircraft were not intended for long-term service and do not meet full operational requirements, requiring significant technical modifications and restructuring of the contract. The Navy has found that investing in an interim solution like increment 1 for the replacement presidential helicopter program is not feasible due to technical shortfalls and structural modifications needed. The Navy's budget request includes funds to terminate the program and start developing a new one. An analysis of alternatives study will be conducted to determine the best way forward, with solid projections of cost and schedule for each option. In August, the Navy completed an initial capabilities document for VXX, establishing preferred values for the new program. The Navy terminated the interim solution for the presidential helicopter program due to technical shortfalls and budget constraints. An analysis of alternatives study will determine the best way forward for the VXX program, with a focus on cost and schedule projections. The VXX replacement must meet mission requirements and be maintainable for a 40-year lifecycle. The VXX replacement for the presidential helicopter program must be maintainable and upgradeable over its 40-year lifecycle. Analysis identified capability gaps in platform, interior, and communications systems, with key metrics including passenger seats, engine operability, mission ranges, and availability rate. Technological advancements are needed to address these gaps as non-materiel approaches are insufficient. The analysis identified capability gaps in platform, interior, and communications systems for the VXX replacement presidential helicopter program. Non-materiel solutions are no longer effective due to technological limitations and aging platforms. Materiel approaches, such as the Product Improvement Program, are recommended to address these gaps. The analysis identified capability gaps in platform, interior, and communications systems for the VXX replacement presidential helicopter program. Three viable materiel approaches have been recommended to resolve these gaps: Product Improvement Program, Non-developmental Approach, and Research and Development (R&D). An update to the previous AoA is warranted due to the evolution of required capabilities. Several potential airframe options are being considered. Several potential airframe options are being considered for new presidential helicopters, including a new \"clean sheet\" design, existing military or civilian helicopters, and the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft. The Pentagon has begun outlining a new presidential helicopter program, with the possibility of a fleet consisting of a single type or multiple types like the current fleet. Acquisition chief Ashton Carter aims to have an acquisition strategy in place for the program. Acquisition chief Ashton Carter aims to have an acquisition strategy in place for the new presidential helicopter program by spring. The Pentagon and White House are considering 17 program approaches, including options for range, payload, and number of passengers. They are also exploring the use of different types of helicopters and varying aircraft numbers, with a preference for adapting an existing helicopter. Carter highlighted the need for a program that would cost significantly less than the canceled VH-71 program. The Navy explored various options for the presidential helicopter program, including a new VXX acquisition program, continuing with the VH-71 program with restructuring, upgrading existing helicopters, or delaying a new program for several years to save costs. The Navy explored options for the presidential helicopter program, including a new VXX program with a competition between contractors and estimated costs of $10 billion to $17 billion. The Navy estimated the acquisition cost of a new VXX program at $10 billion to $17 billion, excluding sunk costs of the VH-71 program. This estimate included reviewing operational requirements, conducting a new AOA, and maintaining two contractors through PDR. The option would procure 23 Increment II aircraft, aiming for IOC in late FY2019 and FOC in late FY2021 to meet operational requirements in the VH-71 ORD. The potential net cost for this option was estimated at $13 billion or more. The VH-71 program has incurred sunk costs of over $3 billion, with a potential net cost of around $10 billion going forward. This estimate does not include expenses for maintaining existing presidential helicopters, reducing weight of Increment I aircraft, additional support costs, and effects of recent decisions. The Navy plans to procure 18 Increment I aircraft, with a total fleet of 23 aircraft expected to achieve IOC in mid-2012 and FOC in late FY2019. The Navy estimates that the aircraft might achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in mid-2012 and Full Operational Capability (FOC) in late FY2019, with an estimated acquisition cost of $9.4 billion. This cost includes Increment II termination costs and sunk costs on the VH-71 program of over $3 billion, leaving a potential net cost going forward of less than $6.4 billion. There is a variation option to procure 14 additional Increment I aircraft and combine them with the five pilot production Increment I aircraft to produce an Increment I fleet. The Navy is considering a cost-saving option to upgrade and extend the service lives of the existing presidential helicopters, avoiding the procurement of new aircraft. This option would involve upgrading 19 existing helicopters, with the VH-60Ns having their service lives extended to 12,000 flight hours and the VH-3Ds to 16,000 flight hours. This would provide several more years of operation without pursuing a new acquisition program for presidential helicopters in the near future. The Navy is considering upgrading and extending the service lives of existing presidential helicopters to save costs. The estimated cost for this option is $4.4 billion, including termination costs and sunk costs of over $3 billion. Congress must decide whether to terminate the VH-71 program and start a new one or pursue a different course, considering operational requirements for presidential helicopters. The Navy is considering upgrading and extending the service lives of existing presidential helicopters to save costs. The estimated cost for this option is $4.4 billion, including termination costs and sunk costs of over $3 billion. Congress must decide whether to terminate the VH-71 program and start a new one or pursue a different course, considering operational requirements for presidential helicopters, including costs, capabilities, IOC and FOC dates, development risks, and implications for the helicopter industrial base. The Navy is considering upgrading existing presidential helicopters to save costs. A successor VXX program could incorporate best practices in acquisition, review operational requirements, and promote competition for cost-effective solutions. Increment I helicopters may not fully meet future operational requirements, leading to the need for new replacement helicopters. The Navy is considering upgrading existing presidential helicopters to save costs. Supporters of alternatives argue that terminating the VH-71 program would waste over $3 billion in sunk costs. Continuing the VH-71 program with Increment II aircraft is seen as the option with the lowest risk for meeting operational requirements. A new VXX program could be as costly as continuing the VH-71 program. A new VXX program could be as costly as continuing the VH-71 program, with new helicopters entering service later than Increment II. The 19 existing presidential helicopters may need to be kept in service longer, as their ability to accept future upgrades is uncertain. Past successful upgrades do not guarantee feasibility or cost-effectiveness of additional upgrades. Operational requirements for presidential helicopters are unlikely to change significantly from the VH-71 ORD. A new VXX helicopter program may not differ significantly from the VH-71 ORD requirements, with potential delays in IOC and FOC. Increment I helicopters could be cost-effective compromises, meeting some operational requirements and allowing for upgrades to meet more in the future. Congress may need to consider alternatives to the VH-71 program, such as a restructured VH-71 program or VXX programs based on alternate airframes. The DOD's understanding of potential alternatives to the VH-71 program, including costs, operational capabilities, and development risks, was questioned when the program was proposed for cancellation. President Obama's criticism of the VH-71 program raised concerns about the decision-making process for the proposed FY2010 defense budget. The VH-71 program faced potential cancellation, leading to questions about cost growth, schedule delays, and decision-making processes. Congress was concerned about causes such as low initial cost estimates, requirements growth, technology maturity, schedule compression, and unclear lines of authority. The Navy's FY2010 budget included $85.2 million for the VH-71 program, with $55.2 million allocated for Increment I. The VH-71 program faced potential cancellation due to excessive cost growth and schedule delays. The FY2010 budget allocated $85.2 million, with $55.2 million for Increment I and $30 million for initial studies on the proposed successor VXX program. The Administration's funding request for the VH-71 program was approved in the conference report on H.R. 2647 / P.L. 111-84. The VH-71 program faced cancellation due to cost growth and schedule delays. The Secretary of Defense issued a stop-work order, and the Navy canceled the System Development and Design contract. Despite investing over $3.0 billion, little progress was made, and the requirements system failed to address obstacles. The Navy's acquisition program faced challenges due to lack of support and resources from the OSD and WHMO. Despite warnings, Navy officials were directed to follow a schedule-driven program, leading to cost estimates of $10.0 billion to $17.0 billion. The conferees urge the Department of Defense and Executive Branch to explore all alternatives for the acquisition program. The conferees urge the Department of Defense and Executive Branch to consider a range of alternatives for the Presidential helicopter program, including single- and multi-platform solutions. They emphasize the importance of evaluating costs and complying with the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009. The House Armed Services Committee recommends approving $85.2 million in FY2010 RDT&E funding for the VH-71 program, which was recently terminated due to excessive cost growth and schedule delays. The committee expresses disappointment in the Navy's $3.3 billion investment in the program and criticizes the lack of support from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the White House Military Office. The committee supports a new acquisition plan for Presidential transport, suggesting the Department of Defense consider continuing procurement of the current helicopter for normal transport and studying other alternatives for different situations. The estimated cost for a new acquisition program is $10.0 to $17.0 billion. The committee supports a new acquisition plan for Presidential transport, suggesting the Department of Defense consider continuing procurement of the current helicopter for normal transport and studying other alternatives for different situations. The FY2010 defense authorization bill recommends approving $85.2 million in funding for the VH-71 program. The House and Senate passed the bill on December 19, 2009, as P.L. 111-118, which allocated funds for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2010. The explanatory statement included $130.0 million for VHXX Executive Helo Development, with an increase for technology capture and a decrease for termination costs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $485.2 million for the VH-71 Presidential Helicopter, an increase of $400 million over the request, to operationalize and incorporate five helicopters into the current fleet. The Committee included $400 million above the President's request to make the five Increment I VH-71 Presidential helicopters operational. The Future Year's Defense Plan proposed $328 million for FY 2010 and $140 million for FY 2011 to make the VH-71 Presidential helicopters operational. The Navy has invested over $3.2 billion in the program, which was canceled in 2009. The Navy has not provided a plan for the five aircraft intended for interim service. The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit a progress report on making the helicopters operational within 30 days. The report on VH-71 Presidential helicopters must be submitted to congressional defense committees within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends a reduction of $55.2 million for termination costs. Rescissions in funding for RDT&EN are specified in H.R. 2346, with the House and Senate proposing different amounts. The funding for the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Navy (RDT&EN) appropriation account includes a rescission of $47 million in FY2009 funding for the VH-71 program. Section 309 of H.R. 2346 / P.L. 111-32 rescinds $217.06 million in FY2009 and FY2010 RDT&EN funding. Excerpts from a May 19, 2009, hearing on FY2010 Navy aviation programs are presented in this appendix. Representative Gene Taylor addressed the failed VH-71 program, questioning the fate of the delivered aircraft assets and how to avoid past mistakes in future programs. In the question-and-answer portion, Courtney sought responses on the presidential helicopter. Secretary Gates announced the cancellation of the presidential helicopter program due to cost overruns and failure to meet requirements. The program was originally budgeted at $6 billion but was heading towards $13 billion and was six years overdue. The need for a new helicopter remains, but the previous program was deemed unsuitable by the White House. The cancellation of the presidential helicopter program was due to cost overruns and failure to meet requirements. Undersecretary Defense Carter directed the cancellation of the program, and plans are being made to develop a new program within 30 days. The need for a new helicopter remains, and efforts are being made to meet the direction for a presidential replacement helicopter program. The current discussion focuses on the need for a replacement helicopter program for carrying the president. The existing VH-3 and VH-60 helicopters are aging and will need to be replaced soon. The budget includes funds for this purpose, and efforts are being made to understand the requirements and impacts of the new program. The discussion revolves around the need for a new replacement helicopter program for the president, focusing on the VH-3 and VH-60 helicopters. Efforts are being made to determine the requirements and transition them to the acquisition community for a new replacement. There are concerns about the sunk costs in the current VH-71 program, but options to recoup some of the investment are being considered to address taxpayer concerns. Trautman explains the steps taken to bring closure to the current helicopter program, including issuing stop work orders and assessing investments to understand funding status. The focus is on recouping investments and addressing taxpayer concerns. The focus is on understanding funding status and investments in ongoing technology for future programs, particularly in helicopter programs. The goal is to meet mission requirements and take advantage of technological investments moving forward. Mr. Bartlett from Maryland questions the need for upgrading the current fleet of helicopters after $3.2 billion was spent on the VH-71 program to replace the legacy fleet. The Navy originally cited urgent reasons for replacement due to weight, weather capability, range, speed, and payload limitations. Now, there is a shift in perspective suggesting the current fleet can be upgraded at a potentially high cost. Congress is questioning the decision to continue using the 35-year-old legacy fleet of helicopters instead of fielding the modern VH-71 helicopters that were already paid for. Concerns include the lack of airframe fatigue testing and the short service life claim for the new helicopters. Congress feels ignored and seeks real answers before considering the budget request. The Navy's decision to issue a stop-work order on the new aircraft for the president has raised concerns in Congress. Questions are being raised about the costs involved in continuing with the current legacy fleet, the need for service life extension, and the lack of necessary improvements. Congress seeks clarification on the situation before considering the budget request. The Navy issued a stop-work order on the new presidential aircraft, prompting concerns in Congress about costs, service life extension, and necessary improvements. General Trautman acknowledges that the VH-71 Increment 1 aircraft is more capable than the current VH-3, but it does not meet the requirements set by the White House military office. Increment 1 of the new presidential aircraft, VH-71, is deficient in payload capability, speed, and range. The reason for moving away from the current fleet was to have better communication capabilities. Shutting down the project would cost $3.2 billion, with additional costs to the industry and Navy. It would cost $1.3 billion to make five of the nine planes ready for presidential use. Manufacturer estimates suggest each plane could be made ready for roughly $100 million. The manufacturer offers to deliver 14 additional VH-71 planes for $100 million each, totaling a fleet of 19 planes. The cost for nineteen planes is small compared to the investment made so far. The General highlights the challenging requirements and underestimated developmental efforts for the VH-71 project. Increment 1 of the VH-71 program is not meeting requirements, leading to a recommendation for cancellation. The analysis suggesting its superiority over the current fleet is no longer valid due to operational issues and additional weight affecting the aircraft's lifespan. The VH-71 Increment 1 did not meet requirements, leading to a recommendation for cancellation from Secretary Gates. The original five-year lifespan was insufficient, and a service life extension program is needed to ensure a 30-40 year lifespan for the aircraft."
