    "content": "In the United States, concerns have emerged about the resilience and security of the nation's electric power system, particularly regarding the cybersecurity of the electricity grid. The grid is controlled by a combination of older legacy systems and newer technologies, with a focus on protecting the integrity of the system as it is modernized. The modernization of the electric grid with new \"intelligent\" technologies using advanced communications and digital advantages may increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. Cybersecurity is a major focus for the energy sector, with reported incidents of cyber intrusions on the U.S. grid on the rise. Minimum security standards may not be sufficient to protect the system. The electric grid is vulnerable to cyberattacks, and current cybersecurity standards are insufficient. The system is interconnected with other critical infrastructure sectors, and only a few sectors have mandatory cybersecurity standards. The report will focus on the bulk power system overseen by FERC, highlighting the need for more effective cybersecurity measures beyond basic compliance with standards. The electric utility business involves generating and transmitting electricity to users through the electrical grid. Further congressional action may be needed for effective cybersecurity protections in this sector. The infrastructure includes generating stations, transformers, and transmission lines to deliver power to homes and businesses. Regulatory regimes may impact the security of these system elements. The electrical grid relies on various IC systems to control and monitor its components, including electronic devices, switches, and circuit breakers. These systems can be controlled by companies under state or federal jurisdiction and may be connected to the Internet or rely on local area networks for operation. These IC systems manage power plant controls, transformer yard functions, and power bus operations. The IC systems in the electrical grid manage power plant controls, transformer yard functions, transmission system, and distribution substations. These systems operate in a control loop, adjusting actuators or sending alerts in case of disturbances. SCADA systems are used for remote grid operations. SCADA systems are highly distributed systems used for centralized monitoring and control of field sites over long-distance communications networks. Field devices control local operations and monitor the environment for alarm conditions. Adopted since the 1970s, SCADA systems focus on function and reliability. SCADA systems, adopted since the 1970s, were historically not connected to centralized networks. Over time, many legacy SCADA systems have been modified and connected to the Internet, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks due to lack of security features. These systems may be susceptible to intrusion through data reporting pathways or attacks like the Stuxnet worm. Distributed control systems (DCSs) in power plants use Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) for process control. Communication in DCS or PLC networks needs to be reliable and fast compared to SCADA systems due to process control functions. The aging electrical grid and pipeline distribution systems in the United States are facing challenges due to limited maintenance, permitting issues, and weather events. Despite increased investment in power transmission, there are concerns about the reliability of the system. Plans for additional high-voltage transmission lines and oil and gas pipelines are in place, but permitting and siting issues may hinder their completion. The demand for energy is expected to increase after 2020, posing a greater challenge for the population. Congress supports grid modernization in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to maintain a reliable and secure electricity infrastructure. The Smart Grid incorporates new IT systems and communication capabilities to improve reliability, security, and efficiency. The Smart Grid enhances the efficiency and cybersecurity of the electric grid through dynamic optimization of operations and resources. It utilizes \"smart\" technologies for real-time communication, metering, and distribution automation. Smart Grid networks can integrate renewable energy sources, distributed generation, demand response, and energy efficiency programs, potentially revolutionizing power generation and usage. The Smart Grid has the potential to revolutionize power generation and usage, but it also poses cybersecurity risks. Components of the Smart Grid, controlled by software programming, may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, especially when connected to the Internet. The grid's information processing and communication attributes increase its susceptibility to cyber threats, making it a potential target for attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. The Smart Grid faces cybersecurity risks as hackers find it easy to exploit vulnerabilities in grid computer networks. Renewable electricity generation, while increasing, also presents potential backdoors for cyber attackers to access the grid. Renewable electricity companies in Europe have been targeted by cyber attackers, compromising the communication networks and software linking green energy sources to the grid. The communication networks and software connecting green energy sources to the grid, along with smart meters sending real-time power usage, are new entry points for hackers. Despite security measures, such as encryption and access control, vulnerabilities exist. Smart meters are highlighted as potential targets for fraud and cyberattacks, with concerns about manipulated readings and power outages. Smart meters are vulnerable to cyberattacks due to weak encryption, with concerns about the longevity of their security. It is recommended to update encryption regularly and implement intrusion detection for better network protection. Legacy systems and supply chains are also potential vulnerabilities in Smart Grid hardware and software. New procurement guidance emphasizes cybersecurity considerations throughout the equipment's life cycle. Security of the supply chain for Smart Grid systems is a significant concern during procurement due to the potential compromise or counterfeiting of components. Best practices in supply chain security and resilience need to be shared and explored between IT professionals, supply chain experts, utilities, and suppliers. The increasing frequency of cyber intrusions on critical infrastructure control systems, including power grids, is a worrying trend for the electric utility industry. Several cyber intrusions targeting critical infrastructure control systems, including power grids, have been reported. These intrusions have the capability to disrupt U.S. power grids and water systems. Despite the presence of mandatory cybersecurity standards, some believe that consensus-based standards are not strong enough to address the cybersecurity needs effectively. Additionally, the cost of meeting these standards may outweigh the perceived risks. In October 2014, the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) identified malware on industrial control systems commonly used to control energy flows on the electric grid. BlackEnergy, a Trojan horse malware program, targets industrial control systems, specifically human machine interface software. It is used in Advanced Persistent Threat attacks to gather information. While no disruption attempts were found, the software poses a significant threat due to its ability to target critical energy infrastructure. The BlackEnergy malware is a modular threat that can move through network files and onto removable storage media. It includes modules for keylogging, audio recording, grabbing screenshots, and even destroying hard disks. Hackers use this malware to hide their presence and gather information in Advanced Persistent Threat attacks. The HAVEX malware, targeting the energy sector since at least August 2012, has been modified over time. This new version acts as a Trojan horse to infiltrate and modify legitimate software from ICS and SCADA suppliers. It was used as a remote access tool to extract data from Outlook address books and ICS-related software files. The cyberattack leaves the system seemingly normal but provides a backdoor for potential control over the company's ICS or SCADA. The HAVEX malware, also known as \"Backdoor.Oldrea\" or \"Energetic Bear RAT,\" infiltrated ICS and SCADA systems through various methods like email campaigns, watering hole attacks, and compromised software downloads from ICS vendors. This allowed attackers to potentially control the targeted companies' operations. The HAVEX malware, also known as \"Backdoor.Oldrea\" or \"Energetic Bear RAT,\" is linked to the Dragonfly group, a state-sponsored entity focused on espionage and sabotage. It allows attackers to upload/download files, run executables, collect passwords, take screenshots, and catalog documents. Sandworm, a type of Trojan horse, initially targeted a Windows vulnerability but has since evolved its attack methods. Spear-phishing emails with attachments exploiting vulnerabilities were the primary mode of attack. The Sandworm attack targeted SCADA systems using the BlackEnergy Trojan. The malware focused on GE Intelligent Platform's CIMPLICITY HMI solution suite, which is crucial for SCADA systems. Sandworm's impact could extend to other corporate systems beyond SCADA. The malware targeting SCADA systems through the CIMPLICITY HMI solution suite could potentially spread to other corporate systems. While CIMPLICITY is being used as an attack vector, there is no evidence of manipulation of actual SCADA systems. The attack could target both corporate and control networks, posing a risk to the bulk electric power system, which has mandatory cybersecurity standards enforced by NERC under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. NERC proposes reliability standards for critical infrastructure protection (CIP) for the grid, while FERC established the Office of Energy Infrastructure Security (OEIS) to address cyber and physical security threats. FERC lacks quick authority in major cyber events, and NERC determines mandatory reliability standards for electric industry facilities based on the \"bulk electric system\" definition. FERC has authority over wholesale power sales and interstate electricity transmission, ensuring bulk electric system reliability. NERC determines mandatory reliability standards for electric industry facilities based on the \"bulk electric system\" definition. FERC was concerned that certain facilities crucial for system reliability were not included in NERC's definition. EPACT excludes local distribution systems from the reliability mandate under Section 215 of the Federal Power Act. In 2010, FERC directed NERC to develop uniform criteria for determining necessary facilities for the interconnected transmission network. FERC approved NERC's revised criteria and new definition of the Bulk Electric System (BES) in 2012, which includes Transmission Elements operated at 100 kV or higher. This definition excludes facilities used in local distribution of electric energy but allows for potential inclusion of some distribution level facilities if necessary for system operation. The current iteration of NERC's standards, CIP Version 5, aims to enhance system security by considering the protection of distribution facilities below the bright-line threshold. This is crucial as these areas could serve as potential entry points for cyber intrusions into the grid. The focus is shifting towards actively addressing security needs rather than just compliance with regulations. The CIP Version 5 standards classify power facilities into High, Medium, and Low impact categories, bringing all BES generating facilities into scope for cybersecurity requirements. Cyber assets are grouped based on facility characteristics, with larger plants receiving a Medium impact rating and black-start units classified as Low impact. All systems must comply with at least a portion of the standards. CIP Version 5 introduces new criteria and requirements for bulk electric system (BES) Cyber Systems, mandating compliance based on impact ratings. It includes encryption of grid signals, \"role-based\" classifications, monitoring of remote access, multiple-factor authentication, and incident response plans for physical security of BES assets. The implementation of CIP Version 5 introduces new requirements for securing bulk electric system (BES) cyber assets, including encryption, role-based classifications, and incident response plans. Concerns have been raised about the potential high cost of compliance, especially for facilities that were not previously designated as cyber assets. Cooperation between the federal government and the electric power sector has expanded, but there have been challenges in awareness and communication. The federal government has been developing the capability to detect cyber intrusions on private critical infrastructure company networks since 2010 through the Perfect Citizen program. The FY2016 budget proposes $14 billion in cybersecurity funding for critical initiatives and research. The Department of Energy (DOE) houses voluntary initiatives and programs for electric sector cybersecurity. The Department of Energy (DOE) leads in electric sector cybersecurity, considering it crucial for delivering essential services. In 2009, Congress directed DOE to establish a national energy sector cybersecurity organization to enhance the security of the electric grid and smart grid technology integration. The Department of Energy (DOE) established the National Electric Sector Cybersecurity Organization (NESCO) with EnergySec and EPRI to improve the cybersecurity posture of the electric sector through information sharing and research. NESCO aims to enhance grid security by fostering collaboration among cybersecurity experts and developing the Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2) as a self-evaluation tool. The Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (ES-C2M2) is a self-evaluation survey tool tailored for the electricity subsector to assess cybersecurity control implementation. It is based on the C2M2 survey and includes a maturity model and evaluation tool. Additionally, the DOE released a roadmap in 2006 for developing a resilient energy delivery system capable of surviving cyber incidents. The plan outlined a 10-year timeline for grid cybersecurity, focusing on barriers and strategies. A five-year update in 2011 discussed achievements and ongoing efforts. DHS coordinates national efforts to protect critical infrastructure, including the grid, through initiatives under the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). NPPD works with partners to enhance cybersecurity, critical infrastructure protection, and resiliency. The Office of Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis (OCIA), Office of Infrastructure Protection (IP), and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&C) focus on cybersecurity, critical infrastructure protection, and resiliency. OCIA conducts modeling and analysis to inform security risk management. IP helps infrastructure owners address risks, providing tools and training. CS&C enhances the security and reliability of cyber and communications infrastructure, prioritizing the reduction of cyber risks from various threats. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) at the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&C) focuses on cyber situational awareness, incident response, and management. It serves as an information sharing forum for public and private sectors to improve understanding of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and incidents, and works to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber incidents that could compromise the nation's critical information technology and communications networks. NCCIC collaborates with federal departments, private sector companies, state and local governments, and international counterparts. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) collaborates with various stakeholders including state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, and international counterparts to protect critical information technology. Two key branches of NCCIC, US-CERT and ICS-CERT, play important roles in electric grid cybersecurity. US-CERT provides expertise in network analysis and distributes timely information to federal departments, agencies, and private sector organizations. Additionally, US-CERT operates the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) for intrusion detection and prevention. ICS-CERT, a branch of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), focuses on providing intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to federal departments and agencies. It aims to reduce risks to critical infrastructure through partnerships and has four main areas of focus: situational awareness, incident response, vulnerability coordination, and cybersecurity partnerships. The system includes the Einstein 2 intrusion detection system, which alerts DHS to malicious network activity in federal executive branch civilian agencies. The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) supports DHS's mission by providing science and technology for security and resiliency efforts, including the Smart Grid. ICS-CERT coordinates responses to control systems-related security incidents and facilitates information sharing among various agencies and organizations. The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) focuses on enhancing the security and resilience of the nation's critical information infrastructure and the Internet. They develop new technologies to defend against cyberattacks and lead cybersecurity research for various stakeholders. This includes initiatives in the electric power sector to ensure resilience in the event of power outages. The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) is working on projects like the Resilient Electric Grid and the Recovery Transformer to enhance the security and resilience of the nation's critical information infrastructure. They are also assessing the state of the Smart Grid concept and developing technologies to ensure Smart Grid security and resiliency in response to evolving cybersecurity threats. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 defined attributes of a Smart Grid and tasked NIST with coordinating its safe and secure development. NIST advocates a defense-in-depth strategy for cybersecurity, emphasizing the importance of determining risk quantified by threat, vulnerability, and consequences. Their Guidelines for Smart Grid Cybersecurity provide a voluntary framework for organizations to develop tailored cybersecurity strategies. The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) Cybersecurity Committee (SGCC) is addressing cybersecurity needs in areas such as Advanced Metering Infrastructure security, cloud computing, supply chain, and privacy recommendations. NIST established the Smart Grid Interoperability to provide foundational cybersecurity guidance and foster collaborations in the smart grid cybersecurity. NIST developed Smart Grid Interoperability guidelines to address cybersecurity risks in the smart grid, following a Presidential Executive Order. The Cybersecurity Framework released in 2014 incorporates industry best practices to reduce cyber risks. Sector-specific federal agencies are required to report annually on critical infrastructure cybersecurity measures. The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, hosted by NIST, focuses on promoting the adoption of secure cybersecurity technologies in both public and private sectors. NERC's Critical Infrastructure Protection Committee oversees physical security and cybersecurity initiatives, with standing subcommittees in these areas. The committee also manages the Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ES-ISAC) to enhance situational awareness and incident management in the electricity sector through information sharing. The ES-ISAC collaborates with DOE and ESCC to share critical information with the electricity sector, enhancing its ability to prepare for and respond to cyber and physical threats. Established in 1998 under Presidential Decision Directive 63, the ES-ISAC allows NERC members to report cyber incidents and receive threat information. The Electricity Sub-Sector Coordinating Council serves as the liaison between the federal government and the electric power sector. The Electricity Sub-Sector Coordinating Council (ESCC) is the principal liaison between the federal government and the electric power sector. It coordinates industry and government efforts on grid security, guides infrastructure investments, improves threat information sharing, and coordinates cross-sector activities with other critical infrastructure sectors. A Senior Executive Working Group (SEWG) supports the ESCC's mission and activities. The ESCC supports industry and government efforts on grid security, forming \"sub teams\" to address goals identified by executives. The industry collaborates with federal agencies on cybersecurity partnerships and information sharing efforts like ES-ISAC, ESSC, and NCCIC. Mandatory standards for critical infrastructure cybersecurity are proposed by NERC and approved (or modified) by FERC, with industry compliance potentially preventing fines. The effectiveness of these standards in ensuring a cybersecure grid is questioned. Existing mandatory standards ensure a cybersecure grid, but recent cyberattacks on SCADA systems highlight potential threats to grid reliability. Despite some believing the risk of a major cyberattack is low, FERC must consider cybersecurity as part of its reliability mandate. NESCO's analysis in 2013 focused on cybersecurity risks for electric utilities, emphasizing the importance of maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability of cyber assets in the electricity subsector. The report categorizes failure scenarios related to the impact on power generation, transmission, and distribution into six domains: AMI, DER, WAMPAC, ET, DR, and DGM, with a generic cross-cutting scenario also identified. Mitigations and prioritization schemes for securing control systems are suggested, focusing on cybersecurity events and not other potential causes of issues. The report outlines a prioritization scheme for securing control systems, listing potential failure scenarios with NESCO teams ranking them based on risk. The scenarios come from various domains, with examples of actions causing breaches and possible mitigations provided. DOE and EPRI issued a voluntary risk assessment based on these cybersecurity failure scenarios. The NESCO, DOE, and EPRI issued a voluntary risk assessment process for utilities to manage risks from cybersecurity failure scenarios. The approach is based on DOE's ES-C2M2 model, focusing on risks from operating IT and IC systems. The electric power industry is primarily in a defensive mode against cybersecurity threats, with a growing emphasis on intrusion detection to detect cyber attackers who may go undetected for years. Collaboration efforts aim to change the electric sector's perspective on cybersecurity. The electric sector is shifting its focus towards cybersecurity, with an emphasis on protecting critical infrastructure from cyber and physical threats. Experts suggest that understanding attackers and their motives is crucial for effective cybersecurity measures. Higher-level cybersecurity postures require looking beyond detecting attacks and focusing on the reasons behind them. The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) uses threat analysts to build effective cyberattack defenses by safeguarding what attackers are after. FS-ISAC has a centralized threat repository for rapid distribution of threat information. The ES-ISAC, for the electricity subsector, lacks the technical capabilities of FS-ISAC in automated information exchange for faster identification and analysis of threats. FS-ISAC has advanced search and analysis capabilities, allowing for greater insights into threat actors. Adoption of faster threat processing technologies in the electric power sector can improve cybersecurity defenses for smaller utilities. NCCIC is working on machine-to-machine sharing of threat data. Renewable electricity in microgrids can resist disruptions from cyberattacks or natural occurrences. Microgrids can enhance resilience against cyberattacks and power outages by providing localized power generation for communities or institutions. The Department of Defense's SPIDERS program aims to secure military installations with distributed generation technologies in case of grid disruptions. The SmartAmerica Challenge initiated by NIST in 2013 aims to address grid vulnerabilities by exploring novel approaches, such as using distributed computing to make the grid more resilient against physical and cyberattacks. This approach is being pursued by the NC State and UNC group within the Smart Energy team to create a distributed computing system that would disseminate control functions to enhance grid resilience. The team is developing a distributed computing system to enhance grid resilience by dispersing monitoring and control functions across multiple virtual machines in a cloud computing network. This approach aims to protect the system from cyberattacks and ensure system reliability for electric utilities. Cyber resiliency involves coordinated activities to respond to and recover from cyber incidents while minimizing costs and business impact. The goal is to ensure system reliability by protecting BES Cyber Assets and Systems under CIP rules. Significant investments may be needed for secure enclosures and protective measures. Electric utilities are concerned about cybersecurity events leading to liability and financial risks. Electric utilities are concerned about cybersecurity liability risks, as adherence to standards may not fully protect them. The American Public Power Association is worried about utilities being vulnerable to negligence claims in the event of cyber attacks. Some states are considering legislation to shield utilities from liability, but no current laws exist for this protection. Congress has previously discussed cybersecurity legislation with liability protections for critical infrastructure. Electric utilities are concerned about cybersecurity liability risks, as no laws have been enacted to grant liability protections to critical infrastructure owners and operators affected by cyber incidents. The industry supports mechanisms for recovering unexpected costs from emergency mitigation actions and seeks liability protections for actions taken under emergency orders. Utility companies may be able to recover costs of cyber and physical security investments in various jurisdictions. Electric utilities may seek recovery of costs from customers in rates filing after a major cyber or physical security attack. Cybersecurity insurance can mitigate losses from cyber incidents, but many companies, including electric utilities, choose not to carry policies due to perceived high costs and confusion about coverage. DHS believes a robust cybersecurity insurance market could reduce successful cyberattacks by promoting preventative measures and best practices. The DHS's NPPD has convened a diverse group of stakeholders to improve the cybersecurity insurance market. Workshops have focused on enhancing the \"first-party\" market for direct losses from cyber incidents. Progress areas include creating a cyber incident data repository, improving consequence analytics, and promoting enterprise risk management. Some electric utilities companies underestimate the risk of a major cyberattack, but insurance industry experts warn that such an event could lead to a catastrophe on par with Exxon Valdez or Deepwater Horizon. Current insurance coverage for utilities only includes minor incidents like data losses, not major events caused by hackers triggering explosions at multiple facilities. This lack of coverage is due to clauses excluding damage from software or malicious code, and is unlikely to change soon. The insurance industry lacks coverage for major cybersecurity events in the electric utility industry due to exclusionary clauses. This is because cybersecurity is not well-understood, making it challenging to design comprehensive products. Large insurance provider Lloyds of London found cybersecurity protection measures too weak for policies to be offered to power companies. Many utilities underestimate the risk of a major cyberattack and prioritize balancing cybersecurity efforts with perceived risks. NERC's CIP Version 5 aims to shift utilities' focus towards providing necessary security levels for BES assets. The focus of utilities is shifting towards providing security for BES assets with different system impacts. Joint federal and industry cybersecurity activities are cooperative, with voluntary adoption of measures. Congressional evaluation may be needed for strategy effectiveness and adoption levels. The grid remains vulnerable to cyber and physical attacks, highlighting the importance of improved cyber intrusion detection measures through government-industry partnerships. Electric utilities are advised to integrate cybersecurity into their strategic planning and operations. Electric utilities need to embrace cybersecurity in their strategic planning to secure the grid from evolving threats like cyber intrusions. Financial investment and staff recruitment for this mission are challenges. SCADA systems infected by worms like HAVEX are vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, posing a concern if originating from a nation-state. Retaliation threats may deter nation-states, but terrorist organizations could exploit these vulnerabilities. The potential use of a worm as a cyber weapon by a terrorist organization could pose a significant threat to the nation's economy. Recovery efforts should be a key part of cybersecurity strategy, alongside securing the system. The energy sector, including the bulk electric system, is subject to critical infrastructure protection rules, but other sectors that support the grid may also need similar standards. This issue may need to be considered by Congress. Congress may need to consider granting FERC more authority to react to cybersecurity threats in real time, especially in light of potential cyberattacks on the grid. The recent redefinition of the Bulk Electric System (BES) may not provide enough protection, particularly at the seams between the BES and distribution systems. Additional standards may be necessary to safeguard the grid effectively. Congress may want to consider ways to help companies deal with the costs of critical infrastructure protection, including standards for facilities connecting to the grid. All BES designated facilities under CIP Version 5 will be covered by new requirements. Congress may also want to look at ways to lessen financial strains on electric utility systems and consider liability protection for electric utilities in the event of a major cyberattack. The insurance coverage for cyberattacks may not cover all damages. Bills related to cybersecurity aim to enhance information sharing between federal and private sector companies. H.R. 1731 proposes multidirectional sharing of cybersecurity information to improve overall cybersecurity. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) can share cyber threat indicators and defensive measures with nonfederal entities. H.R. 234 aims to facilitate real-time sharing of actionable cyber threat information among federal cyber operations centers. The bill H.R. 85 aims to enhance cybersecurity by allowing the federal intelligence community to share threat intelligence with private-sector entities and utilities. It also directs DHS to work with critical infrastructure owners to strengthen security against terrorist attacks and establish terrorism prevention policies. The bill S. 456 aims to strengthen critical infrastructure security and resilience by establishing a Strategic Research Imperatives Program within DHS. It also facilitates the exchange of terrorism threat information and allows private entities to share cyber threat indicators with relevant organizations. The bill S. 456 aims to enhance critical infrastructure security by allowing private entities to share cyber threat indicators with the NCCIC or private organizations, with liability protection for sharing lawfully obtained indicators."
