    "content": "Authorization granted to use Cooperative Threat Reduction funds for projects and activities outside the former Soviet Union. The section authorizes the use of Cooperative Threat Reduction funds for proliferation threat reduction projects outside the former Soviet Union to address emerging threats and achieve US nonproliferation goals. Cooperative Threat Reduction programs include specified programs and any other designated by the Secretary to address proliferation threats in former Soviet states. The section authorizes the use of Cooperative Threat Reduction funds for proliferation threat reduction projects outside the former Soviet Union to address emerging threats and achieve US nonproliferation goals. The Secretary of Defense may use these funds for projects and activities in states outside the former Soviet Union if they contribute to reducing proliferation threats. The Cooperative Threat Reduction funds can be used for projects outside the former Soviet Union to address proliferation threats and achieve US nonproliferation goals. The amount that can be spent on these projects cannot exceed $50,000,000. The funds can be used to provide equipment, goods, and services for the projects but not cash directly. The Secretary must ensure that funds for these projects are sourced from appropriate sources. Activities under subsection (c) are funded by diverting funds from various Cooperative Threat Reduction programs to ensure no single program is the sole source of funds. If funds are obligated in a fiscal year, the President's budget must include a request for an equal amount of Cooperative Threat Reduction funds for the following fiscal year, specifying the programs for which the funds would have been used. The Secretary may only use authorized funds for the Cooperative Threat Reduction program or specified programs. Funds cannot be obligated without a report to Congress detailing the purpose and amount, except in certain circumstances. The Secretary can use authorized funds for the Cooperative Threat Reduction program or specified programs, with exceptions for immediate proliferation threats. Within 72 hours of obligating funds, a detailed report must be submitted to Congress justifying the expenditure. The funds must align with national security interests, contracting process description required, analysis of impact on ongoing programs, need for additional assistance, mechanisms for audits, and congressional oversight. The term \"appropriate congressional officials\" includes key members from various committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress on the possibility of establishing new cooperative threat reduction programs if certain authority is used for two consecutive fiscal years. This report must be submitted along with the Department of Defense budget justification materials."
