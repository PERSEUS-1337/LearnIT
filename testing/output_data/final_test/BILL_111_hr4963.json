    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Healthy Milk and Dairy Choices in Schools Act of 2010\". Congress finds that 44 million Americans have low bone mass or osteoporosis, leading to $19 billion in annual hospital and nursing home expenses. Adequate calcium intake and weight-bearing exercise can help prevent fractures. It is crucial for children to get enough calcium as 98 percent of maximum bone density is reached by age 20. However, a significant percentage of children do not meet current calcium recommendations, with a decline in milk consumption over the past three decades. Children's consumption rates fell sharply from 2005 to 2010, with a further decline as they enter their teenage years. Less than half of school-age children participate in school meal programs, and 87 percent of schools sell sugary drinks on campus. SEC. 3. Amends the fat content of milk in school lunch programs to align with Dietary Guidelines for Americans. SEC. 4. Expands the Special Milk Program. Section 3 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 is amended by removing subsection (b) and restructuring subsection (a). The changes involve removing certain clauses related to meal service programs authorized under the Act. In subsection (d), the clause regarding participation in meal service programs authorized under the Act or the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act is removed. SEC. 5. PILOT PROGRAM PROVIDING LOW-FAT CHEESES FOR SCHOOL BREAKFAST AND LUNCH PROGRAMS. During a 3-year period, the Secretary of Agriculture will purchase low-fat cheeses for school lunch and breakfast programs. These purchases are in addition to commodities provided under existing programs. The Secretary will also conduct an evaluation to assess the impact on children participating in the school programs. The Secretary of Agriculture will evaluate if children in school lunch and breakfast programs increased their consumption of low-fat cheeses. The report will include information on the types of low-fat cheeses suitable for these programs and other factors to increase interest in low-fat cheeses among schoolchildren. The report must be submitted to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and within 90 days after the 3-year period. The report on the evaluation of children's consumption of low-fat cheeses in school lunch and breakfast programs must be submitted to the Senate and House committees within 90 days. Low-fat cheese is defined as cheese with a milkfat percentage lower than specified in federal regulations. SEC. 6. BUDGET NEUTRALITY OFFSET. Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to change the dates for budget neutrality offset from October 1, 2003, to September 30, 2009, to October 1, 2010, to September 30, 2016."
