    "content": "On January 25, 2009, Bolivia approved a new constitution with a 61% to 39% vote, focusing on indigenous rights and government control of the economy. The referendum set a 5,000-hectare limit on private land holdings, with strong majority support. Bolivia's duty-free access to U.S. markets was suspended on December 15, 2008, due to lack of cooperation on counter-narcotics measures. Former President Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada faces extradition for civilian deaths during violent protests in 2008. In 2008, Bolivian President Evo Morales suspended DEA operations in Bolivia, ratified a new constitution with changes, and extended Andean trade preferences. President Bush signed the Andean Trade Promotion Extension Act into law, extending trade preferences for Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. In 2008, President Bush proposed to suspend Bolivia's ATPA benefits due to Morales government's failure in counternarcotics. Despite Bolivia's failure to meet obligations, sanctions were waived for bilateral assistance programs. Chilean President Bachelet convened a UNASUR meeting to support Morales government and offer mediation. The U.S. State Department declared Bolivia's U.S. Ambassador on September 11, 2008. In 2008, the U.S. State Department declared Bolivia's U.S. Ambassador persona non grata and asked him to leave immediately. Opposition protests turned violent, resulting in the deaths of at least 18 demonstrators in Pando, Bolivia. President Morales called a state of emergency, sent troops to restore order, and arrested the departmental prefect. Protestors also shut down a major natural gas pipeline, causing millions in damages and interrupting gas exports to Argentina and Brazil. In September 2008, President Morales accused the U.S. Ambassador of supporting opposition forces, expelled him from Bolivia, and sent a bill to Congress for a constitutional referendum. Opposition prefects announced roadblocks and threatened gas supplies if Morales proceeded with the referendum. Morales had earlier issued a decree scheduling a referendum on the constitution. In December 2008, President Morales scheduled a referendum on the constitution passed by the Constituent Assembly, leading to protests from the opposition. In August 2008, Bolivian voters reaffirmed their support for Morales in a recall referendum. Coca growers in the Chapare region announced they would no longer sign aid agreements with USAID. Protesters surrounded the U.S. Embassy demanding the extradition of former president Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada. In La Paz, protesters demand the extradition of former president Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada and his ex-defense minister for civilian deaths during 2003 protests. U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia was called back to Washington for security consultations. Departmental referendums on autonomy statutes were held in four eastern provinces despite lack of congressional approval. Bolivia faces challenges of instability, poverty, corruption, and ethnic/regional divisions. Bolivia, plagued by chronic instability, poverty, corruption, and ethnic/regional divisions, gained independence from Spain in 1825. Despite frequent military coups, democratic civilian rule was established in 1982. The country lost territory in the War of the Pacific with Chile and the Chaco War with Paraguay, resulting in limited access to the ocean. Bolivia is rich in natural resources but struggles with high poverty rates, with 64% living in poverty and 35% earning less than $2 a day. Bolivia has a diverse population with significant mineral deposits, but 64% live in poverty and 35% earn less than $2 a day. The two predominant indigenous groups are Quechua and Aymara, making up 30% and 25% of the population respectively. Bolivia has been a major producer of coca leaf, used in cocaine production, with cultivation levels decreasing due to eradication policies causing social unrest. The implementation of policies in Bolivia has led to social unrest and economic hardship in coca-growing regions, giving rise to coca growers' trade unions and the political party MAS. Indigenous groups in Bolivia have historically faced under-representation in politics, high poverty rates, and inequality. By 2006, 17% of Bolivian Congress members identified as indigenous, advocating for indigenous rights and economic development. Some indigenous groups in Bolivia advocate for rights, economic development, and land preservation in the legislature. There is a historical alliance between leftist and indigenous struggles, leading to indigenous representation in politics. The draft constitution recognizes indigenous autonomy, but land tenure and coca cultivation remain contentious issues. Indigenous communities seek legal protection for their lands and criticize resource exploitation by outsiders. Coca leaf holds cultural significance for indigenous communities, used for spiritual and medical purposes. The Morales government in Bolivia has promoted land reform and decriminalized coca cultivation for spiritual and medical purposes, addressing protests against economic marginalization. President Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada resigned in 2003 due to indigenous-led protests over fiscal reforms and opposition to U.S.-funded coca eradication programs. The resignation of President S\u00e1nchez de Lozada in Bolivia in 2003 was triggered by protests against fiscal reforms and plans to export natural gas through Chile. His successor, Carlos Mesa, implemented reforms to address indigenous issues, including a referendum on gas exports and overturning a decree giving oil companies ownership of gas. Mesa also promoted popular participation in elections and proposed a constituent assembly for a new constitution. Despite these efforts, he faced challenges similar to his predecessor. President Mesa, like his predecessor, faced challenges with issues related to Bolivia's natural resources, coca eradication, indigenous rights, and power sharing. He resigned in June 2005, leading to Eduardo Rodriguez taking office and promising early elections. In December 2005, Evo Morales and his party, MAS, won the presidential and legislative elections with Morales becoming president. Evo Morales won the presidency in Bolivia with nearly 54% of the vote, the first candidate to achieve an absolute majority in the first round since 1982. His party, MAS, also secured a majority in the lower chamber of Congress, seats in the Senate, and governorships. Morales became Bolivia's first indigenous president on January 22, 2006, broadening his support beyond traditional voter groups. His victory was attributed to dissatisfaction with previous economic reforms. Bolivians did not benefit from previous pro-market economic reforms, facing corruption and nationalistic stances. The 2005 elections marked the first direct election of governors in Bolivia, leading to conflicts between the Morales government and departmental governments over resources and power distribution. Evo Morales and the MAS have made significant social and economic reforms in Bolivia, including nationalizing the gas industry and implementing land reform. Critics argue that Morales has used anti-democratic methods to impose his will, but he continues to enjoy strong personal approval ratings. In a recent national recall referendum, Morales received the support of 67% of Bolivian voters. Morales received 67% support in a national recall referendum in 2008, strengthening his position against opposition prefects. Calls for a new constitution to empower indigenous groups have been ongoing since 1990, leading to the convocation of a constituent assembly in 2006. In 2006, President Morales established elections for a constituent assembly, with MAS winning the majority but lacking the two-thirds needed for constitutional reforms. The assembly aimed to draft a new constitution defining Bolivia as a \"multinational state\" with indigenous representation and supporting agrarian reform and state ownership of natural resources. The constituent assembly in Bolivia, established in 2006 by President Morales, aimed to draft a new constitution supporting agrarian reform and state ownership of natural resources. Opposition delegates pushed for increased regional autonomy, leading to a deadlock in negotiations. The assembly was delayed by a debate over voting procedures, with reform proposals not considered until spring 2007. In August 2007, the Bolivian Congress extended the constituent assembly until December 14, 2007. Tensions rose as the MAS government diverted hydrocarbons tax revenue to fund a national pension, sparking opposition. Sucre residents proposed moving the capital, leading to violent protests and clashes in November 2007. Clashes in Sucre in November 2007 resulted in three deaths and dozens of injuries. The Constituent Assembly passed a draft constitution on December 9, 2007, including provisions for indigenous rights, land redistribution, and presidential reelection. President Morales postponed a national referendum on the draft constitution until after a recall referendum in August 2008, where he secured 67% of the votes. President Morales, after winning 67% of the votes in a recall referendum, pushed for constitutional reform by scheduling a referendum on the constitution passed by the Constituent Assembly for December 7, 2008. This move sparked protests from the opposition, leading to a bill sent to the Bolivian Congress seeking approval for referendums on the constitution and land ownership. The proposed date for the referendums was changed to January 25, 2009, following weeks of protests and confrontations between MAS and opposition supporters. A multiparty commission in the Bolivian Congress made over 100 changes to the draft constitution to appease opposition legislators. In 2007, the commission made over 100 changes to the draft constitution, including limiting President Morales to one possible reelection. On October 22, 2008, the Bolivian Congress approved the draft constitution and scheduled referendums for January 25, 2009. The constitution was ultimately approved with 61% in favor, and a land ownership limit of 5,000 hectares was set by a majority of 81%. The new constitution in Bolivia guarantees indigenous rights, establishes new governance arrangements, and allows for autonomy at different levels. The bicameral Congress is renamed as a \"pluri-national assembly,\" with an enlarged Senate. The central government retains control over key policies, while the supreme court will be elected. The U.S. Department of State praised Bolivia's referendum success, leading to a positive response from President Morales. The Obama Administration's new tone was seen as encouraging by Bolivia. Civic committees and citizens in resource-rich areas around Santa Cruz have been advocating for increased regional autonomy, supported by the wealthy eastern regions. Nine governors were elected in 2005, with undefined powers. Some prefects are seeking autonomy over budgetary and military powers, causing friction with the Morales government. A referendum in 2006 sought to grant more powers to regional governments. The Constituent Assembly election and autonomy referendum in Bolivia revealed deep divisions, with wealthy eastern provinces supporting increased autonomy while others opposed it. Despite the results, the Morales government has resisted granting more power to prefects in autonomy-supporting departments. President Morales has stated that gas-producing departments will not receive a larger share of revenue. In November 2006, Bolivian President proposed legislation allowing impeachment of elected prefects, leading to protests and conflicts with eastern prefects throughout 2007. In January 2007, protests erupted over autonomy demands, resulting in violent clashes. In July 2007, eastern prefects announced draft autonomy statutes, and in November 2007, tensions rose as Morales government pushed its proposal. In 2007, prefects opposed Morales government's proposal to redirect IDH hydrocarbons revenues to pensions for seniors and draft constitution. Prefects issued autonomy statutes seeking greater control over taxes, land, security, and natural resources. Departmental referendums on autonomy were held in four provinces with strong popular support. The Morales government has used high abstention rates in autonomy referendums to downplay results. Autonomy statutes in eastern departments must comply with the new constitution. Bolivia implemented IMF structural adjustment program in the 1990s, privatizing state-owned corporations. GDP growth averaged 3.5% from 1990 to 2000, but the economy relied heavily on foreign aid with a high debt/GDP ratio. Bolivia's economy was heavily reliant on foreign aid and had a high debt/GDP ratio. Economic growth was slow in 2001 and 2002, but picked up to around 4% in 2004 and 2005 due to strong demand for mining products and gas. Despite flooding in 2007, GDP still grew by close to 4%, driven by construction, financial services, manufacturing, and hydrocarbons sectors. However, 63% of Bolivians live in poverty, with future growth likely constrained by declining foreign investment and high debt burden. President Morales of Bolivia opposes free market economic policies and supports more state involvement in economic policy-making and government spending on infrastructure, health, and education. The MAS unveiled a five-year national development plan aiming to increase GDP growth to 7.6% by 2010, create 90,000 jobs annually, and reduce poverty. Critics argue the plan lacks a clear financing plan and is overly ambitious. The Morales government negotiated for further debt relief, with Bolivia set to receive $1.8 billion from the World Bank. Bolivia received $1.8 billion in debt relief from the World Bank in July 2006. The Inter-American Development Bank also canceled Bolivia's $1 billion debt. Bolivia is a member of the Andean Community and an associate member of Mercosur. The future of the Andean Community was uncertain after Venezuela left in 2006 due to disagreements over free trade agreements. Bolivia, part of Mercosur, signed a trade agreement with Cuba and Venezuela in 2006. The Morales government opposes FTAA and aims to increase state control over key industries. Inflation and concerns over economic policy stability persist. Economic growth may slow in 2009 due to reduced demand for exports and remittance inflows. In 2009, Bolivia's economic growth is expected to slow due to job losses from the suspension of ATPA trade benefits, weakening export markets, reduced investment, lower remittances, and rising unemployment. The Morales government's controversial plans include nationalizing the natural gas sector, industrializing the coca leaf, and enacting large-scale land reform. Bolivia has the second-largest gas reserves in South America. Some 50% of gas in Brazil and 75% in S\u00e3o Paulo comes from Bolivia, which lacks the capacity to develop its resources without foreign investment. Bolivians support greater state control over natural resources, leading to legislative changes in the gas sector. In 2005, Bolivia opened its hydrocarbons sector to private investment, but in May 2005, the Congress enacted legislation that raised taxes on oil and gas production and reestablished state ownership at the wellhead. Foreign oil companies criticized the law, but most complied with its terms. Some companies initiated legal action over contract rewrites and reduced investment, predicting that new investments would not be feasible in Bolivia. On May 1, 2006, President Morales fulfilled his campaign pledge to nationalize the country's resources. President Morales fulfilled his campaign pledge to nationalize Bolivia's natural gas industry in May 2006, leading to a significant increase in government income. However, this move raised energy costs for neighboring countries and deterred foreign investors like Brazil's Petrobras and Spain's Repsol-YPF. As a result, Bolivia struggled to meet domestic gas needs and fulfill contracts with Brazil and Argentina. In early January 2009, Bolivian gas exports to Brazil declined by a third due to hydropower increases and lower demand. Bolivia sent an emergency delegation to Brazil to address the issue, and Petrobas agreed to maintain gas purchases at 24 million cubic meters a day. Argentina also increased its intake by 5 million cubic meters to absorb excess production. These events highlighted Bolivia's struggles despite investments from companies like Repsol and nationalization of the gas industry by President Morales in 2006. The Bolivian government faced challenges due to a decrease in gas exports to Brazil, highlighting the country's vulnerability to fluctuations in demand. The coca leaf, used for cultural and illicit purposes, has been a significant part of Bolivia's economy, with the Chapare region once producing a large amount for cocaine production. Since the 1980s, Bolivia has tried various strategies, with US assistance, to combat illicit coca production worth $25 billion annually. Legislation criminalized coca growing outside designated areas, leading to forced eradication programs in the Chapare region. Despite reducing coca cultivation, human rights abuses occurred, and alternative development programs for coca growers were lacking. The government's failure to provide alternative development programs for coca growers in the Chapare region led to economic hardship and social unrest. Clashes between growers and security forces destabilized the area until a one-year agreement was reached in 2004, allowing limited coca production under a cooperative approach. Drug cultivation in Bolivia increased in 2005 despite these efforts. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported an 8% decrease in coca cultivation in Bolivia, largely due to the success of the Chapare agreement. Critics argue that most coca grown in the Chapare goes to the cocaine industry and should be eradicated. Evo Morales and the MAS have a \"coca yes, cocaine no\" policy based on the Chapare agreement principles. President Morales aims to industrialize coca for licit uses, promote voluntary eradication of coca, increase interdiction of cocaine, and develop alternative coca products. He plans to end the division of legal and illegal coca growing zones in the Yungas region and allow licensed growers to sell directly to consumers. His government also targets cooperative eradication of coca in specific areas. The Morales government targeted 3,000 hectares in the Yungas for cooperative eradication, meeting coca eradication targets for 2007. Proponents of the \"coca yes, cocaine no\" policy believe it is a culturally sensitive approach that stands a better chance of success than previous forced eradication programs. Critics argue against Morales' coca policy. Critics of Morales' coca policy argue that it is based on false premises and may encourage illegal drug cultivation. Extreme land concentration and lack of indigenous access to arable land contribute to rural poverty in Bolivia. In 1996, Bolivia passed an Agrarian Reform Law allowing indigenous communities to have legal title to their communal lands. However, these communities argue that their lands have not been legally defined or protected, leading to exploitation by outsiders. The Morales government launched an agrarian reform program in 2006, giving land titles for 7.5 million acres to 60 indigenous communities and promising to distribute titles for an additional 50 million acres to Bolivia's rural poor over the next five years, accompanied by access to credit and technical training. The government plans to redistribute land in Bolivia, with one-third being state-owned and the rest reclaimed from individuals or companies without legal titles. This policy is opposed by large landowners in the Santa Cruz region and Brazilian landowners. In 2006, a new agrarian reform law was passed despite opposition. The new agrarian reform law in Bolivia redistributes government land, unused private land, and illegally acquired land to settlers, peasants, and indigenous peoples. Critics fear arbitrary expropriations and restrictions on land transactions, but government officials promise to prevent these issues. U.S.-Bolivia relations have historically focused on controlling coca production for cocaine, with U.S. support for Bolivia's counternarcotics efforts. In support of Bolivia's counternarcotics efforts, the United States has provided significant assistance, forgiven Bolivia's debt for development projects, and viewed Bolivia as a counternarcotics success story. However, forced eradication has led to social and political unrest, complicating U.S. relations with Bolivia. After the election, U.S. officials congratulated Evo Morales but expressed concerns about his stance on the coca issue and ties with Cuba and Venezuela. Analysts debated whether Morales would follow in Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's anti-American footsteps. Despite initial hopes for dialogue, U.S.-Bolivian relations quickly soured over drug policies, alliances with Venezuela and Cuba, and nationalization of Bolivia's assets. In 2006, President Bush expressed concern about Bolivian counternarcotics cooperation declining under Morales. Tensions continued in 2007 over coca cultivation expansion despite eradication efforts. Friction escalated as Bolivian authorities accused the U.S. of supporting opposition groups. U.S. officials also worried about instability during constitutional reform in 2008, leading to deteriorating relations. In 2008, U.S.-Bolivian relations worsened as protesters demanded the extradition of former president Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada and his ex-defense minister Carlos Sanchez Berzain. The U.S. Ambassador was called back to Washington, and coca growers unions in Bolivia refused new aid agreements with USAID. Relations hit a low point in mid-September. In mid-September 2008, U.S.-Bolivian relations reached a low point when President Morales expelled U.S. Ambassador Goldberg, leading to reciprocal expulsions. President Bush determined Bolivia had failed in its narcotics commitments, prompting a resolution in Congress. President Bush suspended Bolivia's ATPA trade benefits in December 2008 due to the country's failure to cooperate in counternarcotics efforts. The decision was seen as a punishment for expelling the U.S. Ambassador, leading to tense bilateral relations. The Morales administration hoped for a possible improvement in relations following positive comments from the Obama State Department. Bolivia was once considered a counternarcotics success story and a close U.S. ally in the fight against illegal narcotics. Bolivia, once a success story in counternarcotics efforts, saw an increase in coca cultivation in 2003-2005, prompting concerns about the effectiveness of existing programs. The Bush Administration is concerned about Bolivia's counternarcotics efforts following the election of Evo Morales, a coca growers union leader critical of U.S. drug policy. Initially open to dialogue on fighting drug trafficking while allowing some coca cultivation, the U.S. government is now frustrated with Bolivia's efforts. The Chapare agreement has not reduced coca cultivation as intended. The U.S. government is concerned about Bolivia's counternarcotics efforts under President Morales, who allowed more coca cultivation for traditional use. Despite eradication efforts, coca cultivation in Bolivia increased by 5% in 2007. The FY2008 State Department report on Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries revealed a 14% increase in coca cultivation in Bolivia in 2007. U.S. officials claimed that cocalero syndicates, supported by the Bolivian government, expelled USAID and the DEA from the Chapare region. President Bush determined that Bolivia, along with Venezuela and Burma, had failed to meet international narcotics agreements but waived sanctions to continue bilateral assistance programs. Bolivia has been a major recipient of U.S. foreign assistance in Latin America, with declining levels since FY2007. In FY2007, Bolivia received $122.1 million, including $66 million in counternarcotics assistance. The FY2009 request is for $100.4 million, with funding at FY2008 levels until March 6, 2009. U.S. counternarcotics aid to Bolivia has been provided for interdiction/eradication and alternative development since FY2000. In FY2007, Bolivia received interdiction and alternative development assistance through the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI), which was later renamed as the Andean Counterdrug Program (ACP) in FY2008. Funds for alternative development shifted to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account, and then to the Development Assistance (DA) account in the FY2009 budget request. Interdiction funding supports specialized counterdrug units, improves data collection for law enforcement, and increases interdiction of precursor chemicals and cocaine products. ACP funds also maintain a U.S.-owned helicopter fleet, vehicles, patrol boats, training equipment, and infrastructure. The Andean Counterdrug Program (ACP) in Bolivia funds interdiction efforts, alternative development programs, and infrastructure improvements. USAID supports economic development in coca-growing areas and demand-reduction education programs. However, in 2008, Chapare coca grower representatives announced they would no longer sign new agreements with USAID for alternative development programs. USAID will no longer sign new agreements with Bolivia and will focus on the Yungas region. The Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) extends special duty treatment to imports from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru to promote economic growth and discourage dependence on illicit drugs. ATPDEA renewed ATPA trade preferences until December 31, 2006, and expanded trade preferences to include additional products. President Bush directed the USTR to propose suspending Bolivia's trade benefits due to counternarcotics issues. The Andean Trade Preference Extension Act extended trade benefits for Bolivia and other countries until specific dates in 2009. A public hearing on Bolivia's ATPA benefits suspension was held on October 23, 2008. Most experts predict that the overall effect on Bolivia's economy if the ATPA benefits were to be eliminated would likely be small because exports under this program account for a small percentage of Bolivia's GDP. However, Bolivian officials have expressed concerns about potential job losses, particularly in the textile and jewelry sectors. Some argue that Bolivia's declining counternarcotics cooperation and recent expulsion of the U.S. Ambassador may warrant the suspension of trade benefits, while others fear the harm it could cause. Representative Eliot Engel predicted potential negative consequences of suspending the ATPA benefits. Eliot Engel, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, warned that suspending Bolivia's ATPA benefits could empower anti-American sentiments and diminish U.S. relevance in Bolivia. President Bush announced the suspension on November 25, 2008, effective December 15. The impact on job losses and export revenue remains uncertain, as well as Bolivia's prospects for regaining beneficiary status. Bolivia had submitted a $598 million compact proposal to the Millennium Challenge Corporation in 2005, focusing on linking raw material producers to businesses for export. After taking office, the Morales government modified and resubmitted a compact proposal to the MCC in September 2007. The proposal aimed to improve road infrastructure in La Paz, Beni, and Pando, with a smaller project on rural development. Due to unrest surrounding the Constituent Assembly process, a visit by the MCC Bolivia Transaction Team was postponed in December 2007. The MCC dialogue process with Bolivia was put on hold in January 2008, with monitoring continuing to assess the political, economic, and social situation. The MCC Board did not re-select Bolivia for an FY2009 compact due to human rights abuses and violent clashes in the country between 1996 and 2007. Congress has expressed concern over these abuses. The MCC Board did not re-select Bolivia for an FY2009 compact due to human rights abuses and violent clashes in the country between 1996 and 2007. Congress has expressed concern with human rights abuses in Bolivia, urging the Secretary of State to prioritize investigating and prosecuting human rights cases. Funding for FY2006 and FY2007 was contingent on the determination of whether Bolivian security forces are respecting human rights. The Morales government and human rights organizations believe former President S\u00e1nchez de Lozada should be held responsible for civilian deaths during the 2003 protests in Bolivia. Indigenous groups and workers protested economic marginalization, leading to clashes with government troops and up to 80 deaths. The Bolivian Supreme Court issued an extradition decree for the former president in 2007, and a civil lawsuit seeking compensatory damages was filed in the U.S. court system in the same year. A civil lawsuit seeking compensatory damages for families of those killed in the 2003 protests in Bolivia was filed in the U.S. court system in September 2007. A ruling on the case is expected in spring 2009."
