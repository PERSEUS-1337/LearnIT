    "content": "The \"Early Education Act of 2001\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Congress finds that early education programs are crucial for children's development, especially in language and literacy skills necessary for learning to read. Evaluations show that children who participate in these programs have better outcomes compared to those who do not. Early education programs have numerous benefits for children, including improved performance on achievement tests, staying academically on track, reduced need for special education services, enhanced learning retention and social skills, and increased enthusiasm for school. Studies show that investing in quality early education results in significant cost savings later on. Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on Early Education, emphasizing the importance of investing in quality early education programs for children. The new section on Early Education in Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 defines early education as at least a half-day of schooling each weekday before kindergarten. The purpose is to establish a program for early literacy and numerical training by helping State educational agencies expand their systems. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to at least 10 State educational agencies to implement early education programs with a matching requirement not exceeding 50%. The program assisted under this section must be carried out by local educational agencies, available to all children served by the agency, and involve instructors meeting specific requirements. The State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under this section, detailing the program, its purpose, total cost, and matching funds. The Secretary has the authority to establish a monitoring system to fulfill the section's purpose. The Secretary must establish a monitoring system for programs funded under this section and report to Congress annually. Funds should supplement, not replace, other federal, state, or local funds. $300,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2006."
