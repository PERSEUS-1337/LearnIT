    "content": "REGIONAL STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE THREAT POSED BY BOKO HARAM. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense must develop a 5-year strategy to counter the threat of Boko Haram in Nigeria and its neighboring countries, addressing grievances of vulnerable populations. The strategy should enhance institutional capacity and assist in combating Boko Haram. The strategy to counter the threat of Boko Haram includes enhancing military capabilities, providing humanitarian support, improving human rights investigations, and countering violent extremism in Nigeria and neighboring countries. The plan includes addressing societal factors contributing to Boko Haram's radicalization, strengthening the rule of law, enhancing security for schools, combating gender-based violence, and promoting gender equality in Nigeria. The strategy aims to coordinate implementation across agencies and with partners, identify required resources, and assess Nigeria's capability gaps for combating gender-based violence and promoting gender equality. The Government of Nigeria and its regional partners need to address the threat of Boko Haram and the grievances of affected populations. There are significant intelligence gaps regarding Boko Haram and the capacity of Nigeria and its partners to implement a strategy. Congress recognizes that lack of economic opportunity and access to education contributes to Boko Haram's radicalization efforts. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" refer to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives, including those related to Armed Services, Foreign Relations, Appropriations, and Intelligence."
