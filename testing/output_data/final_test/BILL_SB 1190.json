    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The commission under the Public Resources Code must meet at least 11 times annually in a public location, with meetings occurring within 45 days of each other. Meetings are open to the public, and a majority of the commission's members must be present to make decisions. Starting from July 1, 2017, the commission must also provide public access to meetings through telephone, video conferencing, and the internet, allowing real-time testimony during public comment. Section 30321 of the Public Resources Code is amended to define \"a matter within the commission's jurisdiction\" as any permit action, federal consistency review, appeal, local coastal program, etc. Commission staff must include references to materials not related to the commission's jurisdiction in the executive summary of a staff report. The addendum includes instructions on using information in communications for decision-making. An \"ex parte communication\" is any oral or written communication between a commission member and an interested person about a matter within the commission's jurisdiction, excluding certain staff communications. Ex parte communications are restricted to procedural issues, official proceedings involving a commission member, actions of other agencies involving a commission member, and official communications between nonvoting commission members and state agency staff. The Public Resources Code prohibits certain communications related to actions pending before the commission, including communications with nonvoting members and project site visits. Ex parte communications are limited to specific situations involving commission members and state agency staff. Ex parte communications on matters within the commission's jurisdiction and regarding pending enforcement investigations are restricted to specific situations. Commission members and staff may conduct project site visits with approval and permission, limited to communication between them. The commission member must disclose any communication that violates the rules and provide a report to the executive director or the commission within seven days. They are also prohibited from voting or participating in related proceedings. Standard disclosure forms must be adopted for reporting such communications. The commission member must disclose any communication violating rules and report to the executive director or commission within seven days. They are prohibited from voting or participating in related proceedings. The executive director will place any report in the public record. A new policy will be adopted to prevent undue influence by commission members on staff. This section prohibits commission members from unduly influencing staff reports and recommendations. Violating this rule results in disqualification from holding any position at the commission. The purpose is to protect the public interest by ensuring the independence of staff reports."
