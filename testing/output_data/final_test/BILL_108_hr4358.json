    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The Act is titled the \"Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act\" and highlights the significant impact of counterfeit goods on the US economy, including lost tax revenue and jobs. The International Chamber of Commerce estimates that seven percent of world trade involves counterfeit goods, with a market worth $350 billion. Counterfeit products have infiltrated various industries, such as auto parts, electrical appliances, medicines, tools, toys, clothing, and more. Counterfeiting is linked to terrorist organizations for money laundering, poses a threat to public health and safety, and strong domestic laws can help in negotiating better agreements with trading partners. The text chunk \"SEC. 2. TRAFFICKING IN COUNTERFEIT MARKS.\" is related to the previous paragraph discussing the link between counterfeiting and terrorist organizations, public health threats, and the importance of strong domestic laws in negotiating trade agreements. Section 2320 of title 18, United States Code is amended to include trafficking in counterfeit marks. Upon evidence that a defendant possesses articles with counterfeit marks, the court must order forfeiture and destruction of the items. Additionally, individuals convicted of violating this section must forfeit items to the United States as part of their sentence. Upon conviction for trafficking in counterfeit marks, individuals must forfeit any property obtained from the violation and any property used in the offense. The court may also order restitution to the mark owner and other victims. The term 'victim' in the context of trafficking in counterfeit marks refers to individuals affected by the offense. Subsection (e)(1) of the law is amended to include a definition of a 'spurious mark' that closely resembles a registered mark under the Lanham Act. The term 'spurious mark' refers to a mark used in connection with trafficking goods or services that is identical or substantially indistinguishable from a famous mark registered in the USPTO. It includes labels, patches, stickers, wrappers, badges, emblems, medallions, charms, boxes, containers, cans, cases, hangtags, documentation, or packaging. The court may consider various factors in determining if a mark is a 'famous mark' under the Lanham Act, including the distinctiveness of the mark. The factors considered in determining if a mark is famous under the Lanham Act include distinctiveness, duration of use, advertising, geographical extent, channels of trade, public recognition, use by third parties, survey evidence, and enforcement record. To qualify as a famous mark under this section, the mark must be registered on the principal register of the US Patent and Trademark Office. The burden of proof and persuasion lies with the United States to determine if a mark is famous. Evidence of a prior determination by a court or administrative authority creates a presumption that the mark is famous. Prosecution under this section is not applicable if the mark is a counterfeit mark. To be considered a counterfeit mark, the mark must be lawfully registered on the principal register of the US Patent and Trademark Office under the Lanham Act."
