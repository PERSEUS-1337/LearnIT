Coordination among law enforcement officials at all levels is required for effective investigation and prosecution of firearms-related crimes. The legislation aims to enhance firearm tracing and ballistics testing to identify illegal firearms traffickers. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General will select at least 10 jurisdictions for participation in the program, prioritizing those with comprehensive firearm law enforcement strategies. Jurisdictions must also draft a plan to share ballistics records with nearby jurisdictions. The legislation authorizes $20,000,000 for fiscal years 2001 through 2004 to expand ballistics testing, including equipment installation and personnel expenses from the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
