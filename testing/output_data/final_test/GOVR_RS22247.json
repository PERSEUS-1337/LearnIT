The most recent parliamentary elections in June 2005 saw the left-of-center Bulgarian Socialist Party winning with 82 seats. Other parties that won seats include the National Movement for Stability and Progress, Movement for Rights and Freedoms, Ataka, Union of Democratic Forces, Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria, and Bulgarian National Union Coalition. In an effort to boost voter turnout, the government introduced a lottery with prizes, but turnout was only 55%, the lowest since communism. All parties vowed to keep Ataka out of the government, reflecting public dissatisfaction with the political class. Forming a new government was challenging due to scattered votes and personal animosities among party leaders. The stalemate was resolved on August 15. The parliament approved a new coalition government on August 15, led by BSP leader Sergei Stanishev. Critics argue that Stanishev is a weak leader, with real power held by party barons hindering reform efforts. Despite defections, the government retains a majority and plans to stay in power until 2009. A potential challenge could come from the pro-EU and pro-law-and-order party, Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (CEDB), led by Boiko Borisov. President Georgi Purvanov, supported by the BSP, won re-election in 2006, but political power is mainly held by the Prime Minister and government in Bulgaria. The country faces economic challenges, being one of the poorest in Europe with a low per capita income. Urban areas like Sofia are more prosperous than rural regions, which are experiencing an exodus of young people. Bulgaria is also dealing with a shrinking and aging population due to a low birth rate and emigration of young Bulgarians to Western countries for better job opportunities. Bulgaria's economic situation has improved significantly since 1997, with an average economic growth rate of over 5% per year from 1998 to 2005. Unemployment decreased from 18.1% in 2000 to 7.8% in 2007, and the government ran a budget surplus of 3.5% of GDP in 2007. The central bank is working to control commercial bank lending to maintain stable growth, although inflation remains high. Bulgaria's economy has shown significant improvement since 1997, with an average growth rate of over 5% per year. Unemployment dropped from 18.1% in 2000 to 7.8% in 2007, and the government achieved a budget surplus of 3.5% of GDP. However, high inflation may delay Bulgaria's adoption of the euro. The country had a large current account deficit in 2007, but also attracted significant foreign direct investment due to its skilled labor force. Organized crime and corruption remain serious issues in Bulgaria. Crime groups in Bulgaria are involved in trafficking, drugs, weapons, money laundering, counterfeiting, piracy, and fraud. High-level corruption is a critical issue, with powerful politicians running corrupt ministries. Judicial reform is a major challenge, as the system is weak, corrupt, and politicized. Bulgaria's foreign policy focuses on NATO and the EU, with troops deployed in Afghanistan and considering training Afghan security forces. Bulgaria is considering providing training to Afghan security forces and has deployed soldiers to NATO-led peacekeeping forces in Kosovo and Bosnia. They support extending NATO membership invitations to Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia to strengthen peace and stability in the region. Military modernization has been slow due to the costs of overseas deployments, with a focus on acquiring new equipment for full integration in the Alliance. Bulgaria is focusing on preparing a mechanized brigade for NATO missions, along with specialized units totaling over 5,000 men. Concerns have been raised about Soviet-trained officers in the Bulgarian military having links to Russian intelligence agencies. Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007 under strict conditions, including progress reports on fighting organized crime and corruption. The EU may impose sanctions if benchmarks are not met. The European Commission's report on Bulgaria's progress in judicial reform and fighting corruption highlighted areas of improvement but also noted shortcomings in local government, healthcare, and education. While no sanctions have been imposed yet, the EU has suspended funding for certain projects due to irregularities, including corruption concerns. Concerns have been raised about Russia's dominance in Bulgaria's energy sector, as the country heavily relies on Russian oil and natural gas. Bulgaria's energy sector is heavily influenced by Russia, with Russian firms owning key oil refineries, natural gas distribution companies, and gas stations in the country. There are concerns about Russia's control and potential manipulation through political and business ties. President Putin secured Bulgaria's support for the South Stream gas pipeline in 2008, which could increase Europe's reliance on Russian energy. Bulgaria's strategic location on the Black Sea could make it a crucial transit point for energy supplies from Russia and the Caspian Sea to Western Europe, bypassing Turkey's congested straits. Europe's dependence on Russian energy hinders the U.S.- and EU-sponsored Nabucco project, which aims to supply Central Asian gas to Europe without going through Russia. Russian and Bulgarian leaders signed agreements for an oil pipeline from Burgas to Alexandropoulos and for building Russian nuclear reactors in Bulgaria. The United States and Bulgaria have strong bilateral relations, including a Defense Cooperation Agreement for the use of military bases in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government sees these bases as an economic boost and a way to strengthen ties with the U.S. Bulgaria has signed agreements with the United States for the use of military bases, including Bezmer and Graf Ignatievo air bases and the Novo Selo training range. Approximately 2,500 U.S. troops will be deployed to these bases at any given time for short periods. The bases in Bulgaria are cost-effective and offer fewer constraints on training compared to Western Europe. Despite some infrastructure challenges, Bulgaria contributed troops to U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq. Bulgaria's unpopularity among Bulgarians is evident in opinion polls. The country suffered casualties in Iraq, with 13 soldiers killed. Despite withdrawing a battalion in 2005, Bulgaria later sent a 150-man unit to guard a refugee camp in Iraq. Additionally, Bulgaria is involved in training Iraqi security forces. The State Department's 2007 Trafficking in Persons report labeled Bulgaria as a \"Tier 2\" country for human trafficking, indicating efforts to combat the issue but not full compliance with standards. Bulgaria improved victim assistance infrastructure and law enforcement efforts, but struggles with monitoring due to staffing issues. In FY2006, Bulgaria received $35 million in U.S. aid, transitioning from the SEED program to EU admission. In FY2007, $11 million in aid was received, including military financing and training funding. FY2008 will see an estimated $8.5 million in aid, with a focus on military standards. In FY2009, the Administration requested $11 million in aid for Bulgaria, including $9 million in FMF, $1.6 million in IMET, and $0.4 million for destroying small arms and ammunition stocks."
