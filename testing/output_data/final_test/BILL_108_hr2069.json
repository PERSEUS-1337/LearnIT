    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Tuberculosis (TB) Now Act\". Congress finds that tuberculosis is a significant health and economic burden globally, leading to millions of deaths annually. It is a major threat to public health, especially for vulnerable populations like women of reproductive age and those with HIV. The disease is spreading due to inadequate treatment and affects individuals regardless of national borders, with a significant portion of cases in the United States attributed to foreign-born individuals. The global spread of tuberculosis poses a threat to Americans, especially with the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains. Treatment for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in the United States can cost up to $1,000,000 per patient and may not always be successful, making it a virtual death sentence without access to proper care. The highly effective and inexpensive treatment for standard tuberculosis is DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short-course), recommended by the World Health Organization. DOTS includes low-cost diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and ensuring patients complete their medication. It is one of the most cost-effective health interventions available today, costing as little as $10 for a full course of drugs in low-income countries. Proper DOTS treatment is crucial to prevent the development of dangerous multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. The DOTS-Plus strategy supplements the standard DOTS strategy to address multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. The Global Fund focuses on combating infectious diseases like tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria. The CDC plays a role in disease prevention and control. The CDC is actively involved in global tuberculosis control efforts, assisting countries with high burdens of tuberculosis by implementing WHO-recommended strategies, treating multi-drug resistant cases, and conducting research for new diagnostics and treatments. Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to include a new section for assistance in tuberculosis prevention, treatment, and control. Congress recognizes the international problem of tuberculosis and aims to provide assistance for its prevention, treatment, and control. The President is required to coordinate with organizations like the World Health Organization and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Department of Health and Human Services, along with other organizations, aims to develop and implement a comprehensive tuberculosis control program. The goal is to detect 70% of infectious tuberculosis cases and cure 85% of those detected using the DOTS strategy by December 31, 2010. The President shall prioritize activities to increase DOTS coverage and treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. At least 75% of funds for a fiscal year shall be used for antituberculosis drugs, supplies, and direct patient services. The President shall prioritize activities to increase DOTS coverage and treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. At least 75% of funds for a fiscal year shall be used for antituberculosis drugs, supplies, direct patient services, and training in diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, not less than 10 percent of the funds will be allocated to the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility. An annual report must be submitted to Congress detailing the programs and activities carried out, including the number of individuals treated and cured. Authorization of appropriations is also included in this section. Authorization of appropriations is included in this section, with $200,000,000 authorized for each of the fiscal years 2004 and 2005. Amounts appropriated are authorized to remain available until expended. Definitions for terms such as 'appropriate congressional committees', 'DOTS', and 'DOTS-Plus' are also provided. The term 'DOTS-Plus' refers to a comprehensive tuberculosis management strategy that supplements the standard DOTS strategy, addressing specific issues like multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. The 'Global Alliance for Tuberculosis Drug Development' is a public-private partnership ensuring availability of affordable medications in high burden countries. The 'Global tuberculosis drug facility' facilitates access to tuberculosis drugs globally. The Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility (GDF) is part of the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership, which aims to increase access to high-quality tuberculosis drugs for DOTS expansion. The partnership involves the World Health Organization, donors, high burden countries, and various agencies committed to controlling and eliminating tuberculosis. The amendments made by this section will be effective on October 1, 2003, or the date of the enactment of this Act, whichever is later. Authorization of $30,000,000 for global tuberculosis activities through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding as needed for fiscal year 2005. Amounts appropriated will remain available until expended."
