    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alaska Native and American Indian Direct Reimbursement Act of 1998\". Congress enacted a demonstration program in 1988 under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to test direct billing for health services provided to patients eligible for reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid. The program, which began in fiscal year 1989, was successful in increasing collections for participating hospitals and clinics. The demonstration program in 1988 tested direct billing for health services under Medicare and Medicaid, leading to increased collections and efficiency for participants. Direct tribal involvement in billing and collections was found to be more beneficial than the current Indian Health Service-managed system. Allowance for tribes to manage their own billings and collections was recommended. The demonstration program in 1988 tested direct billing for health services under Medicare and Medicaid, leading to increased collections and efficiency for participants. Allowing tribes to manage their Medicare and Medicaid billings and collections independently, rather than through the Indian Health Service, reduces administrative costs and aligns with the Indian Self-Determination Act. The program was extended to September 30, 1998, to prevent interruptions while awaiting a recommendation on its permanency. It is beneficial to extend the demonstration program to other Indian tribes and organizations operating under the Indian Health Service. SEC. 3. DIRECT BILLING OF MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND OTHER THIRD PARTY PAYORS. The Secretary shall establish a program for Indian tribes to directly bill and receive payment for health care services provided under the medicare program and State medical assistance plans. The Secretary will establish a program for Indian tribes to directly bill and receive payment for health care services under the medicare program and State medical assistance plans. Hospitals and clinics participating in the program will be reimbursed directly under the medicare and medicaid programs for services furnished. The funds reimbursed to hospitals or clinics under U.S.C. 1395qq(c), sections 402(a) and 813(b)(2)(A) must first be used for necessary improvements to comply with medicare or medicaid requirements. Any excess funds must be used to improve the health resources deficiency level of the Indian tribe in accordance with Service regulations. The Determination Act requires hospitals and clinics in the program to adhere to auditing requirements and submit reports to the Secretary regularly for oversight. The program requires 2 years of participation and annual reports thereafter. No payments from special funds are allowed for hospitals or clinics participating in the program. Requirements for participation include adherence to auditing and reporting to the Secretary. To participate in the program, an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or Alaska Native health organization must submit an application to the Secretary demonstrating that they contract for a Service facility eligible for Medicare or Medicaid. The Indian tribe, tribal organization, or Alaska Native health organization must submit an application to the Secretary for approval within 90 days, meeting specific criteria for facility accreditation or a plan for achieving it. Participants in the demonstration program authorized under the Alaska Native and American Indian Direct Reimbursement Act of 1998 are automatically approved for the new program without needing to submit an application. Approval of qualified applications or deemed approval of demonstration programs will remain valid as long as requirements are met. The Secretary will examine and implement necessary administrative changes to facilitate direct billing and reimbursement under the program, including agreements with States for Medicaid billing. Additionally, changes will be made to allow participants to provide medical records information for patients served under the program. The program participants must report consistent medical records information and accounting data as required by the demonstration program. The Secretary can modify accounting submission requirements after consulting with participants. Participants can withdraw from the program if desired. Participants in the program can withdraw in the same way tribes can return a contracted program to the Secretary under the Indian Self-Determination Act. Cost accounting and billing authority will revert to the Secretary upon withdrawal acceptance. Additionally, certain Indian tribes and organizations have the option to directly bill for healthcare services provided by their hospitals or clinics. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act allows certain Indian tribes and organizations to directly bill for healthcare services provided by their hospitals or clinics, as stated in section 405. Amendments to the Social Security Act also address this authority, with an effective date of October 1, 1998."
