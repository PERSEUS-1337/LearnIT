The Congress acknowledges the historical exclusion of women from clinical trials and the lack of research funding for diseases that primarily affect women. There is a need for better training on women's health in the medical education system and an increase in women leaders in academic medicine to address women's health issues. The establishment of the Office of Research on Women's Health at the National Institutes of Health is crucial for addressing research on diseases affecting women. The Federal Government should create regional centers for women's health education and treatment to disseminate research information effectively.
