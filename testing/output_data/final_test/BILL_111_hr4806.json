    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Every Child Deserves a Family Act\". Congressional findings and purposes are outlined. The Congress finds a shortage of qualified individuals willing to adopt or foster children in the child welfare system, leading to thousands of foster children without permanent homes. To address this, child welfare agencies should eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and marital status in adoption and foster care procedures. Over 129,000 children in the US foster care system are legally free for adoption, with 51,000 children adopted in 2007 and 25,000 youth aging out of the system. Research shows that youth who age out of the foster care system are at high risk for poverty, homelessness, incarceration, and early parenthood. Increasing adoption rates and establishing permanency for foster youth can lead to significant national cost savings. LGBT youth in foster care often face discrimination, harassment, and violence, with a high percentage of homeless LGBT youth having been in foster care previously. According to data, a significant number of same-sex couples are raising children in the United States, with many LGBT parents interested in adoption. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual parents are raising a percentage of adopted and foster children, while additional individuals from the LGBT community are considering adoption. According to studies, same-sex couples raising adopted children have similar advantages and expectations for their children's well-being as heterosexual parents. However, one-third of child welfare agencies in the US reject gay, lesbian, and bisexual applicants, reducing the number of qualified adoptive parents. The rejection of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and unmarried relatives as foster parents or adoptive parents has led to a decrease in qualified caregivers overall. Over 14,000 children are currently placed with LGBTQ+ adoptive and foster parents, and discriminating against them could increase foster care costs by $87-130 million annually. Some States allow one member of a same-sex couple to adopt, but not both, denying children the same rights and security as those with heterosexual parents. Joint adoption provides access to health benefits, legal protections, and permanency for both parents and child, supported by professional organizations in various fields. Professional organizations in psychology, law, and child welfare support qualified gay, lesbian, bisexual, and unmarried couples to foster and adopt, citing research that shows sexual orientation does not determine parental success. Discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status in foster care placements is not in the best interests of children. The purpose of the Act is to reduce waiting times for children to find loving families and prevent discrimination in adoption and foster care based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. \"Every child deserves a family.\" An entity receiving Federal assistance for adoption or foster care placements cannot discriminate based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status of the person or child. They also cannot delay placements based on these factors or require additional screenings. The subsection prohibits discrimination in adoptive or foster placement decisions based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. It defines placement decision as the decision to place, delay, or deny a child in a foster care or adoptive home. Individuals aggrieved by violations can seek equitable relief through legal action. The Act prohibits discrimination in foster care and adoption placement decisions based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide guidance and technical assistance to ensure compliance with the Act, including identifying inconsistent laws and regulations and providing training to bring them into compliance. The Act mandates guidance and training to ensure compliance with non-discrimination laws in foster care and adoption, including cultural competency training and recruitment efforts for all prospective parents. Training for judges and attorneys involved in these cases is also required. Compliance deadline is specified. Entities receiving Federal assistance for adoption or foster care placements must comply with non-discrimination laws within 6 months of guidance publication or 1 year of the Act's enactment. States can request deadline extensions for statutory law amendments. The Secretary may withhold funds from non-compliant States under the Social Security Act. A study will be conducted within 5 years to assess State compliance with the Act. The legislation prohibits discrimination in adoption and foster care based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. It also aims to remove barriers and additional screenings for placement decisions. The legislation prohibits discrimination in adoption and foster care based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. The Comptroller General will report the study results to Congress within one year."
