It amends Part III of title 38, United States Code, by adding a new chapter titled \"Annual Leave for Family of Deployed Members of the Uniformed Services.\" The \"Military Family Leave Act of 2009\" adds a new chapter titled \"Annual Leave for Family of Deployed Members of the Uniformed Services.\" It includes definitions such as 'eligible employee' and 'family member' in relation to leave requirements and benefits protection. Sec. 4402 of the \"Military Family Leave Act of 2009\" defines 'family member' as the spouse, son or daughter, or parent of an individual. It also explains 'reduced leave schedule' and references the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 for further clarification. Eligible employees are entitled to two workweeks of leave for each family member in a 12-month period. An eligible employee in the uniformed services can take leave for impending active duty or deployment in connection with a contingency operation. The leave can be taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule without reducing the total amount of leave entitled. Paid leave is permitted under this provision. An eligible employee in the uniformed services can take leave for impending active duty or deployment in connection with a contingency operation, which may consist of paid or unpaid leave as deemed appropriate by the employer. If an employer provides paid leave for fewer workweeks than entitled, additional leave can be provided without compensation. The employee can choose to substitute accrued paid vacation, personal, or family leave for the entitled leave. Notice for leave under this provision is required when an eligible employee chooses to use it. An eligible employee must provide reasonable notice to the employer when choosing to use leave under subsection (a). Certification of entitlement to leave may be required by the employer, and the employee must provide it in a timely manner. A notification, call, or order can serve as sufficient certification for leave entitlement. The Secretary may prescribe additional forms of certification. Sec. 4404 of the title states that an eligible employee taking leave under section 4402 is entitled to be restored to their previous position or an equivalent one with the same rights and benefits upon return. The employee does not lose any accrued employment benefits during the leave period, but does not accrue seniority or benefits while on leave. Sec. 4405 prohibits employers from interfering with employees' rights under this chapter, including discrimination. Sec. 4406 enforces these provisions, and Sec. 4407 contains miscellaneous provisions. \"Sec. 4407 states that the provisions of subchapter IV of chapter 43 of this title apply to this chapter. Clerical amendments are made to the table of chapters in title 38, United States Code.\" Annual Leave for Family of Deployed Members of the Uniformed Services."
