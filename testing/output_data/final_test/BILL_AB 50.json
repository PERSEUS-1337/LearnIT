    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges California's high poverty rate, especially among children, leading to various health and developmental issues. Research shows early life experiences impact long-term physical and mental health. Governor Brown established the Let's Get Healthy California Task Force to develop a 10-year plan for improving health, controlling costs, promoting personal responsibility, and advancing health equity. The task force prioritized \"Healthy Beginnings,\" focusing on reducing infant deaths, increasing vaccination rates, reducing childhood trauma, and decreasing adolescent tobacco use. The final report emphasizes the need for evidence-based interventions to meet the ambitious goals set by the Governor. Evidence-based home visiting programs like Nurse-Family Partnership, Healthy Families America, Early Head Start, Parents as Teachers, and Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters support the parent-child relationship from pregnancy to age five. Research shows these programs improve family self-sufficiency, parenting practices, child literacy, school readiness, and maternal and child health. In 2013, over 248,000 Medi-Cal beneficiaries gave birth, increasing costs for taxpayers due to Medi-Cal covering half of all births in the state. Medi-Cal enrollment has risen by 18 percent to 11.3 million, with expectations to exceed 12 million in 2015. The California Health and Human Services Agency submitted a State Health Care Innovation Plan addressing high costs in maternity care to the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Maternal mortality rates have been rising in California, with high-risk pregnancies, NICU services, toxic stress, and emergency room visits contributing to increased healthcare costs, especially for women during childbearing years. Evidence-based home visiting programs have shown sustained improvements in maternal and child health, positive parenting practices, child development, school readiness, reductions in child maltreatment, family economic self-sufficiency, linkages and referrals, and reductions in family violence. Evidence-based home visiting programs have demonstrated reductions in preterm births, maternal mortality, smoking during pregnancy, childhood injuries, and improved family well-being. Cost savings have been seen in federal, state, and local governments due to these programs. The Legislature intends to expand evidence-based home visiting programs in California to improve maternal and child health outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and support families from prenatal to five years of age. The department, in consultation with stakeholders, will develop a feasibility plan by January 1, 2017, to offer evidence-based home visiting programs to Medi-Cal eligible pregnant and parenting women, including establishing Medi-Cal coverage for these services. The department will develop a plan to provide evidence-based home visiting program services to Medi-Cal eligible pregnant and parenting women, including funding mechanisms and prioritizing sources other than General Fund money. Definitions for this section are also provided. An evidence-based program is one that is scientifically proven to be effective and must be reviewed every five years to ensure fidelity to the program model. An evidence-based home visiting program is one that meets specific criteria for effectiveness. The evidence-based home visiting program must meet specific criteria set by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, offer voluntary services to pregnant women and parents of young children, and target outcomes such as improved maternal and child health, prevention of child injuries, and improvements in school readiness and achievement. The evidence-based home visiting program aims to achieve outcomes such as reduced crime, improved family economic self-sufficiency, better coordination of community resources, and enhanced parenting skills related to child development."
