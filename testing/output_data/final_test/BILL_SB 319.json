    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 56.103 of the Civil Code is amended to allow health care providers to disclose medical information to authorized individuals for coordinating health care services for minors, including psychotropic medication monitoring. For the purpose of coordinating health care services for minors, authorized individuals such as health care providers, county social workers, probation officers, and foster care public health nurses may receive medical information and protected health information. Medical information disclosed to certain authorized individuals for the purpose of coordinating health care services for minors cannot be further disclosed unless authorized by law. This information cannot be used as evidence in criminal proceedings against the minor, except if obtained through lawful means other than this disclosure. (e) (1) Health care providers can disclose medical information about a minor's mental health condition to authorized individuals for coordinating treatment, but the recipient cannot further disclose it unless authorized by law. (2) This does not include psychotherapy notes. The disclosure of information under this section does not limit disclosure required by law. \"Minor\" refers to a minor in custody or under court petition. Existing privacy protections are not affected. No expansion of authority for social workers or caregivers. Section 5328.04 of the Welfare and Institutions Code allows confidential information to be disclosed to authorized individuals for coordinating health care services for minors. This disclosure does not override any legal requirements and does not expand the authority of social workers or caregivers. Information disclosed under subdivision (a) of Section 5328.04 shall only be further disclosed for coordinating health care services for the minor and cannot be used as evidence in criminal proceedings against the minor. The section allows certain professionals to keep confidential information provided by a minor or their family. Disclosure of information is not intended to limit disclosure required by law. It does not expand the authority of certain professionals beyond existing law regarding access to confidential information. (g) \"Minor\" refers to a minor in temporary custody, a minor with a court petition filed, or a dependent child/war of juvenile court under Section 300 or 601. (h) Information disclosed does not include psychotherapy notes. Section 16501.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended. The State Department of Social Services amends Section 16501.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code to establish a public health nursing program in the child welfare services program for minor and nonminor dependents in foster care, focusing on promoting their overall well-being. The public health nursing program in the child welfare services for foster care includes the use of a foster care public health nurse to coordinate health care services and serve as a liaison with health care professionals. The nurse will have access to the child's medical information and ensure they receive necessary health screenings. The foster care public health nurse collects health information and coordinates medical care planning for foster children, including arranging assessments, interpreting results, monitoring medications, advocating for healthcare needs, and linking with providers. The public health nurse in foster care assists in coordinating medical care for foster children, including assessments, medication monitoring, and advocating for healthcare needs. They also provide follow-up contact to assess progress in meeting treatment goals and assist nonminor dependents in accessing and coordinating physical and mental health care services. The services provided by foster care public health nurses are limited to those eligible for reimbursement under Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act. The State Department of Health Care Services will seek federal approvals for child welfare agencies to claim enhanced federal funds for services under this section. County child welfare agencies will provide health care oversight and coordination services through agreements with local public health agencies. Prior to the 2011\u201312 fiscal year, there is no required county match for the nonfederal cost of this program. Starting in the 2011\u201312 fiscal year, funding and expenditures for programs under this section will follow specific Government Code requirements. Section 16501.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended. The State Department of Social Services will establish a public health nursing program in the child welfare services to provide healthcare to minors in foster care, promoting their overall well-being. Under the program, counties will utilize foster care public health nurses to coordinate health care services for children in foster care. The nurses will work with child welfare services workers, health care professionals, and other providers to ensure the children receive necessary health screenings and care. The nurses will have access to the child's medical, dental, and mental health information while maintaining privacy requirements. The foster care public health nurses will collect health information and coordinate medical care planning for foster children, including arranging assessments, interpreting results, monitoring medications, advocating for healthcare needs, and ensuring linkage among providers. The foster care public health nurses coordinate medical care planning for foster children, including assessing progress in meeting treatment goals and assisting nonminor dependents in accessing and managing physical and mental health care. The services provided by foster care public health nurses are limited to those eligible for reimbursement under Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act. The State Department of Health Care Services will seek federal approvals for child welfare agencies to claim enhanced federal funds for services under this section. County child welfare agencies will provide health care oversight and coordination services through agreements with local public health agencies. Prior to the 2011\u201312 fiscal year, there is no required county match for the nonfederal cost of this program. Starting in the 2011\u201312 fiscal year, funding and expenditures for programs under this section will follow specific Government Code requirements. Public health nurses will receive training as outlined in Section 16501.4. Section 3.5 of the bill includes amendments to Section 16501.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, contingent on the enactment of both this bill and Senate Bill 238 before January 1, 2016. If this bill is enacted after Senate Bill 238, Section 3 of this bill will not take effect. SEC. 5 of the act states that if there is an increase in costs for local agencies due to mandated programs or services, the state must provide annual funding for the cost increase. Any additional programs or services provided by a local agency above the funded level do not require state funding."
