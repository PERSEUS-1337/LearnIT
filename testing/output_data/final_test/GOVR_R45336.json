    "content": "Administrative agencies are often criticized for delays in issuing regulations, but there are valid reasons for the time taken. Rulemakings involve soliciting input, analyzing information, and balancing interests. Limited resources and other priorities can also contribute to delays. Excessive delays can raise policy concerns and may violate statutory directives from Congress. Excessive agency delays can undermine public trust, inhibit long-term planning, and cause economic harm. Congress can combat agency delay by setting nonbinding time frames or statutory deadlines for actions. The APA requires agencies to act within a \"reasonable time\" even without specific deadlines set by Congress. Individuals can sue to compel agency action for unreasonable delays, with courts using a multifactor test to determine reasonableness. Courts are generally deferential to agencies, but more willing to compel action when specific statutory deadlines are in place. This report discusses how Congress can use various tools to encourage agencies to act within a specific time frame, including lawsuits, political pressure, oversight powers, and the power of the purse. Congress can create incentives for agencies to issue regulations in a timely manner when granting them rulemaking authority. Congress can impose timing requirements on agencies to ensure timely rulemaking. The APA's general rule of reasonableness applies, with courts requiring significant delays before compelling action. Congress can also set nonbinding time frames or statutory deadlines, with courts more willing to enforce specific dates. Penalties may be enacted for missed deadlines on critical matters. Imposing deadlines on agencies by Congress can impact the quality of decision-making. Congress often delegates complex issues to agencies due to their expertise. While Congress usually does not set specific deadlines for federal regulations, penalties may be imposed for agency delays. Imposing nonbinding time frames on agencies by Congress can encourage timely action without the rigidity of firm deadlines. This approach aims to avoid the problematic aspects of true deadlines while still setting expectations for timely completion of tasks, such as processing immigration benefit applications within 180 days. In practice, courts are more likely to compel agency action when a suggested time frame is violated, compared to when no time frame was imposed by Congress. Nonbinding time frames offer a middle ground between no timing guidance and hard statutory deadlines. Statutory deadlines are commonly used to control the timing of agency action, especially in environmental regulations and public health matters. For example, the Clean Air Act amendments in 1990 required the EPA to issue regulatory guidance on motor vehicle inspection and maintenance within twelve months. Congress sets deadlines for regulatory standards, such as motor vehicle inspection requirements and tank monitoring devices. Rulemaking typically takes 1-2 years, but deadlines can vary. Statutory deadlines range from 12-24 months, with some shorter or longer. Congress may also set deadlines for different stages of rulemaking. Congress may set deadlines for different stages of the rulemaking process, allowing for specific timeframes for issuing proposed rules or public comment periods. In cases where speed is crucial, Congress can exempt rules from standard procedural requirements, potentially leading to less input from stakeholders and the public. Agencies may also argue \"good cause\" for bypassing notice-and-comment rulemaking due to looming deadlines, with courts allowing deviations in cases of tight deadlines and complex statutes. Statutory deadlines can impact agency rulemaking speed, with mixed evidence on effectiveness. Agencies often miss deadlines, but deadlines correlate with faster action. Explicit deadlines make it easier for litigants to compel agency action. \"Hammer provisions\" set hard deadlines and penalties for non-compliance, encouraging agency action. The hammer provisions in statutes set hard deadlines and penalties for non-compliance, encouraging agencies to accelerate decision-making and prioritize matters. Hammer provisions in statutes set hard deadlines and penalties for non-compliance, pushing agencies to prioritize matters. However, this can lead to rushed decision-making, neglect of other duties, and limited public input. The APA authorizes suit by a person \"suffering a legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.\" Section 706(1) of the APA provides a remedy to enforce the requirement that agencies conclude matters within a reasonable time by compelling agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed. This creates a private right of action to compel agencies to issue regulations or complete adjudications that have been unreasonably delayed. The APA allows individuals to sue agencies for unreasonable delays in taking required actions. Courts may dispense with balancing tests if agencies violate statutory deadlines. Judicial remedies are limited, with courts able to compel prompt action but not dictate specific actions. Not all complaints of agency delay can be heard in court. The Supreme Court has ruled that a claim under \u00a7 706(1) can only proceed if an agency fails to take a required discrete and nondiscretionary action. Litigants must show that the agency action sought is both discrete and nondiscretionary. The APA defines \"agency action\" to include rulemaking, orders, licenses, sanctions, relief, or failures to act. Failure to act on a rulemaking petition, denial of a petition, failure to undertake required rulemaking, or failure to issue a final rule are all actionable. A claim under \u00a7 706(1) can proceed if an agency fails to take a required nondiscretionary action, such as rulemaking or issuing a final rule. The necessity of a \"mandatory duty\" reflects that a delay cannot be unreasonable for actions that are not required by law. Clear statutory or regulatory language mandating agency action is necessary for a nondiscretionary duty to act. For example, language stating that an agency \"shall establish minimum standards\" or \"shall promulgate regulations\" creates a nondiscretionary duty. In Anglers Conservation Network v. Pritzker, the court rejected a claim that the National Marine Fisheries Service failed to act to protect overfished river herring and shad in the mid-Atlantic region. The court ruled that the relevant statute did not impose a mandatory duty on NMFS because it only stated that the Secretary of Commerce \"may\" develop a fishery management plan. Similarly, in Center for Biological Diversity v. Zinke, the court could not compel an agency to act despite a delay of more than six years. In Center for Biological Diversity v. Zinke, the court could not compel an agency to act despite a delay of more than six years. The plaintiff sought to compel the Department of the Interior to make a final decision on whether reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act were needed. The court held that the agency only had a duty to review its procedures, not necessarily complete any such review. Courts have found mandatory duties created by ambiguous statutory language, as seen in In re A Community Voice regarding the Paint Hazard Act. EPA was sued to update its dust-lead hazard regulations after eight years of inaction, with the Ninth Circuit ruling that EPA had a duty to do so. The EPA was found to have a duty to update its dust-lead hazard regulations under the Paint Hazard Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, with courts applying the TRAC factors to determine the reasonableness of the delay. The D.C. Circuit outlined six considerations to assess the reasonableness of agency delay in making decisions, emphasizing the importance of timely action, especially in matters concerning human health and welfare. The D.C. Circuit outlined six considerations to assess the reasonableness of agency delay in making decisions, emphasizing the importance of timely action, especially in matters concerning human health and welfare. The TRAC court held that the FCC's five-year delay did not warrant mandamus, relying on the agency's assurance of moving expeditiously. The contextual, six-factor balancing test for agency delay is highly fact-specific and often difficult to predict. The TRAC analysis is seen as a useful tool for courts to evaluate agency delay, with the length of the delay being the most important factor. While there is no set timeframe for what constitutes a reasonable delay, delays of several years are often deemed unreasonable. Exceptions to this rule exist depending on other TRAC factors. Exceptions to the rule of thumb regarding agency delay exist based on various TRAC factors. The second factor, when applicable, provides a yardstick for assessing the reasonableness of the delay, especially when there is no timetable from Congress. The third factor considers the impact on public health or welfare, with courts more willing to compel action in such cases. For example, in Public Citizen Health Research Group v. Auchter, a three-year delay in regulating workplace exposure to ethylene oxide was deemed unreasonable, leading to a court order for a proposed rule within 30 days. The court found a three-year delay in regulating workplace exposure to ethylene oxide (EtO) unreasonable and ordered the agency to issue a proposed rule within 30 days, citing the significant risk to workers' lives and well-being. Factors like agency priorities, interests harmed by the delay, and agency impropriety are considered, with bad faith not necessary for a finding of unreasonable delay. The D.C. Circuit case In re International Chemical Workers Union illustrates how courts apply the TRAC factors to determine unreasonable delay by agencies. In this case, the court found a six-year delay in updating cadmium exposure standards to be excessively long, considering the serious health risks involved. OSHA cited resource constraints and other rulemaking deadlines as reasons for the delay, but the court deemed the delay too lengthy for further extensions. The court found the delay in updating cadmium exposure standards to be excessively long, ordering the agency to issue a final rule within several months. Courts are more receptive to claims when agencies miss statutory deadlines, with some courts compelling agency action in such cases. The Tenth Circuit's decision in Forest Guardians v. Babbitt is a leading case in this regard, where the Secretary of the Interior's delay in designating critical habitat for an endangered species was challenged. The Secretary missed a deadline to list a species as endangered, citing a backlog from a spending moratorium. The Tenth Circuit ruled that courts must compel agency action when deadlines are violated, as \"shall\" means shall. Forest Guardians argued that missed deadlines fall under \"unlawfully withheld,\" while delays without deadlines are \"unreasonably delayed.\" The Ninth Circuit follows the Forest Guardians approach in not balancing TRAC factors for delays with statutory deadlines, while the D.C. Circuit still considers TRAC factors even when deadlines are missed. The D.C. Circuit believes that the violation of a statutory deadline is relevant but not necessarily decisive, as courts have the discretion to decline to compel agency action. Courts have the discretion to decline to compel agency action even if statutory deadlines are violated. In a case involving the FDA missing a deadline for processing generic drug applications, the D.C. Circuit found that equitable relief was not warranted after considering TRAC factors. The court emphasized that granting relief would not benefit society as it would only prioritize one application over others. Unlike statutory deadlines, hammer provisions are self-enforcing, with penalties taking effect automatically. The penalty prescribed in the statute goes into effect if the agency fails to act by the deadline, eliminating the need for a civil suit. The penalty imposed by Congress through the hammer provision may be more severe than any court remedy. Judicial decisions rarely address challenges to compel agency action subject to hammer provisions, as Congress has various means to reduce agency delay. Congress has tools to address agency delays, including oversight powers, sending letters expressing concerns, holding hearings, and using the power of the purse to motivate agencies to act promptly. Congress has the power to address agency delays by appropriating money for new staff, threatening funding cuts, and shaping agency procedures. The APA can be reformed to streamline rulemaking processes."
