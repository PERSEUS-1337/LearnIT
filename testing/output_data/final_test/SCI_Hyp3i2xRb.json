    "content": "The paper introduces the Recurrent Identity Network (RIN) as a solution to the vanishing gradient problem in plain recurrent networks. RINs outperform IRNNs and LSTMs on sequence modeling tasks, showing faster convergence and higher accuracy on various datasets. The curr_chunk discusses various methods to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem in neural networks, including second-order optimization methods, specific training schedules, and special weight initialization methods. Gated Neural Networks (GNNs) like LSTM, GRU, Highway Networks, and Residual Networks are also mentioned as effective in training deep models. In this paper, the authors investigate the application of Iterative Estimation (IE) in recurrent GNNs by analyzing a dual gate design common in LSTM and GRU. They propose a new formulation called Recurrent Identity Network (RIN) which suggests that the use of gates encourages the network to learn an identity mapping, beneficial for training deep architectures. The authors propose a new Recurrent Identity Network (RIN) formulation for plain RNNs, encouraging an identity mapping without gates. RINs use ReLU activation and non-trainable parameters to address the vanishing gradient problem and model long-range dependencies. Compared to IRNNs and LSTMs, RINs show faster convergence in early training stages and competitive performance in various tasks. The proposed RIN network addresses training instability in RNNs with ReLU activation. It maintains consistent representations over input sequences, as shown in Eq. 1. The RIN network addresses training instability in RNNs with ReLU activation by maintaining consistent representations over input sequences. The average estimation error is computed to quantify the expectation of the difference between hidden activations in an LSTM model trained on the adding problem task. The results show that the LSTM model fulfills the view of IE. The LSTM model in Fig. 1 fulfills the view of IE with activation levels close to 0, suggesting an identity mapping. GNNs like LSTM, GRU, Phased-LSTM, and Intersection RNN share a dual gate design with hidden transformation, transform gate, and carry gate. These recurrent layers have trainable parameters and activation functions. The LSTM model in Fig. 1 and other GNNs have dual gate designs with hidden transformation, transform gate, and carry gate. The elements of gates are between 0 and 1, indicating their openness. The initial hidden activation h 0 is conventionally set to 0 to represent a \"void state.\" The final layer output h T can be calculated recursively using Eq. 4. The LSTM model and other GNNs have dual gate designs with hidden transformation, transform gate, and carry gate. The elements of gates are between 0 and 1, indicating their openness. The initial hidden activation h 0 is conventionally set to 0 to represent a \"void state.\" The final layer output h T can be calculated recursively using Eq. 4. According to Eq. 3, a zero-mean residual t describes the difference between the outputs of recurrent steps. Eq. 8 performs an identity mapping when the carry gate C t is always open, while Eq. 9 represents a level of representation formed between h 1 and h t. The term T j=t C j extracts the useful part of this representation, contributing to the final representation of the recurrent layer. The contribution \u03bb t at each recurrent step quantifies the learned representation in step t, managed through the carry gate in a GNN. The LSTM model and other GNNs have dual gate designs with hidden transformation, transform gate, and carry gate. The elements of gates are between 0 and 1, indicating their openness. The Recurrent Identity Network (RIN) is a novel plain recurrent network variant that can learn an identity mapping without the need for a carry gate. It utilizes a non-trainable identity matrix as a \"surrogate memory\" component to preserve the last state. The RIN model uses a \"surrogate memory\" component to maintain past states in recurrent steps. It is compared with IRNN and LSTM in tasks requiring long-range dependency modeling, such as the adding problem. Experimental results are reported on datasets with sequence lengths of 200, 300, and 400, each with 100,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples. The experimental settings involve datasets with sequence lengths of 200, 300, and 400, each with 100,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples. The networks compared are RINs, IRNNs, and LSTMs, each with one hidden layer of 100 units. LSTMs have four times more parameters than RINs and IRNNs. The optimizer used is Adam, batch size is 32, and gradient clipping value is 100. Training is done with a maximum of 300 epochs until convergence. The initial learning rates for IRNNs vary between datasets due to sensitivity to sequence length. Weights are initialized differently for RINs, IRNNs, and LSTMs. No explicit regularization is used, and hyperparameter search is not exhaustive. The baseline MSE is 0.167, achieved by predicting the sum of two numbers. The baseline MSE of the task is 0.167, achieved by predicting the sum of two numbers as 1 regardless of the input sequence. Different test datasets show MSE plots, with RINs and IRNNs performing similarly and outperforming LSTMs. LSTM fails to converge in the dataset with T 3 = 400. RINs, despite some instability with ReLU, generally converge faster and are more stable than IRNNs. IRNNs are sensitive to initial learning rates, with high rates causing training failure. Sequential and Permuted MNIST are used for evaluating RNNs. Sequential MNIST presents each pixel of the image to the network sequentially. The network is trained to classify images by modeling a long sequence of 784 steps. Permuted MNIST is a more challenging task where a random permutation is applied to all images, breaking the association between adjacent pixels. Networks are trained with RMSprop optimizer and a batch size of 128 for a maximum of 500 epochs. Initial learning rate is set to \u03b1 = 10 \u22126 with no explicit regularization. Accuracy performance of the networks is summarized in TAB0. The accuracy performance of networks on Sequential and Permuted MNIST datasets is summarized in TAB0. RINs outperform IRNNs for small network sizes, while both achieve similar performance for bigger networks. RINs converge faster than IRNNs in the early training stage. LSTMs perform the worst in terms of convergence speed and final accuracy. An extended RIN model called RIN-DT increases network depth by performing two hidden transitions per recurrent step. Error signal in RIN-DTs can survive 1568 computation steps. Results showed that the error signal in RIN-DTs can survive 1568 computation steps. Evidence of learning identity mapping was demonstrated empirically by evaluating hidden activations across recurrent steps. Networks maintained consistent activation levels, indicating learning of identity mapping. Variance between recurrent steps was bounded, with larger variances observed in the last 200 steps in IRNN and RIN. Repeated ReLU application may contribute to this effect. Additional experiments in the section exhibited similar behaviors, with complete results in Appendix C. The bAbI dataset consists of 20 question answering tasks that measure language understanding and reasoning performance in neural networks. Each task includes 1,000 training and test samples, with statements, questions, and answers provided in each sample. The answer can be inferred from logically organized statements. The bAbI dataset consists of 20 question answering tasks that measure language understanding and reasoning performance in neural networks. The answer to the question can be inferred from logically organized statements. Networks like RIN, IRNN, and LSTM are compared based on their performance on these tasks. The network design involves embedding words into vectors, encoding statements and questions with recurrent layers, and predicting answers using a softmax layer. The network design for RINs, LSTMs, and IRNNs involves 100 hidden units in all layers, with different initial learning rates and optimizers. The batch size is 32, and each network is trained for a maximum of 100 epochs. Results show that RINs can achieve similar performance to the state-of-the-art. The use of ReLU activation function can lead to instability during training of IRNN for tasks with lengthy statements. In this paper, the Recurrent Identity Network (RIN) is proposed as a variant that can model long-range dependencies without gates. The representation refinement in RNNs is discussed, showing how each recurrent step in a GNN is determined by the representation formed up to that step and the openness of the carry gate in later updates. Special functions in the encoded representations can be sensitive to specific patterns of interest, such as temporal frequency selection in Phased LSTM. The Recurrent Identity Network (RIN) is introduced as a model that can capture long-range dependencies without gates. RINs add non-trainable weights to maintain learned representations across recurrent steps, showing competitive performance against other models like IRNNs and LSTMs. Small RINs achieve higher accuracy in tasks like Sequential and Permuted MNIST, with faster convergence speed in early training phases. RINs are robust to hyperparameters and weight initializations, making them suitable for limited computing resources and time-constrained hyperparameter selection. Using ReLU in RNNs can be beneficial when time is limited for hyperparameter selection. While LSTMs can perform well with fine-tuned hyperparameters, the repeated application of ReLU in RNNs may lead to gradient explosion. The proposed IRNN BID13 reduces this issue, but IRNNs are found to be more sensitive to training parameters compared to RINs and LSTMs. Feedforward models using ReLU tend to yield better results and converge faster than those using tanh or sigmoid activation functions. This paper presents a method to make RNNs less sensitive to training by incorporating ReLU. The experimental results support using ReLU in RNNs to speed up convergence. DiracNet utilizes ResNet concepts with a unique activation function, NCReLU. This paper demonstrates training RNNs without gates or special activation functions, complementing previous findings in BID27. Theoretical basis for the effectiveness of RIN by embedding a non-trainable identity matrix. Future investigations on RIN's faster convergence speed, stability with ReLU, and insensitivity to training parameters compared to other models. GNNs like LSTM, GRU, Phased-LSTM, and Intersection RNN share a dual gate design with hidden transformation, transform gate, and carry gate. In RIN, the elements of transform gate and carry gate are between 0 and 1, indicating the openness of the gate at each neuron. The initial hidden activation is typically set to 0 to represent a \"void state\" at the start of computation. The final layer output can be written as a recursive definition. The final layer output in RIN is defined recursively using element-wise multiplication. A zero-mean residual is used to describe the difference between recurrent step outputs. Eq. 16 is rewritten and rearranged, with additional experiments conducted on Deep Transition Networks (DTNs) for RINs. In RIN-DTs, layers add multiple nonlinear transitions in a single recurrent step, increasing network depth. For Sequential and Permuted MNIST tasks with a sequence length of 784, RIN-DTs have a depth of 1568. The recurrent layer is defined in Eqs. 26-27."
