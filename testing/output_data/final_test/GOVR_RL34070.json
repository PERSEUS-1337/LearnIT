    "content": "The post-9/11 intelligence fusion centers build upon pre-existing state and local law enforcement intelligence units, expanding their scope to include federal, public, and private sector data for analysis. These fusion centers focus on homeland security and counterterrorism issues, representing a significant shift in sub-federal intelligence activities. Fusion centers mark a shift towards involving state and local law enforcement in homeland defense and security, emphasizing a proactive approach to combating terrorism. The National Strategy on Homeland Security highlights the threat of terrorism to the U.S. and the need for a comprehensive response involving all sectors of national power. Intelligence fusion centers, when networked nationally, are seen as a proactive tool in combating global jihadist threats. These centers serve as a central hub for sharing terrorism and law enforcement information with various levels of law enforcement officials. There are over 40 fusion centers in the country, each with unique models and common questions about their effectiveness in addressing pre-9/11 information sharing challenges. Fusion centers aim to address pre-9/11 information sharing challenges and enhance national security. Key questions include ownership, funding, oversight, integration with intelligence and security philosophy, and the balance between security and civil liberties. The lack of a standardized model raises concerns about national benefits and the need for common standards. The role of federal agencies in funding and the existence of an integrated national strategy towards fusion centers are also important considerations. The report will analyze the efficiency, sustainability, risks, and evolution of fusion centers, along with national trends, federal support, and private sector involvement. Legislative options will be presented to Congress for consideration. The report will analyze the efficiency, sustainability, risks, and evolution of fusion centers, along with national trends, federal support, and private sector involvement. Legislative options for consideration include the value proposition of fusion centers in homeland security, the importance of intelligence in preventing terrorist attacks, the need to fuse a broader range of data, and the benefits of fusion activities at the sub-federal level. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified common and unique benefits of fusion centers for both DHS and state/local authorities. Common benefits include improved information gathering, analysis, sharing, and response capabilities. Unique benefits for DHS include enhanced information flow, situational awareness, access to local officials, consultation on local issues, and non-traditional information sources. The unique benefit of fusion centers to state and local authorities, according to DHS, includes improved information flow, increased intelligence expertise, clearly defined entry point, insight into federal priorities, and participation in threat dialogue. The extent of DHS's vision for fusion centers will be addressed in this report, with consideration for the short tenure of DHS personnel at fusion centers. Research suggests that DHS personnel currently serve as a defined entry point rather than tools for improvement. Fusion centers are currently seen more as a \"clearly defined DHS entry point\" rather than tools to enhance intelligence analysis. The development of a process for gathering information based on defined requirements in fusion centers is still in its early stages. Intelligence is crucial in homeland security for prevention efforts, as highlighted by Secretary Chertoff at the First Annual National Fusion Center Conference. The 9/11 Commission emphasizes the importance of good intelligence in preventing wars. The importance of intelligence in preventing terrorist attacks has been emphasized in post-9/11 government reorganizations and legislation. This includes the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2005, and the Intelligence Sharing Environment. Intelligence gathering from non-traditional sources is also crucial in preventing attacks. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the need to fuse domestic and foreign intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks. Fusion centers gather information from various sources like law enforcement, public health, and the private sector to better understand threats and allocate security resources effectively. The Fusion Center Guidelines emphasize data fusion as the exchange and analysis of information from various sources to create actionable intelligence. The Homeland Security Advisory Council stresses the importance of continual fusion processes in identifying terrorism-related leads through the connection of crime-related information with other collected data. Fusion centers play a crucial role in connecting state and local authorities with federal threat intelligence, serving as a vital link for timely dissemination of information. This helps align protective resources in response to events like bombings overseas. Charles Allen from DHS emphasizes the need to expand the defensive perimeter outward. The DHS aims to extend the defensive perimeter by utilizing the national fusion center network for information analysis and action. State and local entities are crucial in collecting information to identify threats and enhance threat assessments. Fusion centers can also aid in preventing various crimes and responding to natural disasters. Secretary Chertoff highlights the importance of intelligence-driven efforts in law enforcement. Organized crime cases are intelligence-driven, with state and local police best placed to detect anomalies in their communities for preventing violent acts. The counterterrorism role of state and local law enforcement has been emphasized, with the belief that they are the \"eyes and ears\" of national security due to their intimate knowledge of their communities. They can recognize anomalous behavior and either intervene immediately or collaborate with the FBI to address criminal behavior. State and local law enforcement, along with fusion centers, work with the FBI to maximize intelligence value from activities. Examples include a narcotics investigation revealing a Hezbollah support cell and a local law enforcement case in Torrance, California. Law enforcement investigations have uncovered various terrorist cells, including a homegrown Jihadist cell and a Hezbollah support cell. These cases show that effective law enforcement can disrupt terrorist plots, especially those carried out by amateur extremist groups with hostile intent. Extremist groups, despite their hostile intent, may be disrupted through law enforcement actions. The effectiveness of current law enforcement methodologies in uncovering sophisticated terrorist operatives and their activities is questioned. Sophisticated terrorists may avoid illegal activities that could expose their plots, making it challenging for traditional law enforcement tools to detect them. Secretary Chertoff emphasizes the importance of fusion centers as tools for connecting the dots to prevent terrorist plots. He clarifies that these centers are controlled by state and local governments, with no intention for federal control. Secretary Chertoff emphasizes the importance of fusion centers as tools for connecting the dots to prevent terrorist plots. The desired \"end state\" is to create a network of fusion centers across the country, visible to both federal and local communities. There is a debate on whether state and local authorities have the resources and experience for advanced analysis needed for true fusion. The risks associated with fusion center development include creating centers without necessary philosophical and organizational changes, diminishing political and popular support, and potential premature establishment without a common understanding of the discipline. The effectiveness of fusion centers in preventing and responding to homeland security threats is questioned if they lack fundamental transformation. Limited information flow, questionable data quality, and lack of personnel with appropriate skills may hinder their value. Fusion centers need to recognize potential indicators of terrorist plots and ensure constituent agencies share a common prevention philosophy. The effectiveness of fusion centers in preventing and responding to homeland security threats is questioned if they lack fundamental transformation. It is important to consider who benefits from fusion centers and how responsibilities, labor, and resources should be divided among state, local, regional, and national interests. The philosophical concern of different intelligence conceptions among intelligence and law enforcement communities may impede fusion center development. Fusion center guidelines, while well-received, have limitations such as being voluntary and lacking practical translation of theory into practice. The essence of fusion centers is the integration and analysis of information for actionable public policy ends, including counterterrorism, counter-crime issues, and disaster response. Utilizing private sector data and a proactive intelligence approach can help prevent crime and undermine sophisticated criminal groups. The fusion center's proactive intelligence approach raises concerns about civil liberties abuses, as balancing effective intelligence efforts with privacy protection is challenging. Surveillance on Americans influenced by terrorist ideologies is a dilemma, as they engage in free speech but could also be plotting attacks. Arguments against fusion centers focus on their pre-emptive law enforcement role. The fusion center concept raises concerns about potential civil liberties violations, as intelligence gathering without a criminal predicate may infringe on privacy rights. There is a risk of individuals without proper training engaging in unlawful intelligence collection. The ACLU warns that the establishment of domestic intelligence agencies like fusion centers poses risks to privacy and civil liberties. The ACLU expresses concerns about granting extraordinary powers to DHS without adequate transparency or safeguards for privacy and civil liberties in fusion centers. Fusion center representatives are aware of the need to respect privacy and civil liberties, with some establishing governance boards for oversight on civil liberty concerns. Some fusion centers have governance boards to oversee civil liberty concerns and claim to have privacy policies. However, there is limited public outreach to explain their intelligence activities. One state center collaborates with a civil liberties organization, shares its procedures publicly, and includes a state attorney general office representative on its board to address civil liberties proactively. Another center has brought in a nonprofit organization for auditing. One state center has invited civil liberties groups to audit their operations and stenciled quotes on their walls promoting free speech. Fusion centers without proactive civil liberties outreach cited lack of need or funds as barriers. Some centers argued against such outreach, claiming no local complaints about civil liberties. Some fusion centers lacked proactive civil liberties outreach due to perceived lack of need or funds. While some centers had done targeted outreach to specific communities, these efforts did not reach a large audience. Suggestions for public relations campaigns were hindered by insufficient funds. Fusion centers operate under federal regulations for criminal intelligence systems. Fusion centers operate under federal regulations, including the Attorney General's Guidelines for FBI National Security Investigations and 28 CFR, Part 23 for criminal intelligence systems. The 28 CFR, Part 23 standard for intelligence collection requires reasonable suspicion for gathering and maintaining criminal intelligence information on individuals involved in criminal conduct. Balancing civil liberties with security is an ongoing concern for Congress and the country. The issue of balancing civil liberties with security is a constant concern for Congress and the nation. The question arises on how aggressive fusion centers should be in collecting intelligence beyond criminal information. There is a need for federal oversight to ensure civil liberties are protected in these state and local government-created centers. Some homeland security observers suggest that state fusion centers, established post-9/11, may dissolve over time without another terrorist attack or natural disaster. State and regional fusion centers could be replaced by regional fusion organizations in the next 5 to 10 years to address issues like lack of perceived need, financial constraints, duplication of effort, and risk reduction. If there are additional terrorist attacks or natural disasters in the near future, fusion centers could receive increased federal, state, and local funds if they prove their value as proactive intelligence hubs. However, a potential risk is the threat of reduced funding if the United States does not experience a successful terrorist attack, leading to possible decreases in homeland security funding and programs supporting fusion centers. The fate of fusion centers amid potential funding cuts is uncertain. Their survival may vary by state based on factors like maturity, agency partnerships, resource needs, and past successes. While some centers could continue with reduced staff and scope, others may struggle without federal support. Many fusion centers may survive despite reduced federal and state funding, as they were established post-9/11 and have support from various levels of government and law enforcement agencies. The Intelligence-Led Policing (ILP) model gained favor in the United States following a drop in crime in Kent, England. It is a collaborative enterprise based on improved intelligence operations and community-oriented policing. Police organizations need to reevaluate their policies and protocols to implement intelligence-led policing effectively. Intelligence-led policing emphasizes the importance of quality analysis of data and the development of analytical techniques. Community-oriented policing and problem-oriented policing also rely on intelligence and situational awareness for crafting proactive law enforcement strategies. These models have influenced support for fusion centers like the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Center model. The HIDTA Center model influenced the rise of state and regional fusion centers post-9/11, with 28 HIDTAs designated since 1990 to coordinate law enforcement efforts. Prior to 9/11, there was interest in replicating the HIDTA model, but lacked political support. After the attacks, some proposals were revised and became fusion centers. The post-9/11 state/regional fusion centers were influenced by the HIDTA model, with some being located or linked with HIDTA centers. The movement towards including sub-federal law enforcement and non-traditional stakeholders in counterterrorism was largely grassroots, led by state and regional leaders. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney advocated for the role of states and locals in this movement. The shift in national security responsibility towards state and local officials is evident, emphasizing the need for intelligence to identify and prevent terrorist threats. This change reflects a belief that regardless of the source of threats, state and local authorities are ultimately responsible for the safety of their citizens. State and local officials, along with law enforcement agencies, feel the federal government has not provided sufficient intelligence to prevent or respond effectively to future attacks. The Homeland Security Advisory Council recognized the traditional role of the federal government in national defense and security, stating that terrorism-related information was historically collected outside the U.S. This highlights the need for improved intelligence sharing to address modern transnational threats. The development of fusion centers post-9/11 has seen two waves, with the second wave gaining momentum after the National Governor's Association meeting in 2005. This collaboration between all levels of government and law enforcement is crucial in addressing transnational threats, especially as potential terrorists may be living in local communities planning attacks within the United States. The National Governor's Association meeting in 2005 highlighted the importance of fusion centers in enhancing intelligence sharing among federal, state, and local governments. This led to the realization that each state should establish a 24/7 \"all source\" information fusion center, with support from elected leaders and law enforcement recognizing the national trend and federal funding. The National Governors Association highlighted the importance of intelligence fusion centers in 2005, leading to the establishment of these centers in each state. The NGA's 2007 guide emphasized the role of fusion centers in enhancing security by facilitating information sharing among local, state, and federal agencies. Other initiatives like the Global Justice Information Sharing Initiative and the Fusion Center Guidelines further supported the growth of fusion efforts at the state and local level. Additionally, some fusion centers credited Hurricane Katrina for reinforcing the need for coordination among multiple agencies. State fusion centers, largely operated by state police or state bureau/division of investigation, have expanded from existing intelligence units to facilitate coordination among multiple agencies. These centers, often state-wide in jurisdiction, have enhanced their capabilities with additional personnel, resources, and a broader mission scope. This evolution has allowed them to be established more quickly compared to newly established centers. State fusion centers, also known as \"state police intelligence on steroids,\" are predominantly regional and located in Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) regions. These centers, often in large cities, involve multiple agencies in their development and operation. Legal authority for fusion centers varies among states, ranging from non-existent to statutes defining their responsibilities. Most fusion centers lack recognition by a governor's executive order or state mandate. State fusion centers, often located in Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) regions, derive their authority from statutes that created state police agencies or bureaus of investigation. They demonstrate establishment through internal policy documentation like policy memoranda, Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), and internal directives. Some centers operated without specific legal authority, relying on partner agency consensus. The Fusion Center Guidelines from DHS and DOJ do not address recommended authorities. The lack of official state recognition of fusion centers could impact future federal funding. States have multiple fusion centers, ranging from two to eight, with some states working well together to prevent information silos. In some states, fusion centers face challenges such as competition, lack of established relationships, and difficulty securing funding due to mandated splits. Fusion centers, established and tested, vary in roles and responsibilities. Some focus on counterterrorism, others have broader missions. The purpose of state and regional fusion centers is debated, with shifting goals over the years. Many fusion centers initially focused on counterterrorism after 9/11, but now less than 15% maintain this sole mission. Many centers have expanded to include all-crimes and/or all-hazards, citing national trends, local buy-in, and resource needs as reasons for the shift. Leadership at some centers believe in adapting to the changing landscape. Many fusion centers have shifted from solely focusing on counterterrorism to including all-crimes and/or all-hazards in their mission. This change was driven by the need for local buy-in, as many law enforcement agencies and public sectors were more concerned with issues like gangs, narcotics, and street crime. By broadening their purpose, fusion centers were able to access a wider array of grants and resources from various partners. About 40% of fusion centers now describe their mission as dealing with \"all-crimes.\" Some fusion centers focused on large-scale, organized crimes like the drug trade, gangs, terrorism, and organized crime, while others were concerned with any crime, large or small. Around 40% of fusion centers also described their mission as dealing with \"all-hazards.\" The term \"all-hazards\" originated from FEMA in the 1980s for developing evacuation plans in response to various emergencies, not just nuclear attacks. It has evolved into a proactive approach to emergency management, emphasized by the federal government post-9/11. The concept includes preparedness for domestic terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. The term \"all-hazards\" has evolved from its origins in FEMA in the 1980s to now include preparedness for domestic terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. Fusion centers have adopted an all-hazards mission with a proactive, prevention-focused stance, with different centers interpreting it in various ways regarding data streams, agency partners, and the center's role. Several fusion centers have an all-hazards focus, aiming to prevent and mitigate both man-made events and natural disasters. They also play a role in post-event response and recovery, influenced by events like Hurricane Katrina. These centers prioritize intelligence sharing and analysis before events, acting as a force multiplier and supporting situational awareness after events. In most cases, fusion centers act as a force multiplier and support structure for Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) during large-scale incidents and disasters. They primarily serve an analytic role and support operations and investigations, with some exceptions. Operational centers are usually owned by a state police agency and staffed by law enforcement personnel. State-wide centers, owned by one agency, have a closer relationship with field personnel. Fusion centers, typically owned by state police agencies, have a direct relationship with field personnel and support operations and investigations. They provide operational support, including responding to incident scenes, assisting with investigations, and tasking collectors. Most fusion centers focus on prevention, with some states directing more attention towards prevention due to separate emergency management organizations. Fusion centers primarily focus on prevention by enhancing information sharing, conducting threat assessments, and supporting preparedness efforts. They serve as intelligence relay centers, facilitate coordination, and analyze information to identify relevant data from various agencies. Fusion centers collaborate with law enforcement agencies to gather and distribute relevant information, supplementing existing products with local data. They respond to inquiries, citizen tips, and provide case support to various agencies. While involved in different steps of the intelligence cycle, none cover all steps. Fusion centers play a key role in emergency response activities, supporting the emergency operations center during events. Some centers have a reserved seat at the EOC and send analysts to command posts to relay information. The majority of fusion centers focus on prevention and mitigation of threats. Many fusion centers advocate a proactive stance in preventing threats, departing from traditional reactive policing. However, research shows that most fusion centers still operate reactively, responding to incoming requests and suspicious activity reports. This approach may only identify unsophisticated criminals and terrorists, as seen in the 2007 Fort Dix plot example. The fusion centers struggle with adopting a proactive prevention approach to information analysis and sharing, hindering their ability to identify potential terrorists within their midst. The fusion centers aim to prevent criminal and terrorist acts by analyzing intelligence and filling gaps in information sharing. Post-9/11, there were issues with sharing information between federal and local agencies, hindering all-source analysis efforts. Federal intelligence agencies have made efforts to provide security clearances to state and local personnel, with most fusion centers having multiple staff with Secret clearances. On average, fusion centers have 14 staff with Secret clearances out of approximately 27 full-time persons. The fusion centers interviewed for the report had approximately 27 full-time staff members with varying levels of security clearances, including Secret, Top Secret, and Top Secret-SCI. There was a delay in obtaining necessary equipment for storing classified intelligence despite clearances being granted. The FBI provided most initial security clearances for state and local authorities post-9/11, with 6,011 clearances authorized by August 2005. The FBI initially provided security clearances for state and local authorities post-9/11, with 6,011 clearances authorized by August 2005. Fusion centers reported that DHS has started conducting security clearances for state and local personnel, with some centers turning to DHS after the FBI stopped offering clearances. Issues remain regarding reciprocity among agencies in recognizing clearances, hindering access to facilities and computer systems. State and local authorities have increased access to classified information systems through systems designed for law enforcement and public sector use. DHS created portals like HSIN and HSDN for information sharing with state and local agencies. Plans are in place to replace or upgrade HSIN for more efficient sharing of homeland security information. Fusion centers have a significant number of cleared state and local personnel. Access to threat intelligence and information for state and local personnel at fusion centers has increased through collocation with federal agencies. This access is often indirect, requiring federal officials to retrieve information on behalf of fusion center staff. Fusion centers collocated with FBI's JTTF or FIG have indirect or direct access to FBI information systems. Fusion centers without collocation but with federal agency detailees also have indirect access. Some fusion centers are building their own secure rooms for direct access to these systems. The support for sharing sensitive information with state and local law enforcement, fusion centers, and other public sector entities has increased. Efforts are being made to shift from a \"need to know\" to a \"responsibility to share\" rule for information sharing. The DNI's office is prioritizing addressing security restrictions that hinder effective information sharing, led by the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE). However, there are concerns about whether the PM-ISE has sufficient authority to implement initiatives across all government levels. Fusion centers receive a significant amount of information from federal agencies, but some officials question the effectiveness of this information sharing. Many state fusion center leaders struggle to receive relevant threat intelligence efficiently from federal agencies. The lack of incentives and penalties for information sharing within the Intelligence Community has been criticized. It is unclear if requirements for sharing apply to state and local authorities and the private sector, and how effectiveness is assessed. Both H.R. 1 and S. 4 bills aim to improve information sharing between federal and sub-federal agencies. Despite some improvements since 9/11, state and local fusion centers still find federal information sharing to be reactive rather than proactive. Fusion center officials note that they receive intelligence when requested, but federal agencies need to be more proactive in reaching out to them. Federal agencies are not proactive in reaching out to state and regional fusion centers, leading to a lack of feedback and misconception about the availability of intelligence systems. Many states do not have sophisticated intelligence management systems, and even those that do may not have access to all the data pools as perceived. For example, one mature center reported having access to only 30% of the data. One mature fusion center reported having access to only 30% of law enforcement data, which is better than most. There is a misconception that fusion centers have access to vast amounts of private sector data, but this is largely unfounded. The flow of information from the private sector to fusion centers is sporadic and manually facilitated. The private sector is wary of sharing data with fusion centers due to concerns about lack of government safeguards, industrial espionage, and privacy issues. There is a lack of coordination in adopting information management systems nationally, leading to difficulties in systems working together at state and regional levels. Despite federal efforts to promote the use of XML, fusion centers and states still purchase systems that operate using proprietary language, causing interoperability issues. Currently, fusion center officials face challenges with multiple federal information sharing systems, including HSIN, LEO, RISS, among others. The lack of mandatory guidance and funding concerns contribute to the issue. Fusion center officials struggle with the usability and security of multiple federal information sharing systems, leading to challenges in receiving and passing on information to federal agencies. Contradictory messages from Washington regarding streamlining dissemination channels and promoting individual agency \"pet projects\" at the state and local level further complicate the situation. Several fusion center officials mentioned problems related to the different requirements federal agencies have for creating secure spaces to house their classified information systems. The lack of reciprocity and coordination between federal agencies results in increased costs for fusion centers. Construction of secure spaces for classified intelligence systems can cost significantly more than conventional office space, with estimates ranging from $200-$500 per square foot. Some fusion centers reported estimated costs between $75,000-$100,000 to build each secure space. The 9/11 Commission Report identified systematic over-classification of intelligence as a barrier to information sharing. Fusion centers face high costs to build secure spaces for federal agencies with different security requirements. Some centers were advised to create multiple secure spaces, with costs borne by the center. The federal government's slow response to address over-classification hinders information sharing. The lack of standardization in classification designations and dissemination guidelines hinders information sharing among intelligence and law enforcement agencies. A 2006 GAO study revealed that federal agencies use 56 different designations for sensitive but unclassified information, leading to confusion and difficulties in sharing information. State and local agencies also face challenges in sharing sensitive but unclassified information. The lack of standardization in classification designations and dissemination guidelines hinders information sharing among intelligence and law enforcement agencies. State and local agencies also face challenges in sharing sensitive but unclassified information due to confusion and a lack of common standards. The Controlled Unclassified Initiative (CUI) aims to reduce the number of SBU designations to three, providing clear instructions for security. The Controlled Unclassified Initiative aims to reduce the number of SBU designations to three, with clear instructions for security, handling, and dissemination. Efforts to address over-classification through the IRTPA have not resulted in issued guidelines, leading to potential gaps in threat information sharing. The report proposes separating intelligence data from sources and methods to increase information sharing. Security designations may not always be necessary as intelligence often comes from open sources. Fusion center officials were interviewed for the report. The majority of fusion center officials interviewed for the report were not concerned with sources and methods, but rather with the credibility and corroboration of threats. Federal government agencies have provided financial support to state fusion centers, with states covering 80% of the budgets. Some state leaders appreciate the funding, while others question the effectiveness of federal support. The federal government's support for state fusion centers has raised concerns among officials about potential prescriptive requirements. Funding from programs like the State Homeland Security Program and Urban Area Security Initiative must allocate at least 80% to local jurisdictions, hindering efforts to channel funds towards statewide fusion center initiatives. This policy has led to the creation of regional fusion centers within states. The creation of regional fusion centers within states has been driven by required spending splits. Funding for fusion centers varies greatly, with some centers relying on state funds for support. Annual budgets for fusion centers range from tens of thousands to several million dollars, with funding sources differing significantly between centers. Some fusion centers rely on federal grants for funding, while others depend on state and local funds. On average, federal funding makes up about 31% of fusion center budgets. These centers are primarily law enforcement focused but are expanding to include non-sworn officers and homeland security partners. Staffing levels range from 3 to nearly 250 full-time personnel, with an average of 27 full-time staff. Part-time personnel at fusion centers range from 0 to over 100, with federal representation being a small percentage but impactful. Law enforcement personnel, mainly from state agencies, dominate participation in fusion centers. Local law enforcement agencies are also represented, with most fusion centers being state-wide entities originating from state police intelligence units. The majority of local law enforcement agencies represented in fusion centers are from the largest police departments, which often have intelligence units. However, many local law enforcement agencies may not have their own intelligence or analytic units, as reported by RAND in 2004. Many local law enforcement agencies lack intelligence units, hindering their ability to contribute personnel to fusion centers. Despite having analysts, manpower constraints often prevent full-time dedication to the center. Some agencies question the cost-benefit of participating in fusion centers, leading to reluctance in detailing personnel. Fusion centers prioritize hiring crime and intelligence analysts, with a mix of tactical and strategic roles. Fusion centers have hired contract analysts using homeland security funds, but the length of contracts has been problematic. All-hazards centers are more likely to have non-criminal justice personnel from various public sector partners. Some fusion centers described as all-hazards lack non-law enforcement personnel. Almost all fusion centers studied have federal presence, with federal agencies playing varying roles and sizes of detailee staff. Federal participation influences government relationships, access to information, intelligence flow, and intelligence cycle functions. Around 30% of fusion centers are collocated with federal agencies, impacting their development, operation, and budget demands. Contact between federal agencies and fusion centers directly correlates with their interactions. There is a direct correlation between contact with a federal agency and a fusion center's positive outlook on their relationship. Fusion centers collocated with a federal agency tend to have favorable relationships with them. However, collocation and praise for inter-agency coordination do not always lead to enhanced organizational effectiveness. Many fusion center leaders still need to inquire about information not shared by federal employees. The relationship between fusion centers and federal agencies is influenced by collocation and the presence of federal representatives. Fusion center directors often mention a close relationship with local FBI entities due to the large number of detailees from those entities. Federalism is a central theme in leveraging fusion centers for public safety and homeland security purposes, presenting various challenges. One challenge in supporting state and local fusion centers for public safety and homeland security purposes is maintaining their identity and community support while meeting national needs for threat information. Balancing state autonomy with federal guidance is crucial, especially when it comes to the types of threat information required by different levels of government. The challenge in supporting state and local fusion centers lies in balancing state autonomy with federal guidance, especially regarding threat information. Federalism plays a significant role in coordinating resources and addressing issues such as the legal treatment of terrorism and privacy laws at both state and federal levels. The federal government's role in supporting fusion centers and the products/services they produce with federal funding became a central question after the 2001 terrorist attacks. While some fusion centers were established before 2004, concrete federal financial support didn't come until Fiscal Year 2004, with $29 million from the Homeland Security Grant Program. Federal guidance and human capital support followed in 2005 and 2006, respectively. In 2006, human capital support from DHS and FBI detailees began at fusion centers. While DHS provided financial support through HSGP, the FBI offered support for security clearances and personnel. The federal government played a role in guiding fusion centers post-9/11 to involve state, local governments, and the private sector in homeland security. The rise of state and regional fusion centers is part of a movement to decentralize homeland security, involving non-traditional stakeholders at all levels of government. This includes technical assistance, training, financial resources, human resources, and assistance for information sharing between federal and state/local entities. Congressional hearings and federal regulations also play a role in supporting fusion centers. The federal government has recognized the need for greater state and local participation in homeland security post-9/11 attacks. The 2002 National Strategy for Homeland Security emphasizes shared responsibility and partnership with Congress, state/local governments, private sector, and the public. Even before 9/11, the Department of Justice worked on sharing public safety and criminal information across government levels. The Department of Justice established the Global Justice Information Sharing Initiative in 1998 to facilitate sharing criminal information across government levels. In 2003, the National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan was released to connect federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies for intelligence sharing to combat terrorism and crime. Fusion centers and their role in information sharing were not addressed until federal fusion center guidelines were issued in July 2005 under the DOJ's Global. The Homeland Security Advisory Council's Intelligence and Information Sharing Working Group issued Fusion Center Guidelines in 2005 and 2006, in collaboration with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. These guidelines aim to establish and operate fusion centers at local, state, and federal levels for sharing information and intelligence among law enforcement, public safety, and the private sector. The Fusion Center Guidelines were supported by various law enforcement organizations and validated existing policies and activities for advanced fusion centers. However, some centers found the guidelines lacking a national strategy and technical aspects. The DHS and DOJ-sponsored fusion center program offers seven technical assistance services to aid in fusion center development, including orientation, governance, privacy policy development, and liaison officer program development. Participants have found these services to be somewhat useful, but suggest a more sustained mentorship based on a national strategy. Federal financial support for fusion centers, primarily through the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP), has been provided by Congress. Past funding activities by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have been somewhat unclear, with over $380 million reported to have been allocated from 2001 to 2006. Additional funding was provided in fiscal years 2004-2006 to establish fusion centers. The Department of Homeland Security provided $131 million in fiscal years 2004-2006 to establish or enhance fusion centers. There is a discrepancy of $250 million between the reported funding and the actual allocation, attributed to time and differences in requested versus actual funding data. Empirical research suggests that the reported funding allocated to fusion centers by DHS may not reach the centers themselves due to discrepancies in allocation at the state level. This discrepancy could be attributed to how DHS defines fusion centers and calculates funding. An example provided by a fusion center leader highlighted how personnel hired using DHS funds were later reassigned to non-fusion center efforts. DHS relies on state and local reporting for calculating DHS-funded activities at fusion centers. DHS-funded activities at fusion centers rely on state and local reporting through the State Bi-Annual Strategy Implementation Reports (BSIR) in the Grants Reporting Tool (GRT). DHS searches GRT databases using keyword search terms like terrorism intelligence and emergency preparedness. Limitations exist in accuracy as not all projects are labeled as \"fusion center activities.\" Information is based on grant recipients' input into the GRT. The methodology of calculating DHS-funded projects related to fusion centers has limitations, such as unclear data on requested versus actual amounts. Funding allocation for fusion center activities should be tracked accurately, considering the historical context of support from DHS and DOJ since 2001. Grants for fusion centers follow HSGP Guidelines, with increasing direct language on fusion center activities. Federal funding for fusion centers has been used for start-up costs, technology, and infrastructure investments in recent years. While there is no specific \"fusion center grant program,\" funding has been allocated through federal homeland security grant cycles for various fusion center-related activities. The allocation of funds should be accurately tracked to support the development of a national network of fusion centers. Federal funding for fusion centers has been used for start-up costs, technology, and infrastructure investments. In the last two years, federal grants funded analyst slots and training at fusion centers. The salaries of federal employees and collocation costs are also covered. Questions arise about attaching conditions to funding while maintaining state and local priorities. From a business perspective, the federal government expects a return on its investment in fusion centers, beyond enhanced information sharing. The challenge lies in determining sustainment funding for these centers, which supports personnel costs and information connectivity. Secretary Chertoff mentioned that DHS has provided over $300 million in grant funding to support fusion centers. The DHS has provided over $300 million in grant funding to support fusion centers, helping them establish baseline capabilities. However, this funding is not meant for long-term sustainment, and communities are expected to invest in maintaining these law enforcement tools. The Administration acknowledges the importance of fusion centers and aims to target resources to help them mature. The Administration recognizes the significance of fusion centers and the need for sustained funding to ensure their success. Representative Jane Harman expressed concerns about the lack of funding, emphasizing that without adequate resources, fusion centers may not survive. DHS Chief Intelligence Officer also shared funding concerns, highlighting the importance of creating a sustainable fusion center capability at the non-Federal level. The DHS, in partnership with DOJ, supports fusion centers through grants and technical assistance. If federal funding is cut, centers may focus more on state and local issues rather than federal homeland security concerns. The definition of fusion center \"maturity\" from a federal perspective is yet to be determined. The federal government assesses fusion center \"maturity\" and performance metrics to determine resource allocation. Two levels of federal human capital support are provided to fusion centers: individuals with contact with the centers and federal detailees. The federal government assesses fusion center \"maturity\" and performance metrics to determine resource allocation. Two levels of federal human capital support are provided to fusion centers: individuals with contact with the centers and federal detailees, including FBI and DHS representatives. Questions arise about the coordination and deployment criteria of FBI and DHS personnel to fusion centers, their roles, and the value they add to operations and analysis. The FBI and DHS do not have a joint strategy for interaction with fusion centers. The lack of a national strategy raises concerns about resource allocation and coordination with state and local agencies. The allocation of human resources to fusion centers is a central issue. Funding criteria based on risk, maturity, and individual center needs may lead to disparities in resource allocation. Lack of a clear definition of a \"mature\" center hampers long-term partnership between federal government and fusion centers. FBI detailees have well-defined roles compared to DHS representatives. DHS officials place representatives at fusion centers based on needs. Roles for DHS personnel vary, including intelligence analysts, coordinators, and grant advisors. Critics argue that tasks outside of core information sharing hinder the primary purpose of DHS detailees. Overall, fusion centers with DHS representatives describe their relationships with the agency. Overall, fusion centers have a more favorable relationship with the FBI than with DHS. Fusion centers are more comfortable with the FBI due to a common lexicon and world view shared within the law enforcement community. State fusion center personnel are still figuring out how to interact with DHS, a relatively new entity. Many state and local law enforcement and fusion center staff have concerns about sharing sensitive information with the Department, which often involves non-law enforcement personnel. Fusion centers have taken steps to restrict DHS analysts' access to certain portals and information sharing calls. State fusion center leadership often feels there is a lack of coordination between the FBI and DHS, leading to duplicative resource allocations. The majority of terrorism-related issues are directed to local JTTFs, with the FBI deciding whether to investigate or return the lead. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has requested state fusion centers to report any suspicious incidents that may be perceived as terrorist activity. There is confusion on where this information should be transmitted, leading to concerns about potential threats not being properly addressed due to a lack of clear federal roles and responsibilities. Recommendations include better coordination between the Department of Justice (DOJ) and DHS. Recommendation: DOJ and DHS, in consultation with the Program Manager's Office, should develop standards for communicating State, local, and tribal data on terrorist risks to federal authorities and private sector entities. They should also maintain and disseminate assessments of terrorist risks gathered at the state, local, or tribal levels, and ensure that Suspicious Incident Reports and Suspicious Activity Reports are reported to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Fusion centers are currently inefficient in disseminating information, highlighting a lack of coordination between federal agencies. The fusion center officials are frustrated with multiple, competing information systems promoted by federal agencies, leading to inefficiencies. Congress and the Administration created the Information Sharing Environment to enhance horizontal and vertical information sharing between all stakeholders. The Program Manager for ISE, located within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, is working on integrating systems. The Program Manager for ISE is integrating fusion centers into a broad initiative to enhance information sharing between federal, state, and local law enforcement, public safety entities, and the private sector. The concept of intelligence/information fusion is seen as crucial for sharing homeland security-related information at the national level. The ISE will establish a Federal Fusion Center Coordination Group to support the development of State-sponsored fusion centers for information sharing. The curr_chunk discusses the integration of State-sponsored fusion centers to share information at all levels of the ISE, recommending funding options and designating a single hub for communication with the Federal government. These initiatives aim to enhance information sharing between federal, state, and local public safety and law enforcement officials. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 established the Interagency Threat Assessment Coordination Group (ITACG) as the federal agency responsible for facilitating intelligence flow to state and local homeland security entities. State and local personnel participate in ITACG at the National Counterterrorism Center to understand federal intelligence, while federal personnel learn about state and local perspectives. The ITACG aims to enhance intelligence sharing between federal agencies and state/local governments through fusion centers. It remains unclear how ITACG will interact with existing FBI and DHS dissemination channels. The goal is to streamline threat assessment information sharing, but concerns exist about potential overlap with current processes. The ITACG aims to streamline intelligence flow to state and local authorities, potentially becoming the arbiter for fusion center information coordination. Federal agencies rely on local level information for national threat assessments, supported by Congress through funding and hearings. During the 109th and 110th Congress, multiple hearings were held to discuss intelligence sharing, DHS Intelligence, and fusion centers. Witnesses included representatives from federal agencies like the FBI, DHS, and Office of the DNI, as well as state and local agencies such as the Illinois State Police, Virginia Fusion Center, and others. Private sector representatives from companies like The Boeing Company also participated in the hearings. During the 109th and 110th Congress, hearings were held to discuss intelligence sharing, DHS Intelligence, and fusion centers. Witnesses included representatives from federal agencies like the FBI, DHS, and Office of the DNI, as well as state and local agencies such as the Illinois State Police, Virginia Fusion Center, and private sector representatives from companies like The Boeing Company. DHS-OIA funding levels for detailing intelligence professionals to fusion centers are classified due to OIA being part of the U.S. Intelligence Community. Additional funding was provided to the DHS Analysis and Operations account for support of the State and Local Fusion Center Program. Fusion centers operate under federal regulation 28 CFR, Part 23. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Street Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-351) mandates guidelines for multi-jurisdictional law enforcement information systems funded by federal grants. 28 CFR, Part 23 requires information validation and purge within five years, with a focus on \"need to know\" and \"right to know.\" The regulation may need updating for current threat environments, as it primarily addresses traditional crime rather than terrorism. The federal regulation 28 CFR, Part 23, focuses on information retention for traditional crime rather than terrorism. It may need updating to address current threat environments and advancements in technology. The regulation promotes a \"need and right to know\" standard, potentially hindering effective information flow between intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The relationship and role of the private sector in state fusion centers is not fully defined or embraced, hindering effective information sharing. While some centers have engaged with critical infrastructure owners, most have not established processes to support consistent information flow. Very few state and regional fusion centers have infrastructure sector representatives, relying on open-source information, federal data, or contract vendors for threat information. Reasons for the lack of private sector relationships include prioritizing sectors based on risk, lack of understanding of the role of sector representatives, and a lack of federal guidance on incorporating private sector data. ISAC organizations provide members with threat-related data and services. ISAC organizations offer threat-related data and services to members. Fusion centers can improve information sharing by strengthening relationships with private sector entities through education and information exchange efforts. This collaboration may enhance preparedness and prevention efforts in homeland security. The Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program can assist fusion centers in assessing risks and responding to potential situations at critical infrastructure facilities. Sharing PCII data with state fusion centers may enhance incident response coordination efforts for state and local authorities in homeland security. Some homeland security observers caution that increasing available information may not improve understanding of risks. Programs like ADVISE aim to analyze data for strategic warnings and indications, potentially aiding fusion centers in threat assessment and response coordination. Some express concerns about the potential misuse of private sector data as fusion centers collaborate with intelligence agencies, raising worries about the encroachment on civil liberties by state governments. This relationship could lead to state entities acting on behalf of the federal government in ways that violate privacy laws, with no federal remedy for every issue identified. The report discusses the challenges and potential options related to fusion centers, with a focus on federal remedies and Congressional involvement. Congressional remedies could include oversight of federal agencies, requesting Executive Branch action, and establishing a statutory basis for fusion centers. The report discusses challenges and options for fusion centers, suggesting Congressional oversight, Executive Branch action, and a national strategy. Congress may consider adjusting funding levels and performance benchmarks for fusion centers. One option for Congress is to recommend drafting a cross-agency national strategy with input from various agencies and fusion center representatives. The strategy could address ownership, federal versus state roles, permanence, funding, and performance measures of fusion centers. The curr_chunk discusses the relationship between fusion centers and the federal government, including how performance is measured, coordination with various agencies, integration into the federal intelligence community, and the pros and cons of creating a national strategy for fusion centers. The curr_chunk highlights the need for a national strategy for fusion centers to ensure their effectiveness and impact on a national level. This strategy would address politically sensitive issues like joint deployment strategies for federal agencies and resolve other sensitive topics to create a cohesive structure for the numerous fusion centers across the country. Failure to comprehensively address these issues may result in limited national impact for fusion centers. The success of fusion centers depends on government perception and implementation of goals. Funding sustainability is a key concern for leaders. Federal aid conditions for fusion centers are limited, with voluntary guidelines in place. There is a lack of formal auditing for civil liberties protection and intelligence use. The funding for fusion centers relies on HSGP grants, with state and local fusion centers competing for funding among other homeland security initiatives. Congressional action may be needed to define national goals and objectives for fusion centers. Fusion centers compete for funding among various homeland security initiatives. There is no dedicated funding stream for fusion centers, raising concerns about their future sustainability without a change in funding approach. Arguments for maintaining the current funding model suggest it would provide continuity, but the lack of a dedicated funding stream may jeopardize fusion centers' ability to continue their functions. The current funding model for fusion centers may result in minimal disruption, but maintaining the status quo could perpetuate uncertainty about sustainable federal aid. Alterations to the grant program, such as increasing grant cycle durations, could address hurdles in funding flow to fusion center projects. Increasing grant cycle durations could provide continuity for intelligence analysts and allow for autonomy in funding allocation to state-wide fusion centers, with audits ensuring accountability. This adjustment to the HSGP funding model aims to facilitate the flow of federal homeland security funds to fusion centers. The creation of a narrowly targeted \"Fusion Center\" grant category could provide the federal government with leverage to condition funding on compliance with Fusion Center Guidelines. Arguments against this option include setting a precedent for similar programs and potentially undermining current federal funding approaches for homeland security functions. The creation of a fusion center grant program could fund critical homeland security functions like protecting national infrastructure and transportation security. This could establish a national network of fusion centers to benefit long-term national security interests. The development of standards and metrics for fusion centers could help allocate federal funding based on national benefits. This cooperative effort between federal, state, and local representatives could establish minimum capability levels and maturity thresholds for funding allocation. However, the complexity of this approach may pose implementation challenges and incentivize states to manipulate their maturity levels to retain funding. The implementation of performance metrics and funding thresholds for fusion centers could create certainty for states in planning and targeting funding streams. Collaboration between federal, state, and local agencies is crucial for effective metrics development and center evaluation. Congress, along with input from various agencies, could determine specific criteria for funding allocation. The federal government, in collaboration with DHS, FBI, and ODNI's PM-ISE, may identify key fusion center functions that provide direct benefits and warrant sustainable federal financial support. This could involve supporting state-wide intelligence systems and intelligence analysis. A pilot program could be implemented to assess the federal benefits of directly supporting these functions. Arguments against this approach may include concerns about exceeding federal government expectations. The approach of providing sustainable federal financial support to fusion centers could go beyond current government support, potentially increasing federal outlays and creating a sense of entitlement. Arguments in favor include providing certainty in funding and simplifying the process after an initial period of seed funding. Lessons could be learned from other federal programs. Federal support and cultivation of skills within fusion centers could benefit national interests, acting as a \"force multiplier\" for federal efforts. Enhanced and uniform fusion center training is necessary for effective information fusion and proactive prevention. The diversity of professionals in fusion centers may lead to differing perspectives. The importance of common understanding and training in fusion centers is highlighted, with a focus on intelligence and civil liberties training. This is seen as crucial for ensuring cohesiveness, clarity of vision, and productivity within the center. The federal government may require funding for state fusion centers to be used for civil liberties training with a focus on private sector data concerns. Congress could make this training a precondition for receiving federal grants, with oversight from a designated federal entity. Collaboration between the Intelligence Community and law enforcement is suggested to develop a common intelligence lexicon and definitions. The federal government may require funding for state fusion centers to be used for civil liberties training with oversight from a designated federal entity. Collaboration between the Intelligence Community and law enforcement is suggested to develop a common intelligence lexicon and definitions, ensuring all entities engaged in homeland security are working from the same playbook. The PM - ISE could coordinate efforts to create enhanced and standardized national fusion center training for a common \"dictionary of intelligence.\" Arguments in favor include preventing over-aggressive or under-aggressive intelligence postures in fusion centers. Creating standards and common definitions for intelligence in fusion centers could greatly enhance information sharing. Arguments against this include the belief that there is no difference between \"pure\" intelligence and criminal intelligence, and the difficulty of coordinating with the numerous agencies involved. Training in civil liberties may be necessary to prevent privacy violations and maintain public support for fusion centers. Enhanced and periodic re-fresher training in civil liberties for fusion center personnel is important. Initial training on privacy and civil liberties is provided, but it is usually static. Enhanced training could include real-life examples of privacy violations and lessons learned. Annual re-fresher training on First Amendment rights and national standards/guidelines would be beneficial. PM-ISE issued privacy guidelines in 2006 that could be utilized by fusion centers. The guidelines issued by PM-ISE in December 2006 for fusion centers may not have a significant impact in their current form, as they are vague, focused on federal agencies, and voluntary. Arguments for and against enhanced training in civil liberties for fusion center personnel include resource constraints and historical lessons from COINTELPRO abuses. Training on 28 CFR, Part 23, a federal regulation on multi-jurisdictional intelligence systems, is also important. Many law enforcement agencies in fusion centers received initial training on 28 CFR Part 23 regulations from DOJ or contractors, but follow-up training has been lacking. Fusion centers facilitate training for staff at the state and local level, but consistency in application of the regulation is unclear. Fusion centers are urged to be proactive in preventing issues related to 28 CFR Part 23. Fusion centers are encouraged to be proactive in preventing future attacks, but also cautioned against being too aggressive. Additional training and legal resources may be beneficial to clarify legitimate activities and ensure civil liberties are protected. Training and legal resources for fusion centers can provide consistent legal advice and help entities facing fiscal crises. Some argue against such training due to resource constraints. Fusion centers benefit from short-term DHS/DOJ Technical Assistance Programs but desire longer-term mentoring for sustainability. Formal mentoring programs could pair centers at different maturity levels to share best practices. Pairing fusion centers of varying maturity levels to share best practices and overcome common obstacles is proposed. Arguments against include existing informal mentor relationships and resources constraints. Arguments in favor highlight the minor addition to the Technical Assistance Program and the potential for centers to learn from each other. Official guidelines for mentor relationships may not be necessary. The federal government may require new lessons learned to be added to the DHS Lessons Learned Information Sharing database. State fusion centers express interest in expanding relationships with the private sector but are behind in development. Information sharing with the private sector is ad hoc and inconsistent, with fusion centers not systematically incorporating private sector data into their efforts. Some centers are interested in better utilizing private sector data. The importance of incorporating new types of data, including from private sector sources, into intelligence fusion processes for comprehensive risk assessment is highlighted. However, concerns about potential misuse of personal or corporate data and the inefficiency of massive private data collection efforts are raised. It is suggested that focusing on known criminal leads may be a more effective use of resources. Arguments for increasing interaction between fusion centers and the private sector focus on improving access to terrorism-related information. Some believe this collaboration can enhance understanding of the threat environment and potentially prevent future terrorist attacks. However, critics argue that sharing large amounts of private sector data with fusion centers may not significantly increase security and could lead to civil liberty abuses. The potential civil liberty abuses of private sector data in fusion centers outweigh the benefits of combining it with terrorism-related information. Some fusion centers have proactive public outreach strategies, while others have minimal interaction due to resource constraints. It is important for fusion centers to have a public message consistent with their mission to gain public support and understanding for their long-term viability. The law enforcement elements of fusion centers are responsible for community knowledge and anomaly detection. Public outreach can encourage reporting of suspicious behavior. Arguments for and against outreach programs are largely resource-based, with concerns about funding and staffing. Advocates believe centers should serve a public mission openly to avoid negative perceptions. The need for additional intelligence training for SLT personnel at fusion centers is highlighted, along with the suggestion for federal agency detailees to assist in this process. Congress may consider urging DHS, the FBI, and other agencies with detailees at fusion centers to train their staff on handling classified intelligence effectively. DNI Michael McConnell's \"Focus Area 5: Accelerate Information Sharing\" in the 100 Day Plan for Integration and Collaboration emphasizes enhancing information sharing within the intelligence community and formalizing fusion centers. This could involve field personnel assisting in information sharing, but federal agencies may prefer to retain authority at headquarters. Congress may need to consider taking action on this option to establish linkages between fusion centers and the federal intelligence community. The Interagency Threat Assessment Coordination Group (ITACG) was proposed in 2006 and 2007 to facilitate coordinated information sharing within the intelligence community. Prior to this, there was limited interaction between federal intelligence agencies and state/local law enforcement. The ITACG was established in 2007 at the National Counter Terrorism Center to improve information sharing between federal agencies and state/local law enforcement. However, there are concerns about its effectiveness and security issues with unauthorized communications. The National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) faces security concerns regarding unauthorized communications between state and local representatives, which could complicate federal threat assessments. Cross-training and mutual learning are seen as important for improving communication between federal and state intelligence officials. State and local fusion center personnel can learn about intelligence volumes and limitations from federally coordinated products at the national level. Federal officials can understand the needs of state and local personnel through interaction, improving tailored intelligence products. The proposed ITACG would develop intelligence products for dissemination to fusion centers, but not engage in formal threat assessments. Increasing cross-training for state fusion center analysts could enhance analytical capabilities. The text discusses the potential benefits of increasing collaboration between state fusion center analysts and the NCTC's ITACG, as well as the idea of offering NCTC analysts the opportunity to work at a fusion center. It also considers the argument against such exchanges, questioning the necessity of where analytical skills are practiced. There is a lack of resources and capacity for strategic analytical assessment at state and local fusion centers. Arguments for integrating NCTC and fusion center analysts include better understanding of each other's perspectives and potential for cross-training. One way to prevent terrorism is to aggressively use all existing law enforcement tools. Fusion centers can help direct resources to areas of greatest threat, but it is uncertain if sophisticated terrorists engage in criminal activity before planning catastrophic attacks. The potential for a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) focused on the nexus between terrorism and crime is discussed. The report could involve input from fusion centers to analyze the linkage between criminal and terrorist activities in the United States and overseas. Findings could inform the allocation of protective resources domestically. A National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on the nexus between terrorism and crime is debated. Arguments against include existing cases showing a link, while arguments for highlight the potential to inform counterterrorism efforts and enhance fusion centers' understanding of potential threats. Fusion centers aim to improve their strategic understanding of terrorism precursor crimes by streamlining information sharing with the federal Intelligence Community. Developing a robust feedback loop for bi-directional information flow is crucial for efficient handling of information requests. Some fusion centers have intelligence collection requirements and plans in place to address potential threats, such as anticipating simultaneous al Qaeda attacks in their areas of responsibility. Fusion centers often feel that the information they provide to federal agencies goes into a \"black box\" with little feedback on its value or use. They struggle to receive timely follow-up information and are left unsure if the information they pass on is significant or not. Fusion centers are frustrated by the lack of feedback and communication from federal agencies, leading to resentment. State and regional officials feel disheartened when their locally gathered information is not used systematically. The absence of feedback is a key reason for the establishment of fusion centers. Pending bills in Congress aim to improve information sharing practices in homeland security. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of business practices for information sharing, focusing on the need for feedback mechanisms from state, local, tribal governments, and the private sector to the Department of Homeland Security. Arguments against enhancing the feedback loop include concerns about response times from the federal government, while arguments in support emphasize the importance of improving national security through better information sharing practices. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of timely and effective information sharing in fusion centers to prevent and respond to disasters. It highlights the lack of mechanisms for fusion centers to provide their threat assessments to the National Intelligence Priorities Framework. Arguments against this focus on the need for a collective approach among fusion centers. The curr_chunk raises questions about the federal government's responsibility for privacy and civil liberties issues in state and local fusion centers, and where the line is drawn between federal and state responsibilities in protecting these rights. The federal government's responsibility for privacy and civil liberties in state and local fusion centers raises questions about where the line is drawn between federal and state responsibilities in protecting these rights. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board was established to review the implementation of laws related to terrorism prevention, suggesting a shared responsibility to protect civil liberties in these partnerships. The Oversight Board may collaborate with state agency general counsels to ensure fusion centers comply with guidelines and establish oversight for privacy protection. Arguments against federal oversight include the belief that fusion centers are state creations, while arguments for it emphasize the need for consistent privacy standards. Arguments in favor of federal oversight of fusion centers include the need for civil liberties oversight, potential inadequacy of voluntary privacy protection measures, and the limited effectiveness of litigation as an oversight mechanism. The need for federal oversight of fusion centers is highlighted due to concerns about civil liberties, privacy protection, and the limited effectiveness of litigation as an oversight mechanism. Instances of conflicting threat assessments provided by federal agencies to state and local fusion centers have raised skepticism among the public. Coordination mechanisms have been implemented to address these issues, but Congress may consider creating additional measures to help fusion centers assess the validity and urgency of potential threats. Congress may consider creating a universal confidence ranking for intelligence products to improve transparency and reliability of sources, following failures in pre-war intelligence on Iraq. Initiatives are underway to increase transparency and improve assessment of intelligence reporting quality. Former CIA Deputy Director emphasized the importance of providing honest assessments. The speech emphasized the importance of transparency and confidence in intelligence judgments. Congress may consider oversight hearings on extending this confidence system to fusion centers. A credibility ranking system could improve information sharing and decision-making at fusion centers, but there are concerns about its implementation. A credibility ranking system could enhance information sharing and decision-making at fusion centers, but challenges exist in getting federal agencies to agree on criteria and potential delays in dissemination. Training on intelligence concepts is crucial for the system to be effective at state and regional fusion centers. The report highlights the varied resources and development paths of fusion centers, with states and localities making decisions independently. Fusion center officials have noted unusual homeland security purchases and funding decisions due to lack of federal input. The creation of competing fusion centers in some states has led to varied resources and funding decisions. One argument in favor is that it respects states' rights, while the opposing view highlights the complexity of funding multiple centers within a state. Designating one fusion center as the lead center for the state could streamline federal financial resources allocation. Federal financial resources could be provided to a designated fusion center in each state, which could then distribute funds to satellite fusion centers. Arguments for this approach include centralizing highly qualified intelligence analysts for better information flow, while arguments against it emphasize the state and local nature of fusion centers. Some argue that fusion centers should be designed to serve state or locality interests, potentially having multiple centers. Critics suggest federal agencies take over fusion center functions for preventing attacks and crime. The argument is that federal agencies should take over functions of fusion centers, with intelligence work going to the FBI and all-hazards functions to FEMA or state/local agencies. This is in response to the changing threat environment, requiring non-traditional thinking to prevent and respond to attacks and natural disasters efficiently. Another suggestion is for the FBI to handle strategic analysis while fusion centers focus on tactical analysis of criminal intelligence. The FBI's Field Intelligence Groups (FIGs) may take on a broader role in analyzing criminal intelligence, potentially assisting state and local law enforcement, public safety, and the private sector in directing protective resources towards areas of greatest security threats. This could involve FIGs conducting analysis with FBI analysts or having SLT personnel from fusion centers assist in the analytic process under FIG direction. The FBI would benefit from direct access to state and local criminal intelligence and established relationships with relevant agencies. The FBI's Field Intelligence Groups (FIGs) could expand their role in analyzing criminal intelligence, collaborating with state and local law enforcement, public safety, and private sector stakeholders. This could involve establishing information systems for sharing classified and unclassified information efficiently. Federal resources could be redirected to create statewide intelligence systems that are interoperable, allowing FIGs direct access for strategic analysis. Fusion centers could then focus on tactical analysis and situational awareness. Arguments for and against expanding the FIG's role relative to fusion centers are considered. Expanding the role of the FBI's Field Intelligence Groups (FIGs) in analyzing criminal intelligence and collaborating with state and local stakeholders may marginalize their important contributions. It could also strain the FBI's capacity as the primary counterterrorism and counter-criminal organization in the US. Additionally, overlooking the resources and local knowledge of state and local agencies may hinder effective homeland security efforts. Expanding the FBI's role in strategic analysis could enhance fusion centers' capabilities without supplanting them. This would involve analyzing underdeveloped raw data to support state-run emergency management agencies. Currently, there are over 40 fusion centers operating independently nationwide. The next step in fusion center development involves creating a more formalized collaboration between centers to address mission and resource issues with the federal government. This collaboration has already begun informally post-9/11 to share threat information and intelligence. Several organizational network models could emerge to address mission and resource issues with the federal government. The depictions in Figure 1 represent theoretical models, with elements of these models existing in today's fusion center network structure. Fusion centers have varying levels of linkages with other centers, with stronger connections to nearby centers or those at similar levels of maturation. Formal adoption of these models could bring more structure to the existing fusion center network. Some fusion centers have formed regional coalitions like Southern Shield to share information. Different organizational models may be needed for various stakeholders in the network. A hybrid approach combining different models is likely. Creating a national fusion center representative entity could help prioritize mission and resource issues. State homeland security leaders are concerned about understanding how federal funding and support are prioritized. Some state leaders have established regional fusion center representative organizations to address the challenge of federal government prioritizing support for fusion centers. Currently, individual centers request services from DHS without considering the needs of other centers in higher-risk locations or nationwide. A coordinated national approach is needed to prioritize resources effectively. A national or regional representative fusion center organization could help prioritize common issues and allocate budgets based on strategy. Pros include increased collaboration and understanding of threats, while cons include the risk of creating a \"group-think\" environment. The creation of regional fusion centers could address the need for collaboration at the state and regional level, potentially supported by federal intelligence agencies. This approach aims to coordinate disparate fusion efforts and promote information sharing through a regional model based on federal designations. Increasing regional collaboration on common concerns among various agencies such as FIG, FEMA, and the Drug Enforcement Agency could support the proposal of combining state fusion centers into a regional homeland security center. This approach aims to enhance information sharing, resource allocation, and shift from reactive to proactive threat analysis. The sustainability of fusion efforts may depend on the absence of large-scale terrorist attacks or disasters, which could result in reduced funding and political support. The proposal suggests combining state fusion centers into regional homeland security centers to enhance collaboration and proactive threat analysis. This would involve establishing federal government-led regional fusion centers in partnership with state employees. One argument against this option is that regional fusion centers may not provide as many benefits to local communities, leading to difficulty in maintaining local support. Regionalization of fusion centers is proposed to address resource dilemmas and improve communication with the federal government. Congress could consider legislative measures to support fusion centers, such as 28 CFR Part 23 which governs state and local criminal intelligence systems. This regulation was created in response to past domestic intelligence abuses related to COINTELPRO. The 1960s and early 1970s saw concerns about civil liberties violations related to COINTELPRO, which remain relevant today. Changes in the threat environment and technology suggest a need to update 28 CFR Part 23 to include modern data retention practices. Revising the regulation could strike a new balance between civil liberties and security efforts, establish national standards for information exchange, and address technological advances. Changes to 28 CFR Part 23 may clarify limits on technology use by fusion centers, but may face resistance from civil liberties advocates. Congress could enhance communication between fusion centers to improve information sharing. Several initiatives are being considered to improve information sharing among fusion centers, including requiring systems to be able to communicate with each other. This could reduce information silos and encourage more effective data analysis. Arguments for and against this option exist, with concerns about federal funds contributing to information silos being a key point. One option to enhance communication among fusion centers is standardized reporting formats, which can improve peer-to-peer and federal communication. DHS has provided training to fusion center detailees, but further coordination with federal recipients is needed for a more comprehensive approach. Standardized reporting formats can enhance communication among fusion centers and federal recipients, but coordination with fusion center staff is essential to avoid overburdening them with multiple reporting formats. Input from state and local law enforcement is necessary to ensure consistency and buy-in. Difficulty in agreeing on a standardized report format is a potential impediment. To enhance communication among fusion centers and federal recipients, coordination is essential to avoid overburdening with multiple reporting formats. Standardized reporting is crucial for effective information sharing and analysis in homeland security efforts. Congress may need to compel federal agencies to consolidate information sharing systems. Congress may need to compel federal agencies to consolidate existing federally owned information sharing systems to enhance communication among fusion centers and federal recipients. Designating a single primary system for information sharing could improve intelligence flow between state, local, tribal agencies, and federal entities. This consolidation may reduce stress on fusion centers but could face opposition from federal agencies with separate systems. Ownership of intelligence and information systems remains an obstacle in sharing information with sub-federal entities. Congress may consider urging FBI and DHS to increase clearances for state and local personnel at fusion centers. The lack of classified intelligence reciprocity creates bureaucratic hurdles in effective information sharing. The argument for effective information sharing at fusion centers is that it allows additional personnel to receive threat information and improve the flow of federal intelligence assessments. This could enhance true fusion by combining federal agency assessments with locally collected information. However, a counterargument is that it may not address the issue of over-classification and could further promote a culture of classification among fusion center personnel. Enhancing the declassification process at the federal level may be more beneficial than clearing additional SLT personnel at state and local levels for fusion centers. Increased cleared personnel need accompanying equipment, training, and guidance to effectively utilize intelligence. Congress should focus on declassifying existing products and urge progress on classification issues. Enhancing the declassification process at the federal level is crucial for fusion centers to identify potential threats. Congress should urge compliance with IRTPA requirements to create declassified versions of intelligence reports for fusion centers to utilize effectively. The partnership between SLT agencies, fusion centers, and federal agencies to address homeland security challenges may not be as strong as described. Declassifying intelligence for fusion centers could potentially delay important information reaching the SLT-level. The federal government may not view SLT agencies and fusion centers as true partners, but rather as consumers of their work. There is tension between traditional intelligence and law enforcement agencies, as well as between first responders and law enforcement. Residual resentment towards federal agencies exists among SLT entities, who have historically been treated as inferior information sources. The relationship between SLT agencies and federal entities is strained, with a lack of understanding and trust. SLT officials feel federal agencies do not comprehend their needs, leading to cultural differences and misunderstandings. This hinders effective collaboration in homeland security efforts. The FBI and other federal agencies lack understanding of SLT officials' needs, hindering effective collaboration in homeland security efforts. Information sharing is limited due to a belief that SLT agencies cannot utilize the information to reduce vulnerabilities. The lack of understanding between federal agencies and state and local officials hinders effective collaboration in homeland security efforts. State and local officials often have unrealistic expectations about the intelligence the federal government possesses, leading to distrust and miscommunication. Despite an enhanced level of trust, there are still challenges in communication and cooperation between the two sides. Some fusion center respondents do not see the SLT-federal relationship as a true partnership. Arguments against enhancing this partnership focus on the difficulty of creating and implementing a strategy. Supporters believe improving relationships between government levels and homeland security stakeholders is crucial for U.S. security post-9/11. Congress has legislative tools available to address this issue, such as personnel exchanges. One way to improve the partnership between state and local fusion centers and federal agencies is through personnel exchanges. This can help build mutual trust and understanding by allowing personnel to experience each other's environments and limitations. Concrete measures like assigning personnel to Interagency Threat Assessment Coordination Group and the NCTC could enhance partnerships. Clarifying roles, responsibilities, and resources can reduce duplication, clarify lanes for intelligence sharing, and improve coordination. Issues with fusion centers may not have unique federal remedies due to federalism and state law complexities. Legal issues may not have federal remedies unless constitutional issues are involved. Uncertain funding and mission expectations could lead to fusion center elimination in the future. One near-term priority for fusion center leadership is to coordinate efforts with state officials to secure long-term funding. Without state recognition and funding, the center's ability to provide threat assessments and response activities may suffer. Concerns exist that increased federal funding may come with mission and administrative conditions that could detract from the center's state-focused mission. State fusion centers face challenges with state laws impeding information sharing, potentially hindering their ability to meet state leadership expectations. One law made it a misdemeanor to share criminal intelligence with non-criminal justice entities, limiting the fusion center's ability to share vital information. Additionally, issues with state fusion center personnel may not have federal remedies, posing further obstacles as these centers continue to develop. Some state fusion centers are evolving to align with the threat environment by ensuring their leadership team has experience in all phases of homeland security. There are concerns that increased federal funding may lead to the federal government wanting a say in personnel decisions. The federal government may want to be consulted on personnel selected by state leadership for managing fusion center funds. Concerns include the quality of personnel, resource constraints leading to underperforming personnel, and unclear roles and responsibilities despite signed MOUs. The lack of clarity in roles and functions for detailees at fusion centers can lead to unmet expectations and reduced coordination. MOUs specify salary and training but may not effectively manage detailees. Fusion center leaders are occasionally asked about detailees' performance. Fusion center leaders are concerned about the impact of detailees on productivity and question the effectiveness of the organizational relationship. The lack of tools to measure personnel performance and pressure to justify existence during fiscal crises are key issues faced by fusion center officials. Fusion centers struggle to demonstrate their importance during fiscal crises, leading to challenges in securing budget allocations. Some centers are developing their own metrics for evaluating performance, while others face issues with strategic resource distribution and a lack of understanding of their role. The role of fusion centers is hindered by challenges in receiving federal grants due to lack of strategic coordination and potential duplication of effort. The challenges facing fusion centers include poor planning leading to duplication of effort and lack of interoperability, as well as difficulty in creating buy-in at the sub-state level. Expanding to an all-crimes approach and providing investigative resources to small agencies have helped some fusion centers gain support. Fusion centers face challenges in convincing local law enforcement and non-law enforcement agencies to invest resources in enhancing the fusion process. Non-law enforcement agencies are skeptical due to their lack of intelligence experience and uncertainty about their role. Conflicting messages from the federal government further complicate the situation. The federal government's conflicting messages complicate fusion centers' efforts to integrate intelligence and information. Understanding different intelligence philosophies between the Intelligence Community and law enforcement is crucial for effective fusion center operations. Common lexicon issues and varied approaches to intelligence work are key barriers to integration. Fusion centers face challenges in integrating intelligence and information due to conflicting federal messages. Some centers lack a clear understanding of the distinction between intelligence and information, which is crucial for effective operations. Intelligence is defined as information meeting policy makers' needs, while information is any known data. Intelligence is a subset of information that is collected, processed, and analyzed to meet policy makers' needs. The intelligence cycle involves planning, collection, synthesis, analysis, dissemination, and feedback to create intelligence products for decision-making. The feedback loop from the customer evaluates the product's utility and assists with planning and direction. Different definitions of \"intelligence\" are used by fusion centers and law enforcement. Law enforcement defines intelligence as the product of an analytic process that evaluates information from diverse sources to produce a conclusion about a criminal phenomenon. Law enforcement intelligence (LEINT) is the result of analyzing information to provide direction to decision makers about criminal activities, enterprises, extremists, and terrorists. It offers an integrated perspective on crime trends, threats, and conditions associated with criminality. This type of intelligence is considered \"finished\" intelligence, synthesized and analyzed to be proactive in addressing intelligence gaps. Law enforcement intelligence (LEINT) is proactive in addressing intelligence gaps based on policymaker needs. The Intelligence Community tends to be proactive in national security, while law enforcement is traditionally reactive and prosecution-focused. Carter believes intelligence can be used for prevention and resource allocation within law enforcement. The primary differences between traditional intelligence and law enforcement intelligence lie in three areas. The primary differences between traditional intelligence and law enforcement intelligence lie in three areas: the predicate for intelligence activity, the clients and consumers of intelligence, and the legal regimes governing intelligence collection. Law enforcement intelligence is reactive and focused on criminal events, serving law enforcement officers, prosecuting attorneys, and executives aligning protective resources. Intelligence Community, on the other hand, is proactive in national security, serving national policymakers and action-oriented officials within the military and federal intelligence communities. Prosecuting attorneys and law enforcement executives seek to align protective resources. National intelligence collection operates under a less restrictive legal regime than law enforcement intelligence, driven by the subjects of intelligence collection. The conceptual differences between these communities have implications for fusion centers, raising questions about their operating model and legal regime. Lack of clarity can lead to fusion centers being too conservative or aggressive, undermining productivity and posing a risk to the concept. The research for this report on state and regional fusion centers included literature review, interviews with state fusion center leaders, federal stakeholders, and other interested observers. The conversations were conducted on a \"not for attribution basis\" to engage in open dialogue. The survey method was acknowledged for its limitations but was adopted for efficiency. Various stakeholders, including academia, ACLU, and state and local law enforcement, were also consulted. The authors conducted primary source interviews based on a survey they developed, consulting various stakeholders including academia, ACLU, and state and local law enforcement."
