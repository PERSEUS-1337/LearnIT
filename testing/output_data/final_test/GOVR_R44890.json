    "content": "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided FY2018 funding through September 30, 2018, with a total of $54.18 billion allocated for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, representing a 6.1% decrease from FY2017. The Department of State received $16.22 billion, 10.7% below FY2017 levels, while foreign operations received $37.99 billion, 4% below the FY2017 funding level. The SFOPS total requested for FY2018 was $40.25 billion, with State Operations and Related Programs at $13.20 billion and Foreign Operations at $27.05 billion. This represented a significant decrease from the enacted FY2017 funding levels. The Trump Administration sought to reduce OCO funds by 42% compared to FY2017. The Trump Administration sought to expand OCO funds in FY2018 to cover longer-term core costs for national security, natural disasters, and global operations. Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 to raise discretionary spending limits for both security and nonsecurity sectors to avoid sequestration. The Senate and House passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018, providing government funding at FY2017 levels through December 8, 2017. Subsequent resolutions extended the date. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its State, Foreign Operations, 2018 bill with $51.35 billion in funding for FY2018. The Senate bill for State, Foreign Operations, 2018 included $20.79 billion for OCO, 42% more than the request and the House bill. The total funding level was $11.1 billion more than the Administration request and $3.8 billion more than the House bill. The Senate committee report criticized the proposed reductions for SFOPS, stating that diplomacy and development should not be replaced by battlefield technology. The report also aimed to limit the Administration's discretion in foreign affairs programs. The House Appropriations Committee reported a FY2018 SFOPS proposal with funding levels for Foreign Service and Civil Service positions. The proposal included $35.50 billion for enduring funds and $12.02 billion for OCO, totaling $47.52 billion. This represented a $10 billion decline compared with FY2017 total enacted. The House funding levels were $1.24 billion less for enduring funds and $8.8 billion less for OCO funds compared to FY2017 enacted budget. The House Appropriations Committee reported a FY2018 SFOPS proposal with funding levels for Foreign Service and Civil Service positions. The House funding levels were $3.8 billion less compared to the Senate bill. The committee emphasized the importance of diplomatic engagement and foreign assistance, while also supporting measures to reduce waste and inefficiency. The House approved a consolidated appropriations bill for FY2018, incorporating the text of H.R. 3362 in the SFOPS section. Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, continuing government funding through March 23, 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended government funding through March 23, 2018, raised defense and nondefense discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019, and eased the FY2018 budget process. It prevented a breach of the BCA spending limits by increasing overall revised discretionary spending limits. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 1625; P.L. 115-141) provided FY2018 funding through September 30, 2018, with Division K including $54.18 billion for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS). The Administration's budget proposal for the Department of State and Related Programs included a 27% cut in funding, with reductions in various areas such as Capital Security Cost Sharing and contributions to international organizations. The Diplomatic and Consular Programs account would have decreased by 15% to $8.26 billion under the proposal. The Administration's budget proposal for the Department of State and Related Programs included significant cuts in various areas. The Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance account would have decreased by 62% to $1.14 billion. The proposal also sought to end direct appropriations for certain nongovernmental institutions and cut funding for the National Endowment for Democracy by 39%. However, P.L. 115-141 maintained direct appropriations for these entities. The House committee bill, H.R. 3362, proposed $15.52 billion in new appropriations for the State Department and Related Agency category, 18% more than requested and 15% less than FY2017 funding. The Senate committee bill, S. 1780, would have provided $15.69 billion, approximately 19% more than requested. Ongoing Administration efforts to reorganize the Department of State were noted, with Congress requiring detailed information prior to implementation. The Senate measure, S. 1780, proposed around 1% more funding than the House committee bill for the State Department and Related Agency category. Approximately 25% of the funding in S. 1780 would have been designated for OCO. Both the House and Senate committee reports addressed concerns about the reorganization efforts within the Department of State. P.L. 115-141 provided $16.22 billion for the Department of State, international broadcasting, and related agencies, which was 11% less than the FY2017 funding level and 23% above the Administration's request. The FY2018 funding for the Department of State was $16.22 billion, 11% less than FY2017 but 23% above the Administration's request. $12.04 billion was for the enduring budget and $4.18 billion for OCO. Section 7081 of the law prohibits using funds for reorganization without Congress consultation. DS's primary funding source is the Worldwide Security Protection request within D&CP for security programs at U.S. diplomatic missions. The Administration's proposal for the Department of State's Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) funding would have decreased by 19% from FY2017 to $3.76 billion. The Department of State argued that fully funding WSP with \"no-year\" appropriations created a surplus of unobligated funds. However, there were concerns about the future reduction of OCO funding for recurring DS operations at overseas facilities. The Administration's request for Department of State's Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) funding included a $46.4 million net decrease in non-OCO funds, with no mention of future efficiencies. Both H.R. 3362 and S. 1780 proposed $3.76 billion for WSP, matching the Administration's request. The bills maintained WSP as a no-year appropriation for both OCO and non-OCO funds, allowing unobligated funds to be carried forward for future years. The Administration's request for ESCM funding included a $1.14 billion decrease, constituting a 62% decrease from the FY2017 actual figure of $3.01 billion. The ESCM account is the primary source of funding for OBO, responsible for setting priorities for diplomatic mission properties. One key funding area within ESCM is the Worldwide Security Upgrades (WSU) allocation, used to meet obligations to the CSCS and MCS programs. Congress has provided no-year appropriations for ESCM and WSU. The department planned to use unobligated funds to increase ESCM total direct obligations from $2.19 billion in 2017 to $2.29 billion in 2018. They intended to carry forward $618.4 million in funds from FY2017 for CSCS and MCS obligations in FY2018. Additional funds from MRV fees and contributions from other agencies would bring total contributions to $2.2 billion, meeting the recommended annual level. H.R. 3362 would have appropriated $2.31 billion for ESCM, a 103% increase from the previous year. H.R. 3362 would have appropriated $2.31 billion for ESCM, which is 103% more than the Administration's FY2018 request. The bill also provided $71.78 million for OCO and $1.49 billion for WSU, over $1.1 billion more than the Administration requested. The committee recommended using no less than $956.152 million for CSCS and MCS obligations. S. 1780 would have provided $2.06 billion for ESCM, approximately 80% more than the previous year. S. 1780 would have allocated $2.06 billion for ESCM, 80% more than the Administration's FY2018 request. The bill designated $158.82 million for OCO, significantly more than the House committee measure. Additionally, $1.30 billion was provided for WSU, over $900 million more than the Administration's request. The appropriations report included funding recommendations for various programs, such as $1.12 billion for CSCS and MCS obligations, conflicting with the department's intended approach. The appropriations report for FY2018 allocated funds for the compound renovation project at Embassy Moscow and an American Center at Embassy Moscow. The ESCM appropriation within P.L. 115-141 provided a total of $2.31 billion, with $71.78 million for OCO. The overall ESCM appropriation was 23% less than the FY2017 allocation. The FY2018 appropriation for ESCM was 23% less than the FY2017 level. The explanatory statement rejected the use of prior-year funds for State Department obligations and did not specify funding levels for capital projects in Russia. Funds were allocated for international organizations through CIO and CIPA accounts. The FY2018 request for the CIO account totaled $996.43 million, a 27% decrease from FY2017. The department expected organizations to cut costs and distribute funding more evenly. An interagency review of U.S. contributions to international organizations would prioritize certain entities. The FY2018 request for the CIO account totaled $996.43 million, a 27% decrease from FY2017. The department expected organizations to cut costs and distribute funding more evenly. An interagency review of U.S. contributions to international organizations would prioritize certain entities based on national security interests and American prosperity. H.R. 3362 proposed $1.17 billion for CIO, a 17% increase from the Administration's request and a 14% decrease from FY2017. The appropriations report emphasized prioritizing payments for organizations promoting human health and international security. The committee emphasized the importance of funding international organizations like NATO and IAEA for human health and security. S. 1780 proposed $1.45 billion for CIO, a significant increase from previous years. The appropriations report highlighted the need for U.S. engagement with organizations like the UN and OECD to promote transparency and accountability for national security. The committee emphasized the importance of funding international organizations like NATO and IAEA for human health and security. The report called for a cost-benefit analysis of contributions to organizations receiving $5 million or less. The $1.47 billion appropriation for CIO in P.L. 115-141 was 8% higher than FY2017. The FY2018 appropriation for international organizations was 8% higher than FY2017, 25% higher than the House committee measure, and 1% higher than the Senate committee measure. $1.37 billion was allocated for the enduring budget, with an additional $96.2 million for OCO.

The department requested a reduced U.S. funding of $1.91 billion for U.N. peacekeeping missions, emphasizing the need for more effective implementation to address conflicts and meet objectives. They called for a strategic review of missions and equitable cost sharing among member states. H.R. 3362 proposed $1.50 billion for CIPA, a 25% increase from the Administration's FY2018 allocation. The appropriations report recommended $1.50 billion for CIPA, a 25% increase from the Administration's FY2018 request and a 22% decrease from FY2017. The Senate committee measure, S. 1780, proposed $1.38 billion for CIPA, a 16% increase from the Administration's request and an 8% decrease from H.R. 3362. The report expressed concerns about the scope, duration, and costs of U.N. peacekeeping missions, supporting efforts to reduce costs while maintaining U.S. interests and international security. The appropriations report for S. 1780 stated that the bill provided sufficient funds for contributions equal to the 25% statutory limitation on such contributions. P.L. 115-141 provided an appropriation of $1.38 billion for CIPA, a 28% reduction from FY2017 actual figures and a 16% increase from the Administration's FY2018 request. The total amount provided for CIPA through P.L. 115-141 is very close to that provided through the Senate measure, with differences in allocations for OCO and enduring appropriations. The explanatory statement accompanying the law provides sufficient funds for United States contributions to peacekeeping missions at the statutory level of 25%. The Administration's FY2018 budget request for Educational and Cultural Exchange Programs was reduced by 55% from the previous year. The request aimed to focus on specific foreign policy goals and core programs like the Fulbright program. The FY2018 budget request for the Fulbright program was reduced by 48% to $125.6 million.

The Foreign Operations accounts, including P.L. 480 Title II Food for Peace and McGovern-Dole Food for Education, make up the foreign assistance portion of the international affairs budget. The Administration requested $27.05 billion for FY2018, a 31% decrease from FY2017. The House committee bill proposed $33.46 billion, a 24% increase from the request. The Senate committee bill proposed $35.66 billion, a 32% increase from the request. OCO funding accounted for 29% in the Administration's request, 24% in the House bill, and 47% in the Senate bill. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocated $37.99 billion for Foreign Operations, 4.0% less than FY2017. $7.84 billion (21%) was designated as OCO. Every major category of foreign assistance would have been reduced under the FY2018 request, with bilateral economic and humanitarian assistance cut by about a third, and multilateral aid by 30%.

The Trump Administration proposed changes to the foreign assistance budget. The FY2018 Foreign Operations budget proposed consolidating bilateral foreign assistance programs, eliminating some programs/entities, and cutting funding for foreign food aid programs. The Administration suggested replacing several accounts with a new Economic Support and Development Fund (ESDF) account, citing improved ability to target development activities. The proposed funding level for ESDF was over 40% lower than the FY2017 funding for the accounts it would replace. The FY2018 budget proposed consolidating foreign assistance programs and cutting funding for foreign food aid. The International Organizations & Programs account, funding U.S. contributions to U.N. entities, would have been eliminated.

The FY2018 enacted appropriation also rejected the proposed mergers and eliminations, including the elimination of entities like IAF, USADF, OPIC, and TDA funded through foreign operations line items. The Administration justified these eliminations on fiscal grounds. The Trump Administration proposed eliminations of agencies like IAF and USADF in FY2018 for fiscal reasons, but the final appropriation funded them at similar levels to FY2017.
