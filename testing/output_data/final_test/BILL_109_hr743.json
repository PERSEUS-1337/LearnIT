The Congress finds that the Nazi regime and its collaborators conducted the Holocaust, systematically confiscating insurance assets of Jews and other enemies. Millions of European Jews had purchased life insurance policies before and during World War II. After World War II, European insurers often denied insurance claims of Holocaust victims and their heirs without proper documentation. Only a small percentage of victims and families have successfully collected on their policies in the 50 years since the war. In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) was established to help expedite payouts on contested insurance policies. ICHEIC has received over 90,000 claims but has only made 2,281 settlement offers. Holocaust victims should receive expedited insurance payments to prevent further victimization. States should be allowed to gather Holocaust-era insurance information from foreign insurers. Victims and families should have the option to pursue claims in Federal court for redress. States have the authority to establish requirements for conducting insurance business. A State can set requirements for insurers doing business within the State, including providing information on Holocaust era insurance policies sold, number of policies, holders, beneficiaries, and current status. The State can require insurers to provide details on Holocaust era insurance policies sold, including policyholder information, current status, and payment certification for beneficiaries or heirs. Insurers must also explain if they no longer possess records of such policies. Holocaust era insurance policies refer to policies in force between 1920 and 1945 with beneficiaries who are listed Holocaust victims. Proceeds from these policies may be distributed to Holocaust survivors, charities, or remain undistributed as per court certification. Federal cause of action for covered claims is established. Federal cause of action exists for covered claims with a 10-year statute of limitations. District courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions on covered claims, and personal jurisdiction can be exercised over non-resident defendants in such cases. For covered claims against foreign insurance companies involving Holocaust victims, service of process can be done in any manner consistent with the US Constitution. Definitions include \"covered claim\" for claims against foreign insurance companies and \"original request\" for claims involving listed Holocaust victims as policyholders, insured, or beneficiaries. The term \"covered foreign insurance company\" refers to specific companies and their affiliates that were involved in claims against foreign insurance companies related to Holocaust victims. These companies include Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A., Union Des Assurances de Paris, Victoria Lebenversicherungs AG, and Winterthur Lebensversicherungs Gesellschaft. The claims must have been made by listed Holocaust victims or their heirs to these companies or the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims during the 13-year period from 1933 to 1945.
