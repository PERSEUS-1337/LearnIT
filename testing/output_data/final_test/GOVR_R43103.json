    "content": "The United States has approximately 608,000 bridges on public roads, with 48% owned by state governments and 50% by local governments. State governments own larger and more heavily traveled bridges, including those on the Interstate Highway system. Only 1.5% of highway bridges are owned by the federal government. Interstate and major arterial bridges carry almost 80% of average daily traffic, with the highest traffic loads on Interstate Highway bridges in urban areas. Federal law mandates states to inspect and report findings on public road bridges to the Federal Highway Administration. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) relies on bridge inspections to assess the condition of bridges and identify structural deficiencies or functional obsolescence. A structurally deficient bridge has significant load-carrying elements in poor condition, while a functionally obsolete bridge does not meet current design standards. Structural deficiencies take precedence in classification. In the FHWA's National Bridge Inventory, bridges are classified as structurally deficient if they have significant load-carrying elements in poor condition. This classification also includes bridges that are functionally obsolete. The number of structurally deficient bridges has decreased by 57% since 1990, with approximately 10% of bridges classified as structurally deficient in 2013. Additionally, the number of functionally obsolete bridges decreased by 16% during the same period, with a total of almost a quarter of U.S. bridges being deficient in some way in 2013. In 2013, almost a quarter of U.S. bridges were deficient, with urban Interstate Highway bridges having a lower structural deficiency rate compared to bridges on local roads. Locally owned bridges had more than twice the structural deficiency rate of state-owned bridges in 2013. In 2013, almost a quarter of U.S. bridges were deficient, with urban Interstate Highway bridges having a lower structural deficiency rate compared to bridges on local roads. Locally owned bridges had more than twice the structural deficiency rate of state-owned bridges. FHWA assesses the condition and performance of highways and bridges every two years, estimating future spending needs to maintain or improve current conditions. The 2013 needs assessment showed that $100.2 billion was spent in 2010. The 2013 needs assessment revealed that $100.2 billion was spent in 2010 on capital improvements for highways and bridges, with $82.2 billion allocated to roadways and $18.0 billion to bridges. The majority of bridge funding, $17.1 billion, was used for rehabilitating or replacing existing bridges, showing a 35% increase from 2008. This increase was largely due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Future needs estimates for bridges focus on fixing deficiencies when benefits outweigh costs, with the 2010 expenditure serving as a benchmark. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that fixing all existing bridge deficiencies would cost $106.4 billion in 2010. To keep the backlog at the 2010 level through 2030 would require $8.9 billion annually, while eliminating the backlog by 2030 would need $20.2 billion annually, implying a 1.6% annual increase in spending. The Federal Highway Administration estimates that spending between $8.9 billion and $20.2 billion annually would improve the conditions of the nation's bridges, reducing the total cost of correcting deficiencies by 93% by 2030. Federal assistance for bridge maintenance and construction is primarily through the federal-aid highway program, with states deciding how to allocate the funds. Compliance with federal planning guidelines is required, but states have flexibility in spending decisions. The 2012 surface transportation reauthorization, MAP-21, eliminated the Highway Bridge Program, giving states more control over bridge spending. Bridge projects are managed at the state level, with funds distributed through the National Highway Performance Program and the Surface Transportation Program. FHWA is involved in the project decision-making process for bridge funding under the National Highway Performance Program (NHPP) and the Surface Transportation Program (STP). MAP-21 requires FHWA to classify public road bridges based on serviceability, safety, and essentiality, but does not mandate the use of this classification for program eligibility. Additionally, FHWA imposes performance measures on states for bridge projects. FHWA enforces performance measures for bridge projects, with penalties for states failing to meet standards. States transferring HBP funds to non-bridge uses caused controversy after the I-35W Bridge collapse in 2007. Critics noted a discrepancy between apportioned funds and actual spending on bridge projects. Under MAP-21, states have more freedom to allocate federal surface transportation grants for bridge work. In FY2013, states spent 8% more federal-aid highway funds on bridges compared to FY2012, but it was lower than levels seen in FY2008-2011 due to stimulus funds. Funds authorized prior to MAP-21 can still be obligated through FY2016. Under the National Bridge Inspection Program (NBIP), bridges longer than 20 feet on public roads must be inspected by state inspectors or certified contractors. Data from these inspections are reported to FHWA to identify deficient bridges. FHWA sets standards for bridge inspection through NBIS, outlining inspection frequency and responsible parties. Each state is responsible for inspecting public highway bridges except those owned by the federal government or Indian tribes. The state is responsible for inspecting public highway bridges, except those owned by the federal government or Indian tribes. Inspections can be done by state employees or certified inspectors employed by consultants. The NBIS sets standards for qualification and training of bridge inspection personnel, with a general inspection frequency of every 24 months. States can request FHWA approval for up to 48-month frequency for certain bridges. Underwater inspections are generally every 60 months but can be increased to 72 months. Frequency of underwater inspection is typically every 60 months but can be extended to 72 months with FHWA approval. On-site inspections are usually visual and conducted by trained inspectors, with one designated as a team leader. Load rating of bridges must be overseen by a registered professional engineer, and structures unable to support legal loads must be posted. Most inspections are carried out by state employees or consultants, with FHWA conducting audit inspections to ensure compliance. FHWA also offers engineering expertise for investigating bridge failures, although time for audits is limited. The Emergency Relief Program (ER) provides funding for bridges damaged in natural disasters or catastrophic failures. It offers funds for emergency repairs immediately after the failure and for longer-term permanent repairs. ER is authorized at $100 million per year nationwide, with additional funding provided in supplemental appropriations acts for large disasters. The federal share of emergency repairs within the first 180 days is 100%, with later and permanent repairs reimbursed at the usual federal share for federal-aid highways. The Emergency Relief Program (ER) provides funding for bridges damaged in natural disasters or catastrophic failures, with emergency repairs reimbursed at 100% federal share within the first 180 days. The program is administered through state departments of transportation in coordination with FHWA. ER funds were used for the replacement of the I-5 Skagit River Bridge in Washington State after it collapsed in 2013. Despite warnings of a bridge crisis, FHWA data show a consistent decrease in structurally deficient bridges since 1990. The proportion of structurally deficient or functionally obsolete highway bridges has decreased since 1990, while road conditions have not improved as much. Congress gave states flexibility in using federal funding for bridge or road repairs in MAP-21, without mandating specific bridge spending levels. States are responsible for determining annual bridge repair budgets, raising questions about prioritizing bridge versus road repairs. The terms \"structurally deficient\" and \"functionally obsolete\" are not synonymous with \"unsafe.\" Efforts to eliminate all structurally deficient bridges could lead to inefficient spending if many do not have major safety issues. MAP-21 sets a penalty threshold for states with high percentages of structurally deficient bridges, requiring them to allocate funds for bridge improvements. The MAP-21 legislation sets a penalty threshold for states with high percentages of structurally deficient bridges, requiring them to allocate funds for bridge improvements to reduce the number of deficient bridges. Federal motor fuel tax revenues have been insufficient to support the federal-aid highway program as authorized by Congress for several years. MAP-21 allocated money from the Treasury's general fund for highway and bridge projects. The Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 extended MAP-21's funding levels and policies through May 31, 2015. Congress has options to increase spending on bridges, such as providing general fund monies, resurrecting a stand-alone program for structurally deficient bridges, raising fuel taxes, or emphasizing public-private partnerships. The curr_chunk discusses the use of public-private partnerships (P3s) to reduce the number of structurally deficient bridges by allowing states to lease toll facilities to private investors. This can provide upfront payments for bridge replacement and repair, attract private investment, and make projects eligible for federal loans. Tolling can help improve major bridges quickly and create a revenue stream for private entities interested in P3s. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan is used to fund bridge projects, but bridge tolls can be unpopular and vary in acceptance. Some states charge out-of-state users higher tolls to make them more acceptable, which may face legal challenges. Federal highway funding historically focused on roads and bridges on the federal-aid highway system, with a requirement for off-system bridge spending. MAP-21 mandates that a portion of funds be obligated for off-system bridge projects. Off-system bridges are those not on the federal-aid highway system. In FY2009, funds for off-system bridge projects may be reallocated to more heavily used bridges. FHWA directs federal funding to bridges with low sufficiency ratings, leading states to prioritize replacement over maintenance. In FY2012, 11% of funds were for new bridges, 55% for replacements, 4% for major rehab, and 30% for minor work, showing a shift from the late 1990s. The National Bridge Inventory classifies bridges based on serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use. MAP-21 requires a risk-based priority for systematic preventative maintenance, replacement, or rehabilitation. This approach aims to identify unsafe bridges more clearly than just focusing on structurally deficient or functionally obsolete ones. The Department of Transportation found that FHWA had not fully implemented all MAP-21 bridge provisions, including establishing a risk-based bridge prioritization process. Congress could consider making this a requirement for bridge project funding. MAP-21 maintains the requirement for states to prioritize bridge spending based on state transportation plans. Congress may need to examine state spending on bridges under MAP-21 to ensure adequate attention to bridge needs. FHWA could be directed to ensure inspections are done in compliance with National Bridge standards. FHWA must ensure that inspections are in compliance with National Bridge standards, including on-site audits. Additional funding is needed to hire more personnel for oversight. MAP-21 requires minimum inspection standards and annual state compliance reviews. The Secretary of Transportation must update standards within two years. Congress may oversee implementation.
