Congress finds that the yuan of China is undervalued, giving China a trade advantage and subsidizing exports. China intervenes in foreign exchange markets to maintain the yuan's value artificially. China's foreign reserves exceed $609.9 billion as of January 12, 2005, with a significant increase in the last year. The undervalued yuan gives China a trade advantage, and the government's intervention violates global trading rules. China has not addressed concerns raised by the US and the international community regarding its currency valuation. The Uruguay Round Agreements Act allows WTO members to take action for essential security interests, including protecting the US manufacturing sector. A duty of 27.5% ad valorem may be imposed on Chinese goods without a certification regarding currency valuation policy. The certification required by the President to Congress regarding China's currency valuation policy aims to prevent unfair competitive advantages in international trade. The certification also includes a determination of China's currency revaluation to its fair market value. If the President certifies 180 days after the enactment of the Act, an alternative certification may be considered. The President may delay imposing tariffs on China if they make efforts to revalue their currency. Negotiations will begin to ensure China's compliance with currency revaluation. The Secretary will negotiate with China for currency revaluation within 180 days. A multilateral summit will be convened to discuss exchange rates with Asian governments and other interested parties."
