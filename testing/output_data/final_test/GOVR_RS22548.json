    "content": "The United States provides duty-free treatment to certain imports from Ecuador under a regional trade preference program that started with the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) in 1991. ATPA was renewed and expanded in 2002 under the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA), including additional products like petroleum, textiles, apparel, footwear, and tuna. Congress has favored short-term extensions of ATPA since ATPDEA's enactment. The 113th Congress may consider renewing ATPA. The 113th Congress may consider renewing ATPA, especially since Ecuador is now the only remaining designated beneficiary country. Trade preferences for Colombia and Ecuador were extended until July 31, 2013, as part of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Peru and Bolivia are no longer designated beneficiary countries under ATPA due to their respective free trade agreements with the United States. Bolivia's designation as a beneficiary country under ATPA was terminated in 2008 due to lack of cooperation on counter-narcotics efforts. President Obama continued this determination in 2009, and the option to reinstate Bolivia expired in June 2009. Congress would need to approve legislation for Bolivia to be reinstated. ATPA aims to promote economic growth in the Andean region and reduce dependence on illegal drugs. Increased access to the U.S. market was expected to create jobs and expand legitimate opportunities in the Andean countries. Between 2008 and 2012, imports from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru increased by 49%. Colombia is the leading source of U.S. imports from the region, followed by Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Leading import items include crude petroleum oil, gold, and non-crude petroleum oil products. The region's key exports to the U.S. in 2012 were crude petroleum oil, gold, non-crude petroleum oil products, coffee, and cut flowers. Total U.S. exports to the four ATPA countries reached $29.2 billion in 2012, with Colombia being the largest market. Duty-free imports made up 87.4% of U.S. imports from the region in 2012. In 2012, U.S. imports from the region totaled $11.4 billion, with Ecuador as the only remaining beneficiary of ATPA. 24% entered duty-free under FTAs with Colombia and Peru, while 17% of imports were dutiable. The year 2008 marked the last year of trade preferences for all four countries under ATPA. Between 2001 and 2008, U.S. ATPA imports increased significantly from $1.7 billion to $17.2 billion. However, ATPA imports decreased to $11.4 billion in 2012, with Ecuador being the only remaining beneficiary. Colombia and Bolivia were removed as ATPA-designated countries, while Peru was removed due to the U.S.-Peru free trade agreement. The U.S.-Peru free trade agreement led to a decline in U.S. ATPA imports from Peru. The impact of ATPA on the U.S. economy has been minimal due to low trade volume. ATPA had a higher impact on beneficiary countries, particularly in industries benefiting from trade preferences. Studies suggest ATPA may have indirectly affected coca production. Duty-free U.S. imports under ATPA account for less than 0.5% of total U.S. imports and GDP. The 2012 USITC study on ATPA states that the impact on the U.S. economy has been minimal, especially with Ecuador being the only remaining beneficiary. The rise in imports from ATPA countries was mainly due to petroleum-related products, with crude petroleum oils accounting for a significant portion. Additionally, imports of cut flowers also increased under ATPA. The ATPA agreement had a significant impact on U.S. consumers by lowering prices, with fresh-cut roses showing the largest gain in consumer surplus. The agreement also affected U.S. producers, particularly in the production of fresh-cut roses. The original purpose of ATPA was to incentivize a shift from illegal crop production to legitimate economic activities in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. However, estimating the full effects of ATPA on beneficiary countries is challenging due to various factors at play. The ATPA agreement had a small, indirect impact on coca production in Andean countries, supporting U.S. counter-narcotics efforts. While coca cultivation decreased since 2007, ATPA was not a major cause, with other factors contributing to the decline. Illegal coca cultivation fell in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru from 232,500 hectares in 2007 to 187,000 hectares in 2010. Ecuador saw a decrease in coca cultivation from 232,500 hectares in 2007 to 187,000 hectares in 2010. The country remains a transit point for illegal drugs from Colombia and Peru. The ATPA, along with other development programs, supported job growth in industries like fresh-cut flowers, bananas, and pineapples. Ecuador is the only remaining beneficiary of ATPA, with industries such as fresh-cut flowers, tuna, vegetables, pineapples, mangoes, and plywood benefiting from the agreement. The absence of ATPA would negatively impact their exports. The suspension of trade preferences for Bolivia may result in adverse impacts on exports, particularly fresh cut flowers. This could lead to a loss of investor confidence and reduced private investment, affecting jobs. President Evo Morales' policies have restricted foreign direct investment in Bolivia, causing uncertainty for foreign investors. President Morales' nationalization of industries in Bolivia, including hydrocarbons, telecommunications, and electricity, led to uncertainty for foreign investors. The removal of ATPA trade preferences resulted in job losses, mainly in the clothing sector, impacting investor confidence and private investment. Reports estimate thousands of job losses in textiles and leather sectors due to the suspension of trade preferences. The suspension of ATPA trade preferences in Bolivia led to significant job losses in the textiles and leather sectors, with a 30% decrease in textile sector employment. A 2008 report by Bolivian business owners highlighted the economic crisis caused by political instability and weakened free trade practices. The report warned that the removal of duty benefits for Bolivian exports would increase unemployment and negatively impact the manufacturing industry, which heavily relied on exports to the United States. The removal of duty-free benefits for Bolivian exports to the United States could lead to job losses in the textile sector, affecting up to 85,000 jobs indirectly. The La Paz region, particularly the El Alto area, would be most impacted, potentially leading to political instability and a risk for democracy in Bolivia. Another study estimated the effects of ATPA suspension on Bolivian real incomes, noting that most affected industries were located in La Paz and El Alto. The termination of ATPA benefits would have a sizable effect on households with employees in the manufacturing industry, although their proportion to the economy is small. The termination of ATPA duty benefits would cause a 0.13% drop in manufacturing employment in Bolivia, with a 2% decline in the textile and apparel sector. Job losses would disproportionately affect indigenous people, who would have fewer earning opportunities. Some Members of Congress believe ATPA preferences should not be extended due to Ecuador's lack of support for U.S. policies. Ecuador's decision to renounce trade preferences may have settled the debate on renewing ATPA. Ecuador announced the renunciation of trade preferences under ATPA with the United States, citing political reasons. Supporters argue ATPA supports jobs in Ecuador, while critics believe it harms U.S. producers. The ATPA has impacted U.S. producers by forcing them to compete with lower-cost Andean imports. Supporters in Andean countries believe ATPA has boosted investor confidence, created jobs, and reduced organized crime. The economic effects of ATPA on Ecuador are difficult to measure, but a suspension could increase investor uncertainty and harm long-term investment. The potential expiration of ATPA could lead to job losses concentrated in certain regions, such as Ecuador's flower industry. Ecuador, a beneficiary of ATPA and GSP, estimates negative impacts on thousands of workers if ATPA is not renewed. Ecuador has requested the U.S. government to add certain products to the GSP preferences list. The Embassy of Ecuador and private entities petitioned the USTR to include fresh cut roses and certain vegetables in the GSP program. The decision on Ecuador's petitions was deferred in 2013. Concerns exist about Ecuador meeting eligibility criteria for ATPA. Business associations suggest periodic reviews to ensure compliance. The group argues that Ecuador is not meeting ATPA criteria, particularly in rule of law, foreign investment, and intellectual property rights protection. A significant issue involves a lawsuit against Chevron by Ecuadorian indigenous peoples over toxic waste dumping. Chevron was ordered to pay $18.2 billion for environmental damages in the Amazon region, but they appealed the ruling. Chevron appealed a ruling in Ecuador for environmental damages in the Amazon region, citing fraudulent evidence and political influence in Ecuador's legal system. The dispute raised concerns about Ecuador's failure to meet ATPA eligibility criteria for recognizing and enforcing arbitral awards. Chevron also claimed Ecuador violated ATPA criteria by not enforcing U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty awards. In 2006, Chevron filed a claim with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, alleging Ecuador breached international law under U.N. rules. In March 2010, the U.N. arbitration panel found Ecuador violated the Bilateral Investment Treaty with the U.S. due to court delays in a dispute with Chevron. The international tribunal ruled in Chevron's favor in August 2011, awarding monetary compensation. The U.S. District Court upheld the arbitration award in June 2013. Ecuador requested an extension of trade preferences under ATPA in a letter to the USTR, citing compliance with eligibility criteria and job support for farmers. The letter from Ecuador requests an extension of trade preferences under ATPA, citing job support for farmers and compliance with eligibility criteria. ATPA has been effective in fighting narcotics trade, supporting women business owners, creating jobs in vulnerable provinces, and expanding exports. The debate on ATPA renewal may be overshadowed by recent diplomatic tensions between the United States and Ecuador. The sensitive U.S. government cable exposed by WikiLeaks was published by El Pais in April 2011. Ecuador condemned the publication as unacceptable and malicious. In retaliation, the Obama Administration expelled the Ecuadorean ambassador. Relations between the two countries resumed in September 2011. President Correa's actions suggest a lack of cooperation with the United States. Last year, he granted asylum to Julian Assange in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. President Correa of Ecuador has shown a lack of cooperation with the United States by granting asylum to Julian Assange and considering asylum for Edward Snowden, who revealed classified U.S. government surveillance programs. Snowden is fleeing a U.S. extradition request."
