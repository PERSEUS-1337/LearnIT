    "content": "Nearly all major roads and bridges in the United States are eligible for assistance from the Emergency Relief Program (ER) of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). ER assistance is restricted to roads and bridges on the federal-aid highway system. States may request reimbursement for emergency road repairs from FEMA for disaster-damaged roads that are not federal-aid highways. FEMA may provide limited funding for activities not eligible for ER funds, such as snow removal during extreme snowfalls. This report outlines FHWA assistance for repairing highways and bridges damaged by disasters or catastrophic failures. The Emergency Relief Program (ER) of the Federal Highway Administration provides federal aid for emergency repair and restoration of disaster-damaged roads and bridges. The program was established in 1934 with the Hayden-Cartwright Act, which initially required states to divert their federal highway funds for disaster repairs. The Federal-Aid Highway and Highway Revenue Act of 1956 authorized separate funds for the ER program, drawing funding from the Treasury's general fund revenues and the Highway Trust Fund. The Emergency Relief Program (ER) is funded by 40% from the Treasury's general fund revenues and 60% from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). It was reauthorized through FY2020 in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) and provides funds for the repair of roads on the federal-aid highway system damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. The Emergency Relief Program (ER) is primarily used for repair and reconstruction after natural disasters, with state departments of transportation coordinating with FHWA for funding. Local officials must go through their state departments of transportation to access ER funds, as the program has a permanent annual authorization of $100 million. The ER program has a permanent annual authorization of $100 million in contract authority from the HTF for road repair and reconstruction after disasters. Additional funds can be appropriated as necessary. States receive reimbursement for repairs after submitting vouchers to FHWA. Once the state's eligibility for ER funds is confirmed by FHWA, it can incur obligations with assurance of reimbursement. Emergency repairs within 180 days of a disaster may be reimbursed with a 100% federal share. Permanent repair projects are reimbursed at a federal share of 90% for Interstate System highways and 80% for most other highways. If a state's expenses exceed its apportionments for the year, the federal share becomes \"up to 90%\" for any federal-aid road. States must provide a share of funding for permanent repairs, regardless of timing. FHWA pays for repairs after states submit vouchers. The FHWA pays 100% of emergency or permanent repair costs for roads on federal lands, with exceptions for certain programs. Legislation has authorized 100% funding for specific disaster-related projects. Since 2012, a 90% federal share is allowed for states exceeding their apportionments. The ER program categorizes repairs as emergency or permanent, with states required to contribute to permanent repairs. FHWA reimburses states for repairs after voucher submission. The FHWA categorizes repair work into emergency and permanent categories for roads and bridges on the federal-aid highway system damaged during disasters. ER assistance aims to restore facilities to pre-disaster conditions, focusing on resilience and meeting current standards for traffic volume. The DOT defines resilience as the ability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from multi-hazard threats with minimal damage. ER funds are used to respond to multi-hazard threats and repair roads and bridges on the federal-aid highway system. States must provide a list of eligible project sites and repair costs within two years of the disaster. Contractors must meet all required conditions and pay prevailing wages. ER-funded contracts must comply with DBE, ADA, \"Buy America\" regulations, and prohibitions against convict labor. Repair projects under ER program must adhere to NEPA requirements, but emergency repairs are usually exempt. Betterments may require NEPA review. State and local agencies can start emergency repairs without FHWA approval. Agencies can start emergency repairs immediately without FHWA approval. Costs can be reimbursed retrospectively for eligible disaster work. Emergency repair work must be completed within 180 days for a 100% federal share. Examples include road regrading, landslide removal, and temporary detour construction. Debris removal is generally FEMA's responsibility, but ER funding covers certain facilities. The Emergency Relief Program allows for immediate emergency repairs to start without approval, with costs reimbursed for eligible disaster work. Permanent repairs aim to restore damaged bridges and roads to pre-event conditions. Total project cost cannot exceed repair or reconstruction costs of a comparable facility meeting current standards. ER funds can be used for temporary or permanent repair of damaged bridges or tunnels, including building new bridges to current design standards. Betterments may be eligible if economically justified. Competitive bidding is required for permanent repair and reconstruction contracts. Techniques like design-build contracting can accelerate projects. The ER program allows for various project acceleration techniques like design-build contracting, shortened advertisement periods for bids, and cost-plus-time bidding with incentives for early completion. The Government Accountability Office expressed concerns about the program's financial sustainability due to expanded eligible activities and states not recapturing all allocated funds. The 2011 GAO report found that FHWA lacked information to verify if additional unused allocations were necessary for ER projects, some of which had expanded beyond restoring damaged facilities to predisaster conditions. A 2013 GAO report noted FHWA officials in some states were hesitant to recoup funds from inactive projects, showing a lack of independence in decisions. The GAO report highlighted concerns about FHWA prioritizing partners' interests over federal interests. Legal and procedural changes have addressed some of these concerns, including requiring states to provide a comprehensive list of eligible project sites and repair costs within two years of an event. The definition of \"comparable facility\" for ER funding has been clarified, and the Emergency Relief Manual has been updated to improve eligibility and procedural issues. Congress may find oversight interest in the implementation of these changes, including the \"quick release\" method for providing initial ER funds for large disasters. On April 6, 2017, FHWA allocated $768 million of Emergency Relief (ER) funds nationwide, with Colorado receiving the most at $124 million for road damage caused by flooding in 2013. California was allocated $92.5 million for various weather and fire disasters. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 allowed the Secretary of Transportation to obligate up to $500 million for a single natural disaster event in a state for ER. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 allocated up to $500 million for a single natural disaster event in a state for Emergency Relief (ER) funding. Section 5324 of MAP-21 established a new program for public transportation similar to FHWA's ER program, aimed at helping states and transit agencies cover costs incurred due to disasters and emergencies. Eligible projects include capital projects for repairing and replacing public transportation equipment and facilities, as well as operating costs for evacuation activities. The Emergency Relief Program for public transportation covers costs for evacuation, rescue operations, and temporary transit services during emergencies. Funds are authorized as needed and require appropriations. The Secretary of Transportation determines grant terms. Operating costs are eligible for reimbursement for up to two years after a disaster. Grants are for expenses not covered by FEMA. The program received $10.9 billion from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 for recovery and resilience projects. The Emergency Relief Program allocated approximately $10.4 billion for recovery, relief, and resilience projects in areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. Funds were distributed for response, recovery, rebuilding costs, locally prioritized resilience projects, competitive resilience projects, and direct transfer resilience grants. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has allocated $10.1 billion out of $10.2 billion available for projects not easily funded through regular processes. The federal cost share for emergency relief projects is capped at 80% and 75% for resilience projects. Controversy surrounds the use of funds for projects unrelated to storm resilience. FTA now requires sponsors to prioritize protecting existing assets before investing in new facilities. Resilience of transportation infrastructure is a growing concern. The resilience of U.S. highway and public transportation infrastructure is a growing concern, especially in the face of climate change and regional threats like earthquakes. Current programs focus on reactive measures, with funding available for damaged facilities that meet current standards. Congress could encourage attention to infrastructure resilience in various ways. Congress could enhance surface transportation infrastructure resilience by retaining the current programmatic structure but expanding \"betterment\" eligibilities for increased funding towards resilience measures. Additional funds could be allocated through the appropriations process, and the mission and funding of existing Emergency Relief programs could be expanded to cover climate change risks. A stand-alone program dedicated to preventive retrofitting or rebuilding at-risk road and transit infrastructure could also be created either permanently or as part of the normal authorization process. Encouraging states to use federal formula funds for resilience projects by providing an increased federal share for such efforts."
