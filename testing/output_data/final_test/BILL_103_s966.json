    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Reduction of Metals in Packaging Act\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that the management of solid waste poses hazards to public health and the environment, with packaging contributing significantly to the waste stream. Heavy metals in packaging, such as lead and mercury, are of particular concern due to their potential impact on emissions and landfill leachate. The goal of the Act is to reduce the toxicity of packaging waste by eliminating the addition of these heavy metals. The intent of this Act is to reduce toxicity in packaging without hindering the use of postconsumer materials. The Act aims to reduce packaging toxicity while promoting the use of postconsumer materials. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator, distributor, incidental presence, and intentional introduction of toxic substances in packaging. The Act defines key terms related to packaging, including the exclusion of certain substances that naturally occur in raw materials or are present as postconsumer additions. The term \"manufacturer\" refers to anyone in the production chain who creates packaging for sale or promotional purposes. \"Package\" or \"packaging\" includes containers used for marketing, protecting, or handling products, as defined by standard D-996. Packaging components include trays, wrappers, films, bags, tubs, blocking, bracing, cushioning, weatherproofing, strapping, coating, closure, ink, label, adhesive, and stabilizer. Tin-plated steel meeting standard A-623 is considered an individual packaging component. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON ADDITION OF CERTAIN HEAVY METALS IN PACKAGING. Prohibition on the intentional introduction of lead, cadmium, mercury, or hexavalent chromium in packaging or its components. Concentration levels must not exceed 600 parts per million after 2 years, 250 parts per million after 3 years, and 100 parts per million thereafter. After 4 years from the enactment of the Act, the concentration level of lead, cadmium, mercury, or hexavalent chromium in packaging or its components must not exceed 100 parts per million. SEC. 5. EXEMPTIONS. Exemptions from section 4 requirements include packaging with pre-Act manufacture dates or alternative evidence, and packaging with added lead, cadmium, mercury, or hexavalent chromium for health or safety compliance. During a 6-year period, exemptions from the requirements of the Act may be granted by the Administrator to manufacturers based on specific criteria, allowing the use of certain substances in packaging for protection or safe handling. Exemptions can be granted for a period of 2 years and may be renewed every 2 years if criteria are met. On the date of enactment, section 4 requirements do not apply to packaging or its components exceeding concentration levels due to recycled materials. SEC. 6. CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE. The manufacturer or supplier of packaging must provide a certificate of compliance to each purchaser within 2 years of this Act's enactment. The certificate must state compliance with the Act, any exemptions claimed, be signed by an authorized official, and retained by the purchaser while the packaging is in use. The manufacturer or supplier must retain the certificate of compliance for the packaging in use. A copy of the certificate must be kept on file by the manufacturer or supplier. The certificate shall be provided to the Administrator upon request and to the public. If there are any changes to the packaging, an amended or new certificate of compliance must be provided. Public access to certificate of compliance is required by writing a specific request to the manufacturer. The manufacturer must respond within 60 days. Federal enforcement allows the Administrator to issue civil penalties up to $25,000 for violations. Nonpre-emption clause is included. SEC. 9. NONPRE-EMPTION: States can enforce stricter standards on toxic metals in packaging than those set by this Act. \n\nSEC. 10. REGULATIONS: The Administrator must create regulations for this Act within 18 months of its enactment."
