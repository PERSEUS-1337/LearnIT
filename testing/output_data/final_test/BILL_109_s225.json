    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Land Recreational Visitor Protection Act of 2005\" establishes an avalanche protection program under the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, establishes a coordinated avalanche protection program to identify and reduce avalanche risks for recreational users of public land and visitors to National Parks. Coordination with the Secretary of the Interior is required to ensure adequate protection levels. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, establishes a coordinated avalanche protection program for recreational users of public land, including National Parks, wilderness areas, and other at-risk locations. Resources from the National Avalanche Center of the Forest Service will be utilized, and additional resources may be used as available. An advisory committee will be established to support the program. An advisory committee consisting of 11 members representing authorized users of artillery for avalanche control will be established by the Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior. Members will include representatives from federal land management agencies, concessionaires, permittees, and state departments of transportation. The Secretary, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of the Army will establish a central depository for weapons, ammunition, and parts for avalanche control purposes. Grants may be provided to assist in prevention and forecasting of avalanches. The program aims to assist in avalanche prevention, detection, and mitigation for safety and protection. It also focuses on maintaining essential transportation and communications affected by avalanches, and providing supplies for avalanche control in National Parks, Federal lands, and at-risk communities. The program aims to assist in avalanche prevention, detection, and mitigation for safety and protection, focusing on transportation corridors at risk of avalanches. Priority is given to projects in avalanche zones with high frequency or severity of avalanches, or where deaths, injuries, or damage have occurred or are likely to occur. The program also supports research for cost-effective alternatives to military weapons for avalanche control. The amendment allows surplus artillery ordnance suitable for avalanche control purposes to be provided to users. Authorization of appropriations for this Act is set at $15,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2010."
