    "content": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are effective for processing uniformly sampled data signals like images, but most data signals are not naturally on a grid, leading to aliasing error and information loss. Signals can have different topological structures, making it difficult to analyze mixed topologies. Mathematical formulations for Non-Uniform Fourier Transforms (NUFT) are developed to sample nonuniform data signals of different topologies onto a simplex mesh with no spatial sampling error. The spectral transform is done in Euclidean space, providing four distinct advantages. The representation presented offers advantages such as no spatial sampling error, a unified framework for analyzing signals of mixed topologies using CNNs, leveraging existing CNN architectures effectively, and allowing weighted meshes with local properties. It achieves good results for 3D shape retrieval and sets a new state-of-the-art for point cloud to surface reconstruction tasks. The representation on weighted simplex meshes preserves maximal shape information based on Fourier transformation. Most methods using CNNs for shape learning preprocess shapes into uniform-grid based 2D or 3D images, but these lose 3D topologies and suffer from aliasing errors. Mesh and graph based CNNs perform well in representing weighted meshes with local properties. Our method utilizes analytical integration to sample in the spectral domain, avoiding representational errors seen in voxel-based and view-based models. It allows for the use of powerful CNN architectures on arbitrary geometrical structures, preserving shape information and generalizing across varied topologies. Our framework utilizes shape representation for deep learning tasks on arbitrary geometrical signals, treating the signal as a Euclidean space instead of a graph. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments including a controlled MNIST example, 3D shape retrieval, and 3D point cloud reconstruction tasks. The representation shows unique advantages and potential for wider application in shape learning problems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in shape retrieval and surface reconstruction tasks. Our work introduces mathematical formulations for Fourier Transforms of signals on various geometries, demonstrating precise frequency domain representation with minimal errors. Our shape representation outperforms traditional voxel and SDF methods, leading to state-of-the-art performance in shape retrieval and surface reconstruction tasks when combined with CNNs. The representation of geometrical signals is crucial for shape learning, as it determines learning architectures and information richness. While 2D image learning has established data representation, 3D shape learning lacks consensus. Various shape representations in 3D machine learning include multiview images, volumetric voxels, point clouds, and polygonal meshes. Our proposed representation is similar to volumetric voxel representation, utilizing the inverse Fourier Transform for shape representation. However, binary voxel representation leads to aliasing errors during sampling. Using boolean values for floating point numbers in CNN training is inefficient. Signed Distance Function (SDF) provides shape boundary localization, but is limited to linear surfaces. Our proposed representation under Fourier basis allows for nonlinear surface boundary localization, achieving subgrid-scale accuracy. Cartesian CNNs are widely used in Computer Vision for tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and image segmentation. They have also been applied in shape learning models, with the ability to extend to 3D using 3D convolutional kernels. Cartesian CNNs are efficient for shape learning models using volumetric representations, but improvements have been made for sparse 3D shape signals. Space partitioning tree structures like Quadtree and Octree have been utilized to enhance Cartesian CNNs. These CNNs leverage backbone architectures from computer vision problems and achieve good performance. Graph CNNs, on the other hand, use input graph structures for graph convolutions and have been developed for general graph structured data. Spectral CNNs have also been used with the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian as a basis. Specially Designed Neural Networks have been used for learning on unconventional data structures, such as points and 3D shapes. Various approaches like global pooling, CNNs, and shape manifold convolutions have been explored for efficient learning. Improved methods for Fourier transforms of 2D polygonal shape functions have also been proposed. A 3D formulation proposed by BID41 for Fourier analysis of simplex domains, with approximation methods for Fast Fourier Transform of polynomial functions on simplices. Prisacariu & Reid (2011) use elliptic Fourier descriptors for shape description in level set-based segmentation and tracking. Previous literature exists on fast non-uniform Fourier transform methods for discretely sampled signals. This study introduces a general expression and algorithm for j-simplex mesh transformation, applicable to deep learning problems using weighted simplicial complexes. A j-simplex mesh consists of segments, triangles, and their d-dimensional counterparts. It is a homogeneous simplicial j-complex where signal can be defined as a piecewise constant j-simplex function over the mesh. Each element in the mesh has a distinct signal density, allowing for applications like defining RGB color values on triangular mesh elements in Computer Vision and Graphics. The three-component density value on a triangular mesh defines RGB color content. Signal density can represent mass or charge for scientific purposes. A piecewise-constant j-simplex function is the superposition of N simplices. The Fourier transform of the density function on the j-simplex mesh can be decomposed into a weighted sum of individual j-simplices.\u03b3 j n is the content distortion factor, comparing content between the simplex and the unit orthogonal j-simplex. The Fourier transform of a signal on a weighted simplex mesh can be computed using the general expression provided. The content distortion factor \u03b3 j n can be calculated for the unit orthogonal j-simplex. The matrix B j n represents squared distances between nodes and is symmetrical. The simplex content can be computed using the Cayley-Menger Determinant. The auxiliary node method efficiently computes the Fourier transform of polytopes with uniform signal density by traversing each element in the boundary mesh exactly once. It utilizes signed content and forms an auxiliary j-simplex for the computation. The auxiliary node method efficiently computes the Fourier transform of polytopes with uniform signal density by utilizing signed content and forming auxiliary j-simplices for computation. Equation (3) provides a general expression for computing the unsigned transform for a single j-simplex, with a modification to compute the signed content distortion factor for overlapping regions. The determinant of the Jacobian matrix is crucial for parameterizing the auxiliary simplex to a unit orthogonal simplex. The method requires oriented boundary simplices, determined using the right-hand rule. Efficiency in algorithmic implementation involves adding random noise to vertex coordinates to avoid division-by-zero errors. To ensure robustness, random noise is added to vertex coordinates and the k = 0 frequency mode. Caching values in memory is necessary for efficiency, using the Breadth-First-Search (BFS) algorithm for traversal. The experiment setup is discussed, with model architecture details deferred to supplementary material. The focus is on learning from nonuniform mesh-based representations, comparing methods with the state of the art. In a comparison with state-of-the-art methods, the study uses MNIST characters as polygons to highlight the impact of shape representation on deep learning performance. The original pixel images are pre-processed into polygons represented by watertight line meshes. NUFT involves computing Fourier modes for the shape function and transforming them into physical domain images. Results are compared with raw pixel images downsampled to different resolutions. The study compares different shape representations for deep learning performance using MNIST characters as polygons. NUFT outperforms binary pixel and distance function representations, even surpassing downsampled raw pixel images at low resolutions. NUFT-S and NUFT-V are evaluated for 3D shape retrieval performance on SHREC17 BID24 dataset. Our model, utilizing NUFT-surface (NUFT-S) and NUFT-volume (NUFT-V) at various resolutions, was compared against state-of-the-art shape retrieval algorithms. Results showed comparable performance to pretrained 2D models, outperforming models not pretrained on additional data. NUFT-volume and NUFT-surface representations demonstrated similar performances under the same resolution. The study compared NUFT-surface and NUFT-volume representations with state-of-the-art shape retrieval algorithms, showing comparable performance to pretrained 2D models. NUFT representations achieved better results than current methods and were robust to input noise. The unique task of surface reconstruction from point cloud was addressed successfully using NUFT-point and NUFT-surface representations. Using NUFT-point representation as input and NUFT-surface representation as output, the task is framed as a 3D image-to-image translation problem. The U-Net BID22 architecture is utilized with a single L2 loss between output and ground truth NUFT-surface representation. The model is trained and tested on shapes from three categories of ShapeNet55 Core dataset (car, sofa, bottle), with pre-processing steps including mesh simplification and point cloud conversion. At test time, the output NUFT-surface implicit function is post-processed. At test time, the output NUFT-surface implicit function is post-processed using the marching cubes algorithm to extract contours. The mesh is further shrunk by moving vertices to positions with higher density values while maintaining rigidity. Performance is compared with traditional methods like Poisson Surface Reconstruction and Deep Marching Cubes using metrics like Chamfer distance, Accuracy, and Completeness. Noise testing is also conducted with Gaussian inputs for comparison. The NUFT representation achieves state-of-the-art results in point to surface reconstruction, showcasing good localization properties and flexibility across geometry topologies. It offers a versatile representation for multidimensional signals on simplicial complexes, maximizing shape information preservation. Mathematical formulations and algorithmic tools are developed for efficient transformations, demonstrated through examples like MNIST polygon, shape retrieval, and point to surface reconstruction tasks. The study presents an alternative representation for CNN-based learning on geometrical signals, showing potential in 3D tasks with mixed-topology signals. The parameterization scheme involves transforming the original simplex domain to a unit orthogonal simplex in a lower-dimensional space. The Fourier transform integral is performed in the parametric space, with results restored by a content distortion factor. The content distortion factor \u03b3 j n is the ratio between the content of the original simplex and the content of the unit orthogonal simplex in parametric space. Points have spatial position x but no size, hence can be mathematically modelled as a delta function with point mass at zero. The content distortion factor \u03b3 j n represents the ratio between the original simplex's content and the unit orthogonal simplex's content in parametric space. Parameterizing different shapes onto unit orthogonal shapes allows for integration calculations. 3-SIMPLEX parameterizes a tetrahedron onto a unit orthogonal tetrahedron in R d. Different shape representation schemes are evaluated in terms of geometrical shape information by converting original polytopal shapes into corresponding representations and reconstructing the shape using interpolation and contouring methods. Mesh Intersection over Union (mesh-IoU) metric is used to quantify geometrical shape information. Mesh boolean and volume computation can be efficiently performed with computational geometry methods, and contouring and mesh extraction can be done using marching cubes in three dimensions. In three dimensions, contouring and mesh extraction are performed using marching cubes algorithm for mesh reconstruction. Bilinear upsampling is used for binarized representation, followed by 0.5-contouring. Spectral domain upsampling is used for NUFT representation, followed by training the model with specific details such as batch size, learning rate, optimizer, and model architecture. For training the model, a modified 3D U-Net architecture with 4 down convolutions and 4 up-convolutions is used. The model is trained using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 for 200 epochs. The input is NUFT point representation and the loss function is L2 between output and ground truth. The model is trained and evaluated at 128^3 resolution."
