    "content": "When the House considers legislation, the motion to recommit is the last chance to affect a measure by offering amendatory language or sending the bill back to committee. The Speaker gives priority to those opposed to the measure, particularly minority party Members, with the minority leader or designee having the first opportunity to offer the motion. Only one proper motion to recommit is allowed, and if ruled out of order, a second proper motion may be made. A motion to recommit is the last chance to affect a measure in the House. It can be amended if the previous question has not been ordered. House rules ensure the motion can include instructions for an amendment by the minority leader. A motion to recommit in the House can be of two types: \"simple\" or \"straight\" without instructions, or with instructions directing immediate reporting of the legislation back to the House floor for amendment consideration. The House votes on agreeing to the amendments. The House votes on agreeing to the amendment(s) before moving to final passage of the bill as it may have been amended. Typically, if the motion to recommit has been agreed to, the amendment in the instructions is agreed to by voice vote. Amendments in the instructions are subject to division of the question if it consists of two or more separable substantive propositions. When a motion to recommit with instructions is offered, the clerk will report it in a specific format. The D.C. Official Code is amended to require protection of students and applicants under civil rights laws for participation in the opportunity scholarship program. Both types of motions to recommit are debatable for 10 minutes, with debate time equally divided between the Member making the motion and a Member opposing it. A motion to recommit allows the minority to offer and obtain a vote on policy language of their design, with restrictions on what can be proposed in the instructions. Instructions in a motion to recommit generally may not propose amendments that are not germane to the measure or violate specific House rules. A motion to recommit allows the minority to offer amendments before final passage, including previously rejected ones. It can send the bill back to the committee for further work or to a different committee for consideration. A motion to recommit allows the minority to offer amendments before final passage, including previously rejected ones. It can send the bill back to the committee for further work or to a different committee for consideration, such as creating an ad hoc committee with no permanence. The motion to recommit a bill to a different committee can provide alternative ways to achieve the legislation's goals. This process allows for further debate and potential improvements to the measure, although the committee's decision to act on the recommitted bill may be influenced by House and committee rules. The motion to recommit underwent changes in 1909 to give the minority a vote on important issues, allowing Members to show their policy preferences to constituents. The Speaker pro tempore noted that House and committee rules could affect the timing of actions on recommitted measures. The motion to recommit allows the minority party to express policy preferences and create a public record of their differences from the majority. It can delay or \"kill\" a measure by sending it back to committee without instructions. It also provides an outlet for the minority to express discontent with the legislative process. The motion to recommit allows minority party members to express opposition to majority party policies by sending a measure back to committee. It has existed since the First Congress, with the priority for offering the motion previously not reserved for those opposed to the bill. The motion to recommit historically allowed Members to correct errors in a measure, but its use changed in 1909 due to House procedure changes. This was influenced by Democrats and Progressive Republicans opposing Speaker Cannon's rule. In 1909, during the 61st Congress, Representative John Fitzgerald proposed rules changes giving priority to minority Members to offer the motion to recommit. This amendment aimed to allow the minority to have a vote on important issues. The rules change passed 211-173, establishing the motion as a \"minority right.\" In 1971, House Rule XIX, clause 2(b) was added, allowing 10 minutes of debate on the motion. In the 92nd Congress, a new rule allowed recorded votes in the Committee of the Whole for the first time, leading some to question the necessity of the motion to recommit. Despite expanded voting rules, the minority's right to offer a motion to recommit remained intact. The motion to recommit remained intact despite expanded voting rules. In 1985, the House added language allowing for one-hour debate on the motion, controlled by the proponent and opponent. The Rules Committee issued more special rules in the 1980s and 1990s, restricting the amending process. During the 110th Congress, there was an increase in motions to recommit with \"non-forthwith\" instructions, creating difficult political choices. During the 110th Congress, motions to recommit with \"non-forthwith\" instructions created difficult political choices for Members. Arguments were made that these motions were designed to trap majority party Members and were unnecessary as motions could usually be offered \"forthwith.\" This led to the House amending its rules to require instructions to report an amendment back to the House \"forthwith.\" The rules package of the 111th Congress changed the motion to recommit by allowing \"straight\" motions to be debatable, in addition to motions with instructions. These changes are still in effect."
