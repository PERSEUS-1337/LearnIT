    "content": "The \"Partnership for Academic Success in the States Act\" or the \"PASS Act\" includes provisions for a pilot program, performance agreements, eligible education grant programs, maintenance of academic standards, funding levels, permissible fund uses, allocation within states, administrative expenses, private school participation, fiscal responsibilities, annual reports, agreement terms modification, competitive selection process, performance review, and awards for reducing achievement gaps. The Secretary of Education will conduct a pilot program under the PASS Act, involving up to 10 States. The Secretary will enter into performance agreements with participating States in the pilot program under the PASS Act. These agreements will grant the State the funds they would receive from eligible education grant programs and waive certain program requirements. The agreement will specify the covered programs and waived requirements, with the Secretary unable to waive certain requirements. Under the performance agreement in the PASS Act, the Secretary can waive specific requirements of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, including academic standards, report cards, and public school choice. SEC. 4. ELIGIBLE EDUCATION GRANT PROGRAMS. Eligible education grant programs under this Act include various programs in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and the teacher and principal training and recruiting fund in title II of the Act. The Act includes provisions related to education grant programs such as teacher training, technology grants, English language acquisition, safe schools, innovative programs, Indian education, vocational education, and homeless assistance. The pilot program requires participating states to maintain challenging academic standards and show progress towards achieving them. Additionally, states must maintain funding levels for education. SEC. 6. MAINTENANCE OF FUNDING LEVELS SPENT BY STATES ON EDUCATION.\n\nStates in the pilot program must spend at least the same amount on elementary and secondary education as they did in 2007. The Secretary can waive this requirement in cases of exceptional circumstances.\n\nSEC. 7. PERMISSIBLE USES OF FUNDS. Grant amounts received under this Act can be used for elementary and secondary education purposes as permitted by State law to advance education priorities, improve student achievement, and narrow achievement gaps. Grant amounts received under this Act must be distributed within the State according to State law. If the grant amounts come from part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the State must ensure that each local educational agency receives an allocation not less than what was allocated in 2007. If the total grant amounts are insufficient, allocations to local educational agencies will be reduced by a uniform percentage. SEC. 9. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.\n\nA State may use up to 1 percent of grant amounts for administrative expenses.\n\nSEC. 10. EQUITABLE PARTICIPATION OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS.\n\nGrant amounts must ensure equitable participation of private schools, students, and staff.\n\nSEC. 11. FISCAL RESPONSIBILITIES.\n\nGrant amounts must follow fiscal control and accounting procedures.\n\nSEC. 12. ANNUAL REPORTS. After each school year, states in the pilot program must submit a detailed report to the Secretary on their activities and compliance with the performance agreement. The report must be widely disseminated to parents and the public, shared with media, and posted online. The Secretary will then submit the report to Congress within 60 days, along with any additional information deemed necessary. Terms of performance agreements are outlined in Section 13. SEC. 13 outlines the terms of performance agreements, with an initial term from 2008 to 2012 and the possibility of extension until 2017. SEC. 14 allows for modifications to the agreement with approval. SEC. 15 involves a competitive selection process. The Secretary will establish a process for selecting States for the pilot program, requiring States to submit an application with a draft performance agreement by March 31, 2007. The application must also include a certification of compliance with notice and comment requirements. The Secretary will select States for a pilot program based on criteria by June 30, 2007. Selected States must enter into a performance agreement by August 15, 2007, developed in accordance with State law. SEC. 16. PERFORMANCE REVIEW AND EARLY TERMINATION.\n\n(a) Periodic Review.--The Secretary will periodically review each State in the pilot program to assess progress and compliance with the Act.\n\n(b) Early Termination.--The Secretary can end a performance agreement early if the State fails to meet yearly progress requirements for three consecutive years or does not comply with other obligations under the Act. The Secretary will award states that achieve a 25% reduction in the performance gap between highest and lowest performing student groups in at least two grade levels and content areas. The award amount will be at least 5% of the grant received in 2008, and the funds will come from the performance agreement. Awards under this section are subject to availability of appropriations and shall be paid from the Fund for the Improvement of Education under part D of title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965."
