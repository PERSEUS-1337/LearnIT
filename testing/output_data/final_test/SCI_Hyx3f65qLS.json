SVDocNet is an end-to-end trainable neural network for blind document deblurring, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This technology is essential as digitization increases the prevalence of document and text-based images in everyday life. Image post-processing is essential for correcting image corruption caused by factors like camera shake and noise. Blind deconvolution is a method used to recover the original image and blurring kernel from observed images, but it is a challenging and non-convex problem. Various techniques have been developed for deblurring text-based images. SVDocNet is a spatially variant network based on U-Net architecture for image deblurring, addressing issues with CNN-based approaches such as spatial invariance and computational expenses. The SVDocNet model incorporates recurrent skip connections in encoder-decoder blocks and auxiliary networks to customize internal adjustments for each image. It is evaluated on benchmark datasets for document deblurring, a crucial aspect of digital document analysis. Document restoration aims to remove warping, shading distortions, noise artifacts, and blurring effects. Traditional image deblurring methods used statistical properties, while recent advancements focus on neural networks and deep learning for data analytics. Neural networks and deep learning have revolutionized data analytics, computer vision, and natural language processing. CNNs have shown remarkable results in image classification, object detection, and image deblurring. Various CNN models have been proposed for image restoration, including predicting Fourier coefficients, using a coarse-to-fine approach, and developing conditional adversarial networks. Different approaches have also been applied to document deblurring, such as integrating priors, using L0-based regularization, and training CNNs for document image restoration.

Various models have been proposed for image restoration, including predicting Fourier coefficients and using conditional adversarial networks. Different approaches have been applied to document deblurring, such as integrating priors and training CNNs for document image restoration. Hradi\u0161 trained a CNN to restore document images, while Jiao discretized the blur kernel space into sub-spaces and used a two-stage CNN for classification. The system response is calculated for an input signal passing through an impulse response to generate an output signal. The blur kernel is assumed to have a finite receptive field, implying that the inverse filter's receptive field will be larger. The use of conventional CNNs for deconvolution to approximate the original image requires a large number of parameters and a complex architecture. Alternatively, reproducing the IIR model for deblurring with fewer coefficients is more efficient. A spatially variant RNN can satisfy these requirements, but refinements are needed to merge information from different filtering directions. This is achieved by splitting the weights' map from secondary networks into four parts for both x-axis and y-axis directions. The model incorporates a spatially variant U-Net for deblurring, with skip connections containing alternating convolutional and RNN layers. Each RNN layer captures spatial information from different directions, reducing computation cost while covering a large receptive field efficiently. The model utilizes a spatially variant U-Net for deblurring, incorporating RNN and convolutional layers for feature extraction. The network includes convolutional layers for downsampling and bilinear upsampling for decoding. Different filter sizes are used in the convolutional layers, with three U-Net based architectures for weight generation networks. The filter size for each layer is 3x3, with varying numbers of filters in the encoder-decoder pairs.

The last layer of each WGN yields the weights required for the RNN layers and uses the 'tanh' activation function. The composite network architecture with the network configurations are depicted in Figure 1. The model was trained for 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 10^-4 on the Keras framework with an Nvidia GTX 1080Ti GPU. Testing was done on Hradi\u0161' test dataset with unique kernels and different levels of noise degradation. Results were compared with a baseline network presented by Hradi\u0161. We compared our proposed SVDocNet model with the baseline network by Hradi\u0161 for blind document deblurring. Using PSNR and SSIM, our model outperformed both the standard U-Net and Hradi\u0161' architecture, especially at higher noise levels. The qualitative results show significant improvement in image quality. The spatially variant U-Net architecture for blind document deblurring replaces skip connections with alternating convolutional and recurrent layers for efficient feature extraction. Three auxiliary U-Net networks predict suitable weights for the recurrent layers based on the input blurred image, demonstrating the system's potency quantitatively and qualitatively."
