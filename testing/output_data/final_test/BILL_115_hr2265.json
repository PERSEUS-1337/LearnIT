    "content": "The \"Main Street Revival Act of 2017\" allows small businesses to defer certain employment taxes. Small businesses can elect to defer payment of specified first-year employment taxes in 4 equal installments under the \"Main Street Revival Act of 2017.\" The unpaid portion of remaining installments is due in certain circumstances like failure to pay timely, liquidation of assets, cessation of business, or similar events. If an election is made to pay first-year employment taxes in installments and a deficiency is assessed, the deficiency will be prorated to the installments. The prorated deficiency for future installments will be collected with those installments, while the deficiency for installments already due will be paid upon notice from the Secretary. This rule does not apply if the deficiency is due to negligence, intentional disregard of rules, or fraud to evade tax. The term 'specified small business' under this section refers to any HUBZone business with an expectation of employing no more than 25 full-time employees in the specified first-year. The term 'HUBZone business' includes any employer meeting certain criteria. The term 'HUBZone' refers to an area designated as a historically underutilized business zone, where a business must actively operate and have a substantial portion of services performed by employees. This is relevant for specified first-year employment taxes. The term 'employment taxes' refers to taxes imposed on wages paid during the specified first-year of a small business. All persons treated as a single employer under certain sections shall be treated as one person for tax purposes. The amendment made by this section applies to specified small businesses defined in the Internal Revenue Code, with the first-year beginning after the enactment of the Act. Trust funds for Social Security shall be unaffected by this amendment."
