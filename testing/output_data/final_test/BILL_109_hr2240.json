    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Urban and Rural Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Act of 2005\". Congressional findings are also included. The Congress finds that in 1999, 61% of adults in the US were overweight or obese, with all age, racial, and ethnic groups affected. Approximately 112,000 deaths are associated with obesity each year, along with various health issues. The economic cost of obesity in 2000 was around $117 billion. It is recommended that American adults engage in 30 minutes and children in 60 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week. Physical activity is crucial for preventing weight gain, losing weight, and maintaining weight loss. However, only a small percentage of American adults meet the recommended levels of physical activity. Lack of leisure-time physical activity is prevalent, with 40% of adults in the US not participating in any. Engaging in physical activity, combined with healthy eating, is essential for preventing and treating overweight and obesity. Additionally, the use of public recreational facilities and services positively correlates with the level of physical activity in individuals and communities. Medical and other research show a direct positive relationship between active recreation and disease prevention and general wellness.
