    "content": "Federal government budget deficits have been a concern of policymakers in recent years, with debates between tax cut proponents and deficit \"hawks\" on the effects of deficits on the economy. This report examines the relationship between budget deficits and interest rates, highlighting the complexity of the issue beyond a simple observation of interest rate fluctuations. The relationship between budget deficits and interest rates is complex due to various factors affecting interest rates, such as the state of the economy, saving behavior, investment opportunities, financial markets, demographics, and global financial relationships. Economists use theoretical models to control for these factors statistically and analyze how deficits impact interest rates. Different economic models offer varying evidence on the deficit-interest rate relationship. The budget deficit-interest rate relationship is debated among economists, with some offering evidence supporting the relationship while others refute it. Budget deficits consume real resources when the government borrows to finance spending or tax cuts, leading to higher interest rates. Different theories explain where the resources come from, impacting interest rates. Ultimately, economists and policymakers seek to understand where the resources originate from. The budget deficit's impact on interest rates and the nation's welfare is a key question for economists and policymakers. Budget deficits can affect interest rates and overall economic growth. Mainstream economic theory suggests that deficits can boost total spending and stimulate short-term growth. This can happen through increased government spending or tax cuts, which both contribute to expanding aggregate spending. In an economy at full employment, an increase in spending from tax cuts recipients leads to a mismatch between aggregate demand and supply, requiring market adjustment. This adjustment can result in higher prices and temporary inflation, which may prompt an increase in nominal interest rates. To maintain stable inflation, the Federal Reserve may counteract the rise in demand by tightening monetary policy and raising short-term real interest rates. The increase in demand for savings due to government competition and firms' desire for higher production leads to higher interest rates, crowding out private investment. Investment demand rises as firms seek to increase their supply of goods, resulting in higher interest rates in the money market. In the money market, increased aggregate spending raises money demand, leading to higher interest rates. With higher interest rates, money velocity increases, shifting resources towards the government and away from private sector saving. This shift has long-term consequences for economic growth, as budget deficits reduce national saving and crowd out private investment. Budget deficits lead to less private investment, reducing the economy's size and future standards of living. Deficits place a burden on future generations by allowing more consumption today at the expense of lower saving and investment. This results in lower consumption in the future. In an economy with underemployed labor and capital resources, financing a budget deficit can stimulate the economy by bringing back unused resources into use, generating new production to match increased spending. This is how expansionary fiscal policy works during a recession. During a recession, an underemployed economy can match increased spending with unused resources, leading to a larger aggregate spending increase than the budget deficit. This scenario, not seen since the Great Depression, would have minimal impact on interest rates and inflation if the deficit is eliminated once the economy reaches full employment. In past recessions, some underemployed resources were utilized in response to increased spending, but not enough to prevent increases in interest rates or prices within the conventional model. Expansionary fiscal policy can lead to an increase in aggregate spending, interest rates, and prices, especially when the economy is close to full employment. Deficits can temporarily stimulate production even at full employment, but may not completely offset the increase in aggregate spending. Expansionary fiscal policy can lead to an increase in aggregate spending, interest rates, and prices, especially when the economy is close to full employment. A deficit is likely to result in a smaller increase in output and larger increase in prices at full employment than in a recession. Economists are cautious about pushing the economy above full employment as it could lead to overshooting and a recession. Relaxing the assumption of a closed economy has significant implications for interest rates. The United States could potentially draw from the world pool of savings instead of being limited to national savings, which could prevent an increase in deficits from affecting interest rates. With perfect capital mobility, a deficit would have no impact on interest rates as capital would flow in or out of the country to equalize rates with the world. In a world of perfect capital mobility, a deficit would not affect interest rates, but it would still have costs to the economy. Foreign capital inflows lead to a larger U.S. capital stock, benefiting U.S. workers with higher wages. However, returns from this capital flow to foreigners. The influx of foreign capital causes the dollar to appreciate, making U.S. exports less competitive and expanding the trade deficit, reducing aggregate spending in the economy. In a world of perfect capital mobility, a deficit would not affect interest rates, but it would still have costs to the economy. The expansion in the trade deficit would offset the expansion of fiscal policy one-to-one, shifting crowding out from the investment sector to the trade sector. This means fiscal stimulus has no net effect on aggregate spending, with the burden of deficits now borne by U.S. exporters and import-competing firms. The conventional view assumes that recipients of a tax cut would save a fraction and spend the rest, but there is no direct way to measure how much would be saved. Supply siders believe that tax cuts could lead to a significant increase in private saving, even though the average household saving rate is low. They argue that small increases in the after-tax rate of return could result in large increases in saving if saving is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. This could prevent large changes in interest rates and support investment, keeping the budget deficit in check. The long-run behavior of private saving in the country casts doubt on the idea that small changes in tax rates could significantly impact the private saving rate. The corporate saving rate has remained constant post-war, while the household saving rate has decreased notably in the last two decades. This decline in household saving has occurred despite various changes in marginal tax rates, including reductions in top marginal income tax rates and the expansion of tax-preferred savings vehicles. Private saving may not necessarily increase in response to higher interest rates, as individuals could potentially save less instead. In response to higher interest rates, individuals may save less, especially if they are target savers saving for specific goals. This could make meeting their goals easier but lead to a decrease in overall savings. The relationship between incentives and saving behavior is unclear, with no clear evidence to support either view. The decline in household savings in the late 1990s coincided with a rising stock market, as predicted by the target-saver view. Economists question if there are explanations for a larger private saving response to a budget deficit. Some economists criticize the mainstream view for lacking a detailed explanation of how savers respond to changes in the government's fiscal position. The Barro-Ricardo view, based on specific assumptions, suggests deficits may not affect interest rates. Robert Barro's theory assumes rational individuals with infinite lifespans who can borrow limitlessly against future earnings and are taxed equally. Barro's theory assumes rational individuals with infinite lifespans can borrow limitlessly against future earnings, taxed equally. Deficits may not affect interest rates if government purchases are perfect substitutes for private consumption or if deficit finances tax cuts that are lump-sum in nature. Individuals adjust consumption and savings to offset future tax burdens or reduced government services due to deficits, leading to an expansion of the savings pool without upward pressure on interest rates. In the Barro-Ricardo view, deficits do not lead to increased interest rates or long-term growth. Instead, resources are transferred from private consumption to the government, similar to a tax increase. This offsets any short-run stimulative effect on the economy, as national saving and aggregate spending remain the same. The Barro-Ricardo view explains how individuals adjust their saving behavior in response to fiscal policy by transferring resources from private consumption to the government. However, this explanation is weakened by strict conditions that may not hold in real life scenarios, such as uncertainty, lack of understanding about deficits, or differing individual circumstances affecting saving behavior. The Barro-Ricardo view suggests that budget deficits may cause interest rates to rise, but comparing deficits to interest rates is not a reliable method. Other factors also influence interest rates, such as the business cycle. Statistical methods are needed to isolate the impact of deficits on interest rates. For example, interest rates often fall during recessions due to reduced investment demand. If the business cycle has a greater effect on interest rates than deficits, changes in deficits may not have a significant impact on interest rates. Changes in the structural deficit coinciding with recessions may suggest deficits cause interest rates to fall, but it is actually the recession causing the decrease. Empirical evidence shows deficits do not directly affect interest rates, but they still impose a burden on the economy by crowding out either the trade sector or current private consumption. In the Barro-Ricardo view, budget deficits crowd out private consumption. Various econometric studies on deficit effects on interest rates have conflicting conclusions due to differences in variables, modeling, and assumptions. Changes in model structure can significantly alter results, with some researchers using flawed assumptions like actual deficit instead of structural deficit. The statistical method used in studies on deficit effects on interest rates has limitations, such as the use of nominal instead of real interest rates and the omission of foreign capital flows. Studies often mix data from different economic regimes, leading to questionable results. This report will focus on summarizing the results of three literature reviews, including one by Barth et al. in 1991. Barth et al. (1991) conducted a literature review on deficits and interest rates, finding mixed evidence. Some studies showed deficits positively affecting interest rates, with a potential increase of 0.4-1.2 percentage points for a deficit equal to 1% of GNP. Structural budget deficits had a greater impact on interest rates than actual deficits, especially on long-term rates. Changes in the structural budget deficit have a greater impact on interest rates than changes in the actual budget deficit. Using the structural deficit or advanced statistical techniques in studies avoids skewing results influenced by the state of the economy. High frequency data may not show a clear link between deficits and interest rates due to their volatility. Studies have shown that the link between deficits and interest rates is stronger when deficits finance government spending rather than tax cuts. The use of a measure of future deficits, rather than contemporaneous deficits, is more likely to reveal an effect on interest rates. However, the proper measure of future deficits is debated, with the CBO baseline not considered accurate. Tax cuts may have a smaller impact on interest rates if recipients save some of the proceeds. Some studies using vector-autoregression found no effect of deficits on interest rates. The vector-autoregression method, while not identifying theoretical relationships between variables, may be more accurate than an incorrect theoretical model due to lack of consensus. It cannot control for investors' expectations of future deficits. Evidence on deficits' effects on interest rates is mixed, with no definitive conclusion on whether deficits raise interest rates and reduce saving and capital formation. The studies surveyed on deficits' effects on interest rates and consumption show mixed results. A Joint Economic Committee study found a negative or statistically insignificant relationship between deficits and interest rates. Gale and Orszag reviewed articles from the 1990s and found that 11 out of 16 studies published since then showed deficits had a positive and statistically significant effect. The studies reviewed found that deficits had a positive and statistically significant effect on interest rates, with some showing mixed effects. Recent studies focus on long-term budget forecasts and differentiate between long-term and short-term interest rates, attributing the change in outcome to improved research techniques. Long-term deficits have a greater impact on interest rates than temporary deficits, as shown in 10 macroeconomic forecasting models. A budget deficit equal to 1% of GDP would increase interest rates by 0.1 to 1.0 percentage points after one year and 0.05 to 2.0 percentage points after 10 years in all models examined. The budget deficit-interest rate relationship is explained by the fact that deficits are financed through real resources, leading to higher interest rates. Mainstream economic theory states that deficits are funded by the nation's pool of saving, crowding out private investment. This can burden future generations as less investment leads to a smaller economy. However, other theories suggest that resources can come from foreign lending, avoiding the need for higher interest rates. The capital mobility view suggests that foreign lending can finance a deficit without affecting interest rates, but it can lead to a decline in U.S. industries. The Barro-Ricardo view argues that individuals save more in anticipation of future tax increases or spending cuts to finance deficits, also without raising interest rates. However, the practicality of the Barro-Ricardo view is questioned due to its specific assumptions. The impact of budget deficits on interest rates remains a key concern for economists and policymakers. The ultimate question regarding deficits is where the resources come from to finance them and the impact on the nation's welfare. Budget deficits may not affect interest rates but still impose a burden on the economy. The capital mobility view and Barro-Ricardo view explain how deficits can have no effect on interest rates but still have negative consequences. The conventional view suggests deficits can stimulate aggregate spending in the short run, making rising interest rates a positive sign for policymakers. Policymakers must consider various factors when determining the impact of budget deficits on interest rates. Simply comparing deficits to interest rates is not sufficient, as other variables like the economy, saving behavior, and investment opportunities also play a role. Statistical methods are necessary to accurately assess the relationship between deficits and interest rates, as failing to account for these factors can lead to misestimations. A model that explains how deficits and other variables influence interest rates is essential for a comprehensive analysis. Factors affecting interest rates are analyzed through theoretical models, with mixed empirical evidence on the deficit-interest rate relationship. Recent studies show a stronger, positive relationship between deficits and interest rates, with forecasting models predicting an increase in interest rates with a budget deficit. According to Gale and Orszag (2002), models predict that a 1% GDP budget deficit would increase interest rates by 0.1 to 1.0 percentage points after one year and 0.05 to 2.0 percentage points after 10 years."
