    "content": "WTO disputes are governed by the WTO Understanding on the Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), which was established on January 1, 1995. The DSU expands upon dispute settlement practices from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and is administered by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) represents the United States in WTO disputes. The United States is represented in WTO disputes by the USTR. WTO dispute settlement involves consultations, panel and Appellate Body proceedings, and implementation. The DSB makes decisions on panels, reports, countermeasures, and monitors implementation. These decisions are made unless all DSB Members object, following the DSU. After a WTO decision, the defending Member must comply by a set deadline, with sanctions for non-compliance authorized by the DSB. Compliance plans must be submitted, with a \"reasonable period of time\" allowed for impracticable immediate compliance. If a proposed compliance period is not approved, disputing parties may negotiate a deadline or have the period arbitrated. Withdrawal of the offending measure by the end of the compliance period is expected, with compensation and temporary retaliation options available to the prevailing party. Article 22 of the DSU allows the prevailing Member in a dispute to request compensation or suspend WTO concessions if the defending Member fails to implement rulings. The prevailing party may choose to extend the compliance deadline before seeking a remedy. If concessions are suspended, higher tariffs may be imposed on imports from the defending country. If a prevailing Member chooses to suspend concessions due to a WTO violation, it should do so in the same sector. If not feasible, they can suspend concessions in other sectors of the same agreement. If this is also not possible, they may seek to suspend obligations under another WTO agreement, known as \"cross-retaliation.\" This can be pursued if the prevailing Member does not import enough goods from the defending Member to address the trade injury or if imposing tariff surcharges on goods from the defending Member would be too costly. The DSB authorizes retaliation requests under the DSU. Under the DSU, the DSB authorizes retaliation requests within 30 days after the compliance period expires. If the defending Member objects, the proposed retaliation will be arbitrated, extending the deadline. The arbitration, completed within 60 days, may be carried out by the original panel or an arbitrator appointed by the WTO Director General. The DSB then meets to authorize the retaliation request, subject to any modification by the arbitrator. Article 21.5 of the DSU allows for further dispute settlement proceedings if the parties disagree. Compliance panels under the DSU may take longer than the expected 90 days to issue a report, as seen in the example of the EU's challenge to the US in DS294. The lack of incorporation of Article 21.5 proceedings into the time frame for countermeasures approval has led to a procedural issue known as \"sequencing.\" The DSU allows for temporary suspension of concessions until WTO-inconsistent measures are removed, a solution is provided, or a mutually satisfactory resolution is reached. Compliance at the WTO may involve bilateral procedural agreements and various dispute management strategies without imposing sanctions. The Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) addresses the legal effect of WTO dispute settlement results in the United States, prohibiting private remedies based on alleged violations of WTO agreements. It requires the USTR to keep Congress informed of disputes challenging U.S. laws and places requirements on regulatory action taken to implement WTO decisions. The URAA establishes that domestic law supersedes any inconsistent provisions of the Uruguay Round agreements, requiring congressional or administrative action to implement adverse decisions in WTO dispute settlement proceedings. It states that no provision of the Uruguay Round Agreements inconsistent with US law shall have effect, and nothing in the statute shall amend or modify US law unless specifically provided for in the act. The URAA establishes that domestic law supersedes any inconsistent provisions of the Uruguay Round agreements, requiring congressional or administrative action to implement adverse decisions in WTO dispute settlement proceedings. It clarifies that U.S. law will take precedence in case of conflicts with the Uruguay Round agreements and any necessary changes to U.S. law to implement the WTO agreements are incorporated in the URAA. Congress traditionally addresses conflicts with prior GATT agreements and free trade agreements by enacting subsequent legislation. The URAA establishes that domestic law supersedes any inconsistent provisions of international agreements. Implementation of WTO dispute settlement results requires congressional approval unless consistent with existing statutes. Federal-state cooperation is mandated in WTO disputes involving state law, with limited domestic legal challenges allowed. Private remedies are generally precluded, centralizing the response to adverse WTO decisions at the federal level. Section 102(b) of the URAA clarifies that State laws cannot be invalidated solely based on inconsistency with Uruguay Round Agreements, except in actions brought by the United States. This provision ensures that State laws are not automatically preempted by international agreements, even if found inconsistent by WTO panels. The statute also imposes restrictions on legal actions brought by the United States regarding WTO dispute settlement outcomes. Private remedies are prohibited under Section 102(c)(1) of the URAA, 19 U.S.C. Section 3512(c)(1), stating that only the United States can bring a suit regarding Uruguay Round Agreements. Congress intends to occupy the field with respect to any cause of action. The URAA prohibits private remedies, allowing only the United States to bring suits regarding Uruguay Round Agreements. This includes precluding any person other than the United States from taking action against a State or political subdivision based on a judgment obtained by the United States. The rationale behind this prohibition is that it is the responsibility of the Federal Government, not private parties, to address such matters. The URAA places responsibility on the Federal Government to ensure consistency with international agreements like the Uruguay Round agreements. Agencies can consider compliance with these agreements, but any changes must be authorized by domestic law. Additionally, the URAA imposes requirements on agencies in implementing WTO panel and Appellate Body reports, particularly in trade remedy proceedings. Section 123(g) of the URAA requires consultation with congressional committees before any modification to regulations found inconsistent with WTO agreements can be implemented. This excludes regulations of the U.S. International Trade Commission. The USTR must publish proposals in the Federal Register for public comment before finalizing any changes. The House Ways and Means Committee, Senate Finance Committee, and other relevant congressional committees must be consulted before implementing any modifications to regulations inconsistent with WTO agreements. The final rule or modification cannot take effect until 60 days after USTR committee consultations begin, unless the President deems an earlier effective date necessary. The committees can vote to show disagreement within the 60-day period, but the vote is not binding. Section 129 of the URAA outlines procedures for the Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission to issue new determinations in response to adverse WTO decisions. Section 129 of the URAA allows the USTR to direct the Commerce Department and the ITC to issue new determinations in response to adverse WTO decisions regarding U.S. safeguards, antidumping, and countervailing duty proceedings. The Commerce Department determines dumping or subsidization levels, while the ITC assesses if imports cause material injury to domestic industries. The ITC also investigates increased imports under U.S. safeguards law to determine their impact on domestic industries. The ITC determines if increased imports cause serious injury to domestic industries and recommends remedial measures to the President. Section 129 Determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases are reviewable in U.S. Court of International Trade and by binational panels under NAFTA. WTO panel reports can challenge ITC actions inconsistent with U.S. obligations. The USTR may request an advisory report from the ITC on whether U.S. antidumping, countervailing duty, or safeguards law allows the ITC to take actions that align with WTO findings. The ITC must report to the USTR within specific timeframes to aid in decision-making on appealing panel reports or implementing adverse findings. The USTR may consult with congressional committees and request the ITC to issue a new determination within 120 days to align with WTO findings. If a new negative determination is issued, imports subject to antidumping or countervailing duty orders may no longer be considered harmful. The Tariff Act requires affirmative injury determination for imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties on dumped or subsidized imports. Section 129(a)(6) authorizes USTR to direct Commerce Department to revoke duty orders without injury determination. President can modify safeguard measures based on new ITC determination, consulting with relevant congressional committees. The USTR must consult with relevant congressional committees before acting under the authority granted by the Tariff Act. The USTR is required to publish notices of ITC determinations in the Federal Register. Section 129 outlines procedures for new Department of Commerce determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings, including consultation with congressional committees in case of WTO inconsistencies. The Commerce Department must issue a Section 129 Determination within 180 days of the request, which may result in a reduction of existing duties. USTR can direct DOC to implement the determination after consulting with congressional committees. Section 129(c)(1) of the URAA states that determinations apply prospectively to unliquidated entries of the subject merchandise. The USTR directs the Commerce Department to revoke or implement determinations for unliquidated entries of subject merchandise. Notices must be published in the Federal Register. Section 129(c)(1) states that determinations apply prospectively to unliquidated entries. The USTR directs the Commerce Department to revoke or implement determinations for unliquidated entries of subject merchandise. Relief under subsection 129(c)(1) is distinct from retroactive relief available in court or NAFTA panels. Canada challenged Section 129(c)(1) in a WTO dispute in 2001. The U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty system requires importers to deposit estimated duties with CBP on entry. Canada argued that Section 129(c)(1) prevents the U.S. from refunding duties if a WTO violation is found. Canada argued that duties must be returned on a WTO-consistent basis, while the United States maintained that Section 129(c)(1) only applies to imports entered after the implementation date. The US argued that there are other legal options for dealing with prior unliquidated entries, such as establishing new margins or revising duty rates. The WTO panel in July 2002 concluded that Canada did not prove the statute required WTO-inconsistent actions. The panel concluded that Canada failed to prove the statute required WTO-inconsistent actions by the United States. Private rights of action based on Uruguay Round agreements are precluded under Section 102(c) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. WTO panel findings have been brought to federal courts in challenges to agency determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings. Section 129 determinations issued by the ITC and Commerce Department to comply with WTO decisions are reviewable in the U.S. Court of International Trade. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) has exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions under Section 516A, with appeals going to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and then the U.S. Supreme Court. Federal courts must deem agency determinations in antidumping or countervailing duty proceedings unlawful if unsupported by substantial evidence or not in accordance with law. The court uses a two-step Chevron analysis to determine the legality of agency interpretations. The U.S. Court of International Trade has jurisdiction over civil actions under Section 516A, with appeals to the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court. Federal courts must assess agency determinations in antidumping or countervailing duty cases for legality using a two-step Chevron analysis. The court considers whether Congress has addressed the issue and if not, defers to the agency's reasonable interpretation, which may align with U.S. international obligations under WTO agreements. Plaintiffs argue that agency interpretations violating WTO obligations are unreasonable under Chevron step two. Courts may consider WTO decisions as persuasive but not binding, informing their decisions in domestic legal challenges. Recent court rulings clarify that the URAA establishes a statutory scheme for regulatory compliance with adverse WTO decisions. The executive branch decides on compliance with adverse WTO decisions, courts do not base rulings on WTO decisions if domestic action is not taken. There are 14 pending WTO cases involving the United States. The United States is facing 14 pending WTO cases, with nine involving U.S. trade remedies and the rest related to subsidies, trade in services, or trade-related intellectual property rights. Six of the trade remedy cases focus on the U.S. practice of \"zeroing\" in antidumping proceedings, while the remaining cases include disputes with Japan over antidumping laws and the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act. The United States is facing multiple WTO cases, including disputes with Japan over antidumping laws and the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act. The U.S. has taken administrative action to resolve antidumping disputes with Japan and China, with ongoing tariff retaliation from the European Union and Japan. The U.S. and China have a deadline for their countervailing duty dispute. The United States is facing a countervailing duty dispute with Brazil over U.S. cotton subsidies. Brazil has the possibility of retaliating against U.S. goods, services, or intellectual property. Congress repealed some export credit guarantee programs deemed as prohibited subsidies by the WTO, but reauthorized payments under domestic support programs challenged by Brazil. Brazil can impose sanctions to address both prohibited and actionable subsidies. Brazil has the authority to impose sanctions to address prohibited and actionable subsidy measures. The United States and Brazil have temporarily resolved their dispute, preventing Brazil from applying sanctions. Antigua's challenge to U.S. laws on remote gambling services led to the U.S. withdrawing market access commitments under GATS. Antigua seeks retaliation in the WTO dispute and compensation for the effects of the U.S. withdrawal. Two disputes over intellectual property rights with the EU remain unresolved. The United States has unresolved disputes with the European Union regarding music licensing and trademarks involving property confiscated by Cuba. A partial payment of $3 million has been made for the music licensing case, but full compliance has not been achieved. Bills introduced in Congress to resolve the trademark dispute have not been enacted. Additionally, there have been twenty-one WTO complaints against the United States challenging the use of \"zeroing\" in antidumping proceedings. The United States has faced twenty-one WTO complaints challenging the use of \"zeroing\" in antidumping proceedings. Six cases are currently in the compliance phase, with challenges brought by the European Union, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, and Vietnam. The Commerce Department discontinued zeroing in response to the first EU challenge, leading to a broad WTO prohibition on its use in U.S. antidumping proceedings. The United States is facing challenges from the EU, Japan, and Mexico regarding antidumping investigations and recalculated dumping margins. The US has not fully complied with WTO decisions, leading to requests for trade sanctions. In 2010, the EU and Japan agreed to suspend arbitrations in hopes that the US would address outstanding issues by September 2011. The Department of Commerce proposed a new rule to calculate dumping margins without zeroing in various reviews. Sanctions arbitrations with the EU and Japan were extended to February 6, 2012. Suspensions will continue while the US finalizes the zeroing proposal and issues determinations using the new methodology in challenged proceedings. The Department of Commerce is expected to issue new determinations within four months of February 6, 2012, with the USTR directing implementation within seven days. Sanctions arbitrations will be terminated once the Section 129 proceedings are completed, affecting cash deposit rates for future entries. Mexico requested a compliance panel in DS344 regarding U.S. compliance with a WTO decision on antidumping. The United States has failed to comply with WTO decisions on antidumping reviews, with deadlines set in disputes with Brazil and Vietnam. New complaints involving zeroing were filed by Korea, China, the EU, and Vietnam. A panel was established in Korea's challenge, aiming to expedite proceedings and exclude consideration of U.S. compliance efforts in other zeroing cases. The panel was established in China's challenge in October 2011 after the U.S. and China entered into a procedural agreement to expedite the process. The EU and Vietnam also have complaints in consultations regarding antidumping issues. The U.S. has faced multiple WTO complaints regarding the use of zeroing in antidumping investigations. Over 25 WTO panel and Appellate Body reports have been issued on this issue, despite the lack of explicit mention in relevant agreements. WTO panels and the Appellate Body have found that the use of zeroing in antidumping investigations violates WTO obligations. This includes inconsistencies with Article 2.4.2 of the WTO Antidumping Agreement and prohibitions on imposing antidumping duties that exceed the dumping margin. Additionally, reliance on zeroing-based dumping margins in sunset reviews has been deemed a violation of the WTO Antidumping Agreement. In sunset reviews, the use of zeroing in antidumping investigations has been found to be broadly prohibited by WTO panels. This prohibition extends to the calculation of dumping margins in U.S. antidumping proceedings, including in compliance panel proceedings. The findings emphasize that zeroing-based duties should not be applied to goods that entered the U.S. before the end of the compliance period established in a WTO dispute. The Appellate Body has ruled against the use of zeroing in antidumping investigations, including in compliance panel proceedings. The United States has responded by eliminating zeroing in original investigations and subsequent phases of antidumping proceedings. Zeroing-based duties should not be applied to goods after the compliance period ends. The United States has resolved the dumping margin case without zeroing, but concerns remain about satisfying all WTO complainants. The EU has dropped demands for zeroing-based duty refunds after signing a memorandum with the US in 2012. New WTO-compliant dumping margins will only apply to future merchandise entries. The United States has been critical of the Appellate Body's broad prohibition on zeroing at WTO meetings and submitted proposals to revise antidumping rules in the Doha Round. The US proposed clear text allowing margins of dumping to be determined without offsets for non-dumped transactions. The negotiating text issued by the Chairman of the Doha Negotiating Group in November 2007 reflected U.S. concerns, but the draft text in December 2008 did not address zeroing. The United States continues to push for affirmation that 'zeroing' is consistent with WTO rules in ongoing negotiations. The Tariff Act of 1930 defines terms related to dumping margins. The Tariff Act of 1930 defines terms related to dumping margins, but does not address the practice of zeroing. U.S. courts have held that the statute does not require zeroing, but the Commerce Department's interpretation allowing it is permissible. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled in 2009 to eliminate zeroing in antidumping investigations. The court found that the action taken by the Commerce Department to adjust sales at less than fair value in response to a WTO decision was reasonable under U.S. antidumping law and in accordance with Chevron. The court emphasized the importance of harmonizing U.S. practices with international obligations in its analysis. The court upheld the Commerce Department's action on trade matters, stating it was in accordance with law and not unlawful. The U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the department's interpretation of an ambiguous statute in a Section 129 Determination. However, in a separate case, the court ruled that the department's use of zeroing in administrative reviews was arbitrary, vacating and remanding the judgment for further explanation. The court found that the government's decision to implement an adverse WTO decision alone does not justify inconsistent statutory interpretations. The court vacated a decision and remanded for further proceedings to allow the Commerce Department to explain its reasoning regarding the interpretation of 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677(35). Commerce's use of zeroing in administrative reviews was challenged in the case JTEKT Corp. v. United States. The court questioned the rationale behind zeroing in administrative reviews but not in investigations, leading to a remand for further explanation from the Commerce Department. The U.S. Court of International Trade remanded a case to the Commerce Department on December 15, 2011, ordering a redetermination regarding the use of zeroing in administrative reviews. The court required an explanation on how 19 U.S.C. \u00a71677(35) may be interpreted differently in investigations versus reviews, and to adjust the dumping margin if necessary. The court emphasized the need for a clear basis in the statute for any changes. In Union Steel v. United States, the court upheld the use of zeroing in administrative reviews based on three reasons: it has been the department's preferred method, compliance with WTO decisions, and inherent differences in investigations and reviews. The court upheld the use of zeroing in administrative reviews to establish antidumping duty orders, citing reasons such as accuracy and reflecting commercial reality. Commerce was found to have acted reasonably in changing its investigation methodology to better achieve the purposes of reviews. In November 1999, Japan challenged determinations made by the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in an antidumping investigation of hot-rolled steel products from Japan. The issue in the WTO case was how DOC calculated dumping margins and elements of the affirmative material injury determination made by the ITC. The Department of Commerce (DOC) calculates dumping margins for individual exporters and an \"all others\" rate for firms not individually investigated, based on rates determined for producers, excluding zero or de minimis margins and those determined under \"facts available.\" \"Facts available\" is used when necessary information is not provided or verified properly. The United States uses an \"arm's length\" pricing test to determine if sales are \"in the ordinary course of trade\" for calculating normal value in antidumping cases. This test was argued to unfairly exclude certain low-priced sales, leading to inflated dumping margins. In 2001, the WTO panel found the United States in violation of the WTO Antidumping Agreement due to improper application of \"facts available\" in calculating dumping margins and determining normal value of goods under investigation. The Appellate Body upheld this decision, focusing on the combined operation of the \"arm's length\" test and another test used by the Commerce Department. The Appellate Body found a lack of even-handedness in the application of the \"arm's length\" and \"aberrationally high\" tests in determining normal value of goods. It also ruled against the United States regarding the calculation of normal value and ITC's injury determination. The Appellate Body ruled against the United States on the ITC's injury determination, citing inconsistencies in applying the antidumping statute and a lack of causal link between dumped imports and domestic industry injury. The compliance period for the case expired in November 2002. The compliance period for the case expired in November 2002, but was extended until December 31, 2003. The Commerce Department modified its \"arm's length\" test for normal value finding, establishing a price band for sales to affiliates. This new methodology was to be used in implementing WTO findings on Japan hot-rolled steel AD proceeding. A new dumping determination was announced in December 2002 for the AD proceeding. In December 2002, the Commerce Department recalculated dumping margins for Japanese producers in the AD proceeding following WTO rulings. The recalculations led to reduced dumping margins for three companies and all other exporters. The ITC findings were also criticized, but no action was taken in response to the WTO decision. The WTO panel found Section 735(c)(5)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930 inconsistent with the WTO Antidumping Agreement. Article 9.4 required exclusion of dumping margins based on facts, with the deadline extended to July 31, 2005. Japan agreed not to retaliate immediately but reserved the right to do so in the future. H.R. 2473 aimed to remove obstacles for the Department of Commerce to comply with the WTO decision. The United States continues to support legislative amendments for full compliance with the WTO decision on dumping margins. Japan seeks legislative action, but proposed revisions to the Antidumping Agreement have not included clarifications to Article 9.4. The Byrd Amendment, or CDSOA of 2000, required duties collected under an unspecified rate to be distributed to affected parties. The Byrd Amendment, also known as the CDSOA of 2000, mandated the distribution of duties collected under antidumping or countervailing duty orders to petitioners and interested parties. Payments were available for qualifying expenditures incurred by affected domestic producers. Despite being repealed in 2005, the program remains a target of authorized sanctions by the European Union and Japan. The CDSOA program, also known as the Byrd Amendment, distributed duties collected under antidumping or countervailing duty orders to U.S. firms. Eleven WTO members challenged the program for violating WTO agreements. Two complaints were filed, and the WTO panel found that the CDSOA created impermissible actions against dumping and subsidization. The CDSOA, also known as the Byrd Amendment, was found to create impermissible actions against dumping and subsidization by providing financial incentives for domestic producers to support antidumping and countervailing duty petitions. The WTO panel upheld the finding but reversed on industry support requirements. The compliance deadline was set for December 27, 2003, but the US did not comply, leading to complaints from eight WTO members. In December 2003, eight WTO Members requested authorization to impose retaliatory measures due to the US not complying with the CDSOA deadline. The Arbitrator determined that these Members could impose countermeasures equal to 72% of CDSOA disbursements related to antidumping and countervailing duties. The eight complainants were authorized to impose retaliatory measures in late 2004 due to the US not complying with the CDSOA deadline. The EU, Canada, Mexico, and Japan imposed higher tariffs and surcharges on US products starting in May 2005. The US Court of International Trade ruled in April 2006 that the CDSOA did not apply to imports from Canada or Mexico. U.S. Customs and Border Protection withheld distributions on imports from these countries pending any appeal. Canada allowed its retaliatory tariffs to terminate as of April 30, 2006, while Mexico imposed increased tariffs on U.S. dairy products from September 18 through October 31, 2006. The CDSOA was repealed as of October 1, 2005, with duties available for disbursement until all relevant customs entries before September 1, 2007, are liquidated. The United States informed the WTO Dispute Settlement Body of these actions in 2006. The United States informed the WTO that it had implemented rulings but concerns were raised about duties distribution through 2007. No formal challenge to the 2006 statute's compatibility with WTO obligations has been made. A 2010 enactment restricted funds for CDSOA payments. The CDSOA allows distribution of funds for goods not liquidated or in litigation. EU and Japan impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, but the amounts are decreasing. EU removed 30 products from retaliation list and Japan reduced tariffs on certain goods. Approximately $25.1 million was available for FY2011 disbursements. In June 2003, the EU requested consultations with the US over the use of zeroing by the Commerce Department in determining dumping margins, citing inconsistencies with WTO agreements. The EU alleged that the US had acted inconsistently in 31 cases, including original investigations and administrative reviews. The EU challenged the US over the use of zeroing in determining dumping margins in 15 original investigations and 16 administrative reviews. A WTO panel found zeroing to be inconsistent with the Antidumping Agreement in October 2005. The article discusses the calculation of margins of dumping during investigations, emphasizing the need for fair comparison. The Appellate Body ruled that margins of dumping must consider all comparisons, including weighted average export prices above normal value. The term \"dumping\" in WTO agreements is defined in relation to the product as a whole. The Appellate Body ruled that dumping margins must consider all comparisons for the product as a whole, rejecting the EU's claims regarding zeroing in investigations. The panel rejected the EU's claims on the use of zeroing in various types of reviews, with one dissenting panelist disagreeing on its use in proceedings other than original investigations. The panel did not address EU claims regarding a new injury determination based on excluded imports, viewing it as a dependent claim. The panel report was appealed by both the United States and the EU, with the United States appealing the panel's finding that zeroing was challengeable but not appealing its conclusion on the use of zeroing in price comparisons. The Appellate Body found that the use of zeroing in weighted-average-to-weighted-average price comparisons violated the Antidumping Agreement. They upheld the panel's finding that zeroing is inconsistent with Article 2.4.2 of the Antidumping Agreement and expanded the prohibition of zeroing to include weighted-average-to-transaction comparisons in administrative reviews. This practice was deemed to violate Article 9.3 of the Antidumping Agreement and Article VI:2 of the GATT 1994. The Appellate Body found that zeroing in price comparisons violated the Antidumping Agreement, expanding the prohibition to include weighted-average-to-transaction comparisons. The use of zeroing in reviews exceeded dumping margins, leading to the imposition of antidumping duties. The Appellate Body did not determine if zeroing was inconsistent with WTO obligations due to insufficient facts. The AB report and modified panel report were adopted on May 9, 2006, despite the United States disputing the decision. The United States disputed the Appellate Body decision on zeroing in price comparisons but stated its intention to comply. The Department of Commerce announced it would abandon zeroing in antidumping investigations and seek alternative approaches. The US did not appeal the panel's finding on zeroing. On December 26, 2006, the department published a notice modifying its antidumping procedures. The Department of Commerce modified its antidumping practice in response to a WTO panel ruling, extending the effective date multiple times for review. It initiated Section 129 proceedings to implement the WTO ruling on 12 of the 15 original antidumping investigations challenged by the EU. The Department of Commerce modified its antidumping practice in response to a WTO panel ruling, initiating Section 129 proceedings on 12 of the 15 original antidumping investigations challenged by the EU. On April 9, 2007, new determinations were issued in 11 proceedings, with recalculations done without zeroing. The United States stated that new administrative reviews superseded the ones in dispute, and no further action was needed to comply with the WTO decision. The USTR instructed DOC to implement new determinations on April 23, 2007, in response to a WTO ruling. The EU questioned the prospective nature of the determinations and claimed the US had not brought 16 challenged administrative reviews into compliance. On May 4, 2007, the US and EU entered into a procedural agreement regarding possible compliance panel proceedings. The EU requested consultations with the United States under Article 21.5 in July 2007 regarding compliance panel proceedings. In September 2007, the EU requested a compliance panel, claiming the US had failed to take compliance actions and measures were inconsistent with WTO obligations. The EU cited specific reviews challenged in the original proceeding. The EU challenged 16 administrative reviews in the compliance panel, alleging that the US violated WTO rules by recalculating dumping margins without zeroing, not finding exporters guilty of dumping, and maintaining antidumping orders without assessing harm to domestic industry. The compliance process was complex due to the retrospective US duty system conflicting with the prospective nature of WTO remedies. Compliance had to be achieved by the end of a reasonable period. The compliance process between the US and EU was complex due to conflicting retrospective US duty system and prospective WTO remedies. Disagreements arose regarding goods entered before the compliance period ended and dumping determinations made after the original WTO dispute. The US argued that WTO dispute measures were not taken to comply and were outside the panel's terms of reference. They believed the compliance panel could only review if the original determination complied with the WTO decision, not if zeroing was used in subsequent reviews. The United States argued that it was not required to ensure compliance with challenged determinations in subsequent reviews, as they had been superseded. The EU contended that this approach allowed the US to avoid permanent compliance with WTO decisions by initiating new dispute settlement proceedings for each disagreement in subsequent reviews. The United States faced challenges from the EU regarding compliance with WTO rulings. The Appellate Body found the US to be out of compliance in various aspects. Actions taken before the adoption of panel and Appellate Body reports were deemed reviewable as potential compliance measures. The Appellate Body found that certain sunset reviews were inconsistent with WTO obligations due to the use of zeroing in calculating dumping margins. It was also determined that subsequent administrative and sunset reviews could potentially be reviewed in compliance proceedings. The panel concluded that the use of zeroing in subsequent reviews could potentially undermine compliance with WTO recommendations and rulings, particularly in Section 129 determinations. This could negate actions taken to comply with WTO decisions, affecting imports entering the US before the end of the compliance period. The Appellate Body agreed that zeroing cannot be used in calculating dumping margins for imports entering the US before the compliance period. Duties based on zeroing cannot be collected after the compliance period without violating WTO obligations. The Appellate Body found that measures based on zeroing for antidumping duties collected after the compliance deadline are not WTO-compliant. Compliance with WTO decisions is not limited by the duration of original measures, especially when subsequent measures replace them. The panel and AB found inconsistencies in determinations challenged by the EU regarding the obligation to eliminate zeroing. The United States violated the Antidumping Agreement by not revisiting ITC material injury determinations for certain cases, leading to findings of no dumping or de minimis margins for some exporters. The US was obligated to reconsider material injury using import volumes that excluded non-dumped and de minimis imports. The EU requested authorization from the WTO to suspend WTO tariff concessions owed by the United States for non-compliance in a case involving recalculating dumping margins without zeroing and collecting duties at the new rates. The EU requested WTO authorization to suspend US tariff concessions for non-compliance in a dumping margins case. The US objected, leading to arbitration which was suspended with the understanding that the US would comply with its obligations. The Arbitrator's report would be circulated on September 15, 2011 if not received by September 7, 2011. The US and EU requested further suspensions, now extended to June 28, 2012, and July 12, 2012, under a bilateral agreement. The Commerce Department issued a proposed rule on December 28, 2010, to eliminate zeroing in reviews, using average-to-average comparisons and providing offsets for non-dumped sales. The Commerce Department proposed to eliminate zeroing in reviews by using average-to-average comparisons and providing offsets for non-dumped sales, aligning with WTO-consistent methodology. Antidumping duties will not be assessed if the weighted average margin is zero or de minimis. The Commerce Department is proposing to withdraw the practice of calculating the weighted average margin of dumping in response to Japan's challenge in DS322. They are addressing the WTO-inconsistency of U.S. practice in five-year sunset reviews by modifying the methodology for calculating weighted average dumping margins. Section 752(c) of the Tariff Act does not require the Department to rely on weighted average dumping margins. The Commerce Department is proposing to withdraw the practice of calculating the weighted average margin of dumping in response to Japan's challenge in DS322. The comment period on the proposal closed on February 18, 2011. The EU and Japan responded positively to the U.S. proposal to eliminate the use of zeroing in reviews, but they want the U.S. to cease collecting zeroing-based duties to be in full compliance with WTO obligations. On February 6, 2012, the United States and the EU signed a Memorandum outlining steps to resolve DS294 and DS350 disputes. The plan required the US to complete internal procedures by February 13, 2012, begin Section 129 proceedings by February 18, 2012, and issue final dumping determinations by June 6, 2012. The Section 129 proceedings must be completed within seven days after the Department of Commerce issues final dumping determinations. If deadlines are met, the EU and the United States will continue to suspend arbitration in DS294. Additionally, the EU is required to withdraw its retaliation request within 15 days after the US completes the Section 129 proceedings. The EU must inform the arbitrator by June 28, 2012, to terminate the arbitration, or it will automatically end. The U.S.-EU Memorandum led to the approval of the Commerce Department Final Rule on February 7, 2012, which eliminates zeroing in calculating dumping margins. The Commerce Department's Final Rule, effective April 16, 2012, eliminates zeroing in calculating dumping margins and antidumping duty rates in various reviews. The Memorandum is prospective, addressing revisions in antidumping determinations and refunds of antidumping duties. The department will decide on a case-by-case basis whether to use a price comparison methodology in reviews. Sunset reviews will no longer rely on certain practices. The Commerce Department's Final Rule, effective April 16, 2012, eliminates zeroing in calculating dumping margins and antidumping duty rates in various reviews. The department stated it would no longer rely on weighted-average dumping margins calculated using a methodology found inconsistent by the Appellate Body in cases brought by the EU and Japan. Only in extraordinary circumstances will the department use margins other than those calculated and published in prior determinations. Japan challenged the use of zeroing in various antidumping proceedings, claiming it violated WTO Antidumping Agreement obligations. Japan challenged the use of zeroing in multiple antidumping proceedings involving steel products and bearings. The WTO panel found zeroing in original investigations to be inconsistent with the Antidumping Agreement. The WTO panel found zeroing in original investigations to be inconsistent with the Antidumping Agreement, but rejected Japan's claims regarding zeroing in other types of comparisons and reviews. Both Japan and the United States appealed the decision. In a ruling on January 9, 2007, the WTO Appellate Body upheld the panel's findings that zeroing could be challenged and determined that U.S. measures violated WTO antidumping obligations by maintaining zeroing procedures in transaction-to-transaction comparisons. This was in violation of Articles 2.4 and 2.4.2 of the Antidumping Agreement, which require a fair comparison between export price and normal value. The WTO Appellate Body found that the United States violated WTO antidumping obligations by using zeroing procedures in administrative and new shipper reviews, which was inconsistent with various articles of the Antidumping Agreement and GATT 1994. The WTO Appellate Body upheld Japan's claims against the United States for using zeroing in administrative reviews, citing violations of the Antidumping Agreement and GATT 1994. Additionally, the United States was found to have acted inconsistently with Article 11.3 of the Antidumping Agreement in two sunset reviews. The Appellate Body found that the United States violated Article 11.3 of the Antidumping Agreement by relying on zeroing-based margins in sunset reviews. The DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the panel report, with the United States stating its intention to comply. The Appellate Body informed the DSB in February 2007 of its intention to comply with WTO obligations and requested a reasonable period of time. Japan initially sought arbitration for the compliance period but later agreed to end it on December 24, 2007. The United States mentioned changes made by the Commerce Department in December 2007 regarding zeroing in investigations. Additionally, the Department of Commerce initiated a proceeding in November 2007 under Section 129 of the Uruguay Round Agreements related to the case. In November 2007, the United States initiated a proceeding under Section 129 of Uruguay Round Agreements regarding a steel plate products investigation. Japan requested authorization to retaliate in January 2008, but the dispute was sent to arbitration. In March 2008, a procedural agreement allowed Japan to request a compliance panel without prior consultations. The United States claimed compliance in a dispute with Japan over U.S. actions challenged in an original investigation. Japan requested a compliance panel in April 2008, stating the U.S. was in violation. The United States requested a compliance panel on April 7, 2008, alleging violations of WTO obligations related to zeroing in various reviews and sunset reviews. The compliance panel was established on April 18, 2008, and the United States and Japan asked for arbitration panel work suspension on June 6, 2008. The compliance panel found that the United States had not complied with its WTO antidumping obligations in various reviews, including maintaining zeroing in transaction-to-transaction comparisons. The panel found that the United States had violated WTO obligations by issuing WTO-inconsistent liquidation instructions in administrative reviews involving ball bearings. The panel also addressed a situation where duties are assessed before the compliance period ends, but liquidation instructions are delayed due to litigation, stating that the delay does not excuse non-compliance with WTO obligations. The panel ruled that the United States violated WTO obligations by issuing WTO-inconsistent liquidation instructions in administrative reviews involving ball bearings. Additionally, the panel addressed the issue of delayed liquidations due to pending litigation, stating that such delays do not excuse non-compliance with WTO obligations. In a 2009 appeal, the Appellate Body upheld a compliance panel's decision against the United States regarding zeroing-based dumping margins. The panel emphasized that antidumping duties collected after the compliance period must be calculated without zeroing, rejecting U.S. claims on judicial delay of liquidation and GATT Article II violations. The United States' compliance obligations in the WTO zeroing disputes were discussed in domestic judicial proceedings. The Appellate Body and compliance panel reports were adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body in 2009. The United States stated its intent to comply with the recommendations and rulings, emphasizing the need for compliance with individual administrative reviews in retrospective antidumping systems. The United States raised procedural issues regarding the scope of dispute settlement proceedings in the WTO zeroing disputes. It disagreed with the Appellate Body's findings on the application of obligations to border measures and duty liquidations. Japan requested arbitration of sanctions proposed by the United States in 2008, which was suspended in 2008 due to Japan's compliance panel request. In 2010, the US and Japan asked the arbitrator to suspend work for informal discussions on implementing WTO decisions. The suspension could be terminated at any time, with work set to resume in 2011. The arbitrator's work on Japan's request for arbitration of US sanctions was suspended in 2008 and resumed in 2011. The Commerce Department proposed a rule to eliminate zeroing in trade reviews, and the US and Japan extended the deadline for resolving outstanding issues to January 31, 2012. The United States and Japan signed a Memorandum of Understanding in February 2012 to resolve a dispute regarding zeroing. The agreement included steps for the US to complete internal regulatory procedures, begin antidumping proceedings, and issue a final dumping determination by June 2012. The United States and Japan signed a Memorandum of Understanding in February 2012 to resolve a dispute regarding zeroing. The agreement included steps for the US to issue a final dumping determination by June 6, 2012, in the cited proceeding on Japanese steel. If there is a change in the cash deposit rate, the proceeding will be considered completed when the USTR directs the Commerce Department to implement the final determination. If not, it will be completed when the section 129 determination is issued. Japan and the United States will continue the suspension of the arbitration of Japan's retaliation request until the arbitrator notifies the WTO that it is not necessary to render an award. The United States and Japan signed a Memorandum of Understanding in February 2012 to resolve a dispute regarding zeroing. The agreement included steps for the US to issue a final dumping determination by June 6, 2012, in the cited proceeding on Japanese steel. Japan is to withdraw its retaliation request by a specified date, and the arbitrator will resume work if Japan does not terminate the arbitration by August 20, 2012. The Commerce Department Final Rule and Final Modification for Reviews (FMR) reflecting the department's proposal was approved on February 7, 2012. The Final Rule was approved on February 7, 2012, and published in the Federal Register on February 14, 2012. Mexico challenged the use of model zeroing and simple zeroing by the United States in antidumping investigations. A panel report in 2007 found model zeroing inconsistent with the Antidumping Agreement but ruled in favor of the US regarding simple zeroing in administrative reviews. The Appellate Body reversed the panel's findings on the use of simple zeroing in administrative reviews, stating that it was inconsistent with GATT Article VI and the Antidumping Agreement. They criticized the panel for not adhering to earlier Appellate Body rulings on this issue. The Appellate Body criticized the panel for not following previous Appellate Body reports, which they believe undermines the development of coherent jurisprudence. The Appellate Body report and modified panel report were adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body on May 20, 2008, with the United States supporting the panel's conclusions on simple zeroing but questioning the Appellate Body's approach. The United States questioned the Appellate Body's approach to zeroing in transaction-specific calculations. The issue was arbitrated, leading to a deadline set for compliance. The Commerce Department recalculated the dumping margin without zeroing, implementing the decision effective April 23, 2009. The Commerce Department implemented a determination on April 23, 2009, resulting in a reduction of the dumping margin for one exporter. The United States informed the WTO about the elimination of prospective effects of challenged administrative reviews. Discussions with Mexico were held to comply with recommendations and rulings. On May 19, 2009, a sequencing agreement was reached between the United States and Mexico. Mexico requested consultations with the United States regarding U.S. compliance with a WTO decision, citing issues with the use of simple zeroing in administrative reviews and the imposition of anti-dumping duties above the proper margin. Mexico requested consultations with the United States regarding U.S. compliance with a WTO decision on the proper margin of dumping and the imposition of anti-dumping duties. The U.S.-Mexico procedural agreement allowed for consultations and the possibility of a compliance panel. Mexico requested a compliance panel in September 2010, with a final report expected by March 2012. The European Union had previously challenged the U.S. use of zeroing in a similar case. The EU challenged the U.S. use of zeroing in 18 specific antidumping cases, citing concerns about antidumping duties exceeding correct margins. They also contested zeroing in administrative and sunset reviews, totaling 52 agency determinations. The EU argued that zeroing was a \"measure\" subject to WTO dispute settlement. The EU challenged the US use of zeroing in antidumping cases, arguing it was a measure subject to WTO dispute settlement. The WTO panel found the US acted inconsistently with its obligations by using zeroing in investigations and reviews, but not in cases involving antidumping duties. The WTO panel found that the US use of zeroing in antidumping cases was inconsistent with its obligations. The Appellate Body ruled that the continued use of zeroing in maintaining duties was challengeable in WTO dispute settlement. The Appellate Body found that the US application of zeroing in antidumping duties was inconsistent with WTO agreements, leading to challenges in dispute settlement. The United States expressed concerns with the Appellate Body's approach to zeroing in antidumping duties and agreed on a compliance period with the EU ending in December 2009. The USTR requested a Section 129 determination to address inconsistencies with WTO recommendations before the December 19, 2009 deadline. The United States disagreed with the WTO Dispute Settlement Body's rulings on zeroing in antidumping duties and expressed ongoing consultations to address the findings. The EU was disappointed with the US's lack of compliance after the reasonable implementation period expired. In January 2010, a procedural agreement was reached between the US and the EU to potentially achieve compliance. In January 2010, a procedural agreement was reached between the US and the EU regarding compliance issues. The Commerce Department issued a proposed rule in December 2010 to eliminate zeroing in various reviews. China requested consultations with the US in September 2008 on antidumping and countervailing duty investigations. In March 2011, China challenged U.S. antidumping and CVD laws at the WTO. The U.S. faced compliance issues due to a court ruling in December 2011. Legislation granting authority to impose CVDs on goods from NME countries was signed into law in March 2012. Litigation in the GPX case is ongoing. The U.S. uses a \"surrogate country\" methodology in antidumping investigations for products imported from non-market economy (NME) countries. The Department of Commerce determines the fair market value based on factors of production and other costs, using information from market economy countries. If information is inadequate, the price of comparable merchandise is used. The U.S. uses a \"surrogate country\" methodology in antidumping investigations for products imported from non-market economy (NME) countries. The Department of Commerce determines normal value based on comparable merchandise prices in market economy countries. The NME methodology may result in a higher fair market value due to subsidization, leading to higher dumping margins. The U.S. changed its policy in 2006 regarding countervailing duty (CVD) investigations involving products from non-market economy (NME) countries, such as China. Despite a negative final material injury determination in one case, the Department of Commerce issued CVD orders in subsequent investigations, totaling more than 20 orders on Chinese goods. The U.S. has more than 20 CVD orders on Chinese goods in effect as of October 2011, with the possibility of imposing both antidumping and countervailing duties on the same product. The use of NME surrogate country methodology in antidumping investigations can result in a double remedy, offsetting subsidization with both CVD and dumping margins. The Commerce Department is required to make an upward adjustment of the export price to account for any countervailing duty imposed. The U.S. imposes countervailing duties on Chinese goods to offset subsidies, but there is no requirement to adjust prices for domestic subsidies. This practice has raised concerns about double counting and potential violations of international trade agreements. The imposition of countervailing duties is governed by the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. A financial contribution, in the form of direct funds transfer or other benefits, by a government within a WTO Member's territory may be considered a subsidy. Subsidized imports must cause material injury to a domestic industry for countervailing duties to be imposed, as per GATT Article VI and the SCM Agreement. Subsidies prohibited under the SCM Agreement can only be remedied through a direct WTO challenge or a CVD. In countervailing duty (CVD) investigations, determining the specificity of a subsidy and quantifying the benefit of financial contributions are crucial issues. The SCM Agreement provides guidelines for calculating benefits from different types of governmental financial contributions, using market-based benchmarks. This is important when dealing with Chinese products and determining if a subsidy is specific to certain enterprises or industries within a designated geographic region. In CVD investigations, determining subsidy specificity and quantifying financial benefits are crucial. China's WTO Accession Protocol allows for market-based benchmarks, but if not available, foreign benchmarks are used. Issues arose in China's 2008 consultations regarding benefit determinations. China raised concerns about inconsistencies with GATT articles, the WTO SCM Agreement, the Antidumping Agreement, and China's WTO Accession Protocol in antidumping and CVD investigations involving Chinese goods. China disputed DOC's findings on subsidies and alleged errors in determining benefits received by state-owned enterprises and trading companies. China raised concerns about inconsistencies in the US Department of Commerce's (DOC) subsidy benefit calculations, including the exclusion of transactions with no benefit and errors in determining benefits for state-owned enterprises. China also disputed the classification of state-owned commercial banks as public bodies and the use of benchmarks outside of China in subsidy calculations. China raised concerns about the United States' improper rejection of prevailing terms and conditions in China for making determinations, including the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties in excess of subsidies found to exist, violating international agreements. China argued that the United States violated international agreements by imposing antidumping duties in excess of the amount of dumping found, failing to grant China MFN treatment, and making procedural errors in antidumping investigations. The WTO panel rejected most of China's claims regarding the Department of Commerce's authority to avoid double remedies on goods from China when using surrogate country values for cost determinations. China also considered this a violation of GATT Article I. The WTO panel determined that state-owned enterprises and state-owned commercial banks are considered \"public bodies\" if controlled by the government. It also rejected China's claims regarding trading companies being directed by the government. Additionally, the panel found inconsistencies in the United States' benefit determinations and specificity determinations. The WTO panel found that China failed to establish violations by the US Department of Commerce in benefit determinations. The panel also determined that the DOC acted inconsistently with the SCM Agreement in the OTR investigation. The WTO panel found that China's double remedy claims were rejected in the OTR investigation. China did not establish that double remedies were inconsistent with relevant agreements. The WTO panel found that the United States violated the SCM Agreement by using \"facts available\" in determining the amount of SOE-provided hot-rolled steel in CVD investigations. The WTO Appellate Body reversed the panel's interpretation of the term \"public body\" and the permissibility of \"double remedies\" in China's appeal. The WTO Appellate Body reversed the panel's interpretation of the term \"public body\" in the United States' CVD investigations, finding that certain SOEs and SOCBs did not qualify as public bodies. The AB also upheld panel findings on specificity and approved DOC's use of foreign benchmarks for subsidy benefit determination. The WTO Appellate Body reversed the panel's rejection of China's claim regarding the use of foreign benchmarks by DOC to calculate subsidy benefits from RMB-denominated SOCB loans. The AB found that the panel did not make an \"objective assessment\" as required under WTO rules. Additionally, the AB ruled that imposing both antidumping duties and countervailing duties for the same subsidization is inconsistent with SCM Agreement. The WTO Appellate Body found the United States in violation of the SCM Agreement for imposing duties without assessing \"double remedies\" in antidumping and CVD investigations. This action was deemed inconsistent with Article 19.3, Article 10, and Article 32.1 of the SCM Agreement. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body adopted the report and modified panel report on March 25, 2011. The United States and other WTO Members expressed concern over the AB's interpretation of the term \"public body\" in the SCM Agreement, noting that it appeared to collapse the terms 'government' and 'public body.' The AB's test required an analysis into what constitutes a \"governmental authority,\" moving away from an objective \"control\" standard. The Appellate Body Report raised concerns about determining \"governmental authority\" within the domestic legal system of exporting Members in CVD cases involving state-owned enterprises. This could impose a burden on companies and governments to provide data, as well as on authorities to analyze it. Identifying evidence of \"governmental authority\" in SOEs owned by the government may be challenging, despite their role in managing national economic activity. The Appellate Body Report raised concerns about trade distorting subsidies provided through state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in non-market economies (NMEs). The United States and other Members expressed concerns over the legal reasoning and implications of the AB's finding on double remedies, particularly regarding the concurrent application of antidumping and countervailing duties. The United States raised concerns about the imposition and collection of countervailing duties (CVDs) in the context of trade distorting subsidies provided through state-owned enterprises in non-market economies (NMEs). The Appellate Body's report lacked clarity on what would constitute an 'appropriate' amount of a CVD and imposed significant administrative burdens on Members' trade remedy administrators in cases of concurrent application of CVDs and NMEs. The United States expressed concerns about the complexity of analyzing dumping margins and the challenges in addressing trade-distorting subsidies by NME Members. They agreed with China on a compliance deadline for a WTO decision. Additionally, a U.S. court ruling in a related case highlighted issues with concurrent application of CVDs and antidumping duties. The U.S. court ruled that imposing antidumping duties without adjustments to avoid double counting under the NME methodology was unreasonable. Commerce was advised to refrain from imposing CVDs on NME goods until addressing the issue through improved methodologies or new tools. Commerce has the discretion not to impose CVDs as long as the NME AD methodology is used. The exporter received measurable products. Commerce must apply methodologies to avoid double counting in imposing CVD remedies on NME countries. DOC considered three options and chose to offset the CVD against the duty deposit rate for NME ADs. The USCIT ruled the offset as \"unreasonable\" and inconsistent with the Tariff Act of 1930. The court found that the offset in dumping margin calculations did not comply with the statute. DOC's tripartite list was deemed exhaustive, indicating difficulty in determining double counting. The court ordered DOC not to apply CVD law to the challenging exporter's goods and a second company, even though it did not raise the issue. The CAFC affirmed the lower court ruling, stating that Congress had ratified the 1984 DOC interpretation. The court ruled that the Commerce Department could not impose countervailing duties on imports from non-market economy countries, as Congress had ratified this interpretation in 1984. The Department was instructed to seek legislative authority if it wanted to change this. Secretary of Commerce Bryson and USTR Kirk informed committees that the Administration was reviewing all options. The Administration is considering all options in response to a court ruling that could revoke countervailing duty orders on imports from non-market economy countries. They are also seeking legislation to clarify the application of countervailing duty laws to subsidized goods from non-market economies. Legislation (H.R. 4105) was introduced to address countervailing duty orders on imports from non-market economy countries. The bill was quickly passed and signed into law as P.L. 112-99, authorizing CVDs on NME products and amending antidumping law. The Administration filed a petition for rehearing in the GPX case, and the CAFC requested arguments on the new law's impact. The U.S. has asked for the appellate decision to be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings. Importers are arguing that the new CVD authority is unconstitutionally retroactive and are requesting the case be remanded to the U.S. Court of International Trade. Despite a previous ruling that U.S. CVD law did not cover goods from NME countries, the U.S. proceeded with compliance in China's WTO dispute. The compliance deadline was extended to April 25, 2012, and the U.S. Trade Representative requested determinations under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act for antidumping investigations. The United States Commerce Department's determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations on products from China are in line with the recommendations of the DSB. Commerce is actively seeking additional information from Chinese respondents and the Government of China, with a 180-day deadline for a Section 129 determination. The United States Commerce Department is required to issue a Section 129 determination within 180 days of a request from the USTR. The USTR can direct the department to implement the determination after consulting with relevant parties. P.L. 112-99 authorizes the imposition of CVDs on goods from NME countries, including in the CVD proceedings related to China's WTO case. The new law addresses concerns of \"double counting\" in trade disputes. Commerce is working to implement a new law to reduce antidumping duties on exports from nonmarket economy countries to avoid a \"double remedy.\" This is part of US efforts to comply with DSB recommendations. Brazil has raised concerns over the use of zeroing in antidumping proceedings involving Brazilian orange juice. Brazil has raised concerns over the use of zeroing in antidumping proceedings involving Brazilian orange juice, challenging U.S. statutes, regulations, and practices related to the issue. Brazil raised concerns over the use of zeroing in antidumping proceedings involving Brazilian orange juice. A panel established at Brazil's request found the United States acted inconsistently with the Antidumping Agreement by using zeroing in administrative reviews. The panel report was adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, prompting the United States to propose changes in its practice for calculating dumping margins and assessment rates. Compliance deadline was set for March 17. At a WTO meeting, the United States addressed concerns over zeroing in antidumping reviews with Brazil. The antidumping order in question was set to be revoked, effective March 9, 2011. Brazil and the United States entered into a procedural agreement for possible compliance panel and sanctions request. Vietnam also initiated dispute settlement proceedings against the United States in 2010. In 2010, Vietnam initiated dispute settlement proceedings against the United States regarding a U.S. antidumping investigation of shrimp. Key issues included challenging the use of zeroing in calculating dumping margins, limitations on the number of exporters entitled to individual reviews, and the application of higher dumping rates to companies unable to rebut a presumption of government control. Vietnam challenged the use of zeroing and the application of higher dumping rates in a dispute with the United States. A panel report found against the U.S. on zeroing issues but upheld limitations on firms eligible for individual reviews. The compliance deadline was set for July 2, 2012. In September 2002, Brazil requested consultations with the United States regarding alleged subsidies to U.S. producers of upland cotton. Brazil claimed violations of WTO agreements and requested a panel in February 2003. WTO Members have commitments to reduce domestic support and export subsidies on agricultural products. The Agreement contains provisions on support and export subsidization, with scheduled products subject to reduction commitments. The US did not commit to reducing export subsidies for upland cotton. Violations of export subsidy commitments are prohibited under Articles 3.3, 8, and 10.1 of the Agreement. Alleged violations of the Agriculture Agreement and SCM Agreement can be challenged under WTO dispute settlement procedures. The SCM Agreement prohibits export subsidies and subsidies contingent on domestic over imported products, making any subsidy fitting the Agreement definition \"actionable\" if it causes adverse effects to another WTO Member. Adverse effects include \"serious prejudice,\" such as significant price undercutting or suppression in the market. The SCM Agreement allows for expedited dispute settlement proceedings and compliance with adverse WTO decisions. The \"Peace Clause\" in the Agriculture Agreement temporarily limited resort to WTO dispute settlement for certain support measures until December 31, 2003. The United States was found in violation of the Agriculture Agreement and the SCM Agreement by the WTO panel for maintaining export subsidy programs and providing payments under domestic support programs. The panel determined that certain U.S. export credit guarantee programs constituted export subsidies as they were provided at inadequate premium rates. The WTO panel found that certain U.S. export credit guarantee programs, including GSM-102, GSM-103, and SCGP, were considered export subsidies due to inadequate premium rates. The premiums charged did not provide sufficient financial coverage, mainly due to a 1% fee cap, lack of risk-based pricing, and reliance on government subsidies for effective coverage. The U.S. government's subsidy estimates and re-estimates ensured coverage for export subsidies on upland cotton and rice, circumventing U.S. export subsidy commitments. These programs were found to be prohibited export subsidies under the SCM Agreement. Additionally, the \"Step 2\" program under Section 1207(a) of the Farm Act was criticized by the WTO panel. The WTO panel criticized the \"Step 2\" program under the Farm Act for providing export subsidies on upland cotton, which violated U.S. obligations under the Agreement on Agriculture. The program was also deemed a prohibited export subsidy under the SCM Agreement. Additionally, payments to domestic users of upland cotton were considered a subsidy contingent on use. The WTO panel found that various U.S. domestic support programs, including CCP, MLA, marketing loan program payments, and Step 2 payments for U.S. cotton producers, granted enough support to upland cotton to exempt them from the Peace Clause. These payments were considered \"mandatory price-contingent subsidies\" and caused significant price suppression in the world upland cotton market, violating the SCM Agreement. The WTO panel found that U.S. domestic support programs, including CCP, MLA, marketing loan program payments, and Step 2 payments for cotton producers, violated the SCM Agreement by causing price suppression in the world cotton market. Brazil challenged MLA payments and FCP, which had expired legislative basis, but failed to show serious prejudice from the FCP program. The panel recommended removing prohibited subsidies promptly, citing Article 4.7 of the SCM Agreement. The WTO panel recommended the prompt removal of prohibited subsidies, citing Article 4.7 of the SCM Agreement. The panel also specified a time period for the removal of export subsidies and highlighted the deadline for requests for authorization to impose retaliatory measures under Article 7.9 of the SCM Agreement. The United States and Brazil were given a deadline of July 1, 2005, to remove prohibited subsidies and a deadline of September 21, 2005, for actionable subsidies as per the WTO rulings. The United States stated on April 20, 2005, that it would comply with the rulings but needed time to do so, prompting complaints from Brazil and the European Union. The United States was given a deadline to remove prohibited subsidies by July 1, 2005, as per WTO rulings. In response, the USDA announced a risk-based fee structure for guarantee programs. Brazil requested authorization to impose countermeasures due to the non-removal of subsidies by the deadline. Brazil requested authorization to impose countermeasures against the United States for not removing prohibited subsidies by the WTO deadline. The proposed sanctions included suspending tariff concessions and obligations under WTO agreements, estimating the total sanctions to be $3 billion. In response, the USDA announced proposed statutory changes to comply with the WTO decision. The USDA announced proposed changes to comply with the WTO decision, including repealing the Step 2 cotton program, removing the 1% cap on origination fees under the GSM-102 program, and terminating the GSM-103 program. This would address issues related to suppression of cotton prices in world markets and make the Export Credit Guarantee Program more risk-based. Brazil and the United States entered into a procedural agreement regarding the dispute, with the United States requesting arbitration of Brazil's retaliation. The United States requested arbitration of Brazil's retaliation proposal, which was referred to arbitration at a DSB meeting. Brazil could request a compliance panel after the meeting. Due to the US not complying with WTO obligations on subsidies, Brazil proposed to suspend tariff concessions and obligations under TRIPS and GATS. The US objected, leading to arbitration. The parties later requested to suspend arbitration, citing US commitment to implement changes. The United States reaffirmed its commitment to implement DSB recommendations and rulings at a meeting in November 2005. Congress repealed the Step 2 program in August 2006. Brazil requested a compliance panel in August 2006, citing WTO violations related to the Step 2 program, farm bill payments, and export credit guarantee programs. In December 2007, the compliance panel issued a report adverse to the United States regarding marketing loan and CCP payments and the GSM-102 program. The panel found that the United States violated SCM Agreement obligations by suppressing prices through marketing loan and counter-cyclical programs. Additionally, Brazil proved that the GSM-102 program constituted an export subsidy due to inadequate premiums. The panel found that the United States violated SCM Agreement obligations by providing export subsidies through the GSM-102 program, which had inadequate premiums to cover long-term costs and losses. The subsidies circumvented commitments for various products and exceeded reduction commitments, leading to prohibited subsidies. The GSM 102 export credit guarantees issued under the new fee schedule have a net cost to the Government. The program's fees are below OECD MPR's, indicating they may not cover long-term costs and losses. The structure and operation of the program suggest it is not designed to cover these expenses. The compliance panel's conclusion was based on factors such as CCC's access to funds from the US Treasury and the fixed fee cap preventing risk-based fees. The panel found that the US failed to align its measures with the Agreement on Agriculture and to remove the subsidy promptly as directed by the WTO. The Appellate Body upheld most of the compliance panel's findings but disagreed on the existence of export subsidization in the GSM-102 program. The panel's conclusion that the program would run at a net cost to the government was reversed due to insufficient weight given to US data on subsidy estimates. The United States argued that the challenged programs did not operate at a net loss to the government before complying with DSB recommendations. The Appellate Body confirmed that the revised GSM 102 program was an export subsidy. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body adopted the reports on June 25, 2008, shortly after President George W. Bush signed the 2008 farm bill. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, signed by President Bush, made changes to U.S. export credit guarantee programs to comply with the Brazil cotton case. It repealed certain programs, eliminated origination fees cap, and imposed new requirements on the Secretary of Agriculture for the GSM-102 program. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 made changes to U.S. export credit guarantee programs to comply with the Brazil cotton case. It repealed certain programs, imposed new requirements on the Secretary of Agriculture for the GSM-102 program, and reauthorized counter-cyclical payments and marketing assistance loans for cotton and other commodities for the 2008-2012 crop years. These programs were successfully challenged by Brazil as actionable subsidies in a pending WTO case. In 2008, Brazil requested the resumption of arbitrations on its retaliation proposals after the United States was found not in compliance with WTO rulings. Brazil lowered its retaliation requests to approximately $2.5 billion, including a one-time countermeasure for payments made under a repealed program, annual countermeasures for prohibited and actionable subsidies. The Arbitrator rejected Brazil's request for a one-time payment based on the Step 2 program and lowered the proposed amounts to $297.4 million annually for both prohibited and actionable subsidies. Conditions were set for Brazil to suspend WTO obligations involving U.S. services and intellectual property. The Arbitrator rejected Brazil's request for a one-time payment based on past disbursements under the Step 2 program, stating that countermeasures are temporary remedies to induce compliance. The United States had complied with this program, and Brazil could not pursue countermeasures for serious prejudice resulting from payments under the expired statutory authority. The Arbitrator's decisions are final and not subject to appeal. The Arbitrator determined that Brazil could suspend concessions amounting to $147.4 million annually for the GSM-102 export credit guarantee program, based on transactions in FY2006. Brazil calculated the trade-distorting impact of the program using interest rate discounts and additional export sales obtained by US exporters. The Arbitrator modified Brazil's calculations to more accurately assess the program's impact on Brazil. The Arbitrator reduced Brazil's proposed sanctions for the GSM-102 program to $147.4 million annually, with the amount subject to change based on transaction totals. A formula was provided for determining permissible sanctions, and Brazil was allowed to cross-retaliate under certain conditions. The Arbitrator reduced Brazil's proposed sanctions for the GSM-102 program to $147.4 million annually, with conditions on Brazil's use of this remedy. Brazil has a sufficient range of imports from the United States to suspend concessions in trade in goods without causing economic harm. The Arbitrator identified at least $409.7 million of consumer goods that could be subject to countermeasures. The Arbitrator set a threshold of 20% for U.S. import share, allowing Brazil to find alternative sources of supply. If countermeasures exceed this threshold, Brazil can cross-retaliate by suspending WTO obligations involving U.S. services or intellectual property rights. Brazil may only suspend concessions on trade in goods if sanctions do not exceed the goods threshold. In an arbitration involving actionable subsidies, the United States argued that with the expiration of the 2002 farm bill, payments under the challenged programs would no longer be made, thus no legal basis for Brazil to impose countermeasures. Brazil contended that the reauthorization of these programs in the 2008 farm bill did not materially change them, allowing the problematic payments to continue until the US achieved substantial compliance. The WTO Appellate Body ruled on Brazil's claim for countermeasures due to US non-compliance with trade agreements. The US argued that Brazil's concerns were speculative, but the Arbitrator emphasized substantive compliance over formal measures. Comparing the 2002 and 2008 farm bills, the Arbitrator found that the US had not shown substantial compliance with WTO rules. The Arbitrator found that the United States had not shown substantial compliance with WTO rules regarding the granting of marketing loan and CCPs, despite modifications to the legal basis for these payments. The Arbitrator emphasized the need for substantive compliance over formal measures and stated that uncertainties about future actions could not deter assessment of existing adverse effects. The Arbitrator determined that Brazil could impose countermeasures for the actionable subsidies in an amount not to exceed $147.3 million annually, based on the adverse effects of U.S. programs on the world cotton price. The Arbitrator decided that Brazil could impose countermeasures up to $147.3 million annually for actionable subsidies, based on Brazil's 5.1% share of global cotton production. Brazil may cross-retaliate if the total permissible countermeasures exceed $284.7 million, depending on annual increases in countermeasures due to U.S. payments under the prohibited subsidy. Brazil requested information from the United States on transactions under the GSM-102 export credit guarantee program for FY2008 and FY2009, as well as data on U.S. export prices of scheduled products like pig meat, poultry meat, and rice. In response to the Arbitrator's report on prohibited subsidies, Brazil published a list of over 200 U.S. products that could face increased tariffs. The WTO approved Brazil's request to impose countermeasures against the United States in November 2009. The United States intended to comply with the Arbitrator's decisions, hoping to resolve the dispute with Brazil without the need for tariff increases. Brazil was authorized to impose countermeasures but was not required to do so by a specific date. In response, the USDA tightened requirements for the GSM-102 program in FY2010, seeking stakeholder feedback on fee rate schedule revisions to align with the 2008 farm bill. In November 2009, CCC announced higher program fees for FY2010 based on risk categories. Brazil reported to the WTO in December 2009, claiming annual retaliation of $829.3 million. Negotiations between the US and Brazil delayed the final list of sanctioned products. Brazil notified the WTO in March 2010 of its intention to impose the retaliation starting in April. Brazil notified the WTO of its plan to impose $829.3 million in retaliation against the United States, including tariff increases on various products and the suspension of concessions under TRIPS or GATS. A preliminary agreement in the cotton dispute was reached on April 6, 2010, where the US agreed to establish a fund for technical assistance to Brazilian cotton farmers and contribute $147.3 million annually. The United States agreed to contribute $147.3 million annually to a fund for Brazilian cotton farmers and address food safety issues involving Brazilian exports. Brazil postponed retaliatory measures until April 22, with the possibility of further suspension if progress is made by April 21. On April 9, the USDA canceled unused balances of the GSM-102 export credit program for FY2010 and announced new guarantee fee rates. On April 16, Santa Catarina was added to a list of regions free of certain diseases, easing import restrictions on swine and ruminants. On April 20, a memorandum of understanding was signed to provide a fund for Brazilian cotton farmers, aimed at resolving the cotton dispute between the United States and Brazil. The fund will continue until the next Farm Bill or a mutually agreed solution is reached, with the possibility of termination by the United States if Brazil imposes retaliatory measures. Additionally, on June 25, 2010, a framework agreement was signed between the two countries, including discussions on U.S. domestic cotton support and semi-annual reviews of the GSM-102 program. The United States and Brazil signed a memorandum of understanding on April 20 to establish a fund for Brazilian cotton farmers, aiming to resolve the cotton dispute. The agreement includes discussions on U.S. domestic cotton support, semi-annual reviews of the GSM-102 program, bilateral consultations, and the possibility of imposing countermeasures. The agreement was notified to the WTO on August 27, 2010, with the United States starting payments into the cotton fund in June 2010. During the October 2010 GSM-102 review, it was determined that actual program usage exceeded $1.3 billion. The USDA did not trigger an automatic increase in fees for the GSM-102 program as actual usage approached but did not exceed the $1.3 billion threshold from April to September 2010. New GSM-102 guarantee fees were announced effective February 17, 2011, to encourage the use of shorter loans. A joint U.S.-Brazil review of the program for October 2010 to March 2011 took place in April 2011, leading to an increase in GSM-102 fees. In April 2011, USDA increased GSM-102 fees based on program usage during a joint review. The House passed appropriations legislation in June 2011, aiming to restrict USDA funds for payments to the Brazil Cotton Institute. This provision was not included in the final law. In January 2012, the Brazilian Ambassador wrote to House and Senate agriculture committees regarding various issues. The USDA increased GSM-102 fees in April 2011 based on program usage. Various cotton-related proposals for the 2012 farm bill were deemed more trade-distortive. The passage of the new farm bill and resolution of the U.S.-Brazil cotton dispute are uncertain. The USDA had to increase premiums for the program by at least 15% due to U.S. exporters exceeding a $1.5 billion benchmark. The USDA increased premiums for the program by at least 15% due to U.S. exporters exceeding a $1.5 billion benchmark. The United States and the European Union challenged each other in the WTO over alleged subsidies to major airline manufacturers in the \"Boeing/Airbus\" dispute. WTO panels found injurious subsidies from the EU to Airbus and prohibited subsidies from the U.S. to Boeing, violating the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The EU challenge to U.S. aircraft subsidies is at an earlier stage in the implementation process. Panel and Appellate Body reports were adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body in June 2011 for the U.S. challenge and in March 2012 for the EU challenge. In the pending \"Airbus\" case, the EU claimed compliance with WTO obligations by December 2011, but the U.S. disagreed and requested authorization to retaliate with estimated annual amounts of $7 billion to $10 billion. The United States initiated consultations with the EU regarding a compliance panel under Article 21.5 of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding. The EU objected to the U.S. retaliation request and the parties entered into a procedural agreement allowing for compliance proceedings. A compliance panel was established in the Airbus case, focusing on EU's provision of \"launch aid\" for Airbus models A380 and A350. The United States is challenging the EU's provision of launch aid for Airbus models A380 and A350, arguing that it constitutes prohibited subsidies causing prejudice to U.S. interests. The U.S. is concerned about new launch aid for the A350 exacerbating subsidy problems. The SCM Agreement defines a subsidy as a financial contribution conferring a benefit. The WTO Agreement prohibits subsidies that confer benefits through financial contributions, such as grants or tax credits. Subsidies contingent on export performance or use of domestic products are not allowed. Actionable subsidies can be challenged if they cause adverse effects like material injury to domestic industries or serious prejudice. The complaining Member must show that the subsidy is specific to be successful in challenging it. The EU challenged subsidies granted to Boeing by states and federal level, citing various financial benefits like tax breaks, bond financing, and research funding. The subsidies must be specific to an industry or group of industries, and serious prejudice is determined by adverse economic effects like price suppression and lost sales. The EU alleged that subsidies on the federal level, including programs from NASA, DOD, NIST, Department of Labor, and tax incentives, provided economic resources to the U.S. LCA industry on favorable terms. They claimed violations related to export subsidies and specific subsidies causing adverse effects. The EU alleged that the US provided subsidies to its LCA industry, including $14.1 billion in alleged subsidies between 1989 and 2006, with $10.4 billion attributed to NASA for R&D. The US was accused of maintaining export subsidies through the FSC program and subsequent statutes. The FSC program, found to be an export subsidy in violation of the SCM Agreement, was repealed and replaced by the ETI Act and the American Jobs Creation Act. Transition clauses allowing Boeing to continue receiving benefits under existing contracts were contentious. Congress repealed objectionable provisions in response to adverse reports in compliance proceedings. EU alleged serious prejudice including price undercutting and price depression by subsidized U.S. aircraft in various markets. The WTO panel issued a mixed ruling in a case involving the U.S. and EU producers competing in markets, finding that the U.S. provided prohibited subsidies causing adverse effects. The panel report was made public in 2011, with the U.S. found to have violated the bilateral LCA Agreement. The WTO panel found that the United States violated the bilateral LCA Agreement by providing prohibited subsidies to Boeing's LCA division. The panel determined that certain FSC/ETI measures constituted prohibited export subsidies, totaling at least $5.3 billion between 1989 and 2006. The subsidies were grouped into three categories: aeronautics R&D subsidies, tax subsidies, and other subsidies like property and sales tax relief. The panel found that various subsidies provided to Boeing, including property and sales tax relief, tax credits, and employment assistance, caused prejudice to EU interests. Specifically, NASA and DOD R&D aeronautics subsidies affected Boeing's development of technologies for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, leading to adverse effects in the wide-body product market. The FSC/ETI subsidies and tax incentives affected Boeing's pricing of various aircraft models, leading to adverse effects in different market segments. This resulted in significant price suppression, lost sales, and impedance of Airbus exports in the single-aisle and wide-body aircraft markets. The panel refrained from making a recommendation on compliance with its rulings. The panel refrained from making a recommendation on compliance with its rulings on the FSC/ETI measures affecting Boeing's pricing, noting changes in the measures and the need for the United States to remove adverse effects or withdraw the subsidy. Both the United States and the EU appealed the ruling, with the Appellate Body issuing a report on March 12, 2012. The Appellate Body issued a mixed ruling on aeronautics subsidies, confirming NASA and DOD subsidies and specificity of Washington State B&O tax rate reduction and Wichita IRBs. They found all DOD programs cited by the EU as subsidies and that Wichita IRBs caused adverse effects, but limited some of the adverse effects. The AB addressed a systemic issue regarding information-gathering procedures for serious prejudice cases under the SCM Agreement. The Appellate Body ruled on aeronautics subsidies, confirming NASA and DOD subsidies. They found that government purchases of services are considered financial contributions under the SCM Agreement. The Appellate Body confirmed that government purchases of services are considered financial contributions under the SCM Agreement. They upheld the panel's findings on NASA and DOD subsidies, totaling $2.6 billion. Additionally, they found that Washington State's reduction of the tax rate also constituted a financial contribution. The AB upheld the panel's findings on the financial contributions related to tax rate reductions for commercial aircraft manufacturers and allocation of patent rights under NASA/DOD contracts. They found that these measures were not specific in law but declined to determine de facto specificity. The AB upheld findings on specificity regarding Washington State B&O tax rate reduction and Wichita IRBs as subsidies. They also modified findings on adverse effects of aeronautics R&D subsidies, confirming their impact on Boeing's technology development for the 787 and significant lost sales in the 200-300 seat LCA market. The AB upheld findings on specificity of subsidies like Washington State B&O tax rate reduction and Wichita IRBs. They also confirmed adverse effects of aeronautics R&D subsidies on Boeing's technology development for the 787 and significant lost sales in the 200-300 seat LCA market. The effect of subsidies is a threat of displacement and impedance of EC exports in third country markets for the 200-300 seat LCA market, with significant price suppression. The AB found serious prejudice in the 100-200 seat LCA market due to subsidies affecting Boeing's prices for the 737NG, causing significant lost sales for the EU product. The AB reversed the panel's findings on the effects of subsidies, acknowledging that the price effects of tax rate reductions and R&D subsidies caused significant lost sales and price suppression in the LCA market. They also found serious prejudice in the 100-200 seat LCA market due to subsidies affecting Boeing's prices. The Appellate Body noted unresolved issues in the dispute after panel proceedings and appellate review. It recommended the United States to comply with rulings in the FSC case by removing subsidies causing adverse effects within six months. The EU may seek WTO authorization to impose sanctions against the US for non-compliance with removing subsidies causing adverse effects. The US intends to comply within the specified timeframe and has entered into a procedural agreement with the EU for possible sanctions proceedings. Compliance will focus on NASA and DOD subsidies, as well as income tax breaks from the State of Washington. The EU may seek WTO authorization to impose sanctions against the US for non-compliance with removing subsidies causing adverse effects. Compliance will focus on NASA and DOD subsidies, income tax breaks from the State of Washington, property tax breaks through Wichita's IRBs, and concerns about benefits provided to Boeing. Antigua requested consultations with the US in 2003 regarding laws affecting remote gambling services. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) requires WTO Members to make specific commitments in various service sectors through four modes of supply. These commitments are outlined in a Schedule of Specific Commitments attached to the GATS. Market access and national treatment obligations only apply to scheduled commitments, as stated in GATS Articles XVI and XVII. All GATS obligations are subject to general exceptions outlined in Article XIV. The GATS prohibits WTO Members from imposing limitations on service suppliers or service operations in scheduled sectors. The US did not include gambling services in its commitments, but the WTO panel interpreted \"Other Recreational Services\" as including them. The WTO panel interpreted the US commitments under the GATS to include gambling and betting services within the \"Other Recreational Services\" sub-sector. They found that federal statutes and state laws conflicted with these obligations by limiting the supply of such services, violating market access commitments. The WTO panel ruled against the United States for not being able to invoke exceptions in GATS Article XIV for measures related to public morals or compliance with GATS-consistent laws. The panel found that the US had not shown the measures were necessary or consistent with the Article XIV proviso to avoid discriminatory practices. The WTO Appellate Body found that the United States had violated GATS market access obligations in the dispute over Internet gambling services. They upheld the panel's decision but reversed it on the justification of federal measures under GATS exceptions. The AB also reversed the panel's findings on state laws, stating that Antigua had not proven violations of the Agreement. The WTO Appellate Body found that the United States violated GATS market access obligations in the Internet gambling services dispute. They determined that federal statutes were necessary to protect public morals or order, falling within GATS exceptions. However, inconsistencies were noted in the application of certain laws regarding remote wagering. Antigua argued that the United States applied statutes inconsistently in prosecuting foreign providers of remote horserace gambling services. They cited the Interstate Horseracing Act, highlighting provisions allowing off-track wagers and defining interstate wagers. Antigua argued that the Interstate Horseracing Act allows domestic service suppliers to offer remote betting services for horse races, exempting them from certain prohibitions. The Appellate Body found that the evidence provided by the United States was not persuasive in proving that domestic firms are prohibited from offering remote horseracing wagering services. The Appellate Body upheld the panel's finding regarding the Interstate Horseracing Act (IHA). The United States planned to comply with the rulings by clarifying the relationship between the IHA and federal laws through legislation, seeking a 15-month compliance period due to the complexity of the legislative process. The Arbitrator determined that the compliance period for legislative action regarding the Interstate Horseracing Act would last 11 months and two weeks, expiring on April 3, 2006. The United States claimed compliance based on the Department of Justice's position on remote gambling on horse racing, stating that existing criminal statutes prohibit interstate transmission of bets. Antigua disagreed with the United States' claim of compliance with the Interstate Horse Racing Act, citing violations of the Wire Act, Travel Act, and Illegal Gaming Business Act. In July 2006, Antigua requested a compliance panel, questioning the DOJ's statement and expressing concerns about pending legislation that could further institutionalize discriminatory effects. The United States' position was rejected by the panel and Appellate Body in a dispute with Antigua over remote gambling services. Antigua argued that the US was still not in compliance with the GATS due to technical alternatives and enforcement issues. A compliance panel found the US had not taken any measures to comply, leaving unresolved statutory ambiguity. Legislation was not the only means of compliance suggested by the panel. The United States did not appeal the report on the dispute with Antigua over remote gambling services. In May 2007, the USTR announced the intention to invoke Article XXI of the GATS to clarify commitments and exclude gambling services. This led to two WTO proceedings, one involving negotiations with WTO Members for compensation and the other involving arbitration on Antigua's request for countermeasures. The United States invoked Article XXI of the GATS to clarify commitments and exclude gambling services, leading to two WTO proceedings: negotiations for compensation with affected Members and arbitration on Antigua's request for countermeasures. The United States invoked Article XXI of the GATS to exclude gambling services, leading to negotiations for compensation with affected Members. Antigua, Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, EU, India, Japan, and Macao requested consultations by June 22, 2007. USTR filed a notice for public comment on compensation negotiations, with a final deadline of January 14, 2008. The US and EU reached a bilateral compensation agreement on December 17, 2007. The United States reached agreements with EU, Canada, and Japan in various service sectors. Australia settled issues earlier and withdrew from negotiations. Antigua and Costa Rica requested arbitration for compensation, while India and Macao did not. Antigua was the only remaining Member pursuing arbitration under Article XXI of GATS rules. The arbitral panel would be expected to issue its report within three months. If the United States modified its GATS Schedule without complying with the arbitral decision, Antigua could modify or withdraw benefits in conformity with the findings. In a WTO dispute, Antigua requested authorization to impose $3.4 billion in countermeasures against the United States for non-compliance with the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights. The Arbitrator ruled that Antigua can suspend concessions under the TRIPS agreement up to $21 million annually. The Arbitrator ruled that Antigua can impose sanctions not exceeding $21 million annually for the United States' non-compliance with the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights. Antigua has not appointed panelists to hear their claim, and has not requested authorization for retaliation from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. The Minister of Finance of Antigua expressed a willingness to meet with the United States government instead of imposing sanctions. The USTR's annual report for 2010 indicates ongoing consultations between the United States and Antigua to resolve issues related to remote gambling. The European Commission also expressed concerns over U.S. Internet gambling regulations and suggested that WTO action may be justified. The USTR's annual report for 2010 highlights ongoing consultations between the United States and Antigua regarding remote gambling issues. The EU Trade Ambassador and USTR discussed the implications of the EU report on WTO rights. The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve implemented the UIGEA in November 2008, prohibiting certain forms of payment for illegal Internet gambling. The rule exempts intrastate and intratribal operations with age and location verification requirements. The rule on location verification requirements for Internet gambling was effective on January 19, 2009, with compliance extended to June 1, 2010. Several bills in Congress aimed to permit Internet gambling under federal licensing programs. Bills introduced in the 112th Congress, such as H.R. 1174 and H.R. 2366, sought to achieve this. Additionally, H.R. 2230 proposed a tax on Internet gambling licensees, while H.R. 2702 aimed to amend federal criminal code provisions related to betting activities. The Office of Legal Counsel released an opinion in September 2011 regarding Internet gambling. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) of the Department of Justice publicly released a September 2011 opinion stating that certain types of online betting could be permitted by states. The opinion concluded that interstate transmissions of wire communications not related to sporting events were outside the reach of the Wire Act of 1961. This allowed state-run lotteries in New York and Illinois to proceed as they did not involve wagering on sports. The OLC found it unnecessary to reconcile the Wire Act with the UIGEA in this case. This case, known as the \"Irish music\" dispute, involves legislation enacted in 1998 that allows bars, restaurants, and retail outlets to play radio and television without copyright infringement. The \"small business\" exemption allowing bars, restaurants, and retail outlets to play radio and television music without authorization was challenged by the EU in 1999. The EU extended the compliance period to the end of 2001, with a potential compensation for the EU music industry. An arbitral award in November 2001 determined that around $1.1 million in EU trade benefits are affected annually. In January 2002, the EU requested authorization to impose countermeasures against the US for not complying with trade obligations. The US later paid $3.3 million to the EU to cover nullification of benefits. In June 2003, the US and EU reached a temporary settlement on a payment dispute, with the US agreeing to pay into a fund for EU performers. The EU could request arbitration if the US failed to pay by December 2004. In November 2004, the EU complained to the WTO that the US had not taken sufficient steps to comply with the agreement. The issue of US noncompliance was regularly raised at DSB meetings, with the US promising to work with Congress on the matter. The dispute between the US and EU over the \"Havana Club\" case involves a statute that prohibits the registration of a trademark confiscated by the Cuban government without consent. USTR Kirk and EU Trade Commissioner Ashton are exploring new options to address the dispute, with no agreement announced yet. The US reported to the DSB in 2011 that they will continue to confer with the EU to reach a resolution. The US and EU dispute over the \"Havana Club\" case involved a law prohibiting trademark registration of assets confiscated by Cuba. The EU challenged the law in 1999, citing violations of TRIPS Agreement. Despite multiple deadline extensions, the US did not comply by June 30, 2005. Instead of retaliation, the EU entered an agreement with the US on future retaliation requests. The EU and US reached an agreement on future retaliation requests regarding the \"Havana Club\" case. The EU agreed not to request authorization to suspend concessions for now but will consult with the US before any future request. The US agreed not to block EU retaliation requests outside the 30-day window and retained the right to object and refer the matter to arbitration. Discussions on U.S. noncompliance continue at WTO meetings, while the US reported introducing legislative proposals to implement the WTO ruling. In March 2010, the House Judiciary Committee discussed potential changes to U.S. law following a WTO decision. Bills in the 112th Congress, such as H.R. 255 and H.R. 1887, aimed to repeal Section 211, lift the trade embargo on Cuba, and adjust U.S.-Cuba relations. Other bills like H.R. 1888 focused on easing the export of U.S. agricultural and medical products to Cuba. Additionally, S. 603 and H.R. 1166 proposed amending Section 211 to cover all individuals claiming rights to trademarks confiscated by Cuba."
