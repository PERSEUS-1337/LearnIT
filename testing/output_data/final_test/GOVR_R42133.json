    "content": "Some U.S. policymakers are concerned about the efficiency of conducting government missions abroad. Proposals to reform interagency collaboration on foreign missions aim to enhance performance, save money, and streamline processes. Relevant legislation includes the Interagency Personnel Rotation Act of 2011 and the Contingency Operations Oversight and Interagency Enhancement Act of 2011. The FY2012 NDAA (P.L. 112-81) mandates the President to submit an implementation plan for achieving 'whole-of-government' integration vision within 270 days. Policymakers have long debated the division of labor between the Department of Defense and other agencies for missions abroad, including stabilization, security assistance, counterterrorism, humanitarian aid, and counterinsurgency. The appropriate division of labor between the Department of Defense (DOD) and civilian agencies, particularly the State Department, in conducting missions and activities is a primary question. Recommended changes in authorities, processes, organization, structures, and personnel resources are being considered to optimize their use for future threats. Interagency responses will be crucial for addressing major challenges to U.S. national security in the coming decades, but there is little agreement on solutions for interagency reform. Congress has been involved in aspects of interagency reform. The George W. Bush Administration created the State Department Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization in 2004 with the support of Senator Richard G. Lugar and then Senator Joe Biden. Additional congressional initiatives are being called for in interagency reform. The focus of the report is on civilian institutions and personnel, with discussions on DOD reforms to improve interaction. The report discusses DOD reforms to improve interaction with civilians, starting with a history of interagency reform efforts. It includes a synopsis of reform proposals from various organizations and experts, with a focus on key problems in the current interagency structure. The report concludes with overarching questions about the necessity and priority of interagency reform for missions abroad. Foreign policy analysts have long been concerned about the challenges U.S. agencies face when working together on missions abroad. After the Cold War, new types of missions emerged, requiring a mix of military and civilian efforts. The need for interagency cooperation became evident as military forces took on state-building tasks traditionally handled by civilians. The Clinton Administration issued Presidential Decision Directive 56 in May 1997 to address the need for coordinated U.S. responses to crises abroad. This directive aimed to improve interagency planning and collaboration, but faced challenges in implementation due to bureaucratic resistance. The U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century recommended significant organizational redesign of the executive branch to enhance national security integration across various policy areas. The 9/11 attacks highlighted the challenges of interagency cooperation at home and abroad. The 9/11 attacks in 2001 emphasized the need for improved interagency cooperation in both domestic and international operations. The military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq further highlighted the challenges of collaboration among U.S. departments and agencies. It became clear that civilian-led interagency collaboration was essential for successful missions abroad, leading to proposals for reforming the interagency system in the mid-2000s. The Defense Science Board (DSB) studies in 2004 and 2005 recommended significant changes for \"stability\" operations, including security, transition, counterinsurgency, and peacemaking. The 2005 study emphasized the need for close cooperation between the Department of Defense (DOD) and the State Department, as well as the enhancement of stabilization and reconstruction capabilities. It proposed elevating the profile of stability operations within DOD and making it a core mission alongside combat operations. The 2008 study focused on improving U.S. missions abroad by advocating for preventive action to prevent conflict, contain terrorism, and combat transnational crime. Lessons learned from stabilization and reconstruction operations were seen as applicable to a broader range of U.S. engagements abroad. The studies recommended empowering civilians to lead missions abroad, improving mechanisms for joint civil-military operations, and focusing on state-building in weak or unstable states to address threats to U.S. security. State-building activities were central to the strategy developed to address threats to U.S. security by fostering legitimate, open, and effective governments in troubled countries. The Bush Administration initially rejected the concept of \"nation-building\" but changed its perspective after military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq post 9/11. Significant initiatives were adopted to improve agencies' ability to carry out state-building missions effectively. The Bush Administration embraced recommendations to improve agencies' ability for state-building missions and interagency cooperation. The DOD Directive 3000.05 designated stability operations as a core military mission, shifting focus from combat operations. It emphasized systematic attention to doctrine, training, and planning for stability operations, with DOD supporting civilian leadership in state-building situations. The Bush Administration focused on state-building missions and interagency cooperation, creating the Civilian Stabilization Initiative and the State Department Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization. They also implemented plans for interagency cooperation in National Security Presidential Directive 44 and Executive Order 13434. The Bush Administration established the National Security Professional Development program through Executive Order 13434 in May 2007. The program aimed to promote integration of resources in national security mission areas and break down cultural barriers. However, it did not provide central resources, leaving each department and agency to build its own capacity under the program guidelines. The National Security Professional Development program stagnated during the Bush Administration due to lack of direction and supervision. President Obama aimed to reorganize the federal government for efficiency and competitiveness, embracing key initiatives from the Bush Administration. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed support for civilian capacity-building initiatives in early 2009. In response to the need for funding for S&R missions, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates supported increasing civilian capabilities. The Obama Administration scaled back previous plans but announced modest steps to enhance civilian leadership and coordination in national security. In 2010, the White House outlined steps to strengthen national security through a whole-of-government approach, emphasizing updating American power tools, maintaining military superiority, and investing in diplomacy and development capabilities. The Obama Administration called for enhancing defense, diplomacy, development, intelligence, homeland security, economic institutions, strategic communication, and partnerships with the private sector and non-governmental organizations. The 2010 QDDR, issued by the State Department and USAID, proposed reforms to enhance U.S. diplomacy and development capabilities, aiming for \"whole-of-government\" cohesion. It included integrating national security budgets, elevating key State Department offices, creating new regional structures, empowering Ambassadors, and promoting personnel reforms. The United States' system for decision-making and implementing foreign affairs missions is considered dysfunctional by many analysts, with problems perceived across various national security areas. The three most commonly cited factors for inefficiency in interagency efforts abroad are inadequate strategic planning, structural weaknesses in the government system, and department-centric missions. The U.S. government system for conducting missions abroad is criticized for department-centric organizations leading to \"stove-piping,\" insufficient civilian resources, inadequate information sharing mechanisms, and lack of leadership authority. Personnel are often not trained for interagency missions, causing disagreements among key players over mission purposes and means. Improved institutional arrangements and enhanced leadership may help reduce disagreements among key players in interagency missions. Problems with strategic planning and leadership are often attributed to deficiencies at the White House, particularly the National Security Council (NSC). The NSC plays a crucial role in addressing these issues at various levels within the U.S. government system for conducting missions abroad. The National Security Council (NSC) at the White House is the ultimate locus for integrating foreign policy and national security strategy. Despite its central role, many analysts find NSC staff and procedures inadequate for overseeing interagency missions effectively, especially during crises. Strategic planning can break down, and the State Department regional bureau usually directs civilian efforts. The NSC is responsible for integrating foreign policy and national security strategy, but its procedures may be inadequate during crises. The State Department regional bureau typically directs civilian crisis planning, with ad hoc task forces formed to coordinate activities between civilian agencies and DOD. Task forces at the department and field levels can face challenges due to members' lack of interagency experience and differing cultures, leading to structural weaknesses in operations. At the department level, policies and programs are developed, while at the field level, programs are implemented. Planning and implementation are guided by the President's policy through NSC processes and Cabinet meetings, but agency interests and other factors influence outcomes. Various players with different priorities make developing plans for foreign affairs challenging. The State Department leads this function, with involvement from regional and functional bureaus, USAID, and Ambassadors at U.S. embassies. Field-level efforts are reviewed and overseen by the State Department. At the field level, field-level efforts and activities are overseen by the State Department regional and functional bureaus, which secure funding. In other civilian agencies, headquarters units are involved in planning and implementing activities with limited presence abroad. Collaboration and coordination among civilian agencies at the headquarters level vary. U.S. Ambassadors are responsible for translating the President's foreign policy into concrete diplomatic measures and foreign assistance programs at the field level. Ambassadors or Chiefs of Mission direct and coordinate foreign policy initiatives at U.S. embassies. At the field level, U.S. Ambassadors direct and coordinate foreign policy initiatives at embassies. Ambassadors oversee activities of country teams composed of representatives from various U.S. departments and agencies. However, Ambassadors may lack authority to compel agency representatives to align activities with embassy missions. Structural weaknesses exist at the regional level, where the Department of Defense operates independently through Combatant Commands. In peacetime, military personnel involved in security cooperation are attached to U.S. embassies under COM authority. Civilian input into GCC planning is limited, with some analysts seeing the absence of permanent civilian regional structures as a deficiency. The State Department has regional programs and coordinators reporting to the Secretary of State for interagency missions. The State Department has coordinators for interagency missions, but they lack the power to compel cooperation. Proposals for reforming foreign policy and strategy making vary from broad to narrow, with calls for a new National Security Act to streamline interagency operations. The Project on National Security Reform also suggested a complete overhaul of the National Security Act of 1947. Some analysts doubt the success of current interagency initiatives without full-scale reform. The argument for wholesale reform emphasizes the interconnectedness of the national security system, but implementing such changes is challenging. Many prefer an incremental approach with targeted improvements in key areas. Some proposals focus on improving strategy-making, planning, and budgeting mechanisms, correcting structural weaknesses at different levels, enhancing the authority of U.S. Ambassadors at the field level, and creating interagency personnel policies and mechanisms. The proposals are diverse and catalogued under four rubrics, with a spectrum of recommendations by author and type. Source citations can be found in the bibliography. A fundamental weakness of the current system is the lack of adequate strategy-making, planning, and budgeting capabilities, which undermines the United States' ability to develop coherent foreign policies. Analysts have highlighted the need for systems and procedures to ensure coherent strategy development and effective leadership. Options to address these deficiencies are explored in Appendix B. The deficiencies in the National Security Council (NSC) and its staff roles, responsibilities, and structure are examined in Appendix B. Proposed reforms include establishing new positions and structures, enhancing strategy development processes, integrating budgets, and improving budgeting processes. Weaknesses in civilian institutions hinder their ability to coordinate interagency missions abroad. Bureaucratic impediments to interagency reform include agencies prioritizing core missions and resisting resource allocation. Many proposals for interagency reform aim to overcome bureaucratic obstacles such as agencies prioritizing core missions and personnel responding to specific evaluators. Strengthening the State Department's capacity to lead civilian missions abroad is a key focus, with some proposals suggesting reallocating responsibilities to other agencies. Various institutional arrangements are also being considered. Some proposals advocate creating new institutions or interagency teams for S&R, enhancing civilian input in DOD units, and increasing personnel in the Civilian Response Corps. Ambassadors are seen as crucial for improving interagency coordination in bilateral missions. Ambassadors are viewed as essential for successful interagency cooperation in U.S. assistance efforts in various countries. Proposals suggest enhancing Ambassadors' authority over embassy staff, funding, and interagency country teams to improve coordination. Analysts highlight the need for interagency education and training for effective collaboration in missions. Some proposals aim to establish a U.S. government-wide \"interagency\" culture through education, training, and experience. Suggestions include creating a group of national security professionals dedicated to interagency operations, enhancing the National Security Professional Development program, developing interagency career paths, and forming an interagency cadre of senior managers. Other ideas involve overhauling personnel systems to link interagency education to job qualifications and promotions. Limited proposals focus on expanding opportunities for interagency education and training. Some proposals suggest creating new institutions or enhancing existing ones for interagency education and training. Congress holds authority over interagency reform, including control over resources like personnel and facilities. It also determines the organization of top executive branch departments and agencies, influencing the creation of high-level positions at the NSC and civilian departments like State, Defense, and USAID. Congress plays a significant role in personnel matters and promotions within the government. Congress has significant influence over personnel matters, including the power to promote civilian and military officers and enact legislation to stimulate reforms. This can be done through hearings, briefings, and meetings with executive branch officials. Key issues to consider include the necessity of interagency reform, reliance on the U.S. military, prioritizing proposed reforms, and potential budget savings. The United States' military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq has been influential in shaping these discussions. The United States' military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq has driven interagency reform efforts, raising doubts about the wisdom of such missions. The necessity of interagency reform for missions abroad depends on the future security environment, state-building demands, and the effectiveness of interagency collaboration for new mission types. The perception that extensive interagency reform is vital to national security is being questioned. The belief in the importance of interagency reform for missions abroad stems from the idea that weak states and post-conflict settings are breeding grounds for terrorism. However, some analysts argue that terrorism can also originate in developed countries due to various factors. Focusing solely on weak states for intervention may not always be effective. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the challenges posed by weak states, highlighting their potential to fuel radicalism and extremism. It calls for a holistic approach combining defense, diplomacy, and development to address these threats and protect U.S. interests. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the integration of defense, diplomacy, and development tools to prevent threats to U.S. interests in a complex security landscape. It highlights the need for interagency approaches to strengthen weak states facing insurgencies, terrorist networks, and humanitarian disasters. Policymakers and analysts are urged to consider interagency reform for increasing civilian capacity and integrative personnel measures. The need for interagency reform to strengthen weak states facing insurgencies, terrorist networks, and humanitarian disasters is highlighted in the 2010 QDR. There is skepticism about the effectiveness of state-building efforts, with debates on past successes and failures. One scholar suggests avoiding missions that aim to remake countries, citing Germany and Japan as rare success stories due to specific conditions. Some international post-conflict state-building efforts have been successful, with examples like Mozambique and El Salvador in the early 1990s. Despite challenges in countries like Haiti and Somalia, the Balkans have achieved stability. A 2003 RAND study found that nation-building can effectively end conflicts, prevent their recurrence, and promote democracy. Efforts to improve success in mitigating conflict and state-building operations are showing promise through research and evaluation by the U.S. and international governments, academia, and think tanks. There is a growing body of literature on the effectiveness of mechanisms used to defuse and settle conflicts. The effectiveness of mechanisms used to defuse and settle conflicts, along with state-building best practices, are being studied for future U.S. state-building efforts. The history of the U.S. military in non-combat roles, particularly state-building, has been controversial, with a shift in focus from combat capabilities to socioeconomic reform in the post-Cold War era. The U.S. military's evolving mission post-Cold War includes non-combat state-building activities alongside traditional combat operations. Defense policymakers are grappling with the extent to which the military should be involved in national security activities like counterinsurgency and counterterrorism. The DOD's response so far has been somewhat ambiguous, stating a willingness to engage to whatever extent necessary. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of civilians in non-combat missions, stating that a \"strong cadre of civilians\" is crucial for national security. DODD 3000.05 acknowledges that civilians are better suited for state-building tasks, but also highlights the need for state-building skills within the military. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of civilians in non-combat missions, stating that a \"strong cadre of civilians\" is crucial for national security. While acknowledging that civilians are better suited for state-building tasks, it also recognizes the need for state-building skills within the military. Maintaining state-building capabilities within the U.S. military services comes at a cost, including investments in developing training, exercises, and special abilities. Defense analysts may raise concerns about the trade-offs of maintaining such capabilities amidst budget constraints and a drawdown of active duty troops. If the cost of maintaining military personnel for state-building activities is high, it may impact the debate on weapons modernization vs. personnel budgets. DOD leaders have advocated for developing civilian capacity for these tasks due to the additional costs and strain on military forces. Congress may need to decide if DOD should continue to lead state-building activities or if civilian capabilities should be expanded to allow DOD to focus on hostile situations. Former Secretary of Defense Gates and recent Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs have supported funding for civilian state-building capabilities. The DOD may need to retain capacity for hostile situations, potentially creating a new position for stability operations. Concerns arise about military dominance in state-building activities and its impact on U.S. foreign policy. Former leaders have supported funding for civilian state-building capabilities. The military's increasing dominance in foreign policy coordination and implementation raises concerns about undermining the State Department's role and potentially hindering efforts to promote democratization and civilian control of governments abroad. A RAND publication predicts adverse consequences if resources and capabilities for nation-building are concentrated in the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense's increasing role in foreign policy could weaken the State Department and civilian control over military policy. This shift may hinder U.S. diplomatic efforts and state-building activities, as the military is seen as a secondary choice for such tasks. The military's rejection of using personnel for state-building tasks due to cost considerations. Current capacity falls short of goals set by the Bush Administration. Some argue that military involvement may be cost-effective in the short run. Continued development of state-building and other capabilities is needed. The military's reluctance to engage in state-building due to cost concerns, despite the need for increased capabilities. The State Department has historically led state-building efforts, but a potential shift towards increased DOD involvement could occur. The potential shift of budgets from the State Department to the Department of Defense could impact the balance of authority between the two departments in the future. Policymakers and analysts may debate the priority order of specific reform elements in the national security system, focusing on strategy-making, planning, budgeting, and personnel training. The effectiveness of reform efforts in improving collaboration and coordination may involve creating new structures, rearranging existing ones, or enhancing current authorities and capacities. In prioritizing national security system reform, policymakers may consider different approaches based on their views of current system strengths and weaknesses. Some may focus on White House level changes for crisis operations, while others may look to the State Department and embassy level for steady state strategy improvements. Personalities may also play a role in strategy-making processes. In prioritizing national security system reform, policymakers may consider different approaches based on their views of current system strengths and weaknesses. Some may focus on White House level changes for crisis operations, while others may look to the State Department and embassy level for steady state strategy improvements. Those who believe in the influence of personalities on strategy-making processes might de-emphasize the need for higher level structural reform and instead focus on enhancing leadership capacity at all levels. Prioritizing reform at the field level with an emphasis on interagency personnel development could be another approach, especially for those who see operational personnel capable of correcting flaws in higher levels. The lack of specific criteria for prioritizing reform elements suggests the need for guidance from historical case studies. The editors of a compilation of case studies identified recurring weaknesses in interagency missions, including little investment in human capital, absence of interagency doctrine, and lack of appropriate leadership. They emphasized the importance of competent leaders over organizational structures and processes. Some policymakers may prioritize support for national security professional development programs and civilian capabilities for stabilization. The creation of civilian capabilities for stabilization and reconstruction under S/CRS includes developing rapidly deployable civilian forces for state-building functions. This marks a substantial change from past practices and may allow for earlier withdrawal of military personnel. Continued support for improving this capability is seen as desirable by some policymakers and analysts. Some policymakers prioritize reforms that enhance U.S. government cooperation with other entities abroad. The ease and cost of implementation are also considered, with the Obama Administration focusing on low-cost, easy-to-implement initiatives as of 2011. The decision to cut back on the National Security Professional Development program and elevate S/CRS and S/CT functions in the State Department hierarchy are cost-conscious and relatively low-cost initiatives, reflecting budget pressures and a desire for greater certainty of effect. Interagency reform is seen as a cost-saving measure in the long run, with the 2010 QDDR highlighting the benefits of partnering with other agencies to reduce overall program costs and improve policy outcomes. However, some analysts find it challenging to assess the cost effects of such reforms. Analysts believe that interagency reform may lead to cost savings by eliminating duplication of effort, sharing information technology, and improving collaboration and coordination. However, the actual cost savings may vary depending on the size of the mission and the effectiveness of the reform efforts. Some analysts believe that replacing U.S. military forces with civilian personnel in post-conflict areas could lead to cost savings, but there may be upfront personnel investment required. Congress's ability to oversee national security affairs and promote interagency reform is hindered by its own organization and procedures, according to some analysts. Some analysts believe Congress's organization hampers reform efforts in national security. A 2008 RAND/AAD report suggested creating new select committees to improve integration of power and influence, enabling better decision-making. The 2008 RAND/AAD report recommended creating new select committees in Congress to improve decision-making on national security matters, without directly affecting the current distribution of power. Additionally, the PNSR proposed the establishment of select committees in the Senate and House for interagency national security issues, with the potential for permanent committees with oversight and legislative powers if successful. These committees would serve as the focal point for executive-legislative consultations on national security. The establishment of new select committees in Congress for national security matters has been recommended by various reports and panels. These committees would serve as the focal point for executive-legislative consultations on national security, potentially leading to changes in the current distribution of responsibilities in Congress. The Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel suggested reconvening the Joint Committee on the Organization of the Congress to examine and recommend changes to make Congress more effective in providing for the common defense. The proposal suggests establishing a single national security appropriations subcommittee for key departments and agencies, along with a parallel authorization process. Alternatively, Congress could align defense and foreign relations committees to work together more closely on national security issues. These measures aim to enhance coordination and bipartisanship in handling security matters. To enhance coordination and bipartisanship in handling security matters, Congress may consider revising budgeting processes by mandating multi-year budgets in certain areas and requiring civilian agencies to develop five-year budget plans. This could facilitate strategic planning and discussions on long-term resource allocation for national security challenges. The United States may need to address new state-building needs in Arab states and increase engagement in counterterrorism and conflict prevention due to economic troubles. Congress may explore interagency reform to improve resource allocation and effectiveness in achieving missions. Improved strategic planning and better-trained personnel could lead to more efficient outcomes. The U.S. military, particularly the Army, is reassessing its purposes and reducing its forces, highlighting the need to rebalance military and civilian state-building capacity. Various materials and reports from organizations like the U.S. State Department Advisory Committee on Transformational Diplomacy and the Brookings Institution address reforming U.S. assistance efforts in fragile countries and promoting a joint interagency approach. The curr_chunk discusses various reports and materials from organizations such as the U.S. Army War College, Council on Foreign Relations, and Center for Global Development on topics related to stability operations, post-conflict capabilities, preventive action, weak states, and global development. The curr_chunk provides a list of reports and materials from organizations like CSIS, CWC, and DSB on topics related to development, security assistance, and wartime contracting. The curr_chunk lists various reports and materials from organizations such as Flournoy/Brimley, Heritage Foundation, Lamb/Marks, NDU, and Pope on national security, post-conflict operations, interagency cooperation, and foreign policy implementation. The curr_chunk provides a list of reports and materials from organizations like Flournoy/Brimley, Heritage Foundation, Lamb/Marks, NDU, and Pope on national security, post-conflict operations, interagency cooperation, and foreign policy implementation. It includes references to various reports such as PNSR 2008, PNSR 2009, PNSR 2010, QDR 2006, QDR 2010, QDDR 2010, and QDRIP 2010. The curr_chunk lists reports from organizations like RAND and the American Academy of Diplomacy on integrating instruments of power and influence in national security. The curr_chunk provides a list of reports from various organizations on national security and peace-building operations. The curr_chunk discusses reports on national security and peace-building operations, including proposals to improve strategy-making, planning, budgeting, institutional arrangements, resources, and civilian authority. The curr_chunk focuses on enhancing civilian authority at the field level and improving interagency personnel policies and mechanisms. It excludes specific field or program level interagency issues and proposals that have already been implemented. The curr_chunk discusses past proposals for interagency reform, excluding foreign assistance and congressional oversight reforms. It focuses on executive branch interagency reform and the need for adequate resources in post-conflict settings. The curr_chunk discusses proposals for interagency reform, specifically focusing on the National Security Council's role in policy coordination. It highlights selected proposals from organizations and individuals with expertise in national security issues. The National Security Council (NSC) serves as a forum for considering national security and foreign policy matters, advising and assisting the President in coordinating policies among government agencies. Its role includes advising the President on integrating domestic, foreign, and military policies to enhance cooperation among government departments for national security. The National Security Council (NSC) advises the President on national security and foreign policy matters, coordinating policies among government agencies. The NSC has wide discretion in its functions and organization, with the President appointing members and directing its activities. Each administration uses the NSC differently due to the flexibility granted by law. The NSC staff, also known as the national security staff, has varying roles in different administrations, depending on the President's relationships with department heads and the National Security Advisor. The Secretary of State leads in developing and implementing foreign policy, ensuring coherence of foreign assistance. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 designates the Secretary of State to supervise economic and military assistance programs to ensure they align with U.S. foreign policy. Coordination of foreign policy and assistance is not explicitly mandated, but falls under the Secretary of State's responsibility through other legislation or presidential orders. The State Department, under the guidance of the Secretary of State, is responsible for administering development assistance. Congress mandated the Secretary of State to coordinate all U.S. assistance for combating illicit narcotics. President George W. Bush also tasked the Secretary of State with leading interagency efforts for stabilization and reconstruction activities. The State Department, under the Secretary of State's guidance, administers development assistance and coordinates U.S. efforts for combating illicit narcotics. The Secretary of State also leads interagency stabilization and reconstruction activities, coordinating with the Secretary of Defense. The State Department's organizational structure includes coordinating offices for foreign assistance, HIV/AIDS, counterterrorism, and stabilization and reconstruction activities worldwide. The State Department has coordinating offices for foreign assistance, HIV/AIDS, counterterrorism, and stabilization and reconstruction activities worldwide. The new S&R bureau, created in line with Obama Administration plans, aims to upgrade Coordinator offices on counterterrorism and S&R to enhance effectiveness. The President will nominate an Assistant Secretary for the S&R bureau, which reports directly to the Secretary of State. Congress previously established interagency coordinator posts for assistance to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The State Department has coordinating offices for foreign assistance, HIV/AIDS, counterterrorism, and stabilization and reconstruction activities worldwide. The Office of the Coordinator of U.S. Assistance to Europe and Eurasia oversees assistance to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator was established in 2003 to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism (S/CT) coordinates U.S. government policies to counter terrorism overseas, encouraging interagency collaboration and multi-country activities. The Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism (S/CT) was established in 1972 after the Munich Olympics terrorist attack. It coordinates U.S. government policies for counterterrorism activities, but lacks the authority to compel other agencies to participate or a program budget for leverage. The Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism advises the Secretary of State on international counterterrorism matters and supervises international counterterrorism activities. The Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations was established in 2004 to oversee reconstruction and stabilization efforts, with a congressional mandate and codification in 2008. The Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations, established in 2004, assists with strategic planning in conflict and post-conflict settings. In 2011, its functions were transferred to a new bureau for Conflict and Stabilization Operations, which plays a key role in developing policy and planning for missions. The Assistant Secretary for Conflict and Stabilization Operations will also be the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization. USAID is the primary U.S. agency for administering foreign aid, supporting various activities worldwide. USAID administers foreign aid programs through contracts with various organizations and agencies, including DOD and the Department of Agriculture for disaster relief efforts. The agency deploys Disaster Assistance and Relief Teams (DARTs) to provide specialized assistance in disaster areas. USAID, through its Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), has been involved in state-building and stabilization efforts in conflict and post-conflict settings since 1994. Other executive departments like Treasury, Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Justice, and Transportation also contribute to interagency efforts abroad, with all but Treasury participating in the Civilian Response Corps system. U.S. Chiefs of Mission and Embassy Country Teams play a key role in stabilization and reconstruction missions. U.S. Ambassadors overseas have a crucial role in coordinating foreign assistance and policy. They are appointed by the President with Senate approval and serve as the President's representatives abroad. Ambassadors have the authority to oversee U.S. foreign policy in individual countries, providing a strong executive authority mechanism. The embassy \"country teams\" play a key role in coordinating foreign assistance programs and U.S. military assistance among government representatives in each country. They work under the direction of the U.S. Ambassador to turn broad foreign policy into concrete diplomatic measures. The U.S. Ambassador or other COM leads embassy country teams comprised of representatives from various U.S. departments and agencies to coordinate foreign assistance programs and diplomatic measures in the country. The Ambassador is responsible for directing and supervising all government executive branch employees within the country. The Ambassador (or other COM) is responsible for keeping informed about all government activities in the country and ensuring compliance with directives. Chiefs of Mission have the authority to determine personnel size and mandate. Ambassadorial leadership and country team integration vary by country. The U.S. military has been integrating civilians from other departments and agencies into its structures by creating interagency groups or new posts for civilian agency representatives. This includes setting up Joint Interagency Coordination Groups for combatant commanders to receive civilian input, particularly on counterterrorism issues. In 2004, a USAID Office of Military Affairs was established at USAID headquarters, with liaison personnel sent to each GCC to advise on military activities with development implications. The U.S. military has been increasing civilian participation in combatant commands, such as the creation of civilian positions within some GCCs and the establishment of Joint Interagency Coordination Groups (JIACG) to provide civilian input on counterterrorism issues. The Joint Interagency Coordination Groups (JIACGs) were established in early 2002 to facilitate interagency information sharing for combatant commands, initially focusing on counterterrorism. Headed by SES members, JIACGs have evolved over time, with varying levels of utilization and effectiveness. Some concerns have been raised about their original civilian advisory function. The USAID Office of Civilian-Military Cooperation was established in 2005 to address conflicts between U.S. military activities and development objectives. It includes senior USAID officials assigned to GCCs and Pentagon offices, as well as military liaison officers at USAID headquarters. Some Geographic Combatant Commands have created new posts for civilian personnel from other departments and agencies. The USAID Office of Civilian-Military Cooperation, established in 2005, includes senior USAID representatives and civilians from other agencies assigned to Geographic Combatant Commands. The most integrated commands are AFRICOM and SOUTHCOM, with civilian personnel from various agencies. AFRICOM had 39 civilian personnel and SOUTHCOM had 29, both commands integrating senior civilian personnel into leadership roles. Establishing civilian \"Deputy to the Commander\" posts occupied by senior State Department foreign service officials in U.S. European Command (EUCOM) and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). EUCOM has incorporated its Interagency Engagement Group into its command structure as an Interagency Partnering Directorate. CENTCOM has \"20 liaison members from other U.S. Government departments and agencies\" working with CENTCOM staff. No information on interagency personnel within U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) and NORTHCOM. Other Interagency Mechanisms include Interagency Task Forces for missions abroad. Interagency cooperation for missions abroad is often achieved through multi-agency task forces, which are criticized for being ad hoc and dysfunctional. Task forces under three GCCs coordinate counternarcotics and counter-terrorism efforts. DOD established three task forces to combat drug trafficking following Congress's 1988 designation of DOD as the lead agency for detection and monitoring. The DOD established three task forces to combat drug trafficking, which coordinate support for civilian law enforcement agencies. Two task forces served as the basis for interagency task forces in Florida and Hawaii, focusing on interdicting illicit trafficking and providing support for counterdrug activities. The third task force, Joint Task Force North, is located in Texas under the U.S. Northern Command. Joint Task Force North (JTFN) is located at Fort Bliss near El Paso, TX, and coordinates activities along the southwest border and Gulf of Mexico. It supports federal law enforcement agencies in counternarcotics and homeland security missions. The Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Iraq and Afghanistan are similar task forces consisting of civilian-military teams providing government support. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan and Iraq were established to coordinate U.S. government support in provinces, build infrastructure, and provide assistance to local authorities. Despite challenges, PRTs have continued in Afghanistan, while they were dissolved in Iraq in FY2011. The 15 Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) were dissolved in FY2011 in Iraq. Their functions were transferred to State Department diplomatic posts and Iraqi local governments. The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) teams, a form of interagency task force, work together on conflict resolution and mitigation efforts. Interagency collaboration can also occur through informal arrangements for program planning and implementation. The DOD Regional Counterterrorism Fellowship Program (CTFP) lacks State Department coordination, but DOD consults with them. In Afghanistan, DOD and civilians have informal arrangements for integration. Concerns exist about integrating foreign policy elements and strategic planning within the U.S. government. The Project on National Security Reform (PNSR) highlighted the lack of a strategic framework guiding U.S. national security policymaking, leading to ad hoc planning and resource allocation. Poor strategy formulation at the leadership level has been linked to deficient implementation, fostering rivalries and inefficiencies within government processes. Analysts emphasize the need for systems and procedures to address these challenges. Many analysts stress the importance of coherent strategy, planning, and leadership in civil-military operations to address complex missions abroad. Proposals for enhancing strategy-making and planning processes have been put forth by various organizations and experts, including reforms at the NSC. The Obama Administration has initiatives in budgeting, including establishing a Global Security Contingency Fund and involving Ambassadors in budget-making at the country team level. A \"3D Planning Group\" has been formed by State Department, USAID, and DOD planners to improve collaboration in planning. The Obama Administration has established a \"3D Planning Group\" to enhance collaboration in planning. Proposals for improving strategy-making have focused on the National Security Council (NSC) processes and staff, with suggestions to create new positions, structures, or assign new responsibilities to the NSC staff. The Obama Administration has established a \"3D Planning Group\" to enhance collaboration in planning. Suggestions include creating new positions, structures, or assigning new responsibilities to the NSC staff, which may require expanding the size of the NSC staff or delegating functions to others. Any changes in staff size or structure would require congressional action due to budgetary implications. This could impinge on the President's flexibility to structure the White House according to circumstances and available personnel. The Obama Administration has established a \"3D Planning Group\" to enhance collaboration in planning, which may require expanding the NSC staff or delegating functions. Recommendations for new government-wide strategy and planning reviews aim to clarify agency roles and facilitate integration, modeled after the President's National Security Strategy Report and the DOD Quadrennial Defense Review. Other proposals suggest rationalizing strategy development and planning capabilities through new posts, mechanisms, or procedures. Secretary of State Clinton emphasized the role of Chiefs of Mission in integrating country-level strategic plans and budgets during a meeting with Ambassadors. Each chief of mission will oversee an integrated country strategy that encapsulates U.S. policy priorities and objectives. There is a perceived deficiency in budgeting by agency rather than by mission or goal, with proposals to integrate agency budgets relevant to national security. The concept of an integrated national security budget dates back to the 2001 U.S. Commission on National Security, which criticized the budgeting process for not clearly addressing national security goals and tradeoffs in resource allocation. Budgeting by agency can lead to duplication of efforts and gaps in national security programs. The 2001 U.S. Commission on National Security criticized the budgeting process for not clearly addressing national security goals and resource allocation tradeoffs. They proposed focusing on critical strategic goals like homeland security, counterterrorism, nonproliferation, nuclear threat reduction, and science and technology in the initial integrated national security budget. The Commission suggested that the budget could evolve into a more comprehensive document over time. The national security budget could evolve into a more comprehensive document, with recommendations for sector-specific integrated budgets or budget presentations. Greater transparency and combined decision-making on State, USAID, and DOD budgets in areas of overlap may increase government efficiency and effectiveness. Providing information on all U.S. national security accounts in one document could bring more transparency and facilitate oversight, potentially leading to efficiencies and increased effectiveness. Reform of strategy and planning structures may be needed to manage \"blended\" funds, which could involve coordinating programs through shared cross-agency accounts. Analysts have raised concerns about possible complications for Congress in handling integrated budgets under the current committee system. The Budget Control Act of 2011 consolidates defense and international affairs budgets under a comprehensive \"security\" category, providing an opportunity for Congress to view them as a whole and potentially gain insights for future budget integration. The Obama Administration has endorsed the idea of establishing a fully integrated national security budget and is taking steps to achieve that goal. Secretary of State Clinton mentioned the Administration's desire to discuss a national security budget to see tradeoffs and savings. The December 2010 QDDR signals the Administration's intent to advance the discussion, with a proposed first step being the pooled DOD-State Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF). Congress authorized the GSCF in the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act as a three-year pilot project proposed by the State Department. This fund may highlight the need for associated changes. The Department of Defense (DOD) has a predominant role in missions that some argue should be handled by civilians due to weaknesses in civilian institutions and leadership. Studies show that leaving \"nation-building\" tasks to the military is problematic, highlighting the need for improvements in civilian institutions and authorities. Improvements to civilian institutions and authorities in the national security system, particularly the Department of State and its Secretary, have been key recommendations for interagency reform. Presidents have often appointed \"czars\" to lead interagency efforts in various areas, but these individuals may lack the authority to effectively coordinate operations and are seen as lacking accountability to Congress. Some Members view \"czars\" as lacking accountability to Congress; lead agencies like the Department of State are often ineffective due to lack of authority and resources. Civilian agencies may not prioritize programs that do not align with their core functions or interests. Numerous proposals aim to enhance civilian authority and institutions in national security. Proposals to enhance civilian authority and institutions in national security include increasing State Department capacity, transferring some functions elsewhere, creating new structures for missions abroad, establishing interagency task forces, enhancing regional presence, and increasing personnel capacity. Obama Administration reforms involve creating new bureaus for conflict and stabilization operations and counterterrorism, establishing regional hubs, supporting military commands, and increasing civilian personnel. Plans to enhance Chief of Mission authority are also being discussed. The Secretary of State lacks authority, personnel, and budget to effectively carry out foreign policy responsibilities, especially in key areas like counterterrorism, security assistance, and stabilization. Congress has provided more authority and resources to the Department of Defense in these areas. The State Department lacks authority and resources for missions, while the Department of Defense has been provided with the necessary resources. Recommendations have been made to enhance the State Department's ability to lead interagency missions, particularly in search and rescue operations. The Obama Administration elevated the status of two State Department offices to coordinate interagency efforts. The Obama Administration created a new Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) Bureau and a Counterterrorism Bureau after consulting with Congress. Some analysts doubt the State Department's ability to effectively oversee missions due to its core diplomatic mission shaping recruitment and promotion criteria. They believe restructuring, personnel increases, or additional resources won't overcome this barrier. Some argue for new agencies or arrangements to manage conflict prevention and missions effectively. Suggestions include creating new structures at national, regional, and field levels, independent of existing departments and agencies, to enhance coordination and response capacity. Interagency task forces and improved regional arrangements are also proposed for better adaptability to emerging situations. Some proposals recommend creating new structures or agencies for conflict prevention and overseas missions. Suggestions include redistributing responsibilities, enhancing USAID's role, and even creating an independent S&R agency accountable to either the Secretary of State or the NSC. The Contingency Operations Oversight and Interagency Enhancement Act of 2011 proposes creating a new independent entity, the United States Office for Contingency Operations, to streamline decision-making and enhance interagency cooperation for overseas missions. This new office would absorb functions, personnel, and assets from various agencies like S/CRS, USAID, and DOD. Creating new agencies or structures may be costly and lead to unintended consequences and bureaucratic infighting. Many may prefer proposals to improve civilian coordination through enhanced interagency teams, which are seen as ad hoc mechanisms lacking information on their functionality. Some view these teams as flexible but hindering structural and capacity changes needed for enduring interagency cooperation. Resistance to sharing responsibilities, personnel, and resources may impede their success. Many proposals aim to enhance regional structures and capacity, either by improving military Geographic Combatant Commands or creating new civilian arrangements. Analysts believe that the US needs better integration of civilian and military resources for effective decision-making on regional issues. The focus has been on enhancing the Military Geographic Combatant Commands, with the creation of the U.S. Africa Command in 2008 as a model for interagency organization. The creation of the U.S. Africa Command in 2008 set the standard for civilian integration into military geographic commands. Efforts have been made to enhance civilian input into GCCs, with suggestions from RAND and the American Academy of Diplomacy. However, there are doubts about attracting enough civilian personnel for the level of interagency integration envisioned for AFRICOM. The Obama Administration pledged support for GCCs by providing senior Ambassador-ranked personnel as civilian deputies and USAID high-level development advisors. Some analysts suggest creating new civilian regional structures to enhance interagency integration with military commands. The Obama Administration plans to establish \"regional hubs\" in embassies for personnel dedicated to regional programs. The Obama Administration plans to establish \"regional hubs\" in embassies for personnel dedicated to regional programs, aiming to improve State Department and USAID's ability to think and act regionally. These hubs will offer cost savings and enhance regional communication among bilateral posts. Additionally, a new State Department \"regional forum\" will be created to coordinate regional initiatives and proposals. Some recommendations include reviewing and augmenting civilian personnel authorities and capacity for State Department and USAID personnel. The Obama Administration's \"Diplomacy 3.0\" hiring plan aims to increase State Department and USAID personnel to emulate DOD's practice of having a sufficient excess capacity for interagency education and training. This includes establishing regional hubs in embassies and creating a State Department \"regional forum\" to coordinate initiatives. The State Department aims to have a 15% float for the Foreign Service Officer corps, similar to the U.S. military. Improving Chief of Mission capacity is crucial for effective interagency coordination and foreign policy conduct. Enhancing an Ambassador's authority, capacity, and control over funding is seen as essential for diplomacy and foreign assistance. Enhancing the authority and capacity of U.S. Ambassadors is crucial for effective interagency coordination and foreign policy conduct. This step is viewed as an alternative to creating new structures and is relatively recent. Steps such as selecting Ambassadors with interagency experience and providing adequate training in interagency matters are also important for improving their capacity. Standardizing education and training for potential Ambassadors and vetting candidates for skills in interagency collaboration are seen as necessary advancements. Enhancing Ambassadors' authority over interagency resources is crucial for effective foreign policy conduct. Proposals to increase COM authority over budgets and personnel may face resistance. Some question if attention to interagency reform at the COM level is sufficient, as many issues require regional or global attention. A unique option is to expand COM authority as \"mission managers\" to lead interagency teams. Skepticism remains on whether new authorities or structures alone can overcome agency interests without proper support. The Obama Administration plans to strengthen Ambassadors' authority and expertise within the State Department. The 2010 QDDR highlights Ambassadors as CEOs of multi-agency missions, emphasizing their key role in foreign policy and assistance. The administration aims to improve the knowledge and skills of COMs to enhance their performance. The Obama Administration aims to enhance Ambassadors' authority and expertise within the State Department, emphasizing their role as CEOs of multi-agency missions. The QDDR highlights the importance of integrating civilian agencies' expertise into country strategies under Chief of Mission authority. Secretary of State Clinton has announced that Chiefs of Mission will play a role in integrating strategic plans and budgets at the country level. Implementing this proposal may face bureaucratic challenges but is expected to clarify roles, empower effective leaders, and strengthen relationships with foreign counterparts. The proposal aims to empower good leaders with commensurate authority to be more effective in interagency national security missions abroad. It could address gaps in civilian regional authority and provide an alternative to appointing \"czars\" or lead agencies. However, some analysts argue it may add bureaucratic pressures and be seen as \"adhockery\" in the national security system. The current interagency personnel system lacks incentives for civilian personnel to engage in interagency missions, hindering collaboration and coordination. Agencies prioritize their core missions over interagency activities, leading to difficulties in attracting personnel from other agencies. Some analysts believe agencies do not reward interagency work in personnel evaluations and promotions, leading to disincentives. Cultural differences between agencies can also complicate collaboration, with varying operational cultures affecting task suitability. Training and incentives could potentially change agency cultures over time. Some analysts believe that training and incentives can change agency cultures over time for interagency missions. Efforts to assist personnel in understanding other agencies' cultures are seen as important interim steps. Proposals for personnel reform aim to establish shared knowledge, skills, vision, and trust for effective interagency performance, with the 1986 \"Goldwater-Nichols\" Act serving as a model for necessary reforms. The Reorganization Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-433) created incentives for officers to gain joint experience, promoting inter-service cooperation and a \"joint\" military culture. Some suggest similar legislation for civilian personnel to link interagency education and training to job qualifications and rewards. Congress could mandate changes in civilian personnel systems by providing funds for additional education and training, interagency rotations, and increases in personnel. This could mirror the military's approach of maintaining full strength for core missions while allowing for periods of education and training. Suggestions include establishing new schools, increasing interagency coursework, and creating a national interagency professional corps or senior executive service. The Obama Administration is advancing the National Security Professional Development program to expand interagency education, training, and rotations. Legislation before Congress, the Interagency Personnel Rotation Act of 2011, aims to increase opportunities for interagency experience. Proposals include establishing a National Interagency Professional Corps, Cadre, Career Track, or Executive Service. Proposals for changes in the personnel system include establishing a national security corps or cadre to enhance interagency missions. These proposals may be costly and face bureaucratic challenges, but some suggest building on the existing National Security Professional Development program. The National Security Professional Development program was established in 2007 by the Bush Administration to enhance interagency education, training, and rotations for personnel with national security functions. However, the program faced stagnation due to various reasons such as sporadic leadership, lack of authority, unclear roles, poor communication, lack of funding, and metrics for evaluation. Critics doubt the effectiveness of agency-centric efforts in overcoming resource allocation and cultural issues. President Obama directed the NSC's National Security Staff to \"reinvigorate\" the program. The National Security Professional Development program was established in 2007 to enhance interagency education and training. The Obama Administration launched a second iteration focusing on interagency cooperation in Emergency Management. Related proposals suggest creating a special interagency career track within agencies and departments to enhance interagency missions. This career track would consist of specially trained personnel who can effectively coordinate activities and represent their agencies. However, funding and bureaucratic resistance may pose challenges to implementing this proposal. Proposals for creating a senior executive interagency leadership cadre of personnel versed in interagency missions may require new institutional arrangements and budgets to ensure effectiveness. Establishing separate budget lines for interagency missions can prevent funds from being taken away from core functions. Linking interagency education, training, and experience to job qualifications and promotions is similar to changes in the military personnel system mandated by the Goldwater-Nichols Act, which has been successful in improving military missions. Opportunities for civilian personnel to improve military missions may not include structural changes like the development of inter-service Combatant Commands. Analysts question if current education and training opportunities are enough to create cohesive interagency units and promote interagency relations at the field level. Enhancing interagency education, training, and professional experience is crucial for improving interagency missions. Suggestions include expanding opportunities, requirements, and incentives, protecting interagency personnel during political transitions, and creating new education and training institutions or incorporating new courses into existing ones. Several U.S. government institutions have already increased interagency coursework. Some U.S. government institutions have expanded interagency coursework, but there are calls for further curriculum development at all institutions, including tapping into state and private educational offerings."
