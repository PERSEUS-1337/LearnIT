The Congress finds a significant decline in 18-year-olds with bank accounts since 2007 and a high percentage of Americans not paying bills on time. There is a strong belief in the need for financial education in high schools, but a lack of teachers teaching financial literacy. Only a few states have adopted financial literacy curriculum, and many adults rate their personal finance knowledge poorly. In 2011, 76 percent of adults admitted they need more financial advice. Two in five are saving less than a year ago. Most feel their financial literacy is inadequate but don't rely on others for help. Immediate response is needed for financial stability, along with long-term education reform. There is an urgent need for research-based financial literacy education programs to reach individuals of all ages and socioeconomic levels, including high school graduates, college graduates, young families, and military personnel. Parents talk to their teens about credit, but many teens report not receiving this guidance. Most high school students do not have a budget, and a significant percentage of 16 to 18-year-olds feel unprepared financially. Seventy-five percent of 16 to 18-year-olds prioritize learning about budgeting and money management. Early financial education leads to a \"snowball effect\" of increased likelihood for further financial education. High school and college students benefit from cumulative financial education, resulting in improved financial knowledge and responsible behavior. Parents recognize their teens as \"quick spenders\" and acknowledge the need to better prepare them for financial challenges. According to a 2012 report, 93% of teens are not involved in paying household bills or managing the budget, with 46% admitting they don't know how to create a budget. Young adults aged 23-28 believe that managing money better is crucial. The Government Accountability Office emphasizes the importance of financial literacy for individuals and the country's economic health, especially after the recent financial crisis highlighted the need for improved financial education.
