    "content": "The Act titled \"Transitional Medical Assistance Improvement Act of 2001\" revises and simplifies the Transitional Medical Assistance Program (TMA). The Transitional Medical Assistance Improvement Act of 2001 offers the option of continuous eligibility for 12 months by making reporting requirements optional for states. States may waive some or all notice and reporting requirements. The State has the option to waive reporting requirements under certain clauses, allowing for extended eligibility for low-income individuals for up to 12 additional months. The State may offer up to 12 months of extended eligibility to families receiving assistance for a 6-month period under certain conditions. The State may provide up to 12 months of extended eligibility to families if their average gross monthly earnings do not exceed 185 percent of the official poverty line for a family of their size. The extension rules apply similarly to the initial 6-month period. The State may extend eligibility for up to 12 months if family earnings are below 185 percent of the poverty line. The rules for extensions mirror those for the initial 6-month period. Medicaid receipt can be waived for 3 of the previous 6 months to qualify for TMA. The text discusses the elimination of the sunset provision for TMA and a CMS report on enrollment and participation rates under TMA. The new subsection (g) requires each State to collect and report enrollment and participation rates for adults and children under this section to the Secretary. The Secretary will then submit annual reports to Congress based on this information. The Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will coordinate with the Assistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families to provide guidance on ensuring access to transitional medical assistance. States that extend coverage to children and parents up to 185 percent of poverty may opt out of certain provisions under this section. \"A State may meet requirements for medical assistance if it provides coverage to families earning at or below 185 percent of the poverty line.\" The text chunk discusses the requirement for states to provide written notice to families losing TANF but still eligible for medical assistance. If a family's aid under part A or E of title IV is terminated, the state must inform them of their ongoing eligibility for medical assistance. The text chunk discusses the extension of outstationed workers to accept applications for transitional medical assistance under certain sections of the Act, with effective dates specified for the amendments made. The final regulations for the amendments made by this Act have been issued. The effective date for subsection (g) is 6 months after enactment. States needing legislation to meet the new requirements won't be penalized before the first quarter after the state legislature's session following the Act's enactment. In the case of a State with a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session of the State legislature."
