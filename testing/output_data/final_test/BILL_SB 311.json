    "title": "SB 311",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Article 7.6 of the Education Code adds a section for the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District's Individualized Eligibility Part-Day Preschool Subsidy Plan. The terms \"school district\" and \"preschool program\" are defined within this article. The state-funded part-day preschool program in the school district may develop an individualized eligibility part-day preschool subsidy as a pilot project in consultation with relevant agencies. The subsidy plan for children in the school district attending preschool aims to address local needs, prepare children for kindergarten and grades 1-12, increase access to preschool, provide supplemental services, and offer parent education and support. The school district must develop an individualized eligibility part-day preschool subsidy plan in consultation with preschool programs and the Santa Clara Office of Education. Eligibility for the preschool program is based on free or reduced-price meals eligibility. Children up to the age of admission into kindergarten shall be allowed to participate in the preschool program. The plan and any modifications must be approved by the Santa Clara County Local Child Care Planning Council and the Early Education and Support Division of the department. Upon approval by the school district's governing board, the plan shall be submitted for review. Upon approval of the plan or modifications, the Early Education and Support Division will review and either approve or disapprove them. Disapproval can only occur for non-conformance with the article or conflict with federal law. Once approved, the school district, in consultation with relevant parties, will prepare and submit an annual report summarizing the pilot project's success to the Legislature and the department. The approved pilot project plan must demonstrate an increase in enrollment of eligible children for free meals by the end of the first fiscal year and a 3% increase in the percentage of eligible children by the end of the second fiscal year. The approved pilot project plan aims to increase child enrollment in child development services under a California state preschool program by 3% by the end of the first fiscal year. The school district and preschool program will submit a final report to the Legislature by December 31, 2020, with recommendations on whether the pilot project should become a permanent program. The preschool program may implement an individualized eligibility part-day subsidy plan as a pilot project until June 30, 2021. After this date, the school district will terminate the plan and follow state requirements for subsidized part-day preschools. Children enrolling after June 30, 2021, will not be part of the pilot project and will adhere to existing state laws. Information sharing between the school district and preschool program will comply with federal privacy laws. No additional state funds will be allocated for implementing this program. The article will be in effect until January 1, 2023, unless extended or repealed by a later statute. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District due to unique circumstances, focusing on increasing pupil achievement and parent engagement by offering preschool services. This act is an urgency statute to preserve public peace, health, or safety and will go into immediate effect. It aims to eliminate barriers for families to access state preschool by preventing unnecessary paperwork past the August start date of the 2015-16 school year."
