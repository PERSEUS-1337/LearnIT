    "content": "A proposal for a \".xxx\" domain on the Internet for sexually explicit websites is being debated, with some suggesting it be voluntary and others wanting it to be mandatory. The focus is on whether a mandatory separate domain would violate the First Amendment. Congress has already established a \".kids\" domain for child-friendly content. The proposal for a \".xxx\" domain for sexually explicit websites was initially deferred in August 2005 by ICANN due to protests. Despite revival and public comment in 2007, ICANN ultimately rejected the proposal in March 2007. ICANN rejected the proposal for a \".xxx\" domain in March 2007 but approved a plan in June 2008 for virtually unlimited top-level domains. The plan has specific criteria for disallowing names and is expected to take effect in early 2009. Support and opposition to the proposal exist within both the pornography industry and among opponents of pornography. The proposal for a .xxx domain has faced criticism and support. Critics argue it would legitimize the pornography industry, while supporters believe it would help filter unwanted content. Senator Joe Lieberman supports the idea for easier content filtering, while some pornographers back the proposal for better U.R.L.'s. Others fear it could lead to industry isolation on the web. Opponents of pornography also have concerns. Some opponents of the proposal for a voluntary \".xxx\" domain argue that it would make porn more easily accessible. Two bills have been introduced to create a mandatory \".xxx\" domain for material harmful to minors, with specific definitions provided. These bills direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish the new domain. The constitutionality of a mandatory \".xxx\" domain is being considered without focusing on any specific proposal or bill. The proposal for a mandatory \".xxx\" domain for sexually explicit material is being questioned for potentially discriminating against speech based on content. The Supreme Court typically requires strict scrutiny for content-based speech regulations to be permissible. The Supreme Court requires strict scrutiny for content-based speech regulations to be permissible. Regulations that are content-neutral and serve a substantial governmental interest stand a better chance of being found constitutional. For example, requiring sexually explicit material to be under a separate domain name may not discriminate against speech based on content if the purpose is not to protect people from harm. The curr_chunk discusses the justification for a requirement to categorize websites into those with sexually explicit material and those without it, similar to zoning regulations for \"adult\" movie theaters. The purpose is to facilitate the use of filters by parents or librarians when children access the Internet, focusing on secondary effects rather than the content of the speech. The proposal to categorize websites with sexually explicit material into separate domains aims to protect minors by creating virtual \"neighborhoods\" in cyberspace. This approach, similar to zoning regulations for adult movie theaters, focuses on preventing secondary effects like minors accessing inappropriate content without parental approval. However, unlike zoning ordinances in Renton, the effects targeted by the proposal are directly related to the viewing of regulated speech. The \".xxx\" proposal aims to protect minors from viewing sexually explicit material online by creating separate domains. This approach differs from zoning regulations for adult movie theaters as it targets the direct effects of viewing regulated speech. The proposal imposes a burden on speech based on Congress deeming it harmful, which may not be a sufficient basis for government regulation affecting adults without meeting strict scrutiny. The \".xxx\" proposal may be viewed as a content-based regulation that must pass strict scrutiny or a content-neutral regulation that must advance a substantial governmental interest. The Supreme Court has emphasized the need for strict scrutiny when regulating protected speech based on its content. The \".xxx\" proposal could be seen as compelling speech by requiring websites with sexually explicit material to use a separate domain name. Compelling speech is unconstitutional, similar to censoring speech, except in commercial contexts. In Meese v. Keene, the Court upheld compelled disclosure in a noncommercial context under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, requiring labeling of foreign \"political propaganda\" with specific information. One agent objected to the term \"political propaganda\" as pejorative when wanting to exhibit Canadian films without the required labels. In Meese v. Keene, the Supreme Court upheld compelled disclosure of foreign \"political propaganda\" without labels on Canadian films about nuclear war and acid rain. The Court considered the term not necessarily pejorative and stated that compelled disclosure in a noncommercial context does not raise serious First Amendment issues. This decision contrasts with the Court's later ruling in Riley, which did not mention Meese v. Keene. The Court's holding in Meese v. Keene upheld compelled disclosure of foreign \"political propaganda\" without labels on Canadian films, contrasting with later rulings in cases like Riley. The Court did not mention previous cases where laws compelling speech in a noncommercial context were struck down. The \".xxx\" proposal could be seen as discriminating based on content, potentially facing constitutional challenges. However, citing Meese v. Keene, it could be argued that the proposal is constitutional as it does not restrict distribution but requires additional disclosures for evaluation. If viewed as content-based, it would be subject to strict scrutiny for constitutionality. The Supreme Court applies \"strict scrutiny\" to laws restricting minors' access to sexual material, requiring a compelling interest and least restrictive means. The Court assumes a compelling interest in denying minors access to pornography and focuses on the least restrictive means in evaluating statutes. The Court found that the Child Online Protection Act (CDA) suppresses adult speech to protect minors from harmful content. The \".xxx\" proposal suggests using a separate domain name for explicit content, but the Court questions if there are less restrictive alternatives. One alternative could be making the separate domain name voluntary. The \".xxx\" proposal suggests using a separate domain name for explicit content, with the possibility of making it voluntary. This alternative could be effective in targeting websites based in the United States, where mandatory use may not be feasible due to jurisdictional limitations. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 is mentioned as an existing alternative to the \".xxx\" proposal. It allows parents to block websites not under the \"dot kids\" domain, potentially limiting access to non-sexually explicit material. However, it may not be as effective as the \".xxx\" proposal in denying access to explicit content. The \"Dot Kids\" statute could be a more effective alternative to the \".xxx\" proposal, allowing parents to block both foreign and domestic websites. A court would likely find the \".xxx\" proposal to serve a \"compelling\" interest, meeting the test of serving a \"substantial\" interest. The proposal would not restrict protected speech but would require posting under a separate domain name. The \".xxx\" proposal may not restrict communication avenues unless users choose to block websites with the separate domain name. It is likely to be constitutional under less-than-strict scrutiny, but criminal penalties could affect its constitutionality. The Supreme Court's decision in Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, striking down the Communications Decency Act of 1996, considered the imposition of criminal penalties as a factor. The constitutionality of the \".xxx\" proposal may be affected by criminal penalties, as seen in the Supreme Court's decision in Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union. The proposal's application to websites with predominantly pornographic material or any material deemed pornographic could also impact its constitutionality. The constitutionality of the \".xxx\" proposal may be challenged if it defines websites too vaguely, potentially deterring sites from posting sexually explicit material for non-pornographic purposes. This could violate due process by not clearly outlining what is prohibited. The constitutionality of the \".xxx\" proposal may be challenged based on its potential vagueness, which could inhibit constitutionally protected rights like free speech or association. The outcome of such a challenge would depend on whether a court applies strict scrutiny or content-neutral scrutiny."
