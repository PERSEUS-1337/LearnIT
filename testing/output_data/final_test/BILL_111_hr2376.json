Congress finds that the United Nations Human Rights Council fails to adequately reform the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which has lost credibility in upholding human rights ideals and allowed repressive regimes to avoid criticism for violations. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights included countries with poor human rights records and failed to address atrocities and terrorism sponsorship, while unfairly targeting Israel. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights unfairly targeted Israel, overlooking human rights abuses in other countries. Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan stressed the need for reform to improve the UN's credibility. The creation of the UN Human Rights Council in 2006 did not address these issues. The United Nations Human Rights Council, established in 2006, failed to address serious shortcomings in the UN Commission on Human Rights. It did not create the envisioned standing body of appropriate countries and only made superficial changes, lacking necessary institutional reforms to advance human rights monitoring globally. The United Nations Human Rights Council, established in 2006, did not effectively prevent human rights abuses worldwide or stop violators from being elected to the council. The council's limited protection measures, such as reducing seats to 47 from 53 and retaining geographical quotas, allow human rights abusers to maintain membership, including countries like Israel. The United States opposed the creation of the United Nations Human Rights Council due to concerns about its structure and ability to promote human rights effectively. Israel faced discrimination by being denied full participatory rights in regional group meetings, while nonmembers like the Holy See and the Palestinian observer were allowed to participate. The geographic quota system favored less democratic regions in membership slots. Efforts to reform the council with like-minded countries were deemed necessary to combat corruption. The United States and like-minded countries are concerned about the corrupt United Nations Human Rights Council and its ability to bring about necessary reforms. The first group of Member States elected to the council includes countries designated as \"not free\" by Freedom House, such as China, Cuba, and Russia. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 2. The United Nations Human Rights Council should uphold ideals of the UN Charter and Universal Declaration on Human Rights, allow Israel's full participation, and consist of countries with democratic elections and freedom of expression. The US should not support the Council or provide financial aid until meaningful reforms are implemented for human rights protection. The Secretary of State will withhold a portion of the US contribution to the United Nations' biennial budget to prevent support for the United Nations Human Rights Council, effective from October 1, 2009."
