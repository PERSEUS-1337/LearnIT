    "content": "This report provides updated information on interstate shipment of municipal solid waste (MSW), addressing concerns about waste imports and state regulations. Federal courts have deemed state restrictions on waste importation unconstitutional, stating that congressional action is necessary for states to have such authority. Congress has considered bills granting this authority since the late 1980s but has not enacted any. The report presents data gathered from solid waste officials in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The report provides data on interstate shipment of municipal solid waste, gathered from solid waste officials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Ontario. The data includes information on waste imports and exports, with some states providing estimates due to incomplete reporting requirements. The data on interstate waste shipments shows a rise in total imports, totaling 42.2 million tons in the current survey. This accounts for 17% of the 245.7 million tons of municipal solid waste generated in the United States in 2005. EPA estimates that 79.0 million tons of municipal solid waste were recycled or composted, leaving 166.7 million tons disposed of. In 2005, 166.7 million tons of municipal solid waste were disposed of in landfills or incinerators, with 25.3% crossing state lines for disposal. Imports of waste increased by 3.2 million tons (8%) from the previous report, with a 147% increase since 1995. Pennsylvania remains the largest waste importer, receiving 7.9 million tons of MSW and 1.7 million tons of nonhazardous waste from out of state in 2005. In 2005, Pennsylvania received 7.9 million tons of municipal solid waste and 1.7 million tons of nonhazardous waste from out of state, representing 39% of all solid waste disposed in the state and 19% of the national total for interstate MSW shipments. Despite being a major waste importer, Pennsylvania's MSW imports decreased for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 due to factors like new state fees on waste disposal. Pennsylvania imposed a fee of $7.25 per ton of waste disposed, leading some haulers to dispose elsewhere. New York City is shipping waste by rail, diverting some to Virginia's landfills. Virginia has seen a 45% increase in waste imports since 2001, attempting to restrict imports but facing challenges due to interstate commerce laws. Michigan and Virginia have faced challenges with waste imports due to interstate commerce laws. Michigan, the third-largest waste importer, receives significant amounts of waste from neighboring states and Ontario, Canada. Ontario's waste shipments to Michigan have increased as Toronto closed its landfills and awarded new waste disposal contracts. In 2006, Toronto closed its last two landfills and reached an agreement with Michigan to stop shipping waste by 2010. Ontario will purchase a landfill near London, Ontario for waste disposal. The Ontario government approved a letter of intent to purchase a landfill near London, Ontario to phase out waste shipments to Michigan. The agreement with Michigan Senators does not eliminate the majority of waste shipped, as it only covers \"municipally managed waste\" based on a 2005 baseline amount. Private haulers still ship two-thirds of Ontario's waste to Michigan due to cost and contractual reasons. The provincial government and local governments in Ontario cannot stop private waste shipments from leaving the province. Eleven states reported importing over 1 million tons of waste per year, with Indiana seeing a significant increase. Additionally, 20 states imported over 100,000 tons of waste. Several states, including Wisconsin, New York, and Ohio, reported major increases in waste imports. The Great Lakes states, including Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois, saw a significant increase in waste imports, totaling 3.65 million tons. New Jersey remains a major importer and exporter of waste, with 1.7 million tons imported and 5.8 million tons exported. The absence of flow control in New Jersey has led to increased waste exports over the last decade. Waste-to-energy facilities in New Jersey have started importing MSW to replace local waste, resulting in a large amount of waste entering the state from New York. The Supreme Court upheld flow-control ordinances in the United Haulers case, indicating that some forms of flow control can withstand legal challenges. While New Jersey officials do not anticipate significant impacts on waste exports or imports, Alabama experienced a notable decrease in imports in 2005. Imports to Alabama have fluctuated, with a substantial decline in 2005 followed by a rebound in 2006. Additionally, ten other states reported declines in waste imports, with most decreases being relatively small. Transfer stations in urban areas have less regulation than disposal facilities, leading to concerns about heavy truck traffic and odors in neighboring communities. Some states like Connecticut, Rhode Island, and South Carolina import out-of-state waste to transfer stations before exporting it for disposal. New York City's plan to export waste to New Jersey sparked controversy. Eleven states and the District of Columbia exported over 1 million tons of waste to other states in the latest reporting period. In the latest reporting period, 21 states exported over 100,000 tons of waste to facilities in other states. Ontario exported nearly 4 million tons of waste, mostly to Michigan. New York's waste exports decreased by over a million tons to 7.2 million tons, while New Jersey's exports remained steady at 5.8 million tons. Illinois saw the largest growth in exports, more than doubling to 4.4 million tons, mainly from Cook County. Illinois has reported a significant increase in landfill capacity since 1995, with Chicago being located near the borders of Indiana and Wisconsin. Ten states and Ontario saw waste exports increase by over 100,000 tons each, with Minnesota and Florida showing the largest increases. Twenty-one states were net importers, while 24 states plus D.C. were net exporters. Thirty-eight states had net imports or exports exceeding 100,000 tons, with 22 exceeding 500,000 tons. In 2005, 25 states both exported and imported over 100,000 tons of municipal solid waste, indicating regional differences in disposal capacity. Illinois serves as an example, with the Chicago area exporting waste while downstate Illinois imports waste from neighboring states. This movement reflects the regionalization and consolidation of the waste industry. The waste industry has seen consolidation with the three largest firms accounting for a majority of revenues. Regionalization and waste shipment across state lines are increasing as small landfills close. The report includes data on waste import and export by state. The report includes data on waste export destinations, import amounts, and state agency contacts for more information."
