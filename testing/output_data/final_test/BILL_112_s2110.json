    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Northern Cheyenne Land Consolidation Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that in 1877, the United States forcibly relocated members of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe from Montana to Oklahoma. Despite great hardship and loss of life, the Tribe walked back to Montana to reclaim their ancestral homeland. In 1884, President Arthur established a 371,200-acre reservation for the Tribe, known as the Tongue River Indian Reservation, which included tracts occupied by non-Indian settlers. In 1898, Indian Inspector James McLaughlin was sent by Congress to southeastern Montana to address hostilities between the Northern Cheyenne and non-Indian settlers. In 1900, President McKinley expanded the Tongue River area as recommended by McLaughlin. President McKinley expanded the Tongue River Indian Reservation to include land from the Crow Indian Reservation to the middle of the Tongue River. Congress allocated funds to purchase settler land, claims, and Northern Pacific Railway land within the expanded reservation, as well as to relocate 46 Northern Cheyenne families. However, McLaughlin failed to purchase tracts held by the Northern Pacific Railway within the expanded Northern Cheyenne Reservation. In the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, McLaughlin neglected to purchase the subsurface rights of the Railway in 8 sections totaling approximately 5,000 acres. The subsurface rights are currently owned by Great Northern Properties and constitute the only subsurface within the Reservation not owned by the Tribe. The Tribe asserts claims against the United States for failing to acquire the subsurface rights as directed by Congress. In 2002, the Tribe sued the Secretary over proposed conveyances of Federal coal tracts to the State. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe asserts claims against the United States for neglecting to purchase subsurface rights within the Reservation. The Tribe withdrew a 2002 lawsuit against the United States based on commitments for legislation addressing impacts of coal development. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe will waive legal claims against the United States if conveyances of mineral rights are carried out, addressing impacts of coal development. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Cheyenne tracts\" refers to a 5,000-acre land located in the eastern portion of the State within the boundaries of the Reservation, as depicted on a specific map dated April 7, 2010. The term \"Federal tracts\" refers to approximately 4,500 acres of land located in the State outside the Reservation boundaries. These tracts are depicted on a map titled \"Federal Coal Land Conveyance\" dated November 30, 2011. The \"Federal Coal Land Conveyance\" dated November 30, 2011, includes land in the \"Bridge Creek\" and \"Bull\" areas, with specific details of the sections and parcels within each area. The \"Bull Mountains\" area consists of specific land parcels in T. 6 N., R. 27 E., including sections 4, 8, 10, 14, and 22. The term \"Great Northern Properties\" refers to the Great Northern Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, and any successor to its ownership interest. The curr_chunk provides definitions for key terms used in the document, including Reservation (referring to the Northern Cheyenne Reservation), Secretary (referring to the Secretary of the Interior), Signal Peak Energy (referring to Signal Peak Energy, LLC), State (referring to the State of Montana), and Tribe (referring to the Northern Cheyenne Tribe). The curr_chunk focuses on mineral rights conveyances. The Secretary will oversee the conveyance of mineral interests and coal rights between Great Northern Properties, the Tribe, and Signal Peak Energy. The transactions must be completed within 60 days of receiving all necessary notifications. Great Northern Properties and the Tribe have agreed on a revenue sharing formula for coal produced from Federal tracts. Great Northern Properties and Signal Peak Energy have agreed on terms for the lease of coal in the Federal tracts. Bonus payments for coal leases will be retained by the United States. The mineral interests underlying the Cheyenne are protected. The mineral interests underlying the Cheyenne tracts conveyed to the Tribe are immune from State taxation. In exchange for the mineral conveyances and termination of Federal leases, the Tribe, Great Northern Properties, and Signal Peak Energy waive various legal claims against the United States. The Secretary or Great Northern Properties may rescind mineral conveyances if invalidated by a Federal court, with waiver of the Tribe considered rescinded. Strip mining in Bull Mountains Federal tracts prohibited after completion of mineral conveyances. In subsection (a), coal under Bull Mountains Federal tracts described in section 3(2)(E)(ii) cannot be strip mined. SEC. 5. SYSTEMATIC SUBSIDENCE EVALUATION REPORT. Signal Peak Energy must prepare a report every two years on the effects of subsidence in Federal tracts after mineral conveyances are completed. The report should include subsidence monitoring data, details on cracking, fissures, erosion, and landslide risks. Signal Peak Energy must report on subsidence effects in Federal tracts every two years, including monitoring data, surface hazards for humans, livestock, and wildlife, and the accuracy of predictive subsidence models. Reports must be submitted to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality for public inspection. SEC. 6. ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER FEDERAL BENEFITS.\n\nNo benefits under this Act shall reduce or deny Federal services to the Tribe or its members based on their status as a federally recognized Indian tribe. \n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nSums necessary to implement this Act are authorized to be appropriated."
