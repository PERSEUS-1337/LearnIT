    "content": "National security letters (NSL) are similar to administrative subpoenas, issued by intelligence agencies to gather information from various institutions. Several bills in the 111th Congress proposed changes to NSL authority, including H.R. 1800, H.R. 3845, H.R. 3969, S. 1686, H.R. 4005, S. 1692, and S. 2336. Several bills in the 111th Congress proposed changes to National Security Letters (NSL) authority, including S. 1692 and S. 2336. The Senate Judiciary Committee sent an amended version of S. 1692 to the floor on October 13, 2009, while the House Judiciary Committee reported out an amended version of H.R. 3845 on December 16, 2009. The Feingold/Holt bill aimed to repeal one NSL statute immediately, the Leahy bill sought to repeal a section by December 31, 2013, and the Conyers bill aimed to return all NSL statutes to their pre-USA PATRIOT Act form by the same date. The Nadler bill aimed to repeal the NSL created by the USA PATRIOT Act, while the Leahy bill addressed other national security issues. The Feingold/Holt and Conyers bills also focused on related law enforcement issues. The Reyes bill mirrored the nondisclosure and judicial review features of the Leahy bill. The Sessions bill, S. 2336, addressed Foreign Intelligence Act provisions and judicial review provisions for NSL secrecy orders. Prior to the USA PATRIOT Act, there were four NSL statutes. The FBI can request customer information from communications providers for foreign counterintelligence investigations, with specific criteria to be met for different types of records. The FBI can request customer information from financial institutions and credit reporting agencies for foreign counterintelligence investigations, with specific criteria to be met for different types of records. The FBI can request customer information from financial institutions and credit reporting agencies for foreign counterintelligence investigations, based on specific criteria for different types of records. Section 802 of the National Security Act expands the scope of potential recipients for information, requiring consumer reports, financial information, and records from various agencies and institutions for federal employees with access to classified information. Section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Act expanded the FBI's NSL authority, allowing SACs to issue NSLs without the need for specific facts linking to a foreign power. It required information to be relevant to national security investigations and prohibited investigations solely based on First Amendment activities. The Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL was added by section 358(g) of the USA PATRIOT Act. The USA PATRIOT Act added a new Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL section 627, requiring consumer reporting agencies to provide consumer information to federal agencies for investigations related to international terrorism. The NSL statutes were amended in 2005 and 2006, despite originally being set to expire after five years. The NSL statutes were amended in 2005 and 2006 to add judicial enforcement mechanisms, penalties for non-compliance with nondisclosure requirements, and clarify that the requirements did not have an open-ended nondisclosure provision. The NSL statutes were amended in 2005 and 2006 to add judicial enforcement mechanisms, penalties for non-compliance with nondisclosure requirements, and clarify that the requirements did not have an open-ended nondisclosure provision. The Department of Justice Inspector General reports in 2007, 2008, and 2010 were critical of the FBI's use of NSLs, noting a significant increase in requests and a majority used to investigate Americans. The 2007, 2008, and 2010 Department of Justice Inspector General reports criticized the FBI's increased use of NSLs, with a focus on investigating Americans. The reports highlighted the use of NSLs to obtain telephone toll billing records and subscriber information in counterterrorism cases. This information helped identify individuals with frequent contact with the investigative subject, leading to investigations into potential terrorist cells in the same vicinity. The FBI used ECPA NSLs to obtain telephone toll billing records, electronic communication transactional records, and subscriber information to support FISA orders. RFPA NSL statute also provided access to bank transaction records, which was useful in a counterterrorism investigation involving convenience store owners sending funds to suspected Al Qaeda affiliates for possible money laundering and other violations. The FBI used national security letters to investigate various crimes such as money laundering, fraud, and sale of illegal substances. Bank account records of convenience store owners revealed money transfers to suspicious individuals. The Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL statutes provided valuable information for counterterrorism investigations. The FBI used National Security Letters (NSLs) to gather information on investigative subjects' activities, finances, and potential white-collar crimes. The information obtained from NSLs was used to determine the need for further investigation, generate leads for other agencies, and support FBI analytical reports and databases. However, the report criticized the FBI for using NSLs in violation of statutes and guidelines initially. The FBI issued over 700 exigent letters to obtain information without following the ECPA NSL statute, circumventing requirements and violating guidelines. The report found significant NSL-related violations were not being reported as required. The FBI's misuse of NSL authority circumvented legal guidelines and internal policies, with over 300 NSLs initiated without effective review. 60% of files examined showed violations of internal control policies, and the FBI did not retain signed copies of NSLs. There was a lack of clear guidance on the application of investigative techniques standards, and SAC supervision made attorneys reluctant to question approved investigations. No indication of criminal conduct was found in the FBI's misuse of NSL authority. Prior to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Supreme Court ruled that customers had no Fourth Amendment privacy rights in telephone records. Exigent circumstances can relax Fourth Amendment requirements like probable cause and a warrant. For example, officers may enter a building without announcing their purpose if there is a threat of evidence destruction. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) prohibits communication service providers from disclosing customer records without exceptions like a grand jury subpoena or National Security Letter (NSL). Violating this prohibition can lead to civil liability. The FBI was found to have obtained telephone records using \"exigent letters\" before serving NSLs or subpoenas, despite claims to the contrary. The FBI used \"exigent letters\" to obtain telephone records before serving NSLs or subpoenas, despite claiming not to use them. The FBI can request emergency disclosures under 18 U.S.C. 2702(c)(4) if immediate danger is involved. The Justice Department advised that ECPA may allow voluntary disclosure of call detail records to the FBI under certain circumstances. The second IG Report reviewed the FBI's use of national security letter authority in 2006, noting an increase in NSL requests from investigations of U.S. persons. The FBI and DoJ have made progress in addressing compliance issues with NSLs, but it is too early to determine if new systems will fully eliminate problems. The third IG Report examined the FBI's use of exigent letters and informal means to acquire customer records from communication service providers from 2003 to 2007. The FBI's use of exigent letters became casual and unsupervised, with employees sometimes generating letters for FBI personnel to sign. Proximity between providers and FBI offices led to sneak peeks, providing a preview of information for targeted phone numbers without documentation. The FBI's use of informal means to acquire customer records from communication service providers from 2003 to 2007 was widespread and often done without proper legal process. This included sneak peeks at telephone records without justification, violating FBI guidelines and Department policy. The FBI used exigent letters inaccurately, but took appropriate action to stop their use. NSL recipients are only bound to secrecy if disclosure may endanger national security, diplomatic relations, or investigations. A recipient of a National Security Letter (NSL) may disclose the request to comply with it and seek legal advice. They must inform necessary parties of secrecy requirements and disclose to the requesting agency. The recipient can petition the court to modify or lift the secrecy requirement within a year of issuance, with limitations on resubmitting rejected requests. The court can modify or lift the restriction if disclosure does not endanger national security, personal safety, or interfere with investigations. The federal courts have authority to review and set aside NSL nondisclosure requirements. Recipients can petition the court to modify or set aside an NSL if compliance would be unreasonable, oppressive, or otherwise unlawful. Compliance with NSLs may be unduly burdensome in some situations. The federal courts have authority to review and set aside NSL nondisclosure requirements, with the ability to modify or set aside an NSL if compliance is deemed unreasonable, oppressive, or unlawful. Failure to comply with the court's order is punishable as contempt of court, and breaching confidentiality requirements with intent to obstruct an investigation can result in imprisonment for up to five years. The Second Circuit has determined that NSL procedures must include notice to recipients, expeditious judicial review, government burden of proof, and annual recipient review. The district upheld a nondisclosure order under this procedure. Three provisions for foreign intelligence investigations expired in 2011, but NSL provisions did not. The NSL provisions did not expire in 2011 like other intelligence investigations. Various bills proposed different sunset dates for NSL statutes, with some aiming to return them to pre-USA PATRIOT Act form. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded authority under existing laws and created new NSL provisions. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded NSL authority under existing laws, including the Right to Financial Privacy Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It allowed FBI field office heads to issue NSLs, removed the requirement for specific facts linking to a foreign power, and focused on national security investigations. Reverting to pre-USA PATRIOT Act laws would eliminate these changes. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded NSL authority, allowing FBI field office heads to issue NSLs without specific facts linking to a foreign power. Reverting to pre-USA PATRIOT Act laws would require NSL approval from the FBI Director or senior official based on specific facts related to national security investigations. The \"specific and articulable\" facts standard for NSLs originated from counterintelligence investigations but may not always apply well in counterterrorism cases. Unlike traditional linear counterintelligence cases, counterterrorism cases involve more frequent and secure communication methods between foreign agents and domestic spies. Counterterrorism cases involve complex networks with a larger volume of communication and financial transactions, making it difficult to meet the \"specific and articulable facts\" standard. The language prohibiting NSL-related investigations based solely on First Amendment rights may have disappeared, but it is unclear if the First Amendment itself includes a similar prohibition. Congress amended NSL statutes at the first sunset of USA PATRIOT Act provisions. The USA PATRIOT Act provisions were sunset, leading to amendments in the NSL statutes. These amendments include grounds for secrecy requirements, rights to disclosure to attorneys, and judicial review. The impact of reverting to pre-USA PATRIOT Act state may not be as significant as expected. The government must prove the validity of gag orders under NSL statutes to the court. Legislative proposals reinforce recipient protections under section 3511. The USA PATRIOT Act's NSL statute, section 627, provides extensive information to various requesters. Repealing it could enhance oversight by centralizing NSL issuance authority in the FBI. The FBI has authority to issue NSLs, with difficulty in distinguishing between different statutes. NSL statutes have nondisclosure provisions to protect national security. The least intrusive statute pertains to federal employees who consent to disclosure. The FBI can issue NSLs with nondisclosure provisions to protect national security. A federal district court can modify or set aside a NSL secrecy requirement if it poses no danger or interference. The Second Circuit ruled that NSL provisions must pass First Amendment scrutiny. The Nadler, Conyers, Reyes, Feingold/Holt, Leahy, and Sessions bills aimed to modify NSL nondisclosure order provisions, with a focus on judicial review. The bills proposed different approaches, such as allowing the agency issuing the NSL to determine nondisclosure and seeking judicial approval. The Nadler bill suggested a 30-day disclosure ban before applying for a nondisclosure order from the court. The Leahy, Reyes, Sessions, and Conyers bills proposed maintaining existing criteria for imposing nondisclosure orders, while the Nadler and Feingold/Holt bills aimed for a higher threshold and narrower range of adverse consequences to justify nondisclosure. The six bills proposed measures to address witness intimidation, with varying requirements for obtaining court approval of nondisclosure provisions. The Nadler bill included a 30-day preliminary nondisclosure requirement, while the Feingold/Holt bill allowed for judicial review if nondisclosure was deemed appropriate. The bills proposed measures for addressing witness intimidation, with different requirements for obtaining court approval of nondisclosure provisions. Recipients had 21 days to request judicial review, after which they would be bound by nondisclosure for up to a year if they did not. The agency had 21 days to petition the court for review if judicial review was requested. The bills required the agency to notify recipients of their right to judicial review within 30 days of a request, and to provide a statement of facts justifying nondisclosure to avoid adverse consequences. The Nadler and Feingold/Holt bills proposed measures to address national security concerns, personal safety, and interference with investigations. The Feingold/Holt bill required applicants to justify the need for secrecy orders and recommend when they should expire. The Feingold/Holt bill proposed limiting secrecy orders to no more than a year, while the Nadler and Conyers bills suggested a limit of 180 days. Unlike other bills, the Leahy, Reyes, and Sessions bills did not specify a maximum duration for gag orders or allow for judicial review after a certain period. They only stated that recipients could petition for judicial review without a time limit. The Conyers, Feingold/Holt, Leahy, and Sessions bills did not change existing law regarding judicial review of National Security Letters (NSLs), but they would have required NSLs to include information about the recipient's right to seek judicial review. The Nadler bill proposed a provision that seemed to replace existing law without explicitly amending it. The Nadler proposal aimed to modify NSL provisions for judicial review, requiring specific facts supporting relevance to national security investigations. The Conyers bill also sought specific facts demonstrating reasonable grounds for information sought related to foreign powers or agents. The Feingold/Holt bill proposed certification of specific facts supporting the belief that information pertained to suspected foreign agents or individuals in contact with them, while the Leahy and Reyes bills required a written statement of facts supporting the relevance of the information sought. The Nadler bill and the Feingold/Holt bill aimed to restrict NSL demands that were deemed unreasonable or privileged compared to a grand jury subpoena duces tecum. Minimization standards govern the acquisition, maintenance, access, and disclosure of information within capturing agencies, considering the purposes, authority, interests, and governmental goals involved. Minimization standards regulate the acquisition, maintenance, access, and disclosure of information within capturing agencies, aligning with statutory limitations. For instance, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) imposes strict procedures for authorizing electronic surveillance or physical searches in national security contexts, with oversight mechanisms in place. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act mandates the creation of minimization procedures to safeguard private information in line with U.S. foreign intelligence interests. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act required reports on the feasibility of NSL minimization procedures to protect the constitutional rights of US persons. The Inspector General highlighted the need for clear guidance on minimizing the use of NSLs in national security investigations due to the lack of formal standards. The FBI generates a high volume of NSLs each year, with collected information retained in databases accessible to authorized law enforcement personnel. A working group was formed by the Justice Department to study NSL minimization standards, but final guidance is still pending. Various bills proposed minimization components, such as statutory limitations and instructions for Justice Department guidelines. The Leahy, Feingold/Holt, and Conyers bills aimed to direct the Attorney General to establish minimization procedures within 180 days, similar to the FISA definition. The Reyes bill proposed a 90-day deadline for procedures related to national security letters, while the Feingold/Holt bill emphasized the return or destruction of private information not relevant to foreign intelligence. The Nadler bill proposed procedures for the return or destruction of private information obtained through NSLs that did not comply with the statute. It also required the Attorney General to establish minimization procedures within 90 days to minimize the retention of private information of U.S. persons. Additionally, the bill included provisions for the disclosure of NSL-generated information, following guidelines similar to those in FISA. The proposed procedures for NSL-generated information included prohibited disclosure except for lawful purposes, required Attorney General approval for use in criminal proceedings, and provided opportunities for suppression based on legal grounds. The Conyers bill and Feingold/Holt bill proposed stricter guidelines for the use of NSL information in criminal proceedings, requiring prior approval from the Attorney General and establishing a statutory least intrusive means standard. The current Attorney General's guidelines already emphasize using the least intrusive method feasible in FBI intelligence investigations. The FBI had used \"exigent letters\" and \"certificate letters\" to bypass NSL requirements, potentially invoking voluntary disclosure provisions in some cases. Proposed bills aimed to amend section 2702 to limit disclosure exceptions to imminent or immediate risks of death or serious injury. The Feingold/Holt bill proposed adding a provision to the Right to Financial Privacy Act for disclosure of customer records in cases of imminent risk. NSL statutes require periodic reports to Congressional committees, and the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act mandated annual reports on NSL issuance. Sessions and Reyes bills did not expand the annual statistical report. The Leahy, Reyes, and Conyers bills aimed to expand the annual statistical report on NSLs issued, including a breakdown of targets and Inspector General audits.
