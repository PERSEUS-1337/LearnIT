    "content": "President Bill Clinton and King 'Abdullah II announced negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement between the United States and Jordan in June 2000. Three rounds of negotiations led to the signing of the FTA in October 2000. King 'Abdullah expressed his desire to conclude the negotiations quickly during a summit meeting in Egypt. The U.S. and Jordan completed negotiations for a free trade agreement in October 2000. The agreement was signed and awaits approval from the U.S. Congress and Jordanian parliament for it to come into force. Jordan is set to become the fourth country with a bilateral free trade agreement with the United States, pending approval from the U.S. Congress and Jordanian parliament. Previous FTAs were with Canada, Mexico (NAFTA), and Israel. The U.S.-Israel FTA was approved by Congress in 1985, leading to a significant increase in bilateral trade. The U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement was amended in 1996 to include goods from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, aiming to support the Palestinian economy and peace process. Bilateral trade between the U.S. and Israel increased from $4.7 billion to over $20.7 billion by 2000. The U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement was amended in 1996 to include goods from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. By 2000, the United States directly imported $4.8 million of Palestinian goods. Palestinian exports to the United States may be understated due to Israel's role in intermediating trade. P.L. 104-234 granted the President authority to extend the FTA to cover products from qualifying industrial zones between Israel and Jordan, and Israel and Egypt, promoting Arab-Israeli economic cooperation. Egypt has not expressed interest in participating in the QIZ program, as it involves Arab-Israeli economic cooperation that Egypt prefers to engage in only after a comprehensive regional peace. Some analysts suggest Egypt as a potential candidate for a free trade agreement with the United States, with some Members of Congress supporting this idea. In the early 1990s, Congress did not provide significant assistance to Jordan due to its refusal to join the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq. However, after Jordan and Israel made progress in their peace process, there was potential for a Middle East Free Trade Region including Israel, the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, and Egypt. This idea was supported by some Members of Congress. After the 1990-1991 Gulf War, Congress and the Clinton Administration took steps to benefit the Jordanian economy following the Washington Declaration and peace treaty with Israel. Initiatives included increased economic and military assistance, debt forgiveness, and establishing qualifying industrial zones. The primary motivation was to provide Jordan with a 'peace dividend' to show the benefits of peace to the population. In recent years, Congressional interest in the Jordanian economy has focused on foreign assistance and debt forgiveness. President Clinton promised to forgive Jordan's debt to the United States after the Washington Declaration. Congress provided subsidy appropriations in FY1994 and FY1995, forgiving around $700 million of Jordanian debt. Additional military and economic assistance was increased starting in FY1996. In FY1999 and FY2000, $300 million was earmarked for Jordan in supplemental appropriations for the Israeli-Palestinian Wye River Memorandum. This funding was provided to support Jordan's role in mediating the agreement and to help it withstand opposition. Table 1 summarizes U.S. assistance and debt forgiveness to Jordan since FY1993, including economic and military assistance. Debt forgiveness amounted to $702.3 million of Jordanian debt. Additional funding was provided in FY1999 and FY2000 to support Jordan's role in mediating agreements and withstand opposition. In addition to foreign assistance and debt forgiveness, Congress has also supported joint Jordanian-Israeli economic ventures through the Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ) program. Established in 1996, this program allows products with a certified minimum content of Jordanian and Israeli inputs manufactured in designated zones to have duty-free access to the U.S. market. The United States Trade Representative has designated ten QIZs in Jordan, boosting exports to the U.S., promoting partnerships, job creation, and FDI. Some Members of Congress considered negotiating a U.S.-Jordan FTA after the 1994 Washington Declaration. After King Abdullah II made the U.S.-Jordan FTA a priority, Congressional interest was rekindled. Over 45 Members of Congress urged President Clinton to enter negotiations for an FTA with Jordan, citing reasons such as strengthening bilateral relations and expressing appreciation for Jordan's role in the Middle East. The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was supported by Members of Congress to promote economic growth, regional cooperation, and counter-terrorism efforts. Bipartisan groups urged President Clinton to conclude negotiations for the FTA, with Democrats expressing strong support and commitment to passing the implementing bill in the 107th Congress. President Clinton submitted the U.S.-Jordan FTA to the 107th Congress on January 6, 2001. The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on the FTA on March 20, and Senator Max Baucus introduced a bill (S. 643) to implement the FTA on March 28. The bill was approved by the Senate Finance Committee on July 26. On July 26, the Senate Finance Committee approved S. 643 and the House Ways and Means Committee approved H.R. 2603, implementing the U.S.-Jordan FTA. Approval came after letters were exchanged pledging to resolve any differences between the two countries. The House and Senate approved H.R. 2603, implementing the U.S.-Jordan FTA, with a focus on resolving differences without formal dispute settlement procedures. Senator Phil Gramm warned against using this agreement as a model for future trade agreements regarding worker rights. The U.S.-Jordan FTA was seen as a model for future trade agreements addressing worker rights and environmental issues. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus hoped it would set a precedent for such agreements. The Clinton Administration supported the FTA as a catalyst for economic growth in Jordan. The U.S.-Jordan FTA was seen as a model for future trade agreements focusing on economic growth in Jordan and regional peace. The USTR emphasized the link between economic growth and peace, highlighting the potential for a peaceful and prosperous Middle East. President Clinton and King 'Abdullah initiated negotiations for the FTA, with the USTR officially notifying the intent to conclude the agreement shortly after. The USITC was tasked with studying the economic impact of the FTA on the U.S. economy. The USITC conducted an investigation on the economic impact of a U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, concluding that it would have no measurable impacts on U.S. exports, imports, production, or employment. The study was completed and released to the public in 2000. The USITC predicted an increase in U.S. exports to Jordan in three sectors: cereals (excluding wheat) by 14%, electrical machinery by 104%, and machinery/transportation equipment by 39%. They also mentioned a potential rise in U.S. imports of textiles and apparel from Jordan. The overall impact of the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement on the U.S. economy was deemed negligible, but it could lead to a modest increase in bilateral trade. The USTR is conducting an environmental impact study related to the FTA. The environmental impact study of the U.S.-Jordan FTA responds to a new U.S. commitment to factor environmental considerations into trade negotiations. This is seen as a response to criticisms of the environmental effects of U.S. trade policy during the WTO talks in Seattle. Many are interested in the U.S.-Jordanian negotiations as they could set a model for future U.S. trade strategies on environmental issues. The USTR released a draft environmental review of the proposed U.S.-Jordan FTA, stating that it would not have significant environmental effects in the United States. Comments were solicited from private sector corporations and associations on the objectives for the negotiations, with twenty filing public comments. Private sector corporations and associations expressed support for the U.S.-Jordan FTA, with a focus on textile and apparel products. U.S. textile and apparel companies showed interest in the agreement, as these sectors could be a significant area of growth for Jordanian exports to the United States. Some textile manufacturers, like BCTC Corporation and members of AAMA, have invested in Jordan's QIZs to expand textile and apparel access to the U.S. market. Supporters urge adopting U.S.-Israel FTA rules-of-origin in U.S.-Jordan FTA. Concerns exist that increased Jordanian access may harm U.S. textile and apparel manufacturers and workers. The American TextileManufactures Institute (ATMI) urged the USTR to apply NAFTA 'rules-of-origin' standards to the U.S.-Jordan FTA, which could impact Jordanian exports of textiles and apparel to the United States. Pharmaceutical and motion-picture interests also raised concerns about protecting intellectual property rights in the FTA. The USTR received public comments on the U.S.-Jordan FTA, including requests for zero-level tariffs on specific commodities and support for environmental standards. The AFL-CIO supported core environmental standards, while the US Council for International Business opposed their introduction. The United States Council for International Business opposes environmental standards in the U.S.-Jordan FTA, preferring bilateral agreements. The USTR plans to negotiate labor standards within the FTA, receiving comments from various organizations. Women's Edge and AFL-CIO support including core international labor standards, while the US Council for International Business disagrees. The Jordanian government also seeks input on environmental aspects of the FTA. The Jordanian private sector provided comments on the environmental aspects of the U.S.-Jordan FTA. The Jordanian negotiating team incorporated these comments into a separate environmental review of the agreement, identifying potential positive and negative consequences. Positive impacts include expanded agricultural imports reducing water demand, while negative impacts include increased trade. Increased trade under the U.S.-Jordan FTA may lead to more solid waste and maritime traffic in the Gulf of Aqaba, posing risks to the Red Sea ecosystem. The Jordanian private sector is enthusiastic about the FTA, expecting increased foreign direct investment across various sectors. The U.S.-Jordan FTA is expected to expand trade across various sectors, but concerns exist about increased U.S. imports impacting Jordan's manufacturing sector. Some worry about potential trade shifts away from neighboring countries. Despite this, prominent Jordanian private sector figures have welcomed and endorsed the FTA signed on October 24, 2000. The U.S.-Jordan FTA, signed on October 24, 2000, provides for a 10-year transitional period to phase out duties on goods, leading to duty-free trade between the two countries. Interested parties can consult the full text of the agreement for further details. The U.S.-Jordan FTA, signed in 2000, includes a 10-year transitional period to phase out duties on goods and liberalize bilateral trade in services. Specific market-opening commitments were made in various service sectors. The agreement also addresses Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) by obligating both countries to adhere to WIPO multilateral agreements and provide protections for trademarks, copyrights, patents, and software. The U.S.-Jordan FTA includes provisions for the protection of trademarks, copyrights, and patents, with a focus on software and pharmaceuticals. It enforces IPRs with high fines to deter infringement and specifies the timeline for implementation. A Memorandum of Understanding with Jordan increases criminal penalties for IPR infringement to prevent future violations. The U.S.-Jordan FTA includes provisions for environmental protection, stating that each party should not relax domestic environmental laws to encourage trade. It also emphasizes the enforcement of environmental laws to prevent any impact on trade. A Joint Statement on Environmental Technical Cooperation establishes a forum for collaboration on environmental issues. The Joint Forum on Environmental Technical Cooperation under the U.S.-Jordan FTA aims to advance environmental protection in Jordan through agreed initiatives, in line with the country's strategic plan and policy initiatives. Additionally, the FTA reaffirms obligations to the International Labor Organization and its principles. The FTA between the United States and Jordan emphasizes the importance of not relaxing domestic labor laws to encourage trade. Each party is required to uphold their own labor standards and enforce labor laws effectively to avoid impacting trade. Additionally, the agreement aims to maintain the practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions. The FTA between the United States and Jordan includes safeguard measures to address serious injury to domestic industries, with a maximum duration of 4 years. It also recognizes challenges faced by \"infant industries\" during trade liberalization. Additionally, a Joint Committee is established under the agreement. The FTA between the United States and Jordan includes safeguard measures and establishes a Joint Committee for reviewing the agreement, settling disputes, and seeking advice from NGOs. Dispute settlement procedures are outlined in the agreement. The United States and Jordan have established a dispute resolution process through consultations, Joint Committee, and a three-person panel. If disputes are not resolved, the affected Party can take appropriate measures. Additionally, a Memorandum of Understanding on Transparency in Dispute was signed. The United States and Jordan signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Transparency in Dispute Settlement, requiring public input in dispute resolution. Bilateral trade between the two countries in the 1990s remained steady, ranging from $275 million to nearly $430 million annually. Jordan was ranked as the United States' 98th largest trading partner in 2000. In 2000, bilateral trade between the United States and Jordan totaled approximately $385 million, with U.S. exports accounting for around 80% of this amount. The trade relationship has been largely one-sided, with the United States enjoying a significant trade surplus. In 2000, the United States exported cereals like durum wheat, wheat, and barley to Jordan, totaling $62 million and making up 20% of total U.S. exports. These commodities entered Jordan duty-free due to the sensitivity of food pricing in the country. Food prices have been a contentious issue in Jordan since the government reduced food subsidies as part of its reform program. The United States began lowering food subsidies in Jordan as part of its reform program. The free trade agreement is expected to have a minimal impact on U.S. cereal exports to Jordan, as tariffs are already zero. Other U.S. exports to Jordan face low to moderate tariffs, with some exceptions like smoking tobacco, which faces a high tariff that was not negotiated for removal. In 2000, U.S. imports from Jordan totaled $73 million, accounting for 20% of total bilateral trade. The top ten commodities imported from Jordan to the United States in 2000 are listed in Table 4, along with tariff rates and staging categories for tariff elimination under the Free Trade Agreement. Approximately 40% of Jordanian exports entered the U.S. duty-free through the qualifying industrial zones program. Approximately 40% ($30 million) of Jordanian exports entered the U.S. duty-free under the QIZ program in 2000. An additional 14% ($10 million) received preferential access through the GSP program. Leading exports to the U.S. included textiles, apparel, suitcases, briefcases, and jewelry, with half benefiting from QIZ status and all jewelry exports benefiting from the GSP program. In 2000, Jordanian exports to the U.S. benefited from the QIZ program and GSP program, with jewelry exports specifically benefiting from GSP. Tariff reductions on tobacco products were not negotiated due to the Doggett Amendment. The curr_chunk discusses restrictions on the marketing of tobacco products and U.S. imports from Jordan in 2000. It also mentions the elimination of duties in stages for certain products entering the U.S. duty-free. The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement eliminates duties in stages for certain products entering the U.S. duty-free. The agreement is unlikely to have a large impact on Jordanian exports to the United States, but the textile and apparel sector shows growth potential. In 1994, textiles and apparels were Jordan's second leading industrial export. The textile and apparel sector in Jordan has grown significantly since 1994, becoming a key part of the manufacturing industry. Many multinational firms have relocated operations to Jordan, but only a few qualify for QIZ status, leading to substantial tariffs on exports to the United States. An FTA between the US and Jordan could potentially increase non-QIZ textile and apparel exports to the US and boost foreign direct investment in Jordan. A U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement could significantly increase foreign direct investment in Jordan, with multinational companies potentially relocating operations to take advantage of duty-free access to the U.S. Some U.S. companies may also shift purchases to Jordanian suppliers to reduce production costs. The QIZ program has already attracted FDI to Jordan, and a similar pattern could occur on a larger scale with an FTA. U.S. direct investment in Jordan has been limited in recent years. In 1999, U.S. FDI in Jordan increased to $30 million, up from $15 million in 1995, possibly due to U.S. textile and apparel manufacturers investing in the al-Hassan Industrial Park QIZ in Irbid, Jordan. Jordan remains a rare destination for U.S. FDI in the Middle East, representing less than 0.3% of total U.S. FDI in the region in 1999. The U.S. and Jordan negotiated to stimulate bilateral investment flows. The United States and Jordan negotiated a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) to protect U.S. investments abroad and support international law standards regarding foreign investment. President Clinton sought Senate advice and consent for ratification of the U.S.-Jordan BIT in 2000. Jordan, under King 'Abdullah's leadership since 1999, has prioritized economic reform. Structural adjustments, including harmonizing GST rates, amending customs laws, and protecting intellectual property rights, were made for WTO membership in 2000. Tariff reductions and privatization of public sector companies have also been implemented. Jordan's accession to the WTO was supported by the Senate in October 2000. Jordan's economic reforms, including privatization and trade agreements, have been supported by King 'Abdullah's leadership. Accession to the WTO and a potential FTA with the United States could further boost economic reforms and strengthen bilateral relations. This could also shift Jordan's trade focus towards the United States and away from Iraq. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Jordan and the United States could reduce Jordan's reliance on Iraq as a major trading partner. Increased foreign direct investment and exports from the FTA could lead to job creation and economic growth, potentially boosting support for the peace process in Jordan and demonstrating the economic benefits of peace to other countries in the region. The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement has economic implications for Jordan and the United States. Various reports and investigations have been conducted to assess the impact of the agreement, including on environmental and economic aspects. The agreement could potentially reduce Jordan's reliance on Iraq as a trading partner and lead to job creation and economic growth. The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement has economic implications for both countries. Various reports have been conducted to assess the impact, including on environmental and economic aspects. The agreement could reduce Jordan's reliance on Iraq as a trading partner and lead to job creation and economic growth. The agreement is supported by public comments received by USTR."
