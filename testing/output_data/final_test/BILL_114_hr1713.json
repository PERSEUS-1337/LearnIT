The Act excludes student loan payment assistance from gross income for qualified employees who contribute at least $50 per month. The assistance is limited to $6,000 per year. The Act allows employers to provide student loan payment assistance to employees, with the exclusion from income not exceeding the employee's earned income for the year. A student loan payment assistance program must meet specific requirements outlined in the subsection. The student loan payment assistance program must not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees and must benefit employees who qualify under a non-discriminatory classification set by the employer. Additionally, not more than 25 percent of the assistance can be provided to principal shareholders or owners. The program does not require funding and eligible employees must be notified of its availability. The employer must provide a statement of expenses to employees by January 31st, showing amounts paid for student loan assistance. The plan must not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees and must benefit those who qualify under non-discriminatory classification. The paragraph discusses the requirement for average benefits provided to employees who are not highly compensated to be at least 55 percent of those provided to highly compensated employees under all plans of the employer. Salary reduction agreements may exclude employees with compensation less than $25,000. Compensation is defined by section 414(q)(4) unless determined otherwise by the employer. The text discusses requirements for employer plans to provide fair compensation without discrimination, direct contributions to lenders, and matching contributions for employee contributions. Definitions and special rules are outlined, including student loan payment assistance. The term 'student loan payment assistance' refers to paying principal or interest on indebtedness incurred by an employee for qualified higher education expenses. This includes education expenses paid within a reasonable timeframe before or after the debt was incurred, and for education received while the employee was an eligible student. Refinanced indebtedness is also covered. The term 'eligible student' refers to a student who meets the requirements of the Higher Education Act of 1965 for any academic period. It excludes payments related to indebtedness owed to a related person or under certain qualified employer plans. The Education Act of 1965 defines terms like 'dependent,' 'earned income,' 'employee,' and 'employer.' Earned income excludes employer-paid student loan assistance. An employee includes self-employed individuals, and an employer is an individual with full ownership interest. The Education Act of 1965 defines terms related to employment, including 'employer' as an individual with full ownership interest in a business. A partnership is considered the employer of each partner who is an employee. Ownership rules for stock and unincorporated businesses are outlined in the Act.

The deduction for student loan payments matched by an employer is limited to $6,000 annually and $50,000 lifetime. The amendments apply to taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
