    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Defend America Act of 1996\". Congress finds that the United States has the technology to develop effective defensive systems against limited ballistic missile threats, but has not deployed them. The proliferation of ballistic missiles poses a significant and growing threat to national security, with countries like North Korea, Iran, Libya, and Iraq showing interest in acquiring missiles capable of reaching the United States. The Intelligence Community of the United States has confirmed that North Korea is developing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching Alaska or beyond. It is prudent to commence a national missile defense deployment effort before new ballistic missile threats are confirmed. The United States should deploy a national missile defense system to reduce the proliferation of missiles and weapons of mass destruction, address concerns about accidental or unauthorized missile attacks, and move away from the adversarial offense-only approach to strategic deterrence currently in place with Russia. The deployment of a national missile defense system is crucial for reducing missile proliferation, enhancing strategic stability, and moving towards defensive deterrence. This transition away from Cold War attitudes and towards defensive capabilities is in the interest of all countries. The ABM Treaty allows for adjustments based on changes in the strategic situation. Articles XIII and XIV of the treaty provide a mechanism for amending the treaty, which has been utilized in the past. Article XV allows a party to withdraw from the treaty with six months notice in case of extraordinary events. Previous discussions between the United States and Russia included proposals to amend the ABM Treaty to allow for additional ground-based interceptor sites and sensor deployment in space. The United States aims to deploy a National Missile Defense system by the end of 2003 to defend against limited ballistic missile attacks and transition to a regime that promotes strategic stability. The system will be enhanced over time to counter more advanced threats. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop an affordable and effective National Missile Defense system by the end of 2003. The system will include interceptor systems and ground-based radars to defend against ballistic missile attacks on the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii. The National Missile Defense system will include fixed ground-based radars, space-based sensors like the Space and Missile Tracking System, and Battle management, command, control, and communications (BM/C3). The National Missile Defense system will implement a national missile defense system. The Secretary of Defense must promptly initiate preparatory actions to meet the initial operational capability date, conduct an integrated systems test by the end of 1998, use streamlined acquisition policies to reduce costs, and develop an affordable national missile defense follow-on program. The Secretary of Defense must develop an affordable national missile defense follow-on program that leverages and augments the national missile defense system to provide a layered defense. The Secretary of Defense is required to report on a plan for the development and deployment of a national missile defense system. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress by March 15, 1997, detailing the plan for a national missile defense system. The report should include the system architecture selected for development and justification, as well as the estimated appropriations needed for fiscal years 1997 through 2003 to achieve operational capability. The report to Congress by the Secretary of Defense must include a cost and operational effectiveness analysis of follow-on options to improve the effectiveness of the national missile defense system, a determination of potential conflicts with the ABM Treaty, and an estimate of the time needed to meet the operational capability date specified in section 4(a). SEC. 7. POLICY REGARDING THE ABM TREATY. Congress urges the President to pursue discussions with Russia to amend the ABM Treaty for the deployment of the national missile defense system. If an agreement is reached, it must be presented to the Senate for approval. No funds can be used to implement the amendment unless done in a treaty-like manner. If no agreement is reached within a year, actions will be taken. If an agreement is not reached within one year, the President and Congress may consider withdrawing the United States from the ABM Treaty in consultation with each other. SEC. 8 of the Act defines the ABM Treaty as the agreement between the US and USSR on limiting Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems signed in 1972, including the Protocols signed in 1974. If no agreement is reached within a year, the President and Congress may consider withdrawing from the treaty."
