    "content": "Congress uses an annual appropriations process through 12 subcommittees to provide discretionary spending for federal agencies. The process requires all regular appropriations bills to be enacted before the fiscal year begins on October 1. Continuing resolutions may be used if deadlines are not met, and supplemental appropriations can be enacted during the fiscal year. During the fiscal year, supplemental appropriations may be enacted to provide funds in addition to regular appropriations acts or CRs. Amounts in appropriations acts are subject to limits enforced through mechanisms like points of order and sequestration. Disagreement over discretionary spending levels significantly affected the FY2016 appropriations process, with limits generally less than 1% higher than in FY2014 and FY2015. The President proposed raising both defense and nondefense limits in the FY2016 budget submission. The President proposed raising defense and nondefense limits in the FY2016 budget submission. A congressional budget resolution assumed FY2016 discretionary spending at the level allowed by the limits at that time but also allowed additional spending, which was ultimately resolved through the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. This Act raised both defense and nondefense statutory discretionary spending limits for FY2016 and FY2017. The House and Senate have been considering FY2016 appropriations bills, with six bills passed in the House and all 12 bills reported from committee in the Senate. The Senate rejected a motion to proceed to the Department of Defense appropriations bill. The Senate rejected a motion to proceed to the Department of Defense appropriations bill (H.R. 2685). However, they agreed to consider and passed the Military Construction-VA appropriations bill on November 10. The Senate is currently considering the Transportation-HUD appropriations bill (H.R. 2577) and a CR was enacted to provide continuing appropriations until December 11 (H.R. 719; P.L. 114-53). This report provides background and analysis of congressional action related to the FY2016 appropriations process, including discretionary budget enforcement, regular appropriations bills, and updates on the status of FY2016 appropriations measures. For more information, refer to the CRS Appropriations Status Table: FY2016. The budget enforcement framework for discretionary spending includes statutory limits from the Budget Control Act of 2011 and procedural elements related to the budget resolution. Certain spending is exempt from these limits under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established spending limits for FY2016, with adjustments mainly for OCO/GWOT budget authority. Disagreements over discretionary spending levels and distribution between defense and nondefense activities have impacted the FY2016 appropriations process. The President proposed revisions to the spending limits in his FY2016 budget request. The FY2016 budget resolution establishes enforceable limits on discretionary spending related to the BCA limits. Table 2 compares initial, revised, and proposed limits for FY2016 with those of FY2014 and FY2015. The BCA sets separate limits for defense and nondefense spending, with procedures to lower initial limits. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) lowers initial spending limits for each fiscal year, announced in a \"preview report\" with the President's budget. If discretionary spending exceeds limits, the BCA requires sequestration with across-the-board cuts. OMB evaluates spending and enforces sequestration if necessary, with the first evaluation for FY2016 within 15 days after the 2015 congressional session adjourns. The BBEDCA sets preconditions for adjusting statutory spending limits to accommodate OCO/GWOT-designated funds. If funds are not designated as such, the limit will not be adjusted, potentially leading to higher spending than the limit and triggering sequestration. Appropriations acts with OCO/GWOT spending typically include provisions for designation by Congress and the President. The BBEDCA sets conditions for adjusting spending limits to accommodate OCO/GWOT funds. The FY2016 limits for defense and nondefense spending were reduced initially but proposed to be raised by similar amounts in the President's budget submission. The President's FY2016 budget proposal includes increases to defense and nondefense spending limits, with the defense limit raised by $37.909 billion and the nondefense limit by $36.509 billion. Other proposed changes aim to offset these increases. OCO/GWOT spending requested is $57.996 billion, a decrease from FY2015 levels. The congressional budget resolution assumes different discretionary spending levels. The budget resolution includes procedural contingencies for legislation that could alter spending limits. OCO/GWOT spending under the resolution is $96.287 billion, an increase from previous levels. The BBA 2015 raised defense and nondefense spending limits for FY2016 by $50 billion. The BBA 2015 increased spending limits by $50 billion, divided equally between defense and nondefense. Procedural elements of budget enforcement are guided by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, with committees receiving allocation limits for discretionary budget authority. This process includes 302(a) allocations and 302(b) suballocations to divide the budget authority among subcommittees. The 302(b) suballocations act as caps on appropriations bills, can be revised by the Appropriations Committee, and enforced through points of order. The FY2016 budget resolution set 302(a) allocations consistent with BCA levels, including a separate allocation for OCO/GWOT spending. The most recent 302(b) suballocations for discretionary spending were reported. The most recent 302(b) suballocations of discretionary spending for the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees totaled $96.287 billion. These suballocations were initially reported in April and May 2015, with subsequent revisions made in July and November after the enactment of the BBA 2015. Additional revisions may occur to reflect increases to defense and nondefense limits. The House and Senate provide annual appropriations in 12 regular bills, which can be enacted separately or combined into an omnibus vehicle. The House has reported all 12 bills for FY2016, with six passed, while the Senate has reported and passed one bill. Funding for projects may be provided through a full-year CR if bills are not enacted. The House and Senate have reported all 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2016, with six passed in the House and one passed in the Senate. The Transportation-HUD appropriations bill (H.R. 2577) has not completed consideration. Energy-Water (H.R. 2028) and Military Construction-VA (H.R. 2029) were the first bills approved in subcommittee and reported to the House on April 24, 2015. Two other bills, Legislative Branch (H.R. 2250) and Transportation-HUD (H.R. 2577), received committee consideration in April but were not reported until later. During May and June, the House Appropriations Committee reported on various appropriations bills for FY2016, including Commerce-Justice-Science, Department of Defense, State-Foreign Operations, and Interior. In July, the committee concluded its consideration by reporting out Agriculture and Homeland Security bills, bringing the total number of bills acted on to 11. The House Appropriations Committee reported on various FY2016 appropriations bills, including Agriculture (H.R. 3049) and Homeland Security (H.R. 3128). Six regular appropriations bills were passed by the House, with Military Construction-VA (H.R. 2029) and Energy-Water (H.R. 2028) being the first considered. A total of 104 amendments were offered, with 58 adopted, and the bills were passed later that week. The Legislative Branch appropriations bill (H.R. 2250) was considered on May 19. The House passed the Legislative Branch appropriations bill (H.R. 2250) on May 19 with three specified amendments. In the following weeks, the House considered and passed three appropriations measures under modified open rules. The Commerce-Justice-Science bill (H.R. 2578) was passed on June 3, followed by the Transportation-HUD bill (H.R. 2577) on June 9, and the DOD bill on June 11. A total of 233 amendments were offered, with 124 adopted during this period. The House began considering the Interior bill (H.R. 2822) on June 25 but did not finish amending the bill before the Fourth of July district work period. The House resumed consideration on July 7 but halted the following day after adopting 57 out of 116 offered amendments. No further floor consideration of regular appropriations bills has occurred. The Senate Appropriations Committee also began considering FY2016 regular appropriations bills. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported several bills in May and June, including Energy-Water, Military Construction-VA, Department of Defense, and Homeland Security. In July, they completed consideration of FY2016 regular appropriations by reporting State-Foreign Operations, Agriculture, and Financial Services bills. The Senate passed one regular appropriations bill, Military, after initiating consideration. The Senate voted on the final passage of the Military Construction-VA appropriations bill (H.R. 2029) after considering 17 amendments, with 16 being adopted. The bill passed by a vote of 93-0 on November 10, 2015. Additionally, the Senate also considered the Transportation-HUD appropriations bill. The Senate considered the Transportation-HUD appropriations bill, with multiple motions and amendments being made. Cloture motions were filed and withdrawn, with no further progress reported as of the date of the report. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on two FY2016 regular appropriations bills: 1. Department of Defense (H.R. 2685) and 2. Energy-Water (H.R. 2028) despite multiple attempts. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed by a vote of 49-47 for FY2016 regular appropriations bills. A continuing resolution (H.R. 719) was enacted on September 30, 2015, extending funding at last year's levels through December 11, 2015. Senate legislative action related to FY2016 continuing appropriations occurred on a different legislative vehicle, H.J.Res. 61. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered an amendment to H.J.Res. 61 for temporary FY2016 continuing appropriations through December 11, 2015, with provisions regarding Planned Parenthood funding. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on the amendment, and no further action was taken. On September 24, Majority Leader McConnell proposed a Senate amendment (S.Amdt. 2689) to a different measure (H.R. 719) and filed cloture. The amendment included temporary FY2016 continuing appropriations through December 11 but did not include Planned Parenthood-related provisions. The Senate invoked cloture on the motion to concur with S.Amdt. 2689 on September 28 by a vote of 77-19 and adopted it on September 30 by a vote of 78-20. On September 30, the Senate and House concurred on the motion to adopt temporary FY2016 continuing appropriations through December 11. The budgetary effects of the interim CRs are estimated by the Congressional Budget Office on an annualized basis. The total annualized budget authority for regular appropriations in the CR subject to the BCA limits is $1,016.582 billion. The CR complies with the defense limit but exceeds the nondefense limit, with defense spending estimated at $520.385 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates defense spending in the CR to total $520.385 billion, slightly below the defense limit. Nondefense spending is estimated at $496.197 billion, slightly above the nondefense limit. The CR includes spending not subject to statutory discretionary limits, bringing the total annualized budget authority to $1,099.962 billion. The statutory discretionary spending limits could be enforced 15 days after the congressional session ends, likely after the CR expires on December 11, 2015."
