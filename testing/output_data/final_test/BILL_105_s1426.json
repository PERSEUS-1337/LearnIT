    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rights of Intellectual Property Owners Fairness Facilitation Act of 1997\". Congress finds that the United States industry loses billions of dollars annually due to inadequate protection of intellectual property rights by foreign countries. It is crucial for the US to use its foreign policy to ensure proper protection of intellectual property rights. Several countries under the generalized system of preferences do not offer sufficient protection. Several countries that do not provide adequate protection of patents, copyrights, and trademarks or deny fair market access to US persons rely on intellectual property rights protection. Countries that do not protect intellectual property rights or deny fair market access to US persons are ineligible for GSP treatment. Countries that do not implement parts I, II, and III of the Agreement on TRIPS are ineligible for GSP treatment. After the enactment of the Rights of Intellectual Property Owners Fairness Facilitation Act of 1997, countries that do not implement article 70(9) of the Agreement on TRIPS or any agreements to protect intellectual property rights with the United States are ineligible for GSP treatment. Section 507 of the Act is amended accordingly. Section 507 of the Act is amended to include definitions related to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the Uruguay Round Agreements. Additionally, Section 502 is amended to designate countries that do not implement intellectual property rights agreements as ineligible for GSP treatment. The amendment (19 U.S.C. 2462) allows countries adhering to TRIPS agreements to be designated as beneficiary developing countries if fully implementing specified parts. The President must annually determine if beneficiary developing countries are fully implementing TRIPS agreements and report to Congress. The President must annually assess beneficiary developing countries' compliance with TRIPS agreements and report to Congress. The President must annually assess beneficiary developing countries' compliance with TRIPS agreements and report to Congress. SEC. 4. COORDINATION OF TRADE POLICY AND FOREIGN POLICY. The United States Trade Representative will notify relevant authorities of countries not fully implementing intellectual property rights agreements. The Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, and Administrator of the Agency for International Development will cooperate to encourage compliance with TRIPS agreements. The President is authorized to take actions to encourage developing countries to improve intellectual property rights protection, such as providing insurance for assets and requiring support in foreign assistance programs. The Secretary of State will prioritize intellectual property rights protection in diplomatic missions abroad. Establish technical cooperation committees on intellectual property standards within regional organizations and create a joint effort between the US Government and the private sector to provide intellectual property-related technical assistance. Additionally, require US representatives to multilateral lending institutions to advocate for programs supporting strong intellectual property rights protection in recipient countries. The curr_chunk discusses rights protection in recipient countries that have implemented specific parts of the Agreement on TRIPS and other related agreements with the United States. It also provides definitions for terms like \"Agreement on TRIPS\" and \"developing country.\" The curr_chunk discusses countries designated as least-developed beneficiaries under specific sections of the Act."
