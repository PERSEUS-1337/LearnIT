Congress finds that over 17.2 million homes are vacant in the US, leading to decreased property values and instability in communities. Additionally, the total Federal student debt is $1.3 trillion, with over 40 million Americans having outstanding student loans. This debt is hindering young families from buying homes, highlighting the need to convert debt into equity. The Federal Government should convert student debt into equity to boost housing purchases and help Americans accumulate equity. This can be achieved by using housing properties and student debt to reverse downward trends and connect creditworthy debt holders with housing properties for sale. Eventually, this initiative can help restore financial stability. Participants can help restore neighborhoods, transform debt to equity, and boost property values by investing in a home mortgage.
