    "content": "Political advertising has been a key aspect of American campaigns for over a century. Candidates, parties, and interest groups compete to sway voters and shape policy debates. Campaign finance laws, established in the 1970s, aim to regulate funding sources in elections and ensure transparency. Political advertising has played a significant role in American campaigns for over a century, with laws regulating funding sources and promoting transparency. The debate over corporate and union spending on political ads was reignited by the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC in 2010. The DISCLOSE Act, a legislative response to Citizens United v. FEC, addresses major policy issues surrounding political advertising transparency. It compares provisions of H.R. 5175, S. 3295, and S. 3628 with current campaign finance law and highlights issues for congressional consideration. Legislative developments on the DISCLOSE Act have progressed rapidly. The DISCLOSE Act responds to the Citizens United case, focusing on political advertising transparency. It allows corporations, unions, and tax-exempt organizations to use general treasury funds for independent expenditures in elections. This report will be updated to reflect ongoing legislative developments. The 1907 Tillman Act and 1947 Taft-Hartley Act prohibited corporations and unions from making contributions to political parties and candidates. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 further restricted corporate and labor union treasury funded contributions and expenditures in federal elections. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, also known as FECA, established prohibitions on corporate and union treasury spending, allowing for the creation of separate segregated funds or PACs. In the landmark 1976 Supreme Court decision Buckley v. Valeo, the constitutionality of many FECA provisions was challenged, setting the framework for campaign finance regulation analysis. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court upheld contribution limits, invalidated certain expenditure limits, and created the distinction between issue advocacy and express advocacy in campaign finance regulation. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 addressed political advertising and funding sources, marking a significant legislative development after FECA. During the legislative debates on the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a key concern was whether issue advocacy ads were truly about public policy or aimed at influencing votes for or against candidates. BCRA introduced electioneering communications to regulate messages that could impact elections without explicitly endorsing a candidate. The act also prohibited corporations and unions from using general funds for electioneering communications, restricting ads mentioning political candidates during pre-election periods. In 2007, the Supreme Court limited restrictions on corporate- and union-funded ads mentioning political candidates during pre-election periods. The ruling allowed ads that could be interpreted as something other than calling for a vote for or against a candidate to be aired. Citizens United, a tax-exempt corporation, produced a documentary about then-Senator Hillary Clinton, releasing it in theaters and on DVD. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (FEC), the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the prohibition on corporations and labor unions using their general treasury funds for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. The Court ruled that these prohibitions violated the First Amendment, overturning its previous decision in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned restrictions on corporate-funded independent expenditures in Citizens United v. FEC, ruling that they violated the First Amendment. The Court also upheld disclaimer and disclosure requirements for electioneering communications. The Court's ruling in Citizens United does not affect the ban on corporate or union contributions to political candidates. Federal campaign finance law now allows corporate and labor union treasury funding for independent expenditures. PACs are still required for contributions to candidates, parties, and political committees. Questions have arisen about the impact of Citizens United on political advertising. The Court's decision in Citizens United may lead to increased campaign activity by tax-exempt organizations, particularly \u00a7 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations and \u00a7 501(c)(6) trade associations. Prior to Citizens United, these organizations were generally prohibited from using their treasury funds for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. Some are expecting a flood of corporate and labor union express advocacy on the airwaves due to the Court's decision. Some anticipate increased campaign activity by tax-exempt organizations post Citizens United, with concerns about potential shadow groups receiving undisclosed funds for campaign activities. The impact of corporate and union independent expenditures at the federal level remains uncertain, with proponents calling for preemptive legislation to address potential influx of new political advertising. Legislative responses to Citizens United have already begun. Legislative responses to Citizens United have been swift, with over 40 relevant bills introduced in Congress. The primary focus has been on the DISCLOSE Act, with multiple versions introduced in both the House and Senate. The House has largely concentrated on the DISCLOSE Act in committee hearings. The House Administration Committee and House Judiciary Subcommittee held hearings to assess the Citizens United ruling. H.R. 5175 was discussed in multiple hearings and a markup session, leading to its passage by the House on June 24, 2010. Notable changes included raising the threshold for prohibiting expenditures by government contractors. The DISCLOSE Act, if passed, would expand disclosure and disclaimer requirements for political communications by corporations, unions, and certain tax-exempt organizations. It includes provisions such as raising the threshold for prohibiting expenditures by government contractors and requiring electronic filing of independent expenditures and electioneering communication reports. The DISCLOSE Act aims to expand disclosure requirements for political communications by various organizations, including corporations, unions, and tax-exempt groups. It would also mandate reporting of donor information and spending on independent expenditures and electioneering communications. Additionally, it would require approval from high-ranking officials for advertising content and prohibit certain entities from making contributions or communications in federal elections. The DISCLOSE Act aims to expand disclosure requirements for political communications by organizations, including corporations, unions, and tax-exempt groups. It would mandate reporting of donor information and spending on independent expenditures and electioneering communications. The Act also prohibits certain entities subject to foreign control from making contributions in elections and removes limits on coordinated party expenditures if a candidate does not control the expenditure. Major differences between the House and Senate versions of the Act include varying thresholds for restricting independent expenditures and electioneering. The bills under consideration have different thresholds for restricting independent expenditures and electioneering communications by government contractors. S. 3295 sets the threshold at $50,000, while H.R. 5175 and S. 3628 set it at $10 million. The House bill includes a restriction on Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas lessees, prohibiting them from making contributions in federal elections. The bills also redefine foreign nationals, expanding the definition to include certain foreign-controlled U.S. corporations. S. 3295 revises the lowest unit charge for broadcast advertising and extends it to national party committees in certain cases. It also requires Senate political committee reports to be filed electronically with the FEC. The DISCLOSE Act, as passed by the House, focuses on political advertising and disclosure provisions. It excludes certain organizations from disclosure requirements. The bill aims to document and restrict political advertising to prevent potential corruption. The DISCLOSE Act focuses on disclosure provisions for political advertising, applying additional requirements to entities making independent expenditures and electioneering communications. Corporations, unions, and certain tax-exempt organizations would be subject to these provisions based on financial and time thresholds. The bill does not guarantee an equal playing field among political advertisers or deter entities from calling for election or defeat of federal candidates. The bills' restrictions on political expenditures target specific organizations like government contractors, entities under foreign control, or TARP recipients. They primarily affect non-campaign actors such as corporations, unions, and tax-exempt organizations. The bills do not raise contribution limits for candidate campaigns or address other political committees like parties and PACs, except for allowing parties to make additional coordinated expenditures supporting their candidates. The DISCLOSE Act legislation could impact political spending by corporations, unions, and tax-exempt organizations. The effects of Citizens United are uncertain, and Congress may debate specific provisions in the bill. Maintaining the status quo may result in undocumented election influence spending. Undisclosed funds could potentially be transferred between organizations to influence elections under current campaign finance law. The DISCLOSE Act aims to prohibit certain organizations from making expenditures, but some argue that existing laws may already cover these issues. The impact of Citizens United on political spending remains uncertain, and additional legislative action may not be necessary if substantial spending changes do not occur. The legislation proposes disclosure and disclaimer requirements for independent expenditures and electioneering communications, broadening the definitions to include advocacy for or against a candidate. This expands the regulation scope of FECA. The bills propose expanding the regulation scope of FECA by increasing the period for electioneering communications and regulating political advertising that mentions a candidacy, political party, or candidate's character. The bills aim to expand FECA regulations by including disclosure, disclaimer, and reporting requirements for covered organizations, defined as certain types of corporations, labor organizations, and tax-exempt organizations. Exemptions are provided for charitable organizations and some large \u00a7 501(c)(4) organizations in H.R. 5175 and S. 3628, but not in S. 3295. Incorporated \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations would be included as covered organizations under S. 3295. The legislation aims to expand FECA regulations by imposing disclosure, disclaimer, and reporting requirements on certain organizations. It includes prohibitions on government contractors, TARP recipients, and corporations with foreign ownership from making expenditures in federal elections. The activities that constitute electioneering under the IRC and FECA may differ, with issue advocacy communications potentially being considered electioneering under FECA but not campaign activity under the IRC. The legislation aims to expand FECA regulations by imposing disclosure, disclaimer, and reporting requirements on certain organizations, including government contractors. The House-passed bill increased the threshold to $10 million for contractors to be prohibited from making electioneering communications or independent expenditures. This change was possibly made to exempt small business government contractors from the prohibition. The proposed legislation aims to expand FECA regulations by imposing disclosure, disclaimer, and reporting requirements on certain organizations, including government contractors. The bill exempts contractors who have not received contracts valued at more than $10 million from the ban on independent expenditures and electioneering communications. Large government contractors can receive contracts valued at over $1 billion. TARP recipients would be prohibited from making contributions, independent expenditures, or electioneering communications using TARP funds. The legislation proposes a prohibition on contributions or expenditures by foreign nationals to foreign-controlled domestic corporations, with unclear interpretation of key terms. The legislation proposes thresholds for foreign control, including ownership of voting shares by foreign nationals and power to direct decision-making processes. The FEC has discretion in determining indirect ownership and control criteria. The legislation proposes lifting caps on coordinated party expenditures to help candidates respond to corporate and union advertising post-Citizens United. Some may object to increasing money in the political system, even if it is to counter corporate or union influence. The bills aim to clarify terms regarding communications controlled by candidates or committees, requiring more donor disclosure from organizations to prevent them from being used as \"shadow groups.\" Unlike existing provisions, these bills would disclose donors not specifically giving for political activities. The bills aim to clarify donor disclosure requirements for organizations involved in political activities, including \u00a7 527 groups. These provisions would apply FEC reporting requirements to \u00a7 527 political organizations, which are currently under IRS reporting. The disclosure and disclaimer requirements in the bills do not directly limit political advertising spending. The bills propose additional requirements for organizations involved in political activities, allowing them to establish optional accounts for campaign-related activities. This provision may lead to organizations having to use the account exclusively for future campaign-related activities, which could be a strategic challenge for some. The DISCLOSE Act proposes additional requirements for organizations involved in political activities, including establishing optional accounts for campaign-related activities. It is unclear if organizations can dispose of funds from these accounts if they decide to stop political spending. The implementation of the act may impact how quickly it affects campaigns and independent political advertising, with the FEC responsible for enforcing most provisions. The FEC would administer and enforce most of the DISCLOSE Act's provisions. Implementation before the 2010 November elections is unlikely due to the time needed for rule development, approval, and form amendments. The DISCLOSE Act's effectiveness could be delayed or compromised due to potential disagreements among Commissioners, leading to deadlocked votes. Many provisions would take effect 30 days after enactment, with some immediately effective. The regulated community may lack guidance on compliance until the FEC implements rules. The DISCLOSE Act could still take effect even if rulemaking is delayed, allowing Congress to impose additional requirements on political advertisers. Enacting the act would provide more information on political advertising funded by corporations, unions, and tax-exempt organizations, and could prohibit certain entities from funding electioneering communications. The DISCLOSE Act aims to provide more information on political advertising funded by corporations, unions, and tax-exempt organizations. It could prohibit certain entities from funding electioneering communications and independent expenditures, while allowing political parties to make coordinated party expenditures in some cases. The disclosure and disclaimer provisions could give the public and regulators additional information about the sources of political advertising, potentially causing advertisers to think carefully before making political expenditures. Those in favor of Citizens United may be concerned about provisions in the DISCLOSE Act that could limit participation in elections. Congress is considering issues such as defining terms, regulating organizations, and implementation."
