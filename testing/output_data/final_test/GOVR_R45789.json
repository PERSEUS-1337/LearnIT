    "content": "Members of Congress, the Administration, and outside groups are concerned about projected deficits and debt levels. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts that federal deficits and debt held by the public will sharply increase over the next 30 years. Currently, federal debt is 78% of GDP, much higher than the 50-year average of 42%. If policymakers aim to keep debt at 78% of GDP in 2049, the deficit would need to be reduced by $400 billion annually. The current congressional budget process is criticized for not considering long-term budget outcomes, leading to short-term policy decisions that worsen the deficit and debt. Advocates argue for a shift towards a long-term budget focus to address these challenges. Many challenges exist in adopting a long-term budget focus within the current congressional budget process due to fixed mandatory spending and revenue policies. These policies, including Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and interest on the debt, are set by laws enacted years ago and continue without annual approval. Addressing rising deficits and debt in the long term would require policy changes to these fixed spending and revenue policies. Addressing rising deficit and debt in the long term requires policy changes as projected spending and revenue levels are uncertain. Factors like labor force participation, productivity, interest rates, and healthcare costs can impact outcomes. Budgeting for unforeseen events and underlying projection assumptions pose additional challenges in long-term budgeting. The Congressional Budget Office regularly publishes long-term budget projections, known as the annual Budget and Economic Outlook. These projections cover a 10-year period based on current laws regarding federal spending and revenues. Data evaluating specific programs are also available to assist Congress in understanding the projected budget situation. The Budget and Economic Outlook provides information on projected spending, revenue, deficits, debt, economic growth, and fiscal scenarios. Congress uses this baseline to measure legislative proposals. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also publishes budgetary and economic projections, including in the President's annual budget request. CBO provides cost estimates for proposed legislation as required by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provide information on the impact of legislation on spending, revenues, and the deficit over the next 10 years. CBO also offers a Long-Term Budget Outlook to show the effects of demographic trends, economic developments, and rising healthcare costs on federal finances over the next 30 years. Additionally, CBO notes whether proposed legislation would increase deficits in future decades to help Congress adhere to budget resolutions and other rules. The OMB and GAO provide long-term projections on spending, revenue, deficits, and debt over various timeframes. Specific programs like Social Security and Medicare issue actuarial estimates for the next 75 years. CBO also offers long-term budget outlooks. The CBO provides long-term projections on specific programs such as Social Security and U.S. nuclear forces. Congress, through budget-related rules and committees, oversees these projections and studies the long-term implications of programs within their jurisdiction. The Budget Committees in Congress oversee the budget resolution, reconciliation process, and budget process. They develop a budget plan in the form of a budget resolution, which may trigger the budget reconciliation process. The Budget Committees in Congress oversee the budget resolution, reconciliation process, and budget process. They gather information from various sources, review the President's budget submission, and hold hearings on legislation related to the budget. They also examine the long-term budget outlook and potential changes to the budget process. The budget resolution is an annual agreement between the House and Senate on spending and revenue levels for upcoming fiscal years. It does not become law but serves as a guide for Congress. Once agreed upon by both chambers, it sets enforceable parameters through points of order and the budget reconciliation process. The Budget Act requires the budget resolution to include specific budgetary levels for upcoming fiscal years and out years, such as total spending, revenues, surplus/deficit, and allocation of spending among committees. Points of order can be raised against legislation on the House or Senate floor that violates these levels, but they cannot limit direct spending or revenue levels. The budget reconciliation process allows Congress to reconcile budgetary levels in the budget resolution with existing law by passing legislation to alter revenue and direct spending levels. Reconciliation directives included in the annual budget resolution instruct committees to develop legislation related to direct spending, revenue, or the debt limit. The budget reconciliation process allows Congress to change laws related to spending, revenue, or the debt limit. Reconciliation legislation can be considered under special procedures in both the House and Senate, with a limit on debate time in the Senate. Since 1980, 25 reconciliation acts have been sent to the President, with 21 signed into law. Reconciliation is often used to reduce deficits and can make temporary or permanent policy changes affecting the long-term budget. The reconciliation process allows Congress to change laws related to spending, revenue, or the debt limit. Reconciliation legislation must not increase the net deficit outside the budget window. Various budget-related points of order in the House and Senate restrict consideration of budgetary legislation. Pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rules prohibit the consideration of direct spending or revenue legislation that increases the deficit. The House and Senate have PAYGO rules that prevent legislation increasing the deficit in specific time periods. The Senate also has a \"long-term deficit point of order\" rule. The House previously had a similar rule but no longer does. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established limits on discretionary spending for a 10-year period, with separate annual limits for defense and nondefense categories. Exceeding these limits triggers across-the-board reductions in budgetary resources. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, known as \"Statutory PAYGO,\" enforces budget discipline by requiring the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to track the budgetary effects of new revenue and spending legislation. If a deficit is projected, across-the-board cuts (sequestration) are triggered to reduce excess spending in the applicable category. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985 aimed to balance the budget by setting annual deficit limits for each fiscal year. It required the President and Congress to adhere to these limits without specifying policy changes for deficit reduction, leading to negotiations over revenue increases and spending cuts. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 aimed to enforce deficit limits through sequestration in case of breaches. It was later amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, which introduced PAYGO procedures and discretionary spending limits. This act replaced the focus on deficit targets under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings with a two-pronged approach to budgetary enforcement. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 created a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to reduce the budget deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. Legislation reported by the committee would be considered under special expedited procedures in both the House and Senate, with a limit on debate time in the Senate. If no agreement was reached by January 15, 2012, an automatic process would enforce the budgetary goal. The Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform was created by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 to significantly reform the budget and appropriations process. The committee comprised 16 members from the House and Senate and recommended adopting a two-year budget resolution cycle. The Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform recommended a two-year budget resolution cycle, but the bill was not voted on by the full house."
