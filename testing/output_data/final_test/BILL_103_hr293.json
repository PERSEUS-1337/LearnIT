    "content": "The Act is titled the \"California Central Coast National Marine Sanctuary Act\". It includes findings related to the sanctuary. The California Central Coast National Marine Sanctuary Act recognizes the special national significance of the marine environment in the waters of the California Central Coast due to its oceanographic characteristics, ecological diversity, and presence of endangered species. The California Central Coast National Marine Sanctuary Act acknowledges the unique marine environment in the region, including diverse species and archaeological sites dating back thousands of years. The waters face threats from pollution and industrial activities, while current regulations are insufficient for comprehensive conservation and management. The California Central Coast National Marine Sanctuary Act recognizes the importance of preserving the sensitive marine environment in the region under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972. The designation of the waters as a national marine sanctuary is necessary for the protection of this vital area of our nation's marine environment. The California Central Coast National Marine Sanctuary Act aims to protect and preserve the marine resources of the region. The policy is to safeguard the living resources and environment, while the purpose is to educate the public, manage human uses, and not restrict activities that do not harm the Sanctuary. The California Central Coast National Marine Sanctuary is designated as a national marine sanctuary under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972. It includes submerged lands and waters off the coast of California from the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary to Point Sal Beach. The California Central Coast National Marine Sanctuary extends from Point Sal Beach State Park in Santa Barbara County to the offshore Santa Lucia Bank. The Governor of California has the option to object to the designation within 45 days. Boundary modifications will be made in consultation with the draft environmental impact statement for the Sanctuary. The Secretary of Commerce may make minor modifications to the boundaries of the California Central Coast National Marine Sanctuary as necessary to fulfill the purpose of the Act. Written notification of such modifications will be submitted to the relevant Senate and House committees. SEC. 5. COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT PLAN. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with government authorities, must develop a management plan and regulations within 24 months of the Act's enactment. The plan should allow for public and private uses of the Sanctuary while prioritizing resource protection, establish zoning for resource protection, and create a research and monitoring program. The Secretary of Commerce must develop a comprehensive management plan for the ecological monitoring program, identify alternative funding sources, ensure coordination among authorities, promote education on conservation, and allow public participation in the plan's development. Authorization of appropriations for carrying out the Act: $250,000 for each of the fiscal years 1993 and 1994."
