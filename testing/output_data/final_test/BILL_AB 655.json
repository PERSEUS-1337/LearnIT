The fees cannot exceed the maximum amount authorized and are not subject to certain government code regulations. The secretary can only raise fees based on the board's recommendation. The secretary can set additional fees for renderers and collection centers, with different fees possible. If a renderer and transporter both face additional fees, only the higher fee applies.
