Conforming amendments are made to section 211(o) of the Act. The Clean Air Act is amended to extend renewable fuel volume requirements for gasoline, increasing annually to 22.2 billion gallons by 2023. Amendments are made by replacing \"2011\" and \"2012\" with \"2024\" and \"2025\" respectively. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to require federal agencies to purchase ethanol-blended gasoline and biodiesel. Federal agencies are mandated to purchase ethanol-blended gasoline with at least 10 percent ethanol and biodiesel for their fleet vehicles in areas where these fuels are competitively priced and available. The provision mandates the availability of biodiesel-blended diesel fuel with increasing biodiesel content over time at competitive prices. This requirement is not considered a federal law and does not apply to certain types of fuel. Exemption: This section excludes fuel used in vehicles not considered part of a 'fleet' as defined in section 301(9). SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE BIOENERGY PROGRAM. Reauthorization of Department of Agriculture bioenergy program includes funding priorities for eligible producers in bioenergy initiatives, focusing on cellulosic ethanol production and hydrogen production using ethanol technology. SEC. 4. 7-YEAR DEPRECIATION OF ETHANOL AND BIODIESEL REFINING PROPERTY. The amendment adds ethanol and biodiesel refining property to the 7-year depreciation schedule in the Internal Revenue Code. Ethanol or biodiesel refining property is defined as property used to produce biodiesel or ethanol not derived from petroleum, natural gas, or coal. The amendment adds ethanol and biodiesel refining property to the 7-year depreciation schedule in the Internal Revenue Code for property used to produce biodiesel or ethanol not derived from petroleum, natural gas, or coal. The Alternative Depreciation System table in section 168(g)(3)(B) is amended accordingly. The amendment adds ethanol and biodiesel refining property to the 7-year depreciation schedule in the Internal Revenue Code for property used to produce biodiesel or ethanol not derived from petroleum, natural gas, or coal. The amendments made by this section shall apply to property placed in service after the date of the enactment of this Act, with exceptions for properties under binding contracts or already under construction. The Secretary of Energy will conduct a study on permitting requirements for new petroleum industry facilities and submit a report to Congress. Additionally, tax incentives for renewable fuels will be extended and expanded. The alternative technology vehicle credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is extended, with increased credits for certain hybrid-flexible fuel vehicles. This section will not apply to property purchased after December 31, 2014. The alternative technology vehicle credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is extended, with increased credits for certain hybrid-flexible fuel vehicles. A new flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicle credit is introduced, with specific criteria for determining the credit amount for taxpayers placing a new hybrid flexible fuel motor vehicle in service during the taxable year. The credit amount for alternative technology vehicles is determined according to a specific table. The credit amount for alternative technology vehicles is determined based on the city fuel economy percentage compared to a comparable vehicle, ranging from $1,500 to $3,500. Fuel economy is calculated on an E-85 ethanol gallon equivalent basis. The city fuel economy of a new flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicle, certified by the EPA, must achieve a minimum of 125 using E-85 ethanol. The text discusses the requirement for a new flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicle to achieve a minimum city fuel economy of 125 using E-85 ethanol.
