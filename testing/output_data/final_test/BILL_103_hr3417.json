    "content": "The \"Emergency Cervidae Tuberculosis Protection Act\" includes sections on short title, purpose, definitions, administration, protection measures, insurance premiums, enforcement, regulations, borrowing funds, interstate commerce limitations, and termination. The purpose of the act is outlined in Section 2. The purpose of the \"Emergency Cervidae Tuberculosis Protection Act\" is to establish a voluntary national insurance program for cervidae tuberculosis. Congress recognizes that the commercial raising of cervidae in the United States impacts interstate commerce. The Act defines \"cervidae\" as animals with antlers like elk and deer, including antlerless water deer. \"Commerce\" refers to transport between states or within a state. \"Destruction\" means slaughtering cervidae approved by the Secretary. The term \"exposed\" in relation to tuberculosis in cervidae refers to animals found in herds containing infected individuals, those that have moved from an infected herd, or those nursed by an infected dam. A \"herd\" is defined as a group of cervidae kept together or multiple groups under common ownership but geographically separated. The terms defined in the curr_chunk relate to ownership, infected cervidae, insurance program, owner, person, and Secretary in the context of tuberculosis regulations. The curr_chunk defines \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Agriculture, \"State\" as various regions including States and territories, and \"Tuberculosis\" as a contagious disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis. The curr_chunk states that the administration of the act will be carried out. The Secretary of Agriculture will administer the Act through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. An advisory board consisting of five members will be consulted by the Secretary when establishing policy for the insurance program. Three members, including at least one elk producer and one deer producer, will be selected from a list of nine candidates presented by domestic cervidae producers participating in the insurance program. The advisory board for the insurance program will consist of five members, including elk and deer producers. Members will serve two-year terms, with the option for two members to serve a one-year term initially. The board will select a chairperson annually. The chairperson of the advisory board serves a one-year term and is responsible for establishing operational procedures. In the first year of establishment, the board members select a chairperson who will serve for the remainder of the year. The advisory board will terminate at the end of a 10-year period. SEC. 5. EMERGENCY CERVIDAE TUBERCULOSIS PROTECTION. The Secretary may establish a national insurance program to compensate owners for the destruction of cervidae infected with tuberculosis. Participation in the program is required for indemnity payments, and coverage is not provided to herds under active investigation for tuberculosis. Effective Date of Coverage for the insurance program is upon payment of the premium set by the Secretary. Compensation for the destruction of insured cervidae is paid at rates established by the Secretary, not exceeding 80% of the market value, and reduced by salvage value and other received moneys. The compensation for the destruction of insured cervidae is limited to the fair market value determined by the Secretary at the time of destruction, not exceeding 80% of the market value. Coverage is not retroactive. SEC. 6. INSURANCE PREMIUMS. The Secretary shall establish insurance premiums at actuarially sufficient rates to cover claims and establish a reasonable reserve. Premiums may not exceed two percent of the insured herd's declared market value annually. Premiums must be paid as required by the Secretary. The Secretary may deny or reduce insurance claims and must notify the claimant. The claimant can appeal within six months, leading to a hearing conducted by the Secretary. The denial or reduction is considered a final order reviewable under title 28, United States Code. SEC. 7. DEPOSIT AND INVESTMENT OF PREMIUMS RECEIVED. Premiums received under the insurance program can be deposited in the Treasury or approved banks, or invested in US obligations. Federal Reserve Banks can act as custodians for the Secretary of Agriculture. Repayment of borrowed funds is required after a 10-year period. The Secretary will repay the Commodity Credit Corporation for funds borrowed under section 10 from remaining insurance program funds. Any leftover funds will be rebated to policyholders based on the premium paid. SEC. 8. ENFORCEMENT: Provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act apply to Secretary's enforcement of this Act. SEC. 9. REGULATIONS: Secretary can issue necessary regulations. SEC. 10. AUTHORITY TO BORROW FUNDS: Secretary can borrow funds from Commodity Credit Corporation for insurance program. SEC. 11. EMERGENCY LIMITATIONS: Restrictions on moving Cervidae in interstate commerce. SEC. 11. EMERGENCY LIMITATIONS ON CERVIDAE MOVEMENT IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE: Cervidae movement requires proof of insurance or waiver for tuberculosis risk. SEC. 12. SEPARABILITY: Sections are separable; unconstitutional parts won't affect others. SEC. 13. TERMINATION. The insurance program authorized by this section will end after a 10-year period from the start date. Policies still active at termination will continue until the end of their term but cannot be renewed after the program ends."
