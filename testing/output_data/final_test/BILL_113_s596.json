The Act, known as the \"Fostering Independence Through Technology Act of 2013,\" highlights the benefits of remote patient monitoring for seniors to stay at home longer, reducing costly transfers to higher care settings. It also mentions the high patient satisfaction rates and the financial impact on hospitals for readmissions within 30 days. Current remote patient monitoring programs using technology have reduced hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge. SEC. 2. REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING AND SUPPORT PILOT PROJECTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct pilot projects under title XVIII of the Social Security Act to incentivize home health agencies to provide remote patient monitoring services that reduce expenditures. Pilot projects will be conducted in urban and rural areas, including at least one in a small state with a population of less than 1,000,000. The term \"remote patient monitoring services\" refers to services provided in the home using technology for consultations, monitoring, training, observation, assessment, treatment, and other specified technologies by the Secretary. The term \"remote patient monitoring services\" refers to home-based technology for consultations, monitoring, training, observation, assessment, and treatment specified by the Secretary. Remote patient monitoring technology involves a system using home-based or mobile monitoring devices that transmit clinical data wirelessly or through telecommunications. The Secretary specifies criteria for identifying Medicare beneficiaries within the scope of pilot projects for remote patient monitoring services. Medicare beneficiaries are included in established care plans that involve data review by healthcare professionals. The Secretary establishes criteria for assessing home health agency effectiveness in achieving objectives, including specific clinical conditions. Incentives are provided for agencies participating in pilot projects. The Secretary establishes performance targets for home health agencies in pilot projects, based on historical expenditure data adjusted for risk. The Secretary establishes comparative performance targets for home care agencies in pilot projects based on historical expenditure data adjusted for risk. Participating agencies receive payments equal to 75 percent of Medicare cost savings realized relative to the performance target. The Secretary also limits expenditures under the pilot project. The Secretary limits payments under this section to ensure that total expenditures under title XVIII of the Social Security Act do not exceed what would have been spent without the pilot projects. Home health agencies participating in certain shared savings programs are not eligible for the pilot project. The Secretary may waive provisions of titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security Act for pilot projects involving shared savings or the independence at home medical practice pilot program. A report to Congress on the projects must be submitted within 3 years of the first pilot project implementation, detailing any changes in clinical outcomes and Medicare beneficiary satisfaction. The Secretary may waive provisions of titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security Act for pilot projects involving shared savings or the independence at home medical practice pilot program. A report to Congress on the projects must be submitted within 3 years of the first pilot project implementation, detailing any changes in clinical outcomes, Medicare beneficiary satisfaction, utilization of items and services under Medicare parts A, B, and D, per-beneficiary and aggregate spending, issues related to project expansion, recommendations for legislation and administrative actions, and other appropriate items. If successful, the Secretary shall initiate comparable projects in additional areas to enhance health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries and reduce expenditures under title XVIII. Payments for these projects have no effect on other Medicare payments. Payments under this section do not impact other Medicare payments to home health agencies for providing services under title XVIII of the Social Security Act."
