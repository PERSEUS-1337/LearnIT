    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers benefits such as healthcare, disability compensation, education assistance, and home loan guarantees. It operates through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA), with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) handling healthcare services, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) providing compensation and pensions, and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintaining veterans' cemeteries. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is responsible for maintaining national veterans' cemeteries, providing grants for state veterans cemeteries, and offering burial benefits to eligible veterans. This includes government-furnished headstones, markers, presidential memorial certificates, and burial flags for veterans and their eligible family members. Monetary burial benefits are also available as partial reimbursements. The National Cemetery Administration provides burial benefits for eligible veterans, including monetary reimbursements for burial and funeral costs. The amount of reimbursement depends on the circumstances of the veteran's death. VA national cemeteries, established after the Civil War, now include 131 cemeteries under VA jurisdiction. Eligibility for burial in a VA national cemetery includes members of the U.S. Armed Forces who die while on active duty. The National Cemetery Administration provides burial benefits for eligible veterans, including monetary reimbursements for burial and funeral costs. Eligibility for burial in a VA national cemetery includes members of the U.S. Armed Forces who die while on active duty, veterans discharged under conditions other than dishonorable, U.S. citizens who served in the armed forces of a U.S. ally during a time of war, certain members of Reserve Components and the Reserve Officer Training Corps, commissioned officers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, commissioned officers of the Regular or Reserve Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service, World War II merchant mariners, Filipino veterans who were U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents residing in the U.S. at the time of death, spouses, surviving spouses, minor, and unmarried adult children of eligible veterans. The VA provides burial benefits for eligible veterans, including reimbursement for burial costs. Eligibility for burial in a national cemetery includes active duty members, veterans with honorable discharges, and certain other individuals. The VA does not offer cremation or funeral services, which must be arranged privately. The DOD can provide a military honors ceremony upon request. Former spouses of eligible individuals are not eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery. Former spouses, family members not otherwise eligible, individuals separated from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions, those convicted of certain crimes, and specific military service exclusions are not eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery. Eligible veterans and active duty members can be interred in a national cemetery and receive a government-furnished headstone or marker. Veterans discharged for reasons other than dishonorable after November 1, 1990, are eligible for headstones. Spouses and eligible dependents can also receive headstones or markers if interred in specific cemeteries. Under current federal regulations, veterans interred in national, military post or base, or state cemeteries can receive bronze, granite, or marble markers. Headstones in granite and marble are also available, with styles consistent with existing monuments. Veterans who served after September 7, 1980, must have served a minimum of 24 consecutive months on active duty to be eligible, with exceptions made by the VA Secretary under certain circumstances. Memorial headstones, markers, and medallions are available for individual veterans or groups, including those who die while on active duty and have remains that are not recovered or identified. Spouses and dependents with unavailable remains may also receive memorial headstones. Veterans buried in national, military, or state cemeteries can receive government-furnished headstones or markers. Spouses and dependents buried in private cemeteries are not eligible. Veterans who died after November 1, 1990, and are buried in private cemeteries may receive medallions instead. Only the next of kin can apply for these services through the VA website. Regardless of the date of death, unmarked graves of veterans worldwide can receive government headstones or markers inscribed with the deceased's name, branch of service, and year of death. Memorial markers for veterans must include the legal name, branch of service, year of birth and death, and \"In Memory Of\" at the top. Additional details like rank, war service, and decorations can be included if space allows. Emblems of belief can also be added with approval. Terms like Doctor or Reverend are not allowed on the mandatory name line. Personalized inscriptions like nicknames can be added at the bottom with VA approval. The Presidential Memorial Certificate (PMC) program, initiated by President John F. Kennedy in 1962, honors deceased veterans with a gold embossed certificate bearing the President's signature. The program was extended to those who died in active military service by the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012. The VA provides a list of approved emblems of belief for inclusion on memorial markers, along with the veteran's legal name, branch of service, and year of birth and death. Personalized inscriptions can be added with VA approval. The VA provides a free U.S. flag to honor deceased veterans who served honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces. The flag is given to the next of kin at the funeral service as a keepsake and can be donated to a national cemetery. A burial flag is furnished for veterans meeting specific criteria, including those who served during wartime or after January 31, 1955. The VA provides a burial flag to honor deceased veterans who served in the U.S. Armed Forces. The funeral director or next of kin can apply for a burial flag, and the VA burial allowance reimburses partial burial and funeral costs for eligible veterans. The amount depends on the cause of death and next of kin can apply for reimbursement if they paid for the burial or funeral. Deceased veterans must meet specific requirements for next of kin to be eligible for VA burial benefits, such as having a discharge other than dishonorable and meeting certain criteria related to their service-connected disability, VA benefits, or pending claims. The VA can pay up to $300 towards a veteran's funeral expenses and up to $745 towards plot-interment costs if the veteran died on or after October 9, 1996, while in a VA-approved state nursing home. The burial allowance is not affected by the veteran's assets at the time of death, but it may be reduced if expenses are covered by the employer or another government source. No burial allowances are given to organizations, and the amount is limited to the difference between what is paid by other sources and the maximum reimbursement set by the VA Secretary. The VA will pay burial and funeral costs for veterans, including a $747 burial allowance and $747 for a plot effective October 1, 2014. They may also reimburse costs for transporting remains to the burial state. Up to $2,000 may be covered for funeral expenses if the veteran died from a service-connected disability. The 2008 VA report found that burial and plot allowances were not meeting their original intent of providing financial assistance for veterans' burial, funeral, and plot costs. The report concluded that significant increases in the allowances are necessary to restore the value of these benefits to their original levels, as funeral costs have increased at a rate greater than other prices since 1990. Adjustments to the allowances have not kept up with the inflation of funeral and burial expenses since 1973. The 2008 VA report highlighted that burial and plot allowances have not kept up with the inflation of funeral and burial expenses. In 1973, these allowances covered a significant portion of funeral and burial costs, but by 2007, their value had significantly decreased. The report recommended establishing a basis for each allowance as a percentage of the average cost of funeral, burial, and burial plot, and developing an annual schedule for reviewing and adjusting the allowances using the Consumer Price Index for funeral expenses. The development of national cemeteries began in 1862 after the increasing number of Civil War casualties. Congress authorized President Abraham Lincoln to purchase cemetery grounds for soldiers. Before this, soldiers were buried in private or military cemeteries. The first 14 national cemeteries were established in 1862. After the Civil War, the Army Quartermaster Department initiated the Federal Reburial Program to locate and identify Union soldiers' remains. Despite extensive efforts, many soldiers could not be found, and nearly half of those recovered were unidentified. By 1870, around 300,000 Union soldiers were buried in 73 national cemeteries, mostly in the southeastern US near battlefields. The National Cemetery Act of 1867 provided funds and directives for national cemeteries, with amendments in the 1870s expanding eligibility for interment. In the late 19th century, the Federal Reburial Program established new national cemeteries and replaced wooden headstones with marble ones. Confederate soldiers were re-interred in a new section at Arlington National Cemetery in 1901. The 1930s saw significant changes with the establishment of the Veterans Administration responsible for National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers. In 1933, 11 national cemeteries were transferred to the National Park Service, and in 1934, eight World War I cemeteries were transferred to the American Battle Monuments Commission. Legislation in the following decades expanded burial eligibility in national cemeteries. President Lyndon Johnson ordered a survey of veteran and Army national cemetery programs in 1967, leading to the National Cemeteries Act of 1973. In 1973, Congress passed the National Cemeteries Act (P.L. 93-43), transferring 82 national cemeteries to the Veterans Administration. Arlington National Cemetery and The U.S. Soldiers' and Sailors' Home National Cemetery remained under Army control. The VA elevated its 21 NHDVS cemeteries to national cemeteries, creating a total of 103 cemeteries. The act also established the Advisory Committee on Cemeteries and Memorials. Thirteen new national cemeteries were established in the 1970s and 1980s, marking the largest expansion since the Civil War. In the 1980s and 1990s, new national cemeteries were established by Congress. Legislation in 1986 and 1998 led to the creation of the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) and the elevation of the director's position. Further laws in 1999 and 2003 mandated the study of burial needs and authorized the creation of six additional national cemeteries. The Act of 2003 authorized the creation of six new national cemeteries, bringing the total to 131 cemeteries under the VA's jurisdiction. The Secretary of VA has the authority to acquire land for cemeteries through various means. The VA policy dictates that a cemetery be established if there are 80,000 or more unserved veterans within 75 miles of the proposed site. The VA has initiated an \"urban initiative\" to establish secondary burial facilities near high-density urban areas. The process of building a new national cemetery involves site selection, environmental assessment, land acquisition, planning, design, and construction. A Rural Initiative aims to provide burial options for veterans in rural areas by creating National Veterans Burial Grounds within existing cemeteries. The VA provides burial options within existing public or private cemeteries, held to national shrine standards. The State Cemetery Grant Program assists in establishing state veterans cemeteries, funding up to 100% of development costs. Cemeteries must operate according to NCA guidelines. The NCA is required by Congress to submit reports on the need for national cemeteries, with recommendations on servicing 90% of veterans. Reports identified areas in need of burial space and recommended expanding existing cemeteries instead of opening new ones. This led to the establishment of seven new cemeteries and expansion of existing ones. The 2001 report to Congress estimated the costs of establishing and operating a national cemetery. Recommendations included encouraging grant program cemeteries, expanding existing cemeteries, and building new ones. The 2008 report stated that no new national cemetery would meet criteria until 2015, with St. Louis being the only qualifying location due to the planned closure of Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery. The report recommends retaining the 75-mile service area standard but reducing the veteran population threshold from 170,000 to 110,000 to increase the number of unserved communities qualifying for new national cemeteries. This change would allow Charleston, WV, and Schuyler, NE to qualify. The Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010 required the Secretary to report on site selection, schedule, and funding for new cemeteries in five areas, including Southern Colorado, Melbourne/Daytona FL, Omaha NE, Buffalo/Rochester NY, and Tallahassee FL. Reporting is required every two years until the cemeteries are established. The Tallahassee National Cemetery and Cape Canaveral National Cemetery opened in 2015, with a new national cemetery in Omaha expected to open in 2016. Laws passed during the 112th and 113th Congresses pertain to eligibility and burial in national veterans' cemeteries, including dignified burial for deceased veterans with no known next of kin and restrictions on interment for certain individuals. The agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States was signed on December 16, 2013, establishing Clark ABMC as the 25th cemetery. It holds the remains of 8,600 people, including 2,200 Americans and nearly 700 allied Philippine Scouts who participated in conflicts from the early 1900s to World War II. P.L. 113-65, signed on December 20, 2013, allows for the reconsideration of interments in national cemeteries, including the disinterment of accused murderer Michael Lashawn Anderson, a veteran buried in Fort Custer National Cemetery in Michigan. The law establishes a new process to remove remains of a person believed to have committed murder but never convicted. Anderson's remains were exhumed on February 19, 2014, and transferred to a private cemetery. Legislative History of Monetary Burial Benefits for veterans dates back to World War I. The Veterans' Benefits Acts of 1924, 1933, 1936, and 1957 established burial allowances for deceased veterans, with amounts ranging from $100 to $150 to cover funeral expenses and transportation to the place of burial. In 1958, the burial allowance for deceased veterans was increased to $250, and the VA was mandated to pay this amount for veterans who died in VA facilities. The VA could also provide burial and funeral services for these veterans and cover transportation costs. In 1958, the burial allowance for deceased veterans was increased to $250, and the VA was mandated to pay for transporting bodies of veterans who died in VA facilities to the place of burial. P.L. 85-857 clarified that the $250 burial allowance was not to be paid for deaths prior to August 19, 1958 and extended the filing period for reimbursement claims. P.L. 88-359 in 1964 eliminated the offset against VA burial allowances for amounts paid by burial associations. P.L. 89-360 in 1966 extended the $250 burial allowance to peacetime veterans who died because of service-connected disabilities. P.L. 93-43 in 1973 provided a plot or interment allowance of $150 for veterans not buried in national cemeteries. In 1973, P.L. 93-43 mandated the VA to provide headstones or markers for unmarked graves of veterans buried in national or military cemeteries, including soldiers of the Civil War. It also allowed survivors of veterans who died due to service-connected disabilities to request burial and funeral expenses to be paid by the VA. In 1978, the Veterans' Housing Benefits Improvement Act (P.L. 95-476) extended the burial plot allowance to states for veterans eligible for burial in state veterans' cemeteries. The Veterans Disability Compensation and Survivors' Benefits Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-479) increased the burial allowance to $300 and limited burial expenses for veterans who died of service-connected disabilities to $1,100. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-35) restricted burial allowance payments to eligible pension or disability recipients. In 1982, the Veterans' Compensation, Education, and Employment Amendments (P.L. 97-306) allowed the VA administrator to pay burial allowances to states holding bodies of eligible indigent deceased veterans. The 1988 Veterans' Benefits and Services Act (P.L. 100-322) increased the burial allowance for veterans who died from service-connected disabilities to $1,500. The 1996 Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act (P.L. 104-275) provided a $300 burial allowance for veterans who died in state nursing homes. The Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act of 2000 extended burial allowances for veterans in state nursing homes. The Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001 increased burial allowances for veterans with service-connected disabilities. The Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010 further increased burial allowances and provided for inflation adjustments. The national cemetery program has evolved through various major changes over the years. In 1861, General Orders No. 75 made the Quartermaster responsible for burial and headstones for Union officers and soldiers. The National Cemetery Act of 1867 provided funds and guidelines for national cemeteries. In 1872, soldiers were appointed as superintendents, and in 1873, all honorably discharged destitute soldiers and sailors could be buried in national cemeteries. In 1873, Chapter 276 of the Acts of the 42nd Congress allowed honorably discharged soldiers, sailors, and marines who served in the Civil War to be buried in national cemeteries at no cost. In 1906, P.L. 59-38 provided for marking the graves of Confederate soldiers who died in northern prisons. In 1920, eligibility for burial in national cemeteries was expanded to U.S. citizens who served in the Army or Navy of any government at war with Germany or Austria during World War I. In 1923, the American Battle Monuments Commission was established to erect memorials for American soldiers in Europe. In 1930, the Veterans Administration was established. In 1930, the Veterans Administration (VA) was established and made responsible for the National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (NHDVS) and 21 cemeteries in Europe. In 1933, 11 national cemeteries were transferred to the National Park Service. In 1948, eligibility for burial in national cemeteries was expanded to survivors of veterans. In 1959, eligibility was further expanded to Army or Air National Guard, Reserves, and ROTC members. In 1973, custody of national cemeteries was transferred from the Army to VA's National Cemetery System. In 1973, custody of national cemeteries was transferred from the Army to VA's National Cemetery System (NCS). VA cemeteries were elevated to national cemetery status. The NCS was given responsibility for veterans' headstones and markers. The law distinguished between service-connected and non-service-connected deaths for allowances and added the benefit of transportation of remains under certain circumstances. In 1978, the Veterans' Housing Benefits Act authorized the VA to pay a $150 burial allowance to states for the burial of eligible veterans in state veterans' cemeteries. It also authorized a grant assistance program for state veterans' cemeteries. In 1986, the Veterans' Benefits Improvement and Health-Care Authorization Act mandated the VA to conduct studies to identify areas with the greatest need for services. In 1997, P.L. 105-116 prohibited interment or memorialization in national cemeteries of persons convicted of federal or state capital crimes. In 1998, P.L. 105-368 redesignated the National Cemetery System as the National Cemetery Administration and authorized the VA to provide funding for new cemetery projects. In 1999, the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act directed the VA Secretary to improve burial benefits and establish national cemeteries in needed areas. The 2002 Veterans Benefits Act disqualified persons who committed capital crimes from interment in national cemeteries and restricted certain benefits. The 2003 National Cemetery Expansion Act authorized the establishment of six new national cemeteries. The Cemetery Expansion Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-109) authorized the establishment of six new national cemeteries in various locations.

It also directed the ABMC to operate and maintain Clark Veterans Cemetery as per an agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States signed in December 2013. The Respect for National Cemeteries Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-65) authorized reconsideration of decisions to inter or honor individuals in national cemeteries and allowed for the disinterment of remains from Fort Custer National Cemetery."
