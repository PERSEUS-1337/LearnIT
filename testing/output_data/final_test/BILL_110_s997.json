    "content": "The Act titled \"Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007\" amends the Public Health Service Act to include a section on Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research. The Secretary is required to conduct and support research using human embryonic stem cells, regardless of when they were derived. Ethical requirements for using these stem cells include being donated from in vitro fertilization clinics and created for fertility treatment purposes. The individuals seeking fertility treatment donated embryos with written consent, which would not be implanted and were not induced by financial incentives. The Secretary will issue guidelines within 60 days, and an annual report on research activities conducted under this section will be submitted to Congress. SEC. 498E. ALTERNATIVE HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELL RESEARCH. This section allows for alternative research on human pluripotent stem cells. The Secretary is required to conduct research on stem cells capable of producing various cell types without using human embryos. Guidelines must be issued within 90 days to outline the next steps for additional research. The Secretary is mandated to conduct research on stem cells that can generate different cell types without human embryos. Research priorities include focusing on near-term clinical benefits and considering techniques recommended by the President's Council on Bioethics. Reporting requirements include submitting an annual report to Congress detailing the research activities conducted under this section. The term 'human embryo' is defined in this section, referencing the applicable appropriations Act for the fiscal year. This section does not impact policies on embryonic stem cell research or human cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years 2008 through 2010 to carry out the section regarding human embryos."
