The Clean Air Act prohibits the use of MTBE in motor vehicle fuel in any State, with the Administrator allowed to permit trace quantities not exceeding 0.5 percent by volume. Regulations will be promulgated to enforce this prohibition. The amendments made by subsection (a) allow the Administrator to determine appropriate cases for the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether in vehicle fuel. This does not affect the authority of States to limit the use of MTBE in motor vehicle fuel as per the Clean Air Act. Elimination of oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline. Repeal of certain provisions in the Clean Air Act related to oxygen content requirements for reformulated gasoline. The amendments made by subsection (a) shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act. Section 211(k)(1) of the Clean Air Act is amended to maintain toxic air pollutant emission reductions. The term `PADD' refers to a Petroleum Administration for Defense District. The Administrator must establish standards for toxic air pollutants from reformulated gasoline within 270 days of enactment. Standards for toxic air pollutants from reformulated gasoline must be established by the Administrator for refineries or importers based on data collected during calendar years 1999 and 2000. These standards apply to the quantity of gasoline produced or distributed by the refinery or importer in a calendar year if it is less than or equal to a certain amount. The quantity of gasoline produced or distributed by a refinery or importer in excess of a certain amount is subject to standards for toxic air pollutants. The Administrator shall provide credits for emissions of toxic air pollutants and publish a report on regional protection of toxics reduction baselines. The Federal Register report specifies the excess production of reformulated gasoline and the reduction of toxic air pollutants emissions in each PADD based on data from retail surveys. The Administrator must take action if toxic air pollutant emissions in a PADD do not meet or exceed reductions from 1999 and 2000, based on retail survey data or other sources. The Administrator must identify reasons for failure in gasoline reformulation and revise regulations accordingly. The Administrator must identify reasons for failure in gasoline reformulation and revise regulations accordingly. Reformulated gasoline must meet standards within 180-270 days after promulgation, with all refineries or importers complying by April 1 of the following year and subsequent years. The Administrator must revise regulations for controlling hazardous air pollutants from motor vehicles and fuels within 180 days of enactment. The reformulated gasoline regulations have been consolidated for VOC-Control Regions 1 and 2, with more stringent requirements now applying to gasoline designated for VOC-Control Region 1. A savings clause ensures that prior legal claims or actions regarding emissions regulations remain unaffected. The Administrator will adjust standards for refineries or importers based on toxic air pollutant emissions from reformulated gasoline, with revisions limited to calendar years 1999-2000. Adjustments may consider any federal or state bans on methyl tertiary butyl ether post-enactment, requiring maintenance of emission reductions achieved during those years. The Administrator will adjust standards for refineries or importers based on toxic air pollutant emissions from reformulated gasoline, with revisions limited to calendar years 1999-2000. The adjustment aims to maintain the reduction achieved in the average annual aggregate emissions of toxic air pollutants from reformulated gasoline produced or distributed by the refinery or importer, without going below the average percentage of reductions for reformulated gasoline supplied to PADD I during 1999-2000. SEC. 3. FUNDING FOR MTBE CONTAMINATION. Authorization of up to $850,000,000 from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund for fiscal years 2004 through 2008."
