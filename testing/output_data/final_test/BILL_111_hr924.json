    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Rio Grande Pueblos Irrigation Infrastructure Improvement Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that drought, population increases, and environmental needs are worsening water supply issues in the western United States, including the Rio Grande Basin in New Mexico. A 2000 report by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs highlighted the urgent need for rehabilitating and repairing irrigation infrastructure of the Rio Grande Pueblos. Inspection reveals that key facilities are unsafe and barely functional. The benefits of this infrastructure improvement include water conservation and extending available water supplies. Rehabilitation and repair of irrigation infrastructure in the Rio Grande Pueblos would improve overall water management and help address potential water supply conflicts in the region. This would lead to extending available water supplies, increasing agricultural productivity, economic benefits, safer facilities, and preserving the culture of Indian Pueblos in New Mexico. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a section that likely provides definitions for terms used in the document. The curr_chunk defines the terms \"2004 Agreement\" as an agreement related to payment of operation and maintenance charges on Pueblo Indian lands, and \"designated engineer\" as a Federal employee representing the United States in irrigation structure matters. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the Middle Rio Grande Pueblos, the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, Pueblo irrigation infrastructure, and the Rio Grande Basin. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the Rio Grande Pueblos, including Rio Grande Pueblo, Six Middle Rio Grande Pueblos, and special project. The Secretary is defined as the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"State\" in the 2004 Agreement refers specifically to the State of New Mexico. SEC. 4. IRRIGATION INFRASTRUCTURE STUDY. The Secretary will conduct a study of Pueblo irrigation infrastructure, develop a list of recommended projects over a 10-year period, and prioritize based on factors like disrepair and impact on agricultural land irrigation. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits of repairing, rehabilitating, or reconstructing the Pueblo irrigation infrastructure, including water conservation opportunities, economic and cultural impacts on the Rio Grande Pueblo, addressing water supply conflicts, and improving water operations efficiency. The Secretary shall notify Rio Grande Pueblos to consult on the study and projects related to land operations and irrigation infrastructure improvements. Consultation with the Bureau of Indian Affairs is required for developing the project list. The Secretary must consult with relevant agencies to evaluate programs that can assist in evaluating and implementing projects to repair Pueblo irrigation infrastructure. This includes coordination with on-farm improvements and other related projects. The Secretary will report on recommended projects for Pueblo irrigation infrastructure improvement within 18 months of fund availability, including findings from studies, factors consideration, and consultations. Biennial Review: The Secretary, in consultation with each Rio Grande Pueblo, will review and update the list of projects every two years based on factors outlined in subsection (b). SEC. 5. IRRIGATION INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS. The Secretary may provide grants to the Rio Grande Pueblos for projects to repair, rehabilitate, or replace irrigation infrastructure to increase water efficiency, conserve water, or enhance water management in the Rio Grande Basin. Assistance cannot be used for major impoundment structures, on-farm improvements, or irrigation of Rio Grande Pueblo lands. The Secretary shall consult with Rio Grande Pueblos and the Bureau of Indian Affairs for irrigation projects on historically non-irrigated land. The Federal share of project costs shall not exceed 75 percent, with potential waivers by the Secretary. The Secretary may waive or limit the non-Federal share required if the Rio Grande Pueblo demonstrates financial hardship. The District can contribute to the non-Federal share for special projects on land in the Six Middle Rio Grande Pueblos. The District may contribute to the non-Federal share of project costs. The State can also provide a partial or total contribution towards the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share can be in the form of valuable assets or services. The Secretary may allocate funds for projects under subsection (a) that substantially contribute to the project. No funds from section 8(b) can be used for operation or maintenance of projects under subsection (a). SEC. 6. EFFECT ON EXISTING AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITIES. This Act does not affect existing project-specific funding authority or absolve the United States from any responsibility to any Rio Grande Pueblo. SEC. 7. EFFECT ON PUEBLO WATER RIGHTS OR STATE WATER LAW. SEC. 7. EFFECT ON PUEBLO WATER RIGHTS OR STATE WATER LAW.
