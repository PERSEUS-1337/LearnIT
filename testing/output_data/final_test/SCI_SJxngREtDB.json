GumbelClip utilizes truncated importance sampling and additive noise to enable the use of off-policy samples, resulting in faster convergence and improved sample efficiency compared to on-policy algorithms. It competes with existing off-policy policy gradient methods while being simpler to implement. The effectiveness of GumbelClip is demonstrated on a subset of the Atari domain, showcasing advancements in reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. Neural networks, specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), are data-hungry and require millions of samples for convergence. DRL methods are often trained in simulated environments to generate ample data. Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms can be on-policy or off-policy, with off-policy algorithms being more sample-efficient by reusing old experiences. This allows for learning an optimal policy while executing. Off-policy algorithms like Q-Learning enable learning an optimal policy while executing an exploration-focused policy. Deep Q-Learning (DQN) combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks and uses techniques like experience replay for stable convergence. However, action-value methods have limitations in handling stochastic policies and large action spaces. To overcome these limitations, policy gradient methods can be used. The paper proposes adjustments to the A2C algorithm to enable off-policy learning from stored trajectories, resulting in GumbelClip, a simple off-policy actor-critic algorithm in under 10 lines of code. The paper introduces GumbelClip, a simple off-policy actor-critic algorithm with increased sample efficiency and performance compared to on-policy algorithms like A2C. It covers background information, describes the algorithm, presents experimental results, and discusses future work and conclusions. The policy in reinforcement learning is a probability distribution over actions based on states. The agent observes the state, chooses an action, and receives a reward. The goal is to maximize future returns using a discount factor. The value function of a policy is the expected return. The policy gradient theorem is used to optimize parameters for the stochastic policy. Parameters are updated based on the gradient of the discounted reward objectives. The advantage function reduces gradient estimator variance while maintaining bias. Gumbel-Softmax distribution approximates samples from categorical distribution using Gumbel noise. The policy gradient is estimated from samples generated by the on-policy distribution \u03c0(a|s), limiting efficiency compared to off-policy methods like Deep Q-Learning. Importance sampling is used to incorporate off-policy samples, but suffers from high variance. Truncating importance weights can help reduce variance. GumbelClip, based on A2C, introduces clipped importance sampling, policy forcing with Gumbel noise, and large batch sizes from replay memory. It defines current policy, behavior policy, and forced policy using Gumbel-Softmax distribution for off-policy learning. The study introduces policy forcing with Gumbel noise to make the sampled policy distribution more categorical. It uses importance sampling with clipped weights and updates parameters \u03b8 and \u03b8v using replay memory. The update equation for GumbelClip involves clipping the range of importance weights to prevent exploding products and reduce variance. The gradient is estimated by sampling trajectories from replay memory, and network parameters are updated using a forced policy. The advantage function is the bootstrapped k-step return. Importance weights tend to clump near boundaries, as shown in Figure 2. The effect of clipping and Gumbel noise on policy updates is explored in the context of importance sampling in A2C. Three modes exist, representing agreement and disagreement cases. When the forced policy disagrees with the behavior policy, the update is clipped by an upper bound. Experiments focus on the Atari domain due to its variety in environments and representation of states as high-dimensional pixels. The study used the gym software package to conduct experiments on playing Atari games using raw pixel observations. The network architecture included three convolutional layers with specific filter sizes and strides, followed by a fully-connected layer with rectified non-linearity. The experiments ran on a GPU with 16 threads, trained for 40 million frames, and used a replay memory of size 250000. Updates were performed every 5 steps in the environment. The study used gym software to experiment with playing Atari games using raw pixel observations. The network architecture included three convolutional layers and a fully-connected layer with rectified non-linearity. Updates were performed every 5 steps in the environment, with a clamping coefficient of 4. RMSProp was used for optimization with a learning rate of 5e \u2212 4 and a discount factor of 0.99. 64 trajectories of length 5 were sampled for each update, starting after collecting 10,000 samples in the replay memory. GumbelClip was developed and tested on the FishingDerby environment, showing improved run time over A2C. Limited computational resources only allowed evaluation of GumbelClip on a subset of environments. In this study, GumbelClip was evaluated on a subset of environments against off-policy (ACER) and on-policy (A2C) actor-critic algorithms. The training performance across 8 Atari games showed that GumbelClip matched or exceeded the performance of A2C on all environments, with improved convergence speed. It also showed respectable performance compared to the ACER algorithm on many environments. The study evaluated GumbelClip on Atari environments, comparing it with ACER and A2C actor-critic algorithms. GumbelClip showed comparable or better performance than A2C across all environments and performed well compared to ACER on many environments. The methodology was tested using a modified A2C implementation and a replay memory capacity of 50000 per thread. The performance of GumbelClip was evaluated on select Atari environments, including Alien, BeamRider, Boxing, FishingDerby, MsPacman, Qbert, Seaquest, and SpaceInvaders. Results showed that GumbelClip outperformed the on-policy ACER algorithm and the off-policy A2C algorithm in terms of sample efficiency and convergence speed. GumbelClip outperforms ACER and A2C in sample efficiency and performance across various environments. The use of additive noise and clamping has mixed effects, with GumbelClip showing faster initial performance gains but potential bias issues. Despite outperforming A2C, GumbelClip falls short compared to ACER in the Qbert environment. Its simplicity and minimal changes to the A2C algorithm contribute to its superior performance over other on-policy actor-critic methods. The impact of noise drawn from different distributions (Gumbel, Normal, Uniform) on the forced policy F(a|s) performance is compared in experiments on the Alien Atari game. Results show that Gumbel and Normal distributions initially improve at the same rate but diverge midway through training, with the Normal distribution degrading before stabilizing. The Uniform distribution shows similar convergence characteristics to the other two distributions. The Gumbel distribution shows superior performance compared to Normal and Uniform distributions in experiments on the Alien Atari game. GumbelClip demonstrates stability even with extended training time of 150 million frames on Boxing and FishingDerby environments. The GumbelClip algorithm maintains stability during extended training on Boxing and FishingDerby environments. Ablations were performed to analyze performance improvements, with results shown in Figure 6. The GumbelClip algorithm is tested for stability in training on Boxing and FishingDerby environments. Ablations in Figure 6 show performance improvements by gradually adding components to the off-policy A2C algorithm. The addition of a larger batch size from 16 to 64 trajectories results in a +21.30% increase over the base version. The addition of noise and an aggressive clamp on the importance sampling ratio further improve performance in the off-policy A2C algorithm. The change in Equation 8 from \u03c0(a|s) to F(a|s) is highlighted, showing that batch size and noise contribute significantly to performance gains. The histograms in Figure 7 illustrate the impact of adding components on the distribution of \u03c1. The addition of Gumbel noise in the off-policy A2C algorithm improves performance by increasing smoothness between 0 \u2192 1, creating a fatter tail from mode 1 \u2192 c, and increasing density across all modes. The histograms in Figure 7 show the effect of adding components on the distribution of \u03c1, with clear modes at 0, 1, and c. GumbelClip is best suited for environments with discrete actions. In this paper, GumbelClip is introduced as a modification to the on-policy A2C algorithm, allowing for full off-policy learning from stored trajectories in a replay memory. The approach involves aggressive clipping of importance weights, large batch sizes, and additive noise from the Gumbel distribution. Empirical validation and ablations demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of GumbelClip, outperforming A2C in terms of performance and sample efficiency. GumbelClip, a modification to the A2C algorithm, shows comparable performance and sample efficiency to ACER with minimal changes needed for implementation."
