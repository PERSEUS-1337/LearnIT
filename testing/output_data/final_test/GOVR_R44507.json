    "content": "In March 2014, the WHO identified a rapidly evolving outbreak of Ebola in Guinea, which later spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone. Weak disease detection systems failed to identify the outbreak early. The international community's efforts to contain the disease began in mid-2015, with WHO declaring Ebola a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in August 2014. The disease had reached Nigeria, infected 1,779 people, and claimed 961 lives by then. Some criticized WHO for the delayed response. In December 2015, WHO declared the end of human-to-human Ebola transmission in Guinea, marking the first time all three affected countries had stopped the original chains of transmission. By then, there were 28,637 confirmed Ebola cases worldwide, with 11,315 deaths reported. WHO warned of potential small outbreaks despite the significant progress made in containing the disease. In December 2015, WHO declared the end of human-to-human Ebola transmission in Guinea, marking the first time all three affected countries had stopped the original chains of transmission. Since then, WHO has reported 19 more cases, including 8 deaths. Congress allocated $88 million for U.S. Ebola response in September 2014, with funds for CDC activities in West Africa and research on treatments and vaccines. In October 2014, President Obama announced a \"whole-of-government\" response to the Ebola outbreak, deploying the U.S. military to build Ebola treatment units in Liberia. Congress provided $5.4 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for the U.S. government Ebola response in FY2015. Congress appropriated roughly half of the funds for international Ebola responses to the Department of State and USAID through Title IX, Division J of P.L. 113-235. The foreign affairs funds, totaling over $2.5 billion, were limited to Ebola response but could also be used for preparedness efforts in countries at risk. The Secretary of State and USAID Administrator were authorized to make fund transfers within Title IX for Ebola-related purposes with congressional notification. As of March 1, 2016, less than half of the $2.5 billion has been obligated by the Department of State and USAID. As of March 1, 2016, less than half of the $2.5 billion international Ebola emergency funding has been obligated by the Department of State and USAID. USAID disbanded its Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) in West Africa in January 2016, which coordinated the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak. Various agencies had specific roles in the response, such as USAID managing international responses, CDC leading medical components, NIH supporting research, and the Department of State advancing diplomatic efforts. The DOD deployed troops to construct ETUs in West Africa, along with CDC and USAID personnel. U.S. agencies collaborated to procure diagnostic tests, support contact tracing, train healthcare workers, and enhance diagnostic capacity. Ebola control efforts in West Africa are in Phase 3. Ebola control efforts in West Africa are in Phase 3, with limited transmission and low probability of large-scale outbreaks. WHO and partners focused on isolating cases in Phase 1, then emphasized surveillance and community engagement in Phase 2. Health officials expressed confidence in managing residual risks at a meeting in March 2016. Since the primary Ebola outbreak ended in December 2015, the three countries have successfully led collaborative efforts to contain small outbreaks. In March 2016, Guinean, Liberian, and WHO officials identified and contained a small outbreak, causing 13 suspected cases in Guinea and Liberia. Local Guinean health authorities reactivated the emergency coordination mechanism to manage the response, deploying WHO experts for containment efforts. In March 2016, an interagency team including experts and NGOs contained a small Ebola outbreak in Guinea and Liberia. Over 1,000 contacts were monitored and provided support, with 1,500 people vaccinated with VSV-EBOV. The vaccine was found effective in preventing Ebola infection in a 2015 trial. The \"ring vaccination\" strategy is now a standard procedure. According to a March 2016 report by the Inspectors General of USAID and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), efforts have been made to restore primary health services in Ebola-affected countries. In Guinea, the U.S. government supported the restoration of basic health services at 90 facilities by providing IPC training for over 2,800 health care workers. USAID developed IPC training curriculum, supervised health practitioners, while CDC aided in developing a national IPC policy and supported IPC action plans in affected areas. The United States reduced funding for Ebola response activities in 2015, with no U.S.-funded ETUs operational. Support was provided for only a few laboratories in Guinea and Liberia. Safe burial teams were demobilized in Liberia, and safe burials were no longer a core response in Sierra Leone. The USAID and HHS Inspectors General reported that USAID and CDC supported case investigation and contact tracing efforts in Liberia and Guinea in November 2015 and March 2016, collaborating with other organizations to vaccinate contacts. The United States continues to play a crucial role in containing Ebola flare-ups in the region, despite uncertainties about long-term health system strengthening plans. WHO declared the West Africa Ebola outbreak no longer a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on March 29, 2016. At a March meeting convened by WHO, representatives from Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone expressed concerns about sustaining human resources for Ebola response, addressing long-term health needs of survivors, and preventing further transmission. Country leaders doubted their capacity to maintain lab facilities, train rapid response teams, sustain disease surveillance systems, and provide specialized services for health complications of Ebola survivors. The challenges faced by countries in controlling and eliminating Ebola include the virus persisting in various parts of the body after acute symptoms resolve. Researchers are studying the implications of this persistence for survivors' health and potential disease transmission. Ebola survivors may experience health complications weeks or months after recovery, with musculoskeletal pain, joint stiffness, arthritis, and eye pain being common. Ebola survivors often experience musculoskeletal pain, joint stiffness, arthritis, eye problems, tinnitus, hearing loss, abdominal pain, headache, and memory impairment. Ocular issues such as uveitis, cataracts, and optic nerve disease can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. Access to specialized healthcare, particularly for ocular conditions, is limited in the affected countries, resulting in a growing number of survivors losing their eyesight. Ebola survivors face challenges in accessing specialized healthcare for ocular issues, leading to potential blindness. Uncertainty about risks during surgery on Ebola patients has hindered ocular treatments. Survivors also report peripheral neuropathy, tremors, muscle weakness, seizures, and Parkinsonism. Ebola in pregnancy results in high obstetric complications and neonatal mortality. WHO has identified newborns with Ebola. Health experts are uncertain about how long the Ebola virus remains in the bodies of survivors, with the virus being identified in the eyes, semen, and other bodily fluids of survivors one year after recovery. Male survivors are advised to use condoms during sexual intercourse and undergo regular screenings until two negative test results are achieved. Scientists are uncertain about the duration and infectivity of Ebola virus in breastmilk. Ebola virus has been detected in breastmilk up to 16 months after symptoms. WHO recommends testing breastmilk for Ebola in lactating survivors. If virus is detected, suspend breastfeeding, use premixed formula, and retest every 48 hours until two negative results. Limited access to clean water and healthcare in affected countries poses challenges for lactating mothers with Ebola. Access to health care is limited for lactating mothers with Ebola, making it unlikely they receive advice on using infant formula safely. Breastmilk testing is also limited, raising concerns about Ebola transmission. WHO recommends regular health assessments for Ebola survivors for at least a year. However, providing care for over 11,000 survivors is a challenging task for affected countries. The affected countries struggle with maintaining behavioral change, such as safe burial practices and condom use. The UNFPA is providing free condoms and awareness campaigns to prevent sexual transmission of Ebola and other diseases. Concerns exist about the ability of governments to sustain health system improvements. Some health facilities in Liberia have improved their infection prevention and control protocols post-Ebola outbreak, but there are concerns about their ability to maintain these protocols as international funding decreases. Observers fear that supplies, practices, and payments for health personnel may not continue. Some health clinics in West Africa are still facing challenges in maintaining infection prevention and control protocols, such as interruptions in running water. Despite the low Ebola caseload, there are ongoing technical issues and risks that require significant government support. The organization warned of technical issues and high consequence risks that require government and partner coordination. Maintaining health care gains, combating complacency, and improving communication practices remain challenges. Infrastructural constraints persist in all three countries, with ongoing efforts to resolve supply chain management issues in Guinea. Analysts are concerned about the impact of numerous Ebola deaths among health workers. Analysts are concerned about the impact of numerous Ebola deaths among health workers, lingering mistrust of government health facilities, and long-term health issues facing Ebola survivors in the affected countries. Limited access to health services and high mortality rates for children were prevalent even before the outbreak. Delivery of services was severely disrupted during the epidemic, contributing to a decline in healthcare services in Liberia. During the Ebola epidemic, healthcare services in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea were severely disrupted. Outpatient visits in Liberia declined by 61%, malaria care for children in Sierra Leone dropped by 39%, and immunizations fell by 21%. In Guinea, primary medical consultations decreased by 58%, hospitalizations by 54%, and vaccinations by 30%. The high number of Ebola deaths among health workers further limited the supply of health personnel and led to additional restrictions on health services. Over 500 health workers were killed by Ebola in the three countries, resulting in increased non-Ebola related illnesses and deaths due to interruptions in basic healthcare delivery. During the Ebola outbreak, healthcare services in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea were severely disrupted, leading to increased deaths from TB, malaria, and HIV due to inadequate capacity. The long-term impact includes concerns about providing basic healthcare and access to services for Ebola survivors. The outbreak also damaged the economies of the affected countries, with Sierra Leone experiencing a 21.5% contraction in 2015 and job losses. Despite employment levels rebounding, employees were working fewer hours and earning lower wages. During the Ebola outbreak, healthcare services in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea were severely disrupted, leading to increased deaths from TB, malaria, and HIV due to inadequate capacity. Roughly 12% of Liberian businesses surveyed have closed, and Guinea's economic growth fell from 2.3% in 2013 to 0.6% in 2014. Despite the economies of the three countries reportedly recovering, the economic deficits incurred during the outbreak may slow the pace of rebuilding and health system strengthening. Experts project Guinea's economy to expand by 4.3% in 2016 and Sierra Leone's by 20% in 2017. Liberia's Ministry of Health acknowledges the need to improve its health facilities to prevent future outbreaks like Ebola. They estimate the cost of building a resilient health system at $489 million through FY2016 and FY2017, with an additional $1.21 billion through FY2022. The drop in global commodities prices has limited the government's investments in public infrastructure, posing challenges for the country's development. Congress is monitoring the situation closely. Congress is interested in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the disposition of funds. $1.3 billion of the $2.5 billion allocated for international Ebola responses remains unobligated. $600.4 million of the unobligated funds for training and water infrastructure will expire by the end of the fiscal year. The remaining $686.4 million is for activities to prevent Ebola re-emergence. Discussions are ongoing on the use of these funds for emerging health crises. In response to emerging health crises, Congress is discussing the use of unobligated Ebola funds for other infectious diseases like Zika virus. President Obama requested nearly $1.9 billion for a U.S. domestic and international Zika response, with a portion allocated for international efforts. The Administration proposed transferring funds from existing Ebola accounts to address the Zika virus. In May 2016, the House introduced a bill (H.R. 5243) to provide $622.1 million for Zika response efforts until September 30, 2016, with a portion designated as emergency funds. The bill includes rescissions of certain Ebola-related appropriations and the HHS nonrecurring expenses fund. Its appropriations are subject to the same requirements as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The House passed the measure on May 18, 2016, without amendment. Senate action on the bill occurred in the context of other appropriations bills in May 2016. On May 12, 2016, Senator McConnell proposed an amendment to provide $1.1 billion for Zika response and preparedness until September 30, 2017. The Senate adopted the amendment on May 19, 2016. USAID Administrator Gayle Smith argued against reprogramming Ebola funds, stating that resources are still needed for West African countries to prepare for future outbreaks and strengthen health systems. Members of Congress opposed reprogramming Ebola funds, advocating for their preservation to support weak health systems in West Africa. Residual Ebola funds should be preserved to strengthen weak health systems in West Africa. The U.S. government's role in supporting long-term recovery in the region is unclear. USAID's obligations for Ebola-related activities appeared to be declining, with few new programs initiated in FY2016. During the second quarter of FY2016, USAID obligated $12.7 million primarily for Ebola detection and reporting efforts in the region. Recommendations include the U.S. government taking a more active role in strengthening the WHO for future outbreaks and providing incentives for countries to enhance their health security. Specifically, it is proposed that USAID or the CDC develop incentives for countries to adopt best practices in disease response and preparedness. Some proposals suggest incentivizing countries to adopt best practices in disease response and preparedness to strengthen global health security. Recommendations also include revising current approaches and exploring budget instruments for permanent preparedness. Other suggestions involve contributing to global health emergency funds for faster financing release and coordinated funding mechanisms during pandemics. Some observers propose that Congress require U.S. agencies to report data on Ebola spending and progress in a more integrated, consistent, and publicly available manner. Quarterly progress reports from USAID on ongoing Ebola efforts provide an overview of activities but lack sufficient information on outcomes. There is a need for appropriate mechanisms to track spending and link performance indicators. In 2015, disease outbreaks like dengue, chikungunya, and Zika have spread into the United States, highlighting the importance of global health security. Several groups advocate for increased investments in research and development for neglected diseases, which lack vaccines or treatment options. The international community would need to double current investments in health research and development to $6 billion by 2020 to meet global health goals. The United States leads in public investment for global health research and development, funding a majority of neglected diseases and supporting over half of global health products in development. Some experts suggest increasing funding for FDA Priority Review Voucher program to boost research on neglected diseases. Recommendations include adding a \"novelty\" requirement to encourage new investments and ensuring affordability of products granted a FDA priority voucher. Examples of U.S. support for the West Africa Ebola outbreak include efforts by USAID and HHS agencies to restore basic health services and advance long-term Ebola response. USAID has supported the construction of temporary isolation units at health care facilities in three countries to integrate EBOLA care, build rapid response capacity, and institutionalize infection prevention protocols. In Sierra Leone, USAID constructed 90 semipermanent isolation units. Efforts were also made to strengthen the government supply chain system in Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Sierra Leone, USAID provided technical assistance for monitoring and tracking supplies and essential medicines. USAID also led interagency transition planning to transfer U.S. government-supported activities. In Liberia, USAID reopened primary health care facilities, completed facility assessments, provided essential medicines, and supported immunization campaigns. The USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team disbanded in 2016, and country program offices in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have since led Ebola responses. CDC supported the development of healthcare in Liberia. In Liberia, CDC supported the development of a national training curriculum for healthcare worker safety and quality of healthcare services, reaching over 1,000 workers. In Sierra Leone, CDC funded training on national IPC guidelines for 50 hospital and district workers and sponsored the STRIVE trial to assess the rVSV-ZEBOV candidate's safety and efficacy. CDC also enhanced Ebola surveillance by facilitating procurement of diagnostic tools and providing mobile laboratories. In collaboration with the University of Sierra Leone and the Ministry of Health, CDC vaccinated over 8,000 participants. In Liberia, CDC supported semen screening and counseling for male survivors to reduce transmission risks. WHO reported screening 405 male survivors' semen by January 3, 2016. Project SHIELD in Sierra Leone enrolled 650 male survivors for semen testing by December 14, 2015, with training provided for healthcare workers and peer networks on sexual risk reduction counseling. Several U.S. agencies collaborated on clinical trials for Ebola vaccines and therapeutics in the United States and West Africa. In Liberia, NIH and CDC partnered with the government to conduct studies on Ebola vaccine candidates. The FDA facilitated the export of vaccines to Liberia during an outbreak in 2015. The Government of Liberia and NIH vaccinated around 170 individuals. PREVAIL III study was launched in June 2015 to understand long-term consequences. The Government of Liberia launched the PREVAIL III study in June 2015 to understand the long-term consequences of Ebola, immunity development in survivors, transmission risks, with over 1,788 individuals enrolled as of January 4, 2016."
