    "content": "Lying or making a false statement is a federal crime under various circumstances, including making a material false statement to a federal agency or department, committing perjury before a federal tribunal, inducing someone to commit perjury, or conspiring to commit these crimes. False certifications can also be punishable as perjury. Additionally, a defendant's sentence for another federal offense may be enhanced if they are found to have made a false statement during the investigation or trial. The federal law prohibits false statements, concealment, or false documentation within the jurisdiction of the federal government branches. Section 1001 of the statute outlines the scope of the law, applying to the executive, judicial, and legislative branches. Section 1001 of the federal law prohibits falsifying, concealing, or using false documents in matters within the jurisdiction of the US government branches. Violators can face fines and imprisonment up to 5 years, or up to 8 years for offenses related to terrorism or specific criminal activities. The Dictionary Act states that \"whoever\" includes corporations and individuals. The use of \"includes\" is illustrative, not exclusive. Section 1001 prohibits falsifying documents within federal jurisdiction, applicable to corporations as well. The phrase 'within the jurisdiction' refers to matters under the authority of a federal agency or department. It includes false statements made to state, local, or private entities involving federal funds or regulations. Section 1001(b) provides an exception for false statements presented in judicial proceedings, covering statements made to the court even if they lead to executive branch efforts. This exception also applies to false statements of indigency filed by defendants seeking legal counsel. Section 1001 applies to false statements within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch, including financial disclosure statements and statements in congressional investigations. The government must prove that the defendant acted knowingly and willfully, presenting false information with intent. The offense of making false statements under Section 1001 requires the defendant to knowingly and willfully present false information with the intent to deceive. It is not necessary to prove that the defendant knew the statement involved a federal entity or intended to defraud one. Materiality is a key element in prosecution for this offense, similar to perjury. The offense of making false statements under Section 1001 requires presenting false information with the intent to deceive. Materiality is crucial, and the statute includes elements of concealment, false statements, and false writings. Prosecutions for concealment must prove a duty not to conceal, while false statements apply to anyone making false statements. Conviction under Subsection 1001(a)(2) requires knowing that a statement is false. Defenses are limited, and there is no safe harbor for recantation. The \"exculpatory no\" doctrine was rejected by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court rejected the \"exculpatory no\" doctrine under Section 1001, which covers written false statements. To establish a violation, the government must prove the statement is false, material, knowingly made, and concerns a federal entity's jurisdiction. There are three primary perjury statutes, each involving false statements or writings. Section 1621 is one of three primary perjury statutes, involving false statements made under oath. It includes two offenses for testimony and written statements, where a person willfully states or subscribes to a material matter they do not believe to be true. Perjury under oath involves making false statements or subscribing to untrue material matters, punishable by fines or imprisonment for up to five years. The Supreme Court defines perjury as willfully giving false testimony, not due to confusion or faulty memory. The term \"whoever\" includes individuals and entities like corporations, unless specified otherwise by law. Corporations can be held liable for crimes committed by employees for their benefit. Conviction for perjury requires knowingly making false statements willfully. The definition of \"willful\" in this context is not clearly defined. Perjury under Section 1621(1) requires the prosecution to prove the defendant knowingly made false statements willfully. The Supreme Court clarified in Bronston v. United States that literal truth, even if deceptive, does not constitute perjury. This was illustrated in a case where a witness truthfully denied having a Swiss bank account but deceptively answered a follow-up question about ever having one. The Supreme Court's decision in Bronston v. United States highlighted that literal truth, even if deceptive, does not amount to perjury under Section 1621(1). The case involved a witness who truthfully denied having a Swiss bank account but evasively responded to a follow-up question. The Court emphasized that perjury cannot be based on ambiguous questions, and the responsibility lies with the questioner to ask precise questions. The ambiguity in answering questions may not support a perjury conviction under Section 1621(1), as per the Bronston v. United States case. The distinction between permissible and impermissible ambiguity is challenging to define, with some courts finding it impossible. Compliance with the common law \"two-witness rule\" is required to establish falsity in a statement for perjury conviction. Conviction under Section 1621(1) requires the government to prove the falsity of the statement with two independent witnesses or one witness and corroborating evidence. A false statement must be material to be considered perjury, capable of influencing the decisionmaker. A contemporaneous correction of a false statement may not negate its materiality. Perjury is completed when a false statement is presented to the tribunal, and recantation is not a defense. Section 1621(2) added in 1976 allows for perjury without an oath in various certifications and declarations under penalty of perjury. Section 1621(2) allows for perjury without an oath in certifications and declarations under penalty of perjury, applicable within or outside the United States. It serves as an enforcement mechanism for Section 1746, which provides an option for under-penalty-of-perjury statements required by federal statutes or regulations. Prosecutions under Section 1621(2) seem to focus on individuals rather than corporations or entities. Section 1623 was enacted by Congress to simplify perjury prosecutions by allowing convictions for inconsistent statements without proving one false. It includes a limited recantation defense, eliminates the two-witness rule, and requires a \"knowing\" mens rea standard. Perjury under Section 1623 of title 28, United States Code involves knowingly making a false material declaration under oath in a court or grand jury proceeding. The government must establish that the defendant knowingly made a false material declaration under oath. The Dictionary Act defines \"whoever\" to include individuals and entities. The Dictionary Act defines \"whoever\" to include individuals and entities like corporations, unless the statute suggests otherwise. Corporations can be held liable for crimes committed by employees for their benefit. Section 1623 covers false statements under oath or \"under penalty of perjury\" in court or grand jury proceedings. The phrase \"proceedings ancillary to\" court or grand jury proceedings covers various legal proceedings, including depositions in civil litigation, habeas proceedings, bail hearings, and suppression hearings. Perjury under Section 1623 requires a knowingly false statement, not confusion or faulty memory. Deliberate ignorance or willful blindness to the falsehood can also satisfy this requirement. Perjury under Section 1623 requires knowingly false statements, not confusion or faulty memory. Deliberate ignorance or willful blindness to the falsehood can also satisfy this requirement. Conviction for perjury requires two necessarily inconsistent material declarations made under oath, with one statement of necessity being false. The Supreme Court upheld the ruling that a perjury conviction can be based on the testimony of one witness, contrary to the traditional two-witness rule. Materiality is a key element in perjury cases, defined as having the potential to influence decision-making. This definition can be challenging to apply in certain legal proceedings like grand jury hearings or civil suit depositions. In legal proceedings like grand jury hearings or civil suit depositions, materiality is a key element in perjury cases. The courts have different views on what constitutes materiality, with some focusing on the potential to lead to admissible evidence and others on the impact on the outcome of the suit. The \"perjury trap\" doctrine has been used to address materiality issues in cases of false testimony before the grand jury. The \"perjury trap\" doctrine deals with witnesses called solely to elicit false testimony, posing no bar to prosecution in most cases. Section 1623 addresses obstacles to perjury prosecution, with subsection 1623(d) offering a defense where a false declaration is admitted in the same proceeding. The courts require specific and thorough repudiation of false testimony for a defense under section 1623(d) to be valid. Disagreement exists on whether the defense is denied if either the false statement substantially affected the proceeding or if its exposure is imminent. Most courts agree that either condition will invalidate the defense. The defense under section 1623(d) may be available to a witness if there is no adverse impact or likely exposure of their false statement. Corrections of earlier statements can negate the inference of knowingly presenting false testimony, preventing conviction for perjury. Subsection 1622 prohibits inducing another to commit perjury, with two elements required for conviction. Perjury under Section 1621 or 1623 can support a conviction for subornation under Section 1622. Subornation under Section 1622 requires proof of perjury, knowing induced statement is false, and knowingly and willfully inducing. Prosecution for subornation is rare due to ease of prosecuting as obstruction of justice under different statutes. Section 371 prohibits conspiring to commit federal offenses, including perjury and subornation. Conspiracy under Section 371 requires agreement of two or more people to commit a federal crime, punishable by up to five years in prison. Perjury, subornation of perjury, and false statements are also punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Offenders may be punished for conspiracy and the underlying crime, as well as any crime committed in furtherance of the scheme. The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines play a significant role in federal sentencing, with obstruction of justice being a factor that can enhance a defendant's sentence. The Guidelines assign offense levels based on aggravating factors, with the final offense level determining the sentencing range based on the defendant's criminal history category. For example, a final offense level of 15 could result in a sentencing range of 18 to 24 months for a first-time offender and 41 to 51 months for a defendant with an extensive criminal record. The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines assign offense levels based on aggravating factors, with the final offense level determining the sentencing range based on the defendant's criminal history category. A 2-level increase can result in a difference of up to 68 months in sentencing. Section 3C1.1 instructs courts to add 2 offense levels for obstruction of justice related to the defendant's offense of conviction. The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines assign offense levels based on aggravating factors, with the final offense level determining the sentencing range based on the defendant's criminal history category. Section 3C1.1 instructs courts to add 2 offense levels for obstruction of justice related to the defendant's offense of conviction, which can result in a significant increase in sentencing. The provision is not intended to punish a defendant for exercising a constitutional right, such as denying guilt or refusing to provide information to a probation officer. Perjury during trial can lead to sentence enhancement under this section, covering perjurious and false statements in various judicial contexts. The commentary in this section covers conduct such as committing perjury, providing false information to a judge or law enforcement officer, and obstructing justice. Courts have found sentencing enhancements appropriate for giving perjurious testimony or false statements in legal proceedings. The lower federal appellate courts are divided over whether an obstruction of justice enhancement may be based on a defendant's false statement of indigence to secure counsel. Perjury and false statements in legal proceedings can lead to sentencing enhancements. The court must find that the defendant willfully testified falsely with respect to a material matter to warrant a sentencing enhancement under the section. False identification at the time of arrest only warrants a sentencing enhancement when the deception significantly hinders the investigation or prosecution."
