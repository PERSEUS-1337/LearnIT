    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iran Diplomatic Accountability Act of 2008\". Congress finds that the National Intelligence Estimate concluded Iran had a covert nuclear weapons program, which was halted in 2003. Concerns remain about Iran's intentions and behavior regarding nuclear weapons development. The United States should work with all interested parties, including the IAEA, to permanently terminate Iran's nuclear weapons program, bring its nuclear energy program under IAEA control, and engage in direct talks with Iran to resolve tensions. SEC. 3. APPOINTMENT OF HIGH-LEVEL U.S. REPRESENTATIVE OR SPECIAL ENVOY. The President shall appoint a high-level US representative or special envoy for Iran based on knowledge of Iran's nuclear program, negotiation experience, and ability to build trust. The appointee will conduct direct negotiations with Iran to ease tensions and consult with other countries and organizations. The appointed US representative will conduct direct negotiations with Iran, act as a liaison with intelligence agencies, and ensure bilateral negotiations complement international negotiations with Iran. The Secretary of State will establish an office to support the high-level US representative or special envoy appointed under section 3(a). Additionally, a report to Congress will be required. SEC. 5. REPORTING TO CONGRESS. The United States representative or special envoy for Iran appointed under section 3 shall report to specified congressional committees every 180 days on negotiations progress, in classified or unclassified form. Committees include those on Appropriations, Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, and Intelligence in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 is granted to carry out the Act."
