    "title": "SB 1347",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 51283 of the Government Code in California is amended to require the county assessor to determine the fair market value of land before canceling a contract. The assessor must provide this valuation to the board or council for determining the cancellation fee, and notify the landowner and Department of Conservation of the current value. The assessor must provide relevant valuation information to parties upon request, keeping confidential information secure. A cancellation fee of 12 1/2 percent of the property's valuation must be paid by the landowner upon contract cancellation approval. The board or council may waive payment or extend time for payment if cancellation is due to involuntary transfer or change in land use not immediately suitable for greater economic return to owner. Payment may be deferred or not required if in the best interests of conserving agricultural land use. The Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency can approve a waiver or extension of time if it aligns with chapter policies and the board or council's compliance. The secretary evaluates the request based on the board or council's findings and evidence in the record. In the 2004\u201305 fiscal year, the first $2,536,000 of revenue paid to the Controller will be deposited in the Soil Conservation Fund for various conservation programs and support costs as approved by the Legislature. The costs for administering Section 51250 and grants to resource conservation districts are subject to specific conditions. Cancellation fees collected are to be transmitted to the Controller and deposited in the General Fund, except in certain cases. Funds from each contract cancellation must be sent to the Controller within 30 days. The Legislature intends that cancellation fees are not considered taxes but payments that provide a private benefit. A competitive grant program will be established to assist resource conservation districts in implementing projects to improve soil conservation, carbon sequestration, moisture retention, and land resource quality. Section 4214 of the Public Resources Code is amended to specify how fire prevention fees will be expended, with the State Board of Equalization retaining funds for refunds and expenses related to fee collection. Funding for certain programs under the Government Code is contingent on receiving necessary funding first. The moneys collected, other than those retained by the State Board of Equalization, shall be deposited into the State Responsibility Area Fire Prevention Fund for fire prevention activities benefiting owners of habitable structures in state responsibility areas. Excess funds will be used for fire prevention activities in counties with state responsibility areas, and the fund may also cover administration costs. The State Responsibility Area Fire Prevention Fund is intended to cover administration costs and fund fire prevention activities for owners of habitable structures in state responsibility areas. Moneys in the fund are allocated for local assistance grants, projects by Fire Safe Councils, and activities by the California Conservation Corps. The State Responsibility Area Fire Prevention Fund covers administration costs and funds fire prevention activities for habitable structures in state responsibility areas. Grants are provided to nonprofit organizations for fire prevention projects, inspections are conducted for defensible space compliance, public education is conducted to reduce fire risk, fire severity mapping is done, and other fire prevention projects are authorized. The board establishes a local assistance grant program for fire prevention activities benefiting habitable structures in state responsibility areas. Grants are based on the number of structures for which the applicant is responsible and the funds allocated in the annual Budget Act. The board must submit an annual report to the Legislature on the fund's status and uses, including benefits to counties, grant program effectiveness, defensible space inspections, compliance levels, and recommendations. The reporting requirement is no longer in effect after January 31, 2022. The report must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code. To ensure timely implementation, the department may contract for services to establish the fire prevention fee collection process without following public contracting laws for up to 24 months."
