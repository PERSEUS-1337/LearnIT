    "content": "SECTION 1. CREDIT FOR FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section for the purchase of a principal residence by first-time homebuyers. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows a 10% credit for first-time homebuyers on the purchase price of a principal residence, capped at $6,500. Married couples filing jointly can only claim the credit if both are first-time homebuyers. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers is capped at $6,500. For married individuals filing separately, the credit is only available if the individual is a first-time homebuyer, with a reduced amount of $3,250. If multiple unmarried individuals purchase a home together, the credit can be allocated among them, but the total credit cannot exceed $6,500. The term 'first-time homebuyer' refers to an individual who has not owned a principal residence in the US in the past 3 years. Once a person is considered a first-time homebuyer for one residence, they cannot be considered for another. The definition of 'principal residence' is the same as in section 121. The terms 'purchase' and 'purchase price' are defined in section 1400C(e). Any excess credit in a taxable year can be carried forward to the next year. Reporting requirements may be necessary to verify eligibility for the credit. No double benefit is allowed if the credit under section 1400C is claimed. The basis of a residence is reduced by the amount of the credit allowed under section 1400C. The provisions apply to a principal residence if a binding contract is entered into before June 1, 2002, and the residence is purchased and occupied before January 1, 2003. Amendments are made to the general rule for adjustments to basis in section 1016 of the Code. The text chunk introduces new amendments to various sections of the tax code, including changes related to the allowance of credits for residences under section 25B and 1400C. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. Section 25B allows for the purchase of a principal residence by a first-time homebuyer. The amendments made by this section will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2000."
