    "content": "The U.S.-led military actions in Afghanistan and Iraq have raised concerns about women's rights in the post-war reconstruction process. Efforts are being made to help women participate in political, educational, and economic life after years of gender-based repression and economic exclusion. Congressional initiatives are addressing various issues related to women in these countries, with a focus on political, economic, and social aspects. The report focuses on foreign aid for humanitarian and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and Iraq, with an emphasis on women's inclusion in governance, education, workforce, and healthcare. Conditions for women in Afghanistan have improved since 2001, with increased access to education and job opportunities. Despite improvements in access to education and job opportunities for Afghan women since 2001, many still struggle to find culturally appropriate work close to home with reasonable pay due to lack of education and skills. While women have made progress in political participation, conservative attitudes persist in rural areas, especially in the south and east. Iraqi women have historically fared well compared to other Middle Eastern countries, with equal rights under the 1970 Constitution. However, conditions worsened under Saddam Hussein's regime, impacting women disproportionately due to Islamic and tribal traditions. Conditions for women in Iraq have improved post the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, with greater civil rights and educational opportunities. While there is progress in political representation, women face challenges under Islamist policies, especially in rural areas with conservative leaders. Gender discrimination and austere dress codes indicate regression in women's rights. Women in Iraq face challenges such as economic insecurity, political violence, and restrictive dress codes, hindering their development and integration. The fragile situation in the country limits humanitarian assistance, making it difficult to meet basic needs. Women in Kurdish areas have more opportunities compared to those in central and southern Iraq. Specific legislative earmarks support programs for Afghan women and children, highlighting the ongoing struggles faced by women in the region. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2006 includes a $50 million earmark for programs directly addressing the needs of Afghan women and girls, with $7.5 million allocated to support women-led non-governmental organizations. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2006 allocates $7.5 million to support women-led NGOs in Afghanistan. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 includes $50 million for programs benefiting women and girls, with a portion designated for women-led NGOs. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required a strategy for women's rights in Afghanistan, but no funding was provided. Two bills, S. 2032 and H.R. 4117, aimed to provide $300 million in appropriations for Afghan women in fiscal years 2005-2007. Specific amounts were earmarked for the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. Despite being introduced in Congress, neither bill was enacted into law. The President's FY2005 budget did not specify aid amounts for women, but indicated that development funds would benefit women and girls. The Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief in 2005 included funding for Afghan women's organizations, but it was removed before final passage. Previous acts earmarked funds for programs supporting Afghan women, including training, equipment, education, shelters, and rights programs. In FY2003, funding was allocated for women's programs in Afghanistan, including support for women's centers, humanitarian assistance, education, health, legal rights, economic opportunities, and political participation. The Asia Foundation and the National Endowment for Democracy also received funding for women's rights in Afghanistan. The Afghan Women and Children Relief Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-81) authorized educational and health care assistance for Afghan women and children. The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-327) allocated $15 million for the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs. USAID supports Afghan women through various grants and programs, including assistance for NGOs and income generation opportunities. Afghanistan is a significant recipient of U.S. foreign aid, ranking third in FY2006. USAID and the State Department provide support for women in agriculture and rural areas, as well as Afghan refugees and vulnerable populations. Progress has been made in economic growth, democracy, education, and health. USAID partners focus on promoting women's political participation. The State Department's PRM supports Afghan refugees, IDPs, and returnees through the MRA account. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), International Organization for Migration (IOM), and other U.N. agencies and NGOs, along with PRM, support vulnerable women through various programs for Afghan women refugees, IDPs, and returnees. PRM's core goal includes literacy training, income generation, gender-based violence prevention, and mother-child health care. The Bush Administration has shown interest in involving Iraqi women in rebuilding efforts since 2003. Numerous programs exist for Iraqi women, but listing them all is challenging. Several programs have been launched specifically focused on Iraqi women, but assessing their sustainability is difficult due to increasing violence in Iraq. Congressional funding for Iraqi women's programs has been relatively low, with no specific earmarks in the current Congress. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2006 provides funding for governance and rule of law programs in Iraq. The Institute will fund governance and rule of law programs in Iraq. Previous Senate bill mentioned funding for governance, elections, political parties, civil society, and women's rights, but women were excluded in the final report. Congressional resolutions urged equal rights for Iraqi women and commended women candidates in elections. No specific earmarks for women's programs were passed. Bills were introduced for assistance to Iraqi women in various areas. In February 2004, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz announced that the United States allocated $27 million for women's programs in Iraq, with a focus on education. Additionally, $86.8 million was committed to education projects in Iraq. In March 2004, Secretary of State Colin Powell announced a $10 million Iraqi Women's Democracy Initiative (IWDI) to train Iraqi women in democratic public life skills. Over 2000 Iraqi women have been trained in political, economic, and media skills. The formation of a \"U.S.-Iraq Women's Network\" (USIWN) was also announced. These programs represent a small portion of overall U.S. funding in Iraq, with a focus on women's issues and education. Since April 2003, USAID has implemented programs targeting Iraqi women in governance and the economy, with nearly 60 percent of small business grants awarded to women. A grant of $1.3 million is being finalized for a women-focused Micro Finance Institute. USAID is also training women politicians, journalists, and NGOs promoting women's interests under the Iraq Local Governance Program. The Local Governance Program (LGP) in Iraq aims to support women's participation in government by recruiting and training them for sub-national governing bodies. USAID conducts workshops on topics like democracy and women's rights, while the Iraqi Women in Local Governance Group (IWLGG) works to enhance women's political participation through education and monitoring progress. Additionally, USAID supports accelerated learning programs for girls' education. USAID programs focus on girls' education, providing life skills and academic background for formal schooling. They are rehabilitating water and sanitation facilities at 800 primary schools and training 75,000 female teachers. Over 2,800 schools have been rehabilitated, 45 new schools built, and 47,500 secondary school teachers trained. Female attendance has surpassed male attendance in Afghanistan. Afghan and Iraqi women face challenges in post-conflict environments. Despite improvements since the fall of the Taliban, Afghan women still face socio-economic disadvantages, with low female literacy rates and gender disparities in school enrollment. Afghanistan has high maternal and neonatal mortality rates, while Iraq, despite being more industrialized, also struggles with poor health indicators. Iraq has historically had a better educational system than Afghanistan, but girls' school attendance, especially in rural areas, lags behind boys. Congressional funding supports democracy building and civil development in both countries. The rehabilitation of basic education and health care infrastructure for Afghan and Iraqi women is crucial. Congressional funding has impacted Afghan women through legislative earmarks, but Iraq has not utilized earmarks extensively for women's programs. Despite some similarities in the approach to improve the lives of Afghan and Iraqi women, the countries start from different economic and social points. The reconstruction timetables for Afghanistan and Iraq will differ based on events and challenges on the ground. Congress is examining the progress of reconstruction programs for women, considering the impact of religious versus secular forces, local traditions, and rural-urban differences to assess the effectiveness of assistance provided to Afghan and Iraqi women for future post-conflict regions."
