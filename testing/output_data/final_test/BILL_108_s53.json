    "content": "SECTION 1. CREDIT FOR EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE EXPENSES. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to add a new section regarding employee health insurance expenses. The employee health insurance expenses credit for small employers is determined by the sum of expense amounts paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year. The expense amount is a percentage of qualified employee health insurance expenses, with 25% for self-only coverage and 35% for family coverage. The expense amount for small employers is a percentage of qualified employee health insurance expenses, with 25% for self-only coverage and 35% for family coverage. The per employee dollar limitation is $750 for self-only coverage and $2,450 for family coverage. The applicable percentage of qualified employee health insurance expenses for small employers is determined based on a table, with different percentages for self-only and family coverage. The applicable coverage percentage for qualified employee health insurance expenses ranges from 10% to 20%, based on the employee's coverage level. An eligible qualified employee is defined as someone not covered by specific health insurance plans. The applicable coverage percentage for qualified employee health insurance expenses is determined based on the employee's wages, with a reduction applied if the wages exceed $20,000 annually. The term 'small employer' is defined as an employer with an average of 25 or fewer employees during the previous two calendar years, with the condition that the employer must have been in existence throughout those years. The determination of qualified employee health insurance expenses is based on the average number of employees expected to be employed on business days in the current calendar year. Qualified expenses include amounts paid by an employer for health insurance coverage for qualified employees, excluding amounts paid under salary reduction arrangements. The term 'qualified employee' refers to an employee whose annual wages from the employer range from $5,000 to $25,000. This definition excludes certain employees like those under section 401(c)(1) but includes leased employees. The term 'wages' is defined as per section 3121(a) without any dollar limitation. For taxable years after 2003, the $25,000 amount in subparagraph (A) will be adjusted for inflation based on the cost-of-living adjustment. The text discusses adjustments for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, with rounding rules and the application of similar rules from section 52. It also mentions the denial of double benefits for qualified employee health insurance expenses. The text introduces a new credit for employee health insurance expenses under section 45G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This credit will be part of the general business credit under section 38(b). Additionally, there will be no carryback of the section 45G credit before the effective date. The new credit for employee health insurance expenses under section 45G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 may be carried back to a taxable year before the enactment of section 45G. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments under section 45G for employee health insurance expenses apply to expenses incurred after December 31, 2002."
