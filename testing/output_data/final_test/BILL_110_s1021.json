    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Japan Currency Manipulation Act\". Congress finds that the Japanese yen is fundamentally misaligned with major currencies, with the Bank of Japan reporting the lowest trade-weighted average in 20 years. The Federal Reserve noted Japan's frequent and massive interventions in foreign exchange markets, attributing the misalignment to deliberate policy decisions by the Government of Japan. Japan's government artificially suppresses the yen's value to boost exports, holding $875 billion in foreign reserves, the second largest globally. The US trade deficit with Japan is $88 billion, mainly in automobiles. Japan has had a large trade deficit with the US for over 25 years, mostly in auto parts. Japan provides significant subsidies for its automobile industry, with a $3,600 subsidy for family sedans made in Japan and a $9,700 subsidy for luxury vehicles. The exchange-rate misalignment of the yen gives Japanese exporters an unfair advantage over US manufacturers. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a concise statement defining terms within a document or legislation. In this Act, \"currency intervention\" refers to direct and indirect actions to counter the appreciation of the Japanese yen. \"Exchange-rate misalignment\" is defined as discrepancies in exchange rates. The term \"exchange-rate misalignment\" refers to an undervaluation of the Japanese yen due to large-scale currency intervention by the Government of Japan. The Secretary considers factors like Japan's balance-of-trade surplus or deficit to determine if misalignment is occurring and conferring a benefit. The curr_chunk discusses Japan's balance-of-trade surplus or deficit with the United States and other trading partners, foreign direct investment, foreign currency reserve holdings, and mechanisms to maintain an undervalued Japanese yen exchange rate. The curr_chunk outlines the criteria for measuring trade surpluses or deficits, including considering economic factors and using accurate trade data. The Secretary of the Treasury will develop an objective methodology to quantify exchange-rate misalignment using reliable data. The Secretary of the Treasury will develop an objective methodology to quantify exchange-rate misalignment using reliable data. Additionally, a report on currency intervention and exchange-rate misalignment will be provided. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress every 180 days on currency intervention by the Government of Japan regarding the exchange rate of the Japanese yen and the US dollar since 2000, and efforts to create exchange-rate misalignment since March 2004. The report will detail incidents of direct or indirect currency intervention by Japan. The report to Congress every 180 days on currency intervention by the Government of Japan regarding the exchange rate of the Japanese yen and the US dollar since 2000 includes incidents of currency intervention and justifications for not acting upon them under the Exchange Rates and International Economic Policy Coordination Act of 1988. The report to Congress every 180 days on currency intervention by the Government of Japan since 2000 includes efforts to create or maintain exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen with the US dollar and other currencies. This involves statements made by Japanese officials regarding currency value or movement. The report to Congress every 180 days on currency intervention by the Government of Japan since 2000 includes efforts to manipulate the exchange rate of the Japanese yen with the US dollar and other currencies. This involves directives that alter investments of pensions plans and insurance companies to gain an unfair competitive advantage in international trade, as well as any other efforts to prevent effective balance of payments adjustments. The proposal suggests a joint US-EU plan to address the exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen. The Secretary must submit a proposal for a joint US-EU plan to address the exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen to the Senate and House committees within 60 days of the Act's enactment.

The Secretary must propose a joint US-EU plan to address the Japanese yen's exchange-rate misalignment with the US dollar and other currencies at G-7 meetings until the issue is resolved. The Secretary will consult with Japan to decrease their foreign currency reserves for balance of payments adjustments and fair trade. If Japan intervenes in currency to gain an unfair advantage, the Secretary will take immediate action to prevent it. The United States will call for a special meeting of the International Monetary Fund to address exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen, its destabilizing effects, and Japan's excessive foreign currency reserves. The Secretary must report every 180 days on progress towards reducing Japan's foreign currency reserves, actions taken at G-7 meetings regarding yen exchange-rate misalignment, and efforts to correct the misalignment with the US dollar and other currencies."
