    "content": "The \"Renewable Energy Access Through Leasing Act of 2010\" or the \"REAL Act of 2010\" provides insurance coverage for loans financing renewable energy systems leased for residential use. The \"Renewable Energy Access Through Leasing Act of 2010\" aims to encourage residential use of renewable energy systems, reduce carbon emissions, promote energy-efficient construction, minimize environmental impact, lower consumer utility costs, and attract private investment in the green economy. Definitions in the act include terms like \"authorized renewable energy lender.\" The \"Renewable Energy Access Through Leasing Act of 2010\" defines terms like \"authorized renewable energy lender,\" \"renewable energy system lease,\" and \"renewable energy manufacturer.\" The \"Renewable Energy Access Through Leasing Act of 2010\" defines terms like \"renewable energy manufacturer,\" \"renewable energy system owner,\" \"renewable energy system,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may insure loans for renewable energy systems for lease to homeowners. The principal amount of the loan insured shall not exceed the system's residual value. The residual value of a renewable energy system is based on the fair market value of the future revenue stream from electricity production, determined by the net present value of the power output production warranty and regional electricity prices forecasted by the Energy Information Administration. The Secretary may not insure a loan for a renewable energy system unless the owner certifies that the system will be leased to homeowners granting easements for installation and selling electricity to the grid. Discounts or prepayments on leases should not affect homeowner mortgage requirements. The Secretary may only insure loans for renewable energy systems if the lender meets specific eligibility criteria, including being a green banking center or meeting other requirements set by the Secretary. Lenders must also meet qualifications established by the Secretary for participation in the program. The Secretary will issue a certificate of insurance to approved lenders. The Secretary will issue a certificate to insured lenders as evidence of insurance coverage for renewable energy systems. The certificate will state the fair market value of the future revenue stream for each year of the system's remaining life and is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Claims for insurance can be filed in case of default on the insured loan, with payments made accordingly. Upon default, the Secretary holds a lien on renewable energy system assets and revenue stream, superior to all other liens. The renewable energy system owner or lender can assign or transfer insurance coverage, and the Secretary is entitled to revenue from selling electricity to the grid after an insurance claim is paid. Premiums and charges for insurance are fixed by the Secretary. The Secretary sets and collects insurance premiums for loans under this section to cover program expenses and losses. Premiums are deposited in the Renewable Energy Lease Insurance Fund. No other fees or charges can be assessed by the Secretary. The Renewable Energy Lease Insurance Fund is established in the Treasury for providing insurance for loans under this section, funded by premiums collected and available without fiscal year limitation. The Secretary may invest excess amounts in obligations of the United States. Regulations will be issued to carry out this section within 180 days. Debt obligations insured by the Secretary are ineligible for purchase by the Federal Financing Bank. The Secretary's authority to insure new loans under this Act will end 10 years after enactment, subject to the Federal Financing Bank Act of 1973."
