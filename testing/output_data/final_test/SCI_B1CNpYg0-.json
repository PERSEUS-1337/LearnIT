A method is proposed to predict embeddings for rare words using small amounts of auxiliary data, improving results for reading comprehension, textual entailment, and language modeling tasks. Learning representations for rare words in natural language is challenging due to the Zipfian distribution of words. The typical remedy is to learn embeddings for a core set of words and treat all other words as out-of-vocabulary (OOV), replacing them with an unknown word \"UNK\" token. This heuristic solution lacks specific representations for technical domains, names, and institutions unless sufficient data is available. Learning representations for rare words in natural language is challenging due to the Zipfian distribution of words. Model designers often rely on large vocabularies or vocabulary selection strategies to address this issue. Some models have attempted to tackle the open vocabulary problem by obtaining word representations from characters, which can capture morphological derivations but struggle with semantic distinctions among similar words. This approach also does not account for the spelling of named entities. In this paper, a new method for computing word embeddings is proposed to address the large vocabulary problem and lack of data for rare words. The method involves training a network to predict word representations based on auxiliary data, such as dictionary definitions or Wikipedia infoboxes. The paper proposes a method to compute word embeddings using auxiliary data like dictionary definitions or Wikipedia infoboxes. Multiple sources of auxiliary data can be used together to create a combined representation for out-of-vocabulary words. The focus is on producing embeddings for out-of-vocabulary words from dictionary data or spelling. The method proposed in the paper aims to generate word embeddings using auxiliary data such as dictionary definitions or Wikipedia infoboxes. It focuses on creating embeddings for out-of-vocabulary words from dictionary data or spelling. The method is particularly useful for datasets with many rare terms, such as technical or bio/medical text. The paper compares baseline models with embeddings trained directly on the task objective to those using their on-the-fly embedding method in tasks like reading comprehension and textual entailment. The paper compares baseline models trained directly on the task objective to models using pretrained GLoVe vectors and their on-the-fly embedding method. Results show that auxiliary data improves performance by allowing models to exploit connections defined in the data. This approach is beneficial for datasets with many rare terms, like technical or bio/medical text. The approach of using pretrained models with auxiliary data is beneficial for datasets with rare terms, such as technical or bio/medical text. BID7 proposed representing OOV words with fixed random vectors, which is effective for machine comprehension but lacks word semantics. BID13 used bidirectional LSTM to read rare word spellings, showing improvement for language modeling and POS tagging. Investigating spelling as auxiliary data source is also considered. Our approach involves training a dictionary reader in an end-to-end fashion for a specific task, avoiding the use of potentially suboptimal auxiliary ranking costs. Unlike previous methods, we do not rely on high-quality pretrained embeddings. Another related work uses dictionary definitions for database embedding initialization, while we focus on directly learning to use definitions. Our approach involves training a dictionary reader for a specific task by embedding external information instead of using a generic representation for out-of-vocabulary items. This method differs from directly learning to use definitions and belongs to a family of methods for conditioning neural networks on external knowledge. Our approach involves training a dictionary reader for a specific task by embedding external information instead of using a generic representation for out-of-vocabulary items. The idea is to rely on descriptions similar to relying on definitions, but we focus on understanding complex inputs rather than adding new output classes. We enhance word embeddings with auxiliary data from knowledge bases, such as WordNet, in a unique way. Our work differs from previous approaches as we use a textual form and learn in an end-to-end fashion, allowing the model to select useful information for the task at hand. A neural network processes language input by replacing elements with vectors called embeddings, which are either trained from scratch or pretrained. The approach involves using definitions from auxiliary data to compute embeddings of rare words on the fly, instead of having persistent embeddings for each rare word. This is done by fetching a definition and feeding it into a network to produce a definition embedding. The approach involves using definitions from auxiliary data to compute embeddings of rare words on the fly. The definition embedding is produced by a definition reader, which can use the same embeddings or train different ones. Different choices for vocabulary and function are considered, such as mean pooling or LSTM. Multiple definitions for a word are combined using mean pooling. The primary purpose of definition embeddings is to inform word representations. The approach involves using definitions from auxiliary data to compute embeddings of rare words on the fly. The definition embeddings are combined with word embeddings using a trainable matrix or by simply summing them. If no definition is available for a word, a zero vector is used. The implementation of this approach is made feasible by processing all word definitions in parallel. The approach involves using definitions from auxiliary data to compute embeddings of rare words on the fly. They do not consider definitions of word combinations or geographical entities. The definition reader could handle unknown words using their definition embeddings, implementing a form of recursion. They worked on extractive question answering, semantic entailment classification, and language modeling, exploring how augmenting baseline models with on-the-fly embeddings would affect performance. They used word definitions from WordNet as a source of auxiliary data. The study experimented with character-level spelling of words as auxiliary data and used pretrained GLoVe vectors for word embeddings. They compared their technique to baselines to bridge the gap between data-poor and data-rich scenarios, using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset for evaluation. The Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) contains 100,000 human-generated question-answer pairs from Wikipedia. A simplified coattention network model is used to process the context and question, generating attention maps and a final context-document representation. The model used in the Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) processes context and question to generate attention maps and a final context-document representation. Two linear layers with softmax assign probabilities to each position in the document for the answer span. The model skips iterative inference and uses ReLU instead of highway-maxout units. The baseline model has embeddings trained from scratch with a small vocabulary of 10k common words. Preliminary experiments show that a smaller vocabulary of 3k words is better for models using auxiliary data, and combining information from definitions and word embeddings is helpful. The model in the Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) generates attention maps and a final context-document representation. Different models were tried for reading the dictionary and spelling, with the best performance seen when using a LSTM for spelling and MP-L for dictionary definitions. The dictionary lookup procedure involves lowercasing and lemmatization, and the contribution of these steps was evaluated. The comparison also included a model trained with GLoVe embeddings. The last model in the comparison uses GLoVe embeddings with 200 dimensions for all vectors. Results show significant improvement over the baseline model when external information is added. Mean pooling performs similarly to LSTM when using the dictionary alone. The necessity of matrix W for best results in mean pooling model is verified, and back-propagation through the reading process is helpful. This method is preferred over the one by BID14. The study compares different models using various forms of auxiliary data, such as spelling, dictionary definitions, and GLoVe embeddings. Combining spelling and dictionary (SD) provides the best results, showing a 1.1 point advantage over using just spelling (S). The model with GLoVe embeddings (G) still leads by 1.1 points, but the gap has narrowed. Testing on the development set confirms the benefit of using dictionary definitions, with SD outperforming S by 1 point. The model with lemmatization and lowercasing (SL) is also evaluated. The study compares different models using spelling, dictionary definitions, and GLoVe embeddings. Combining spelling and dictionary (SD) shows a 1.1 point advantage over just spelling (S). Qualitative investigation on selected examples reveals that SD successfully uses dictionary definitions, while S does not. Attention maps show that SD is aware of certain answers, like \"overseas,\" due to dictionary definitions. The study compared different models using spelling, dictionary definitions, and GLoVe embeddings. Combining spelling and dictionary (SD) showed a 1.1 point advantage over just spelling (S). Qualitative investigation revealed that SD successfully used dictionary definitions to match words like \"overseas\" and \"direction\". The model with the dictionary was better at answering questions about specific professions like \"scientist\" or \"actress\". Attention maps showed how the model considered \"overseas\" as a candidate answer with the help of the dictionary. The study compared different models using spelling, dictionary definitions, and GLoVe embeddings. The model with the dictionary successfully used definitions to match words like \"overseas\" and \"direction\". However, there were cases where definitions were missing or not used effectively, impacting the model's ability to understand context and make accurate matches. The study utilized the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) and MultiGenre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) corpora to predict logical relations between sentences. MultiNLI offers matched and mismatched sets for testing, providing a more diverse dataset compared to SNLI. The study utilized the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) and MultiGenre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) corpora to predict logical relations between sentences. MultiNLI offers matched and mismatched sets for testing, providing a more diverse dataset compared to SNLI. A variant of Enhanced Sequential Inference Model (ESIM) BID5, replacing TreeLSTM with biLSTM, achieved close to state-of-the-art accuracy by encoding hypothesis and premise matrices using bidirectional LSTMs and forming joint representations using alignment matrices. These representations are processed by parallel bidirectional LSTMs and a single layer Tanh MLP to predict entailment. The study used different vocabularies for the baseline model and the model using auxiliary information in SNLI and MultiNLI experiments. A separate vocabulary V dict was created for the definitions, consisting of the 11000 most frequent words weighted by their occurrence in training data. Separate word embeddings were used for the main model and the definition reader, with mean pooling applied before adding the result to e(w). The study used pretrained GloVe embeddings and LSTM models for reading spelling and definitions. Mean pooling was found to work better than using LSTM for reading definitions. Results on SNLI and MultiNLI showed that using dictionary definitions bridged a significant gap in performance. Spelling was not as useful on these datasets compared to SQuAD. The study found that using dictionary definitions significantly improved performance on SNLI and MultiNLI datasets compared to spelling. Fixed random embeddings for OOV words did not provide a significant advantage. A t-SNE visualization of word embeddings from the BLESS dataset showed that dictionary-enabled models outperformed baseline models for sentences with rare words. In the One Billion Words language modeling task, the approach was applied to datasets of varying sizes, from 1% to the whole training set. The model used an LSTM with 500 units and trainable input embeddings for the 10k most frequent words, covering 90.24% of word occurrences. The softmax output layer was restricted to predict probabilities of the 10k most common words. The study aimed to assess if having a definition of an observed word helps the model predict the following words from a restricted vocabulary. The study focused on using auxiliary information for less frequent input words in language modeling. Three sources were considered: dictionary definitions, GloVe vectors, and spellings. Experiments were conducted with \"restricted\" inputs, only using auxiliary information for words with both GloVe embeddings and dictionary definitions. Three variants of dictionary-enabled models were tested, including one with spelling information added. The study experimented with different models using dictionary definitions, GloVe vectors, and spellings for less frequent words in language modeling. Adding spelling consistently improved performance, even more than adding dictionary definitions. The model using lemma+lowercase performed worse than those with dictionary definitions, indicating the importance of dictionary information in a non-trivial way. The study compared different models using dictionary definitions, GloVe embeddings, and spellings for rare words in language modeling. Adding spelling improved performance more than adding dictionary definitions. GloVe embeddings resulted in the best perplexity. When looking at how models handle rare words, adding definitions to spelling helped bridge performance gaps. The study explored using different sources of auxiliary information, such as spelling and dictionary definitions, to create embeddings for rare words. Adding spelling information was found to be helpful, but directly inferring meaning from characters was challenging. The approach of incorporating various data sources showed promise, with experiments demonstrating improvements in question answering and semantic entailment tasks. Further investigation suggested that adding more auxiliary data could enhance performance. Incorporating additional auxiliary data, like definitions for words and phrases, was found to be beneficial. The study plans to include more data sources and improve the use of existing ones in future work. Addressing rare words in the auxiliary information could significantly enhance the proposed method. Using on-the-fly embeddings for rare words may be a potential solution, although the computational aspect needs consideration. Incorporating auxiliary data, such as word definitions, is beneficial for improving embeddings. Future work will explore asynchronous training of on-the-fly embeddings and the main model. The method bridges the gap between data-poor and data-rich setups, where pretraining word embeddings may not be feasible. This approach is applicable when limited auxiliary data is available. Our method utilizes limited auxiliary data efficiently by learning end-to-end from sources like dictionary definitions. It allows users to have control over the language processing system by editing or adding auxiliary information. Domain adaptation can be achieved by using other sources of auxiliary knowledge, such as technical term definitions for medical texts. This approach offers a promising alternative for handling rare words."
