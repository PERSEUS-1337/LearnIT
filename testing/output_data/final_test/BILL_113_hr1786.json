The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004 is amended to change the definition of \"Director\" and further define the term \"lifelines\" to include public works and utilities. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program is established under the amended National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program, established under the amended National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004, aims to reduce losses from windstorms through a coordinated federal effort with other levels of government, academia, and the private sector. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is responsible for planning and coordinating the program. The Director of the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program is responsible for ensuring necessary components for windstorm risk reduction, supporting the development of engineering tools, and requesting assistance from Federal agencies. The Director of the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program is responsible for coordinating federal post-windstorm investigations, issuing recommendations for model codes, and requesting assistance from other federal agencies. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is responsible for research and development to improve building codes and standards. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program sets standards for building design and construction. The National Science Foundation and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration support research on windstorm behavior. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is involved in windstorm risk reduction measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency supports the development of risk assessment tools, windstorm-related data collection, public outreach, and promotion of windstorm preparedness measures. They work closely with national standards and building code organizations. The National Institute of Standards and Technology collaborates with building code organizations to improve building practices in the construction industry. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, along with other agencies, includes budget activities related to risk assessment and windstorm preparedness in their annual budget requests. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction is established, chaired by the Director, and includes heads of FEMA, NOAA, and NSF. Each agency must include their projected activities and spending for the Program in their annual budget request to Congress. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction, chaired by the Director, includes heads of FEMA, NOAA, NSF, OSTP, OMB, and other relevant agencies. The Committee meets at least twice a year to oversee the planning and coordination of the Program. They are responsible for developing and submitting a Strategic Plan to Congress within one year of the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act Reauthorization of 2014. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program, as outlined in the 2014 Reauthorization, includes prioritized goals, research objectives, agency roles, progress assessment methods, and research result transfer methods. A progress report is due within 18 months of the enactment date. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program, as outlined in the 2014 Reauthorization, requires a report to Congress on funded activities, outcomes achieved, recommendations for building code changes, and alignment with strategic goals. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program must report to Congress on funded activities, outcomes, recommendations for building codes, and alignment with strategic goals. The Program should also incorporate recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction and develop a coordinated budget to be submitted to Congress annually. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004 is amended to establish the National Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish an Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction with at least 7 members from various sectors. The Committee will provide assessments on trends in windstorm impact mitigation practices. The Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction will focus on the Program's Strategic Plan, coordination, necessary revisions, and reporting recommendations to the Director every 2 years. Members will serve without compensation, and the Committee will not be required to file a charter after the initial one. The Committee will terminate at a specified date. The Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction will terminate on September 30, 2016. Members with a conflict of interest must recuse themselves from relevant activities. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Amendment to Section 207 of the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004 regarding authorization of appropriations.
