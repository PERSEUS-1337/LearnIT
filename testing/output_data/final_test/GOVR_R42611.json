    "content": "The Keystone XL pipeline proposal has sparked significant debate among policy makers and environmental stakeholders. TransCanada, the owner/operator, must obtain a Presidential Permit from the State Department before construction can begin. Environmental groups have raised concerns about the potential environmental impact of the pipeline. The Presidential Permit application for the Keystone XL pipeline construction is a crucial decision that involves assessing factors impacting national interest, including potential local impacts, oil extraction impacts in Canada, and national energy and climate change policy implications. Stakeholders have varied concerns, with some focusing on oil spills, others on environmental impacts, and some on broader policy implications. The decision on the Keystone XL pipeline proposal is a key gauge of the Administration's stance on reducing fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions. Advocates for climate change mitigation see the pipeline as a way to galvanize support. Proponents argue for the pipeline's construction to enhance U.S. petroleum supply security, diversity, and economic benefits. Environmental concerns related to the project are the focus of this report. This report focuses on environmental concerns related to the proposed pipeline and oil sands crude it will transport. The issues discussed are not unique to oil sands and can be compared to other energy sources. Section One covers oil sands extraction and comparison to other crude oils, while Section Two provides an overview of the Keystone XL pipeline and federal requirements for environmental impact consideration. The curr_chunk discusses federal requirements for considering environmental impacts from the Keystone XL pipeline, including the Department of State's national interest determination and obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act. It also covers environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, climate change concerns, oil spill risks, land disturbance, and water resources. The report aims to complement other CRS reports on the Keystone XL proposal. The curr_chunk provides information on oil sands, which are a mixture of sand, clay, water, and bitumen. Bitumen is a dense form of petroleum that can be processed into fuel. It is difficult to transport due to its viscosity. The curr_chunk explains the different categories of processed/diluted bitumen from oil sands reserves: Upgraded bitumen (SCO), Diluted Bitumen (DilBit), and Synthetic bitumen (Synbit). These products are created by refining or blending bitumen with lighter hydrocarbons to make it easier to transport. DilBit, for example, is a blend of 25-30% condensate and 70-75% bitumen. The curr_chunk discusses the increasing exports of blended bitumen, including DilBit and Synbit, from Canada to the United States. These exports have nearly tripled in the past six years and are expected to drive most of the growth in oil sands production. Canadian crude oil imports accounted for 33% of U.S. imports in 2013, up from 28% in 2012. Oil sands deposits are found worldwide, with the largest reserves in Canada and Venezuela's Orinoco Oil Belt. The Orinoco Oil Belt in Venezuela holds significant oil reserves, with less than 0.4% currently being produced. Proven oil sands reserves in Alberta are estimated at 170 billion barrels, accounting for 97% of Canada's total proven oil reserves. Canada ranks third in proven oil reserves globally, behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, due to its oil sands in Alberta. Proven reserve estimates can change rapidly, with Canada's reserves increasing from 5 billion barrels in 2002 to 175 billion barrels in 2003. Venezuela also saw an increase from 73 billion barrels in 2000 to 298 billion barrels in 2013, mainly from oil sands and extra-heavy oil additions. Oil sands extraction methods include mining and in situ operations. According to the Government of Alberta, 80% of Canadian oil sands are accessible by in situ methods only, with in situ operations surpassing mining in 2012. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers projects in situ production to reach 62% of total production by 2020. Strip-mining is used for oil sands deposits less than 250 feet below the surface, with the extracted bitumen upgraded to synthetic crude oil. Nearly all mined bitumen is upgraded to synthetic crude oil. In situ methods like CSS and SAGD are used for deeper oil sands deposits, with SAGD being the preferred method for new projects. SAGD involves injecting steam to heat the bitumen for collection. Unlike mining operations, in situ recovery produces DilBit instead of synthetic crude oil. Crude oil is a mix of hydrocarbons with varying densities. Key properties include API gravity, which measures weight compared to water, and sulfur content indicating corrosiveness. \"Heavy\" crude oil is typically defined as having an API gravity at or below 22\". The total sulfur content in crude oils ranges from below 0.05% to 5.0%, with crudes above 1.0% considered \"sour\" and below 0.5% as \"sweet.\" Total Acid Number (TAN) measures the acidity in crude oil, with values above 0.5 potentially corrosive due to naphthenic acids. Alberta's oil sands crudes are compared to other heavy crudes worldwide. The Keystone XL pipeline project involving heavy crudes, including oil sands, was initially proposed by TransCanada in 2008. It consisted of two segments crossing the U.S.-Canadian border into Montana and terminating in Nebraska, and connecting an existing pipeline in Oklahoma with locations in Texas. Despite denial of the initial permit application in 2012, TransCanada proceeded with the construction of the Gulf Coast Pipeline segment without requiring a permit from the Department of State. The Gulf Coast Pipeline Project, which became operational in January 2014, did not require a permit from the Department of State as it does not cross a U.S. border. TransCanada submitted a new permit application in May 2012 for the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline's 875-mile northern segment, with a capacity to deliver 830,000 barrels per day. This volume is significant compared to other U.S.-Canada import pipelines, potentially transporting around 300 million barrels per year. The Keystone XL pipeline project involves the transportation of DilBit and synthetic crude oil from Canada to the United States. The pipeline would require a 50-foot-wide permanent right-of-way, with most of it on privately owned land. Additional facilities include pump stations, mainline valves, and delivery metering facilities. The project aims to complete TransCanada's Keystone Pipeline System, connecting Alberta oil sands to the U.S. via existing pipeline segments. The Keystone XL pipeline project involves a 30-inch pipeline connecting Alberta oil sands to U.S. refineries in Illinois, with a capacity of nearly 600,000 bpd. The U.S. portion runs 1,086 miles from North Dakota to Illinois. The project also includes a 36-inch pipeline extension from Nebraska to Oklahoma. The Department of State's decision-making process for the Presidential Permit application is subject to environmental review requirements under NEPA to assess environmental impacts. The analysis of impacts during the NEPA process informs federal decision-making for the Presidential Permit. Compliance with NEPA is necessary before the Department of State can approve the permit. Issues and environmental impacts led to the denial of TransCanada's 2008 permit application. The 2012 reapplication for the Keystone XL pipeline restarted the permit and NEPA compliance process. Federal agencies typically do not have authority over oil pipeline siting, which is usually governed by state laws. In accordance with Executive Order 13337, a facility connecting the US with a foreign country, like a pipeline, needs a Presidential Permit from DOS. The process involves identifying environmental impacts, complying with NEPA, and determining national interest. DOS denied TransCanada's 2008 permit due to environmental issues, leading to a reapplication in 2012 for the Keystone XL pipeline. Federal agencies lack authority over oil pipeline siting, governed by state laws. The Department of State (DOS) has significant discretion in making National Interest Determinations for Presidential Permits for projects like pipelines. Factors considered include energy security, environmental impacts, foreign policy, and compliance with federal regulations. Key factors in past decisions include environmental impacts, diversity of oil supply, and security of transport pathways. The Department of State considers various factors when making National Interest Determinations for Presidential Permits for projects like pipelines, including energy security, stability of trading partners, economic benefits, and environmental goals. Additional factors may also be considered for each permit application. The Department of State must request views from various agencies and invite public comment for energy-related projects. If the project serves the national interest, a Presidential Permit is issued. This process applies to the Keystone XL pipeline. In its 2012 Presidential Permit application for the Keystone XL pipeline, TransCanada states that the project will provide a secure source of Canadian crude oil to meet US demand, access domestic oil supplies in Montana and North Dakota, and reduce reliance on oil from other countries. The project will also bring economic benefits with minimal environmental impacts, requiring an environmental impact statement under NEPA. The State Department requires an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for major federal actions like the Keystone XL pipeline. The EIS analyzes potential impacts, including no action and mitigation measures, to determine if the project serves the national interest and complies with environmental statutes. Environmental requirements under NEPA are a key focus in this process. The NEPA process requires the Department of State to consider environmental impacts when reviewing a Presidential Permit application, such as the Keystone XL Pipeline project. The final EIS identifies significant impacts related to construction, operation, and maintenance. EIS preparation involves a draft and final stage, with public and agency comments incorporated into the final EIS. The Department of State (DOS) is the lead agency responsible for preparing the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline. They rely on information from TransCanada and request input from cooperating agencies with expertise in environmental impacts. The original permit process involved 11 federal cooperating agencies, including the EPA and state agencies. Table A-1 in the Appendix lists the agencies and their roles in the permitting process. The EPA plays a key role in reviewing and rating draft EISs for the Keystone XL Pipeline project, impacting the NEPA process. The State Department released a draft EIS for the 2012-proposed project, evaluating potential impacts of a new pipeline route. The EPA provided comments on the draft EIS for the Keystone XL Pipeline project, rating it as \"EO-2\" due to inadequate information. Recommendations for improvements included analyzing GHGs, pipeline safety, alternative routes, and community/environmental justice impacts. The State Department released the final EIS in response to public comments. The final EIS reflects DOS's response to comments and begins the process to determine national interest for the project. The NEPA process is considered complete with the issuance of a final Record of Decision (ROD). For projects requiring a Presidential Permit, the final EIS initiates the DOS process for the National Interest Determination (NID). DOS will seek input from federal agencies to decide on the permit issuance. The issuance of a Presidential Permit for the pipeline is being evaluated to determine national interest. The NEPA process requires a full assessment of environmental consequences and project alternatives before a final decision is made. NEPA does not prohibit actions with adverse environmental impacts but requires awareness and consideration of these impacts. The National Interest Determination (NID) dictates the outcome of approval or denial of the Presidential Permit based on the proposed project. The NEPA process requires a full assessment of environmental consequences and project alternatives before a final decision is made. NEPA does not prohibit actions with adverse environmental impacts but requires awareness and consideration of these impacts. The issuance of a Presidential Permit is based on the finding that the proposed project serves the national interest. The NID process determines whether the project is in the national interest based on its environmental impacts. Executive Order 12114 requires federal agencies to analyze significant impacts from federal actions abroad. The Executive Order 12114 requires federal agencies to analyze significant impacts from federal actions abroad, but does not mandate evaluation of projects outside the US involving foreign nations, like Canada's involvement in the Keystone XL pipeline. The Department of State uses the order as guidance for environmental analysis in the final EIS, considering extraterritorial project impacts as necessary for national interest determination. Factors considered include impacts on policy objectives and climate change strategies. The Department of State did not specifically cite climate change and U.S. energy goals in its denial of TransCanada's initial Presidential Permit application for the Keystone XL pipeline. Concerns remain about the environmental impacts abroad and how they may influence the national interest determination. Multiple pipelines connect Canadian oil resources to the United States, with some applying for Presidential Permits in recent years, including the ongoing Keystone XL permit process. The Keystone XL permit process has exceeded prior timetables. The project was deemed to have limited adverse environmental impacts and serve national interests by increasing oil supply diversity and shortening transportation pathways for crude oil imports from Western Canada. The Keystone XL pipeline provides additional crude oil supplies from a stable trading partner, reducing the need for high seas transport and railway routes. Stakeholders may support issuing a Presidential Permit for the XL proposal due to declining imports from other suppliers. Environmental concerns related to the pipeline and oil sands cover local, regional, and national/global issues. This section discusses key environmental issues related to oil sands production, including greenhouse gas emissions intensity, climate change policy, oil spill risk, and impacts of oil sands extraction. There is debate over whether oil sands have a higher emissions intensity compared to other forms of crude oil, with some stakeholders arguing that emissions from oil sands crude oil are comparable to other global crudes. Life-cycle assessments are used to compare environmental impacts of products, including CO2 and GHG emissions from hydrocarbon resources. Results can evaluate emissions intensity of fuel life cycles and compare different types of fuel production. Life-cycle assessments compare emissions intensity of fuel production methods, such as \"cradle-to-grave\" or \"Well-to-Wheel\" models. WTW assessments for petroleum-based fuels consider the entire life cycle, including extraction, refining, distribution, and combustion. WTT assessments may focus only on production/extraction, providing different insights. Oil sands crudes' emissions can be shown through WTT assessments. The WTT assessment shows oil sands crudes have higher emissions intensities than conventional oils due to the production phase. Published studies indicate Canadian oil sands crudes emit 17% more GHGs than the average barrel of crude oil refined in the United States. Canadian oil sands crudes emit 2%-19% more GHGs on a life-cycle basis compared to selected crude oil imports. On a well-to-tank basis, they emit 9%-102% more GHGs, highlighting the importance of LCA boundaries and data presentation. The higher emissions intensity is due to the heavier and more viscous nature of oil sands, requiring more energy and resources. Oil sands are compositionally deficient in hydrogen and have higher carbon, sulfur, and heavy metal content than lighter crude oil types, requiring more processing to yield consumable fuels by U.S. standards. Various studies show the variability in WTW GHG emissions estimates for Canadian oil sands crude types, with comparisons to other crude oils. The higher emissions intensity is attributed to the heavier and more viscous nature of oil sands, necessitating more energy and resources for extraction and processing. NETL compared WTW GHG emissions of reformulated gasoline from Canadian oil sands crudes, finding a 17% higher emissions compared to the US average in 2005. This increase in production emissions is 80% higher than the 2005 average for imported transportation fuels. Results from these studies can be used by stakeholders to support their positions on GHG emissions intensity. Some stakeholders use WTT comparisons to highlight oil sands' GHG emissions intensity, while others argue it's comparable to other heavy crudes in the US. However, these assertions may not tell the complete story as LCAs, used to generate data, have uncertainties and variables. LCAs are crucial for comparing GHG emissions of hydrocarbon resources but rely on complex analytical design features and may omit factors like land use changes and co-product combustion. Comparing the GHG emissions intensity of oil sands to other fossil fuels can be challenging due to the complexity of factors like land use changes and combustion of co-products. One study found that oil sands emissions intensity is slightly lower than underground coal mining but higher than surface coal mining. It is important to note that other heavy crude oils also have comparable emissions intensity to coal. The 2014 FEIS GHG emission and climate change discussion, including President Obama's evaluation of the Keystone XL pipeline's impact on climate, has sparked significant debate among stakeholders. The 2014 FEIS discusses GHG emissions related to the proposed pipeline and potential climate change impacts, including concerns about facilitating oil sands development and its impact on the global carbon budget. The document identifies various impacts, including GHG emissions, and analyzes project alternatives, including the \"no action alternative.\" The FEIS finds that the project would result in GHG emissions. The 2014 FEIS states that the proposed pipeline would result in GHG emissions during construction and normal operations, with total life-cycle emissions of 147 to 168 MMTCO2e per year. The proposed pipeline would result in GHG emissions of 147 to 168 MMTCO2e per year, with incremental emissions estimated at 1.3 to 27.4 MMTCO2e per year. Approval or denial of the project is unlikely to significantly impact oil sands production or demand for heavy crude oil in the U.S. The Final EIS suggests that oil sands production would be unaffected by market conditions, implying negligible incremental GHG emissions from the proposed pipeline. Stakeholders question the conclusions and argue for greater climate change impacts. Operational emissions for alternative transportation modes exceed those of the pipeline. Stakeholders challenge the conclusions in the 2014 FEIS, arguing that the Keystone XL Pipeline could have a significant impact on oil sands expansion due to uncertainties in oil market projections and transportation options. They highlight the financial challenges and higher production costs for oil sands projects, emphasizing the sensitivity of new investments to changes in supply costs and global prices. The Keystone XL Pipeline could impact oil sands expansion due to uncertainties in oil market projections and transportation options. Key variables affecting expansion include lower global oil prices, higher rail costs, and future carbon pricing policies. Decrease in oil sands development could impact global GHG emissions growth. Some stakeholders believe oil sands will be produced as long as there is strong global demand for petroleum products. The Canadian oil sands will be produced and shipped using any available route, with future investment impacted only if global oil prices fall below supply costs for an extended period. Current production is only affected in scenarios where all pipeline transport capacity is frozen. Stakeholders believe incentives are too great to leave oil in the ground, and once extracted, the market will likely add transport capacity over time. They argue that scaling up transport is feasible based on evidence from other regions. GHG emissions intensities for the Canadian oil sands are currently within an acceptable range. The Canadian oil sands have GHG emissions intensities within an acceptable range, with future reductions expected due to efficiency improvements and technological advances. Alberta has implemented policies to mitigate emissions, including a GHG intensity reduction program and funding for clean energy investment and carbon capture facilities. Concerns exist about the impact on the global carbon budget. The global carbon budget is a maximum amount of net worldwide GHG emissions to avoid exceeding a 2\u00b0C temperature target. Studies by the IEA and IPCC estimate carbon budget scenarios to address climate change. The IPCC and IEA have estimated carbon budget scenarios to limit global warming to 2\u00b0C. The IPCC states that no more than 1 trillion tons of carbon can be released into the atmosphere by the end of the century for a 66% chance of meeting the target. Current emissions are on track to reach this threshold by 2040. The IEA suggests that only one-third of fossil fuel reserves can be consumed before 2050 to achieve the 2\u00b0C goal. Critics argue that the Keystone XL project could exceed the global carbon budget. The GHG emissions from oil sands projects could reach the 2\u00b0C threshold if all resources were consumed. The impact of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline on carbon emissions depends on whether oil sands extraction is dependent on it. The Keystone XL pipeline's impact on carbon emissions is debated, with some viewing it as a significant risk due to potential spills and high emissions, while others see it as a minor addition to overall emissions. Policy makers are unsure where to draw the line on climate protection decisions, especially when considering unilateral actions by the United States. The Keystone XL pipeline poses risks of oil spills, with concerns heightened by past incidents involving oil sands crude oil. Policy makers are debating whether this pipeline would increase the risk of spills compared to others, especially considering the properties of oil sands crude oil. The comparison of oil spill risks from pipelines to other modes of oil transportation is also a key issue. The Keystone XL pipeline poses spill risks compared to other oil transportation modes. Environmental groups argue that DilBit may increase spill risks. Congress enacted P.L. 112-90 to review pipeline regulations for diluted bitumen transportation. The Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) contracted the National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council (NRC) to conduct a study on the transportation of diluted bitumen by pipelines. The NRC report found no unique causes of pipeline failure specific to diluted bitumen and no evidence of properties that differ significantly from other crude oils. The 2013 NRC report found no unique causes of pipeline failure specific to diluted bitumen and no evidence of properties that differ significantly from other crude oils. Some argue that DilBit pipelines may be more likely to fail due to their corrosiveness. DilBit TANs range between 0.92 to 2.49, higher than lighter crude oils but comparable to other heavy oils. The presence of naphthenic acids in high TAN crudes can increase corrosion potential in refinery units operating at high temperatures. However, DilBit pipeline transportation occurs at lower temperatures, with varying corrosivity levels not directly correlating with TAN values. Canadian oil sands crudes show low corrosion rates despite high TAN numbers due to the diverse types of compounds present. Oil sands crudes have low corrosion rates despite high TAN numbers, possibly due to inhibitor compounds. DilBits have high sulfur content, which may indicate corrosivity, but most sulfur is in stable compounds, not corrosive H2S. The comparison of H2S content in DilBits shows lower concentrations than other crude oils. Erosion in pipeline transport is a concern for DilBit pipelines, but sediment contents in DilBit blends are similar to other Canadian crude oils. Regulations require filtering high solids content in crude oils for quality specifications. The 2013 NRC report highlights the stricter Canadian regulations for sediment and water content in crude oil compared to the U.S. standards. It mentions the potential risk of column separation in liquids with high vapor pressure, leading to pressure surges that can damage pipelines. Some concerns were raised during the 2011 EIS process about DilBit's instability making pipelines more susceptible to ruptures. The NRC report stated that DilBit does not have a high percentage of light hydrocarbons, reducing the risk of column separation. Concerns have been raised about the Keystone XL pipeline's operating parameters, including temperature and pressure levels. The operating temperature is expected to be between 42\u00b0F and 135\u00b0F, with a special condition allowing for temperatures above 150\u00b0F with specific testing and approval. The FEIS does not discuss if operating temperatures will exceed 150\u00b0F during the pipeline's operation, but Special Condition 15 allows for that possibility. The operating pressure is designed for a maximum of 1,308 psig, but could reach up to 1,600 psig due to elevation changes. Comparing to other DilBit pipelines, the highest reported operating temperature was 122\u00b0F and the highest operating pressure was 1,440 psig. The Keystone XL pipeline's maximum temperature of 135\u00b0F and potential maximum operating pressure of 1,600 psig exceed NRC report data. It is uncertain if these differences are concerning. The proposed pipeline would meet PHMSA regulations and include 57 additional safety measures. DOS determined that these conditions would provide a high level of safety similar to that required in High Consequence Areas. The degree of safety provided by the additional 57 measures for the Keystone XL pipeline has been debated, with only 12 conditions differing from minimum requirements. Oil spill frequency and volume estimates have also been contentious during the permit process, with challenges in comparing various estimates due to different data years, pipeline segments, and components. In the 2014 FEIS, DOS analyzed crude oil pipeline spill incidents using PHMSA data from 2002 to 2012. The data provided insight into spill volume, incident cause, and frequency for the Keystone XL pipeline. Spill frequency rates and average volumes were calculated, but the records did not differentiate between types of crude oil. Table 4 shows spill estimates for mainline pipeline, tanks, valves, and other components. The 2014 FEIS analyzed crude oil pipeline spill incidents using PHMSA data from 2002 to 2012, providing insight into spill volume, incident cause, and frequency for the Keystone XL pipeline. Table 4 indicates that mainline pipelines and tanks have a lower spill frequency but higher average spill volume compared to valves and other components. Using the data from Table 4, DOS estimated an annual spill frequency of 0.46 releases per year and a volume of 518 barrels per year for the entire Keystone XL pipeline project. This estimate only includes mainline pipelines greater than 16\" in diameter. The table also provides spill estimates for the 875-mile northern segment of the pipeline under consideration for a Presidential permit. Based on PHMSA data, spill frequency for the KXL mainline is estimated at 0.22 times per year, while spills from any component would occur 1.88 times per year. Some argue that using this data may overestimate spill frequency due to older pipelines. However, proponents believe Special Conditions would reduce incidents. The 2014 FEIS suggests modern pipelines are less likely to leak, leading to a reduction in spills compared to historic records. The existing Keystone pipeline, transporting 590,000 bpd of oil sands since 2010, has a higher spill frequency than estimated. In the first year, 12 incidents were reported, with one resulting in a spill of 400 barrels. Most incidents were minor, involving discrete pipeline elements. Stakeholders suggest internal corrosion in Alberta pipelines causes more spills than in the US. Internal corrosion in Alberta pipelines has caused more oil spills compared to the U.S. system, likely due to the high proportion of oil sands crudes in Alberta since the 1980s. Existing pipeline spill data are limited in analyzing risks associated with transporting oil sands crude oils. The NRC report highlighted the insufficiency of incident records in drawing definitive conclusions about the effects of transporting diluted bitumen on pipeline failure susceptibility. The NRC report highlighted the insufficiency of incident records in drawing definitive conclusions about the effects of transporting diluted bitumen on pipeline failure susceptibility. Comparing U.S. and Alberta oil spill data is challenging due to different data scopes. PHMSA prepared a comparison of pipeline incidents between the two databases, showing internal corrosion failures. The comparison of internal corrosion failures between U.S. and Alberta pipelines in the 2011 FEIS databases showed a 30% higher rate in the U.S. system. However, due to various factors like pipeline age and enforcement, the comparison is considered preliminary. The 2014 FEIS did not include this comparison table, but noted similarities in incident frequencies and corrosion-based incidents between the two regions. The impacts of an oil spill depend on factors like the type and volume of oil spilled, as well as the location. EPA mentioned that spills of oil sands crude may have different consequences. The 2013 NRC report did not address the potential impacts of spills of oil sands crude like DilBit. Limited studies exist on spills of heavy crudes similar to Canadian heavy crudes. Extensive research has been conducted on the behavior and fate of crude oil spills globally, including studies on specific chemical components found in DilBit. Analysts can rely on past experience with other crudes and DilBit constituents to confidently model the behavior of DilBit spills. Analysts can confidently model the behavior of DilBit spills based on past experience with other crudes and DilBit constituents. In the event of a spill reaching the water table, some soluble portions would dissolve into groundwater and be transported in the direction of regional groundwater flow. The extent and composition of a groundwater contaminant plume from a DilBit spill would depend on various factors. The composition of a groundwater contaminant plume from a DilBit spill depends on soil and aquifer characteristics, spill amount, and duration. Heavy components are hard to remove and may require soil removal. DilBit mixed with sediment in rivers can pose challenges and higher cleanup costs compared to conventional crude oil spills. Recent pipeline spills have raised concerns among policymakers and stakeholders. The 2010 Enbridge pipeline spill released 850,000 gallons of oil sands crude oil into Talmadge Creek, leading to ongoing response activities due to the oil's inability to biodegrade. EPA ordered Enbridge to dredge the river to remove the oil sands crude oil mixed with sediment, with estimated response costs of $1.122 billion. Benzene was identified as the dominant toxic compound in crude oil spills. In the 2010 Enbridge pipeline spill, 850,000 gallons of oil sands crude oil were released into Talmadge Creek, leading to ongoing response activities. Benzene was determined to dominate toxicity in potential crude oil spills, along with other BTEX compounds. The BTEX content of oil sands crudes ranged from 5,800 to 9,100 ppm, while conventional crude oils ranged from 5,800 to 29,100 ppm. PAHs are also toxic compounds in crude oils, with slower evaporation rates but less water solubility. The 2010 Enbridge pipeline spill released 850,000 gallons of oil sands crude oil into Talmadge Creek, with benzene dominating toxicity. PAHs are also toxic compounds in crude oils, with slower evaporation rates but less water solubility. Unlike BTEX, PAH concentrations in crude oils transported by the Keystone XL pipeline are unknown due to proprietary information. Concerns also exist about heavy metal concentrations in DilBit, particularly vanadium and nickel, which are similar to some heavy crude oils processed in Gulf Coast refineries. The transportation of crude oil in the United States has increased through various modes such as rail, barge, and truck. Each mode carries some risk of oil spills, with railroads historically spilling less crude oil compared to other modes. Between 1996-2007, railroads had lower crude oil spillage rates per ton-mile compared to trucks or pipelines. However, recent data show a significant increase in oil spills by rail transport. The State Department's 2014 FEIS compared oil spill frequency and volume by transportation mode, finding that pipelines have the highest barrels released per ton-mile, while rail transport has the highest reported releases per ton-mile. Stakeholders are concerned about environmental impacts from Canadian oil sands development. The State Department's analysis focuses on environmental impacts related to Canadian oil sands production, including land disturbance and water resource issues. The scope of extraction-related impacts is debated, with a summary of environmental analyses and regulations for the Canadian portion of the Keystone XL Project included as a matter of policy. The State Department's analysis focuses on environmental impacts related to Canadian oil sands production, including land disturbance and water resource issues. Oil sands mining and in situ operations can disturb the land to varying degrees. Surface mining involves clearance, excavation, and tailings ponds, while in situ recovery is seen as causing minimal land disturbances. However, research suggests the comparison between the two processes is more complex. Surface mining involves polygonal features like mine sites, overburden storage, tailing ponds, and end pit lakes, while in situ development is defined by linear features such as seismic lines, access roads, pipelines, and well sites. In situ operations may create a larger disturbance due to landscape fragmentation and natural gas requirements for steam generation. Studies show that in situ operations disturb more land per unit of oil compared to mining, mainly due to the land disturbances from natural gas development. The study compared land disturbances from Alberta oil sands operations with conventional oil development in Alberta and California. In situ oil sands operations have a higher energy yield than other sources, but when natural gas use is included, its energy yield decreases, making it equivalent to conventional oil development from California. The Alberta oil sands operations in Canada require a significant amount of natural gas for in situ production, impacting energy yield estimates. The oil sands are located in Canada's boreal forest, a crucial ecosystem known for its carbon storage capacity. A 2010 study compared carbon storage in different resources, showing higher soil and biomass carbon ratios in oil sands areas. The carbon ratio in oil sands areas is significantly higher than in California oil sites. Reclamation requirements in Alberta and the United States aim to restore land to its original capability after resource extraction. The BLM guidance for final reclamation of oil and gas operations on federal lands aims to restore the land to its original condition, including vegetation, hydrology, and wildlife habitats. Data from Alberta show that reclamation efforts have not kept pace with land disturbance, with only 7% of disturbed areas permanently reclaimed and 2% certified according to Alberta requirements. The 2010 Royal Society of Canada report expressed skepticism about achieving equivalent land capability in a reasonable time frame due to the small amount of land certified for reclamation in the oil sands region. A 2012 study found that lost wetlands were not being replaced, leading to a significant loss of carbon storage and sequestration potential. The environmental consequences of oil sands development are seen as part of the global discussion on unconventional oil and gas implications. Oil sands development in northern Alberta and the northern territories has water resource impacts from both in situ and surface mining techniques. In situ processes use groundwater for steam-based oil extraction, while surface mining operations withdraw water from the Athabasca River. After extraction, the recovered bitumen is typically upgraded to synthetic crude oil. The treatment of bitumen in oil sands mining requires cooling and process water, leading to significant land disturbance. Remediation efforts are regulated in Alberta, but the effectiveness in restoring and protecting water resources is debated. Ongoing maintenance involves capturing and disposing of surface water and groundwater, with concerns about wetlands and migratory bird impacts. Oil sands production and upgrading processes are noted for their high water usage per unit of energy. The oil sands production and upgrading processes are more water intense than most conventional oil production and oil and gas from shale and tight formations. In situ oil sands production is generally lower in freshwater intensity than oil sands mining, but leaves a significant portion of petroleum resources unrecovered. Concerns with oil sands development include the concentration of water use and impacts within a limited geographic area. One concern with oil sands mining is the reduction of river flows due to water use. Operators must obtain water withdrawal licenses and follow a water management framework to protect in-stream flows in the Athabasca River. An expert panel concluded that current water use levels do not threaten the river system if the framework is fully enforced. Groundwater depletion and water quality are also significant issues, with the need for better management of regional groundwater resources and limitations on extraction. The issue of water quality in oil sands development has sparked debate. The Regional Aquatic Monitoring Program (RAMP) claims minimal impacts, but peer-reviewed studies show increased toxic elements in the Athabasca River. Several toxic elements, including cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc, exceeded guidelines for aquatic life protection in Canada and Alberta. A 2012 study highlighted a legacy of PAH in lake sediments in the Athabasca oil sands region due to industrial development. The Joint Implementation Plan for Oil Sands Monitoring aims to enhance existing monitoring activities and improve analysis of historical data."
