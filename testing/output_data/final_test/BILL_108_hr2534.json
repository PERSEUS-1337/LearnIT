Efforts to end human rights violations abroad are hindered by impunity, and the US has a vested interest in supporting democratic societies that uphold human rights. The steps to fully investigate and prosecute human rights violations may include creating a truth commission or tribunal, appointing a human rights officer, and leading official national investigations with the help of civil society organizations. Executive agencies possess documents related to human rights violations abroad that foreign authorities need for investigations and prosecutions. Foreign authorities conducting investigations into gross human rights violations are crucial for the United States. Foreign authorities investigating gross human rights violations urgently need declassified documents from the United States.

GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS. The head of an agency may delay disclosing a human rights record if there is clear evidence that the threat to military defense or foreign relations outweighs public interest, especially if it involves revealing sensitive intelligence information.
