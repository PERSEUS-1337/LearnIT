    "content": "Section 1 introduces qualified stock distributions to employees under a new section 83A in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If an employee elects to apply this section to a qualified employee stock distribution, gross income excludes shares of employer securities up to the maximum stock amount, gain on excluded securities held for at least 10 years, and gain on stock acquired within 60 days of a qualified disposition. The fair market value of employer securities disposed of is determined at the time of disposition. Definitions for employer securities and qualified employee stock distribution are provided, with the latter referring to distributions of employer securities to employees as compensation for services. Employees eligible for a qualified employee stock distribution must meet certain criteria, including age, length of service, citizenship status, stock ownership, and compensation disclosure requirements. The term 'maximum stock amount' refers to the lowest number of employer securities received by any employee in a distribution. A 'qualified disposition' is the sale of employer securities meeting certain criteria during a calendar year. The applicable percentage for receiving employer securities in a calendar year is determined based on a table, with different percentages for each year following the receipt of the securities. The applicable percentage for receiving employer securities in a calendar year is determined based on a table, with percentages increasing incrementally each year. The percentages range from 0 percent in the first through tenth years to 100 percent in any subsequent calendar year. The exclusion of amounts from gross income under subsection (a)(1) does not count as wages for employment tax purposes. Section 83 does not apply to transfers of employer securities under subsection (a)(1). An employer can deduct the fair market value of transferred securities under section 162. If stock is disposed of before the required holding period, recapture may be necessary. If an individual disposes of excluded employer securities within the 5-year holding period, their gross income for the year of disposition will increase by the excluded amount. The tax for that year will also increase by the tax amounts that would have applied if the exclusion had not been used. The tax increase for excluded employer securities disposed of within the 5-year holding period will be treated as imposed under specific tax provisions. The basis of transferred securities will be their fair market value at the time of transfer. Two or more persons treated as a single employer under certain sections will be considered as one for this purpose. The election under subsection (a) must be made as prescribed by the Secretary and can only be revoked with consent. The Secretary must issue regulations for the application of the section to stock options and provide mechanisms to satisfy requirements in case an employee is inadvertently excluded from receiving employer securities. Reporting under sections 6045 and 6051 is required for transfers of stock covered by this section. The Secretary will issue regulations for applying the section to stock options and ensuring compliance if an employee is unintentionally excluded from receiving employer securities. Reporting is mandatory for stock transfers covered by this section. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. Sec. 83A. Qualified stock distributions to employees. The amendments apply to stock received after the enactment of this Act."
