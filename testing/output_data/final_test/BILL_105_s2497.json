    "content": "The Late-Term Abortion Limitation Act of 1998 is cited as the title of this Act. It amends Title 18, United States Code, by adding a new chapter 74 titled \"Ban on Certain Abortions.\" The Late-Term Abortion Limitation Act of 1998 adds a new chapter titled \"Ban on Certain Abortions\" to Title 18, United States Code. It prohibits post-viability abortions unless the physician certifies in writing that it is necessary to protect the mother's life or physical health. The Late-Term Abortion Limitation Act of 1998 prohibits post-viability abortions unless necessary to protect the mother's life or physical health. No woman who has had an abortion after fetal viability can be prosecuted for conspiring to violate the law. A medical emergency exception allows for abortion without certification, but the physician must document the specific medical condition. Penalties are enforced by the Attorney General. The Attorney General or designated officials can take legal action in federal court to enforce the Late-Term Abortion Limitation Act of 1998. Penalties for violations include suspension of medical license or fines up to $100,000 for first offense, and more severe penalties for subsequent offenses. Upon a second offense of knowingly violating a provision of the Late-Term Abortion Limitation Act of 1998, the court will notify the State medical licensing authority for license revocation or impose a civil penalty up to $250,000. The State medical licensing authority must be given an opportunity to be heard at a hearing to determine the penalty. Upon commencement of an action under subsection (a), the Attorney General or designated officials must certify to the court that notice of the alleged violation has been provided to the relevant State authorities at least 30 days prior to filing the action. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must publish proposed regulations for physician certifications within 60 days of enactment. Certifications must include a statement by the performing physician that the abortion was done in their best medical judgment. The abortion must be deemed medically necessary by the performing physician and certified by an independent physician or in cases of a medical emergency, certified by the performing physician. The physician must certify that the abortion is medically necessary or in cases of a medical emergency, based on the specific medical condition. Confidentiality regulations will be enforced to protect the mother's identity. States must develop procedures for revoking or suspending a physician's license for violating the regulations. Failure to implement these procedures may result in loss of funding under title XIX of the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act allows states to regulate post-viability abortions if permitted by the Constitution. Definitions in the act include \"grievous injury\" as a severe disease caused by pregnancy or inability to provide necessary care. The term 'grievous injury' in the Social Security Act refers to a severe disease caused by pregnancy or the inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition. A 'physician' is defined as a doctor legally authorized to perform abortions. Performing an abortion in violation of section 1531 subjects individuals to the provisions of this chapter. A clerical amendment is made to the table of chapters for part I of title 18, United States Code. Ban on certain abortions is outlined in section 1531."
