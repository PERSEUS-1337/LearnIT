    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community Reinvestment and Recovery Act\" and establishes a grant program. The Secretary of Defense will establish a grant program to help local communities recover from the economic impact of military base closures. Within 180 days of a closure announcement, eligible local government units will be determined. Grants will be provided through existing Federal programs. The Secretary of Defense will establish a grant program to assist local governments in recovering from the economic impact of military base closures. Grants can supplement funds from other Federal programs and provide financial assistance to eligible local governments. All Federal departments and agencies must cooperate with the Secretary in prioritizing funding for eligible local governments. The economic recovery plan outlined in Section 3 aims to assist local governments in recovering from the economic impact of military base closures. To be eligible for a grant under section 2, an eligible local government must submit a comprehensive local economic recovery plan to the Secretary. The plan should detail steps to recover from economic impacts and specify how grant funds will improve opportunities for industrial or commercial activity, create new jobs, or address economic problems in the community. The eligible local government can submit an application to the Secretary through cooperating departments to address economic problems within 90 days for review and action. SEC. 4. AMOUNT OF FUNDS.\n\nThe amount of funds available as grants under section 2 for the closure or major realignment of a military installation is 10 percent of the total projected savings by the Department of Defense in the first 10 years after the closure or realignment. The Secretary determines the projected savings soon after the closure announcement. Funding requests for these grants are submitted separately from the Department of Defense's normal appropriation requests.\n\nSEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORTS. Reports from grant recipients must be submitted to the Secretary detailing the progress of the local community in recovering from closure or realignment effects, along with the purposes of grant money used. The report should include a revised economic recovery plan and a statement of grant expenditures for the fiscal year. The Secretary evaluates these reports to ensure proper use of grant funds. If grant money received by a local government is not used in accordance with the Act's purposes, the Secretary can suspend further payments and eligibility until satisfactory assurances are provided for future compliance. The Secretary will establish regulations for local government grant eligibility, application approval, grant amounts, and other necessary rules. The Act defines \"military installation\" as a facility under the Department of Defense with a certain number of employees, and \"unit of local government\" as a general purpose local government entity. The term \"government\" refers to a general purpose unit of local government or an entity established for economic recovery in an area affected by military base closure. The term \"base closure law\" includes the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 and Title II of the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Funds may be appropriated to the Secretary as needed for this Act, available for up to 10 years. SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act will be effective on October 1, 1993, and applies to military installations selected for closure before or after this date."
