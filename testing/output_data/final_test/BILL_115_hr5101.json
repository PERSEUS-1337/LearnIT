    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Rewards Act\". It includes findings and expresses the sense of Congress. The Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative estimates that $20-40 billion is lost annually to corruption in developing countries. In 2014, $480 million in corruption proceeds hidden by former Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha was forfeited. The Department of Justice established the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative in 2010 to forfeit proceeds of foreign corruption and return them to benefit those harmed. Only about $5 billion of the $20-40 billion lost annually to corruption in developing countries has been repatriated in the last 15 years. Corruption weakens governments, reducing resources for fighting terrorism and building strong institutions. The United States has effective programs to reward individuals who assist in identifying and convicting criminals and seizing illicit assets. The Internal Revenue Service and the Department of State have programs to reward individuals for providing information on illicit activities. However, there are no specific programs that offer monetary incentives for identifying and recovering stolen assets related to foreign government corruption. Foreign government corruption involves officials stealing, misappropriating, or diverting assets for personal gain through embezzlement or bribes. Recovery of stolen assets may not always lead to forfeiture actions, hindering the ability to pay rewards under existing Treasury Department authorities. Officials take bribes to allow government resources to be expended in ways that lack transparency. They often use the US and international financial system to hide stolen assets. Whistleblowers who expose foreign corruption face risks to their safety and need incentives like monetary rewards and asylum to protect themselves and their families. It is the sense of Congress that a Department of the Treasury stolen asset recovery rewards program is needed to intensify the global fight against corruption and help identify and recover stolen assets linked to foreign government corruption. The program aims to forfeit proceeds of corruption and return stolen assets to the affected countries.
