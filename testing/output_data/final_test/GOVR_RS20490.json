    "content": "Singapore, with a population of 4.7 million, is a small city-state that holds significant economic and diplomatic influence due to its stable government, strong economy, educated population, and strategic location. It plays a crucial role in regional affairs, particularly as a key partner for the United States in trade and security cooperation. Singapore supports U.S. trade policy and security efforts in Asia while also maintaining close relations with China. The People's Action Party (PAP) has dominated Singapore's politics since 1959, benefiting from a fragmented opposition, economic success, and electoral procedures favoring the ruling party. In 2011, opposition parties made significant gains in parliament, prompting the PAP to promise reforms in response to public concerns. This marked a potential shift towards political pluralism in Singapore. Singapore's parliamentary-style government is led by the prime minister and cabinet, with the president serving as a ceremonial head of state. Lee Hsien Loong has been prime minister since 2004, succeeding his father Lee Kuan Yew, who resigned in 1990 after 31 years in power. The elder Lee, considered the architect of Singapore's success, stepped down as \"Minister Mentor\" in 2011 to pass leadership to the next generation. Electoral reforms in 2010 aimed to increase non-PAP representation in parliament, reflecting a more open and diverse Singapore. Leaders have acknowledged a \"contract\" with the people, emphasizing individual rights. Singapore's leaders have acknowledged a \"contract\" with the people, curbing individual rights for societal stability. Supporters praise the country's economic growth and living standards, while critics argue for more liberties to foster creativity and entrepreneurship. The government has attempted to control bloggers to limit criticism and sensitive issues. The ruling party, PAP, faces obstacles despite consistent election wins. The PAP maintains political dominance in Singapore by restricting political discourse and action, using defamation suits to deter opposition. Opposition politicians face obstacles, including bankruptcy for failing to pay libel damages. Singapore's economy relies on exports like consumer electronics, IT products, pharmaceuticals, and financial services. The GDP per capita is $61,400 (2012 estimate), with China, Malaysia, and the United States as major trading partners. The U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement is significant. Singapore's largest trading partner is the United States, with the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement boosting trade since 2004. In 2012, Singapore was the 17th largest U.S. trading partner with $50 billion in total trade, and the largest U.S. trading partner in ASEAN. The U.S. trade surplus with Singapore is the fifth largest globally, and U.S. direct foreign investment in Singapore exceeded $116 billion in 2012. Both countries are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Singapore is a key player in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), representing a third of the world's trade with Japan's entry. The country has a strong record of championing trade pacts and has concluded numerous free trade agreements. Singapore's mature economy and lack of significant agricultural sector make it easier for them to negotiate such agreements. Additionally, Singapore has a bilateral security and defense relationship with the United States. The 2005 \"Strategic Framework Agreement\" formalizes the bilateral security and defense relationship between Singapore and the United States. This agreement allows the U.S. military access to facilities in Singapore on a rotational basis without sovereignty issues. The U.S. Navy operates resupply vessels, a naval base, a ship repair facility, and an airfield in Singapore. Singapore also hosts a logistical command unit for coordinating warship deployment in the region. Additionally, U.S. fighter planes and naval vessels are rotated to Singapore regularly, and Changi Naval Base can accommodate a U.S. aircraft carrier. The only facility in Southeast Asia that can dock a U.S. aircraft carrier, Singapore forces train regularly in the United States. Security cooperation has grown under the Obama Administration with increased bilateral exercises and training, including joint air combat exercises and urban training at Singapore's Murai Urban Training Facility. Singapore has initiatives to strengthen global cargo security procedures and is a member of the Container Security Initiative and the Proliferation Security Initiative. The USS Freedom, a U.S. Navy littoral combat ship, arrived in Singapore in April 2013 for a 10-month deployment in Southeast Asia. Singapore's hosting of the LCS symbolizes its role in the U.S. \"pivot\" to the region. The LCS is designed for close-to-shore combat in shallow waters, with anti-mine and anti-submarine capabilities. Singapore's advanced facilities and political influence allow it to host U.S. naval assets, supporting ASEAN's regional diplomacy efforts. Singapore plays a key role in regional diplomacy, especially in relation to China. The Obama Administration's renewed engagement has allowed Singapore more diplomatic space to address Beijing on important issues. Singapore emphasizes the importance of maintaining strong relations with both China and the United States, positioning itself as a balancer and intermediary between major powers in the region. Prime Minister Lee advised the U.S. to strengthen economic ties with the region and build trust with Beijing during a visit to Washington in April 2013. Singapore maintains a neutral stance on China's island claims, while also hosting Chinese surveillance vessels for technical cooperation on maritime safety. Despite China's economic power, Singapore's relationship with Beijing is multifaceted, including cultural, political, and educational exchanges. Singapore adheres to a one-China policy but has a strong relationship with Taiwan, conducting military exercises and exploring a free-trade pact under the WTO framework. The ruling party in Singapore, the PAP, maintains political dominance by intimidating opposition and restricting political discourse. Defamation suits are used to discourage opposition, and the government emphasizes social discipline over individual liberties. Opposition politicians face obstacles, including bankruptcy for failing to pay libel damages to PAP leaders. In 2013, Singapore faced criticism for its control of the press, ranking 149th out of 179 countries in terms of press freedom. New media regulations were implemented, prompting backlash from international internet companies."
