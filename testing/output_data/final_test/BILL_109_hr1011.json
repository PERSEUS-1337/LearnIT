Congress finds that over 150,000 people were killed in the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia, with more than 5,000,000 directly affected. Approximately 150,000 pregnant women in the most affected countries are facing complications, including trauma-induced miscarriages. The Indonesian Midwife's Association lost 30% of its members in the tsunami, impacting the urgent assistance needed for pregnancies in Indonesia. In disaster situations, healthcare systems collapse. In disaster situations, healthcare systems crumble when most needed, especially for pregnant women. Emergency relief focuses on food, shelter, and security, neglecting safe delivery for women in labor and their special health needs. Maternity hospitals and women's health clinics providing maternal health assistance, safe delivery, contraceptives, and emergency obstetric care have been destroyed by the tsunami. The Galle Teaching Hospital in Galle, Sri Lanka, relocated its patients to a facility on higher ground after being damaged by the tsunami. The new facility has fewer beds than the original hospital. In disaster situations, the lack of essential supplies and trained personnel leads to a rise in the death toll, especially for pregnant women. Violence against women, including rape, is also a concern during such crises. Violence against women, including rape and physical abuse, has been reported during rescue operations and in temporary shelters. The Women and Media Collective Group in Sri Lanka has appealed for attention to safety issues for women in relief efforts. The UNFPA has programs dedicated to maternal and child health care, safe delivery of babies, reproductive health, contraceptive supplies, and other critical assistance in Indonesia, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka. The UNFPA has experience in providing humanitarian relief support for victims of disasters. In 2001, the Bush Administration gave $600,000 to the UNFPA for emergency reproductive health needs of Afghan women refugees. The support was used for maternal and child health services in various crisis areas like Sudan, Eritrea, Kosovo, and Sierra Leone. The UNFPA has appealed for $28,000,000 from donor countries to provide relief to women in Indonesia, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka. SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE TO TSUNAMI VICTIMS. The Secretary of State authorizes funding to the UNFPA for tsunami victims in Indonesia, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka. The funding will be used for providing equipment, reestablishing maternal health services, preventing violence against women and youth, and offering psychological support and counseling. Authorization of $3,000,000 to the Secretary of State for providing psychological support, counseling, and vital services to unaccompanied women and vulnerable individuals."
