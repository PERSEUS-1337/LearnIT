    "content": "Most Social Security and Tier I Railroad Retirement benefits are not taxed, but up to 85% of Social Security benefits can be taxable for recipients with provisional income exceeding certain thresholds based on filing status. Provisional income includes adjusted gross income, tax-exempt interest, certain excluded income, and 50% of Social Security benefits. The thresholds for taxable benefits are $25,000 for single filers and $32,000 for joint filers. If provisional income exceeds certain thresholds based on filing status, up to 85% of Social Security benefits can be taxable. The thresholds are $25,000 for single filers and $32,000 for joint filers. The amount of taxable benefits is determined by different tiers of provisional income, with varying percentages and thresholds. The taxable portion of Social Security benefits for married taxpayers filing separately is the lesser of 85% of benefits or 85% of provisional income. Thresholds are not adjusted for inflation. Examples in Table 2 show how taxable benefits are calculated for single retirees with different levels of non-Social Security income. The taxable portion of Social Security benefits increases as non-Social Security income rises, resulting in higher taxable benefits. Figures illustrate this for single retirees with varying annual Social Security benefits. Provisional income, the sum of non-Social Security income and half of Social Security benefits, determines the taxable amount. For single retirees, the taxable portion of Social Security benefits increases with higher non-Social Security income. Provisional income, the total of non-Social Security income and half of Social Security benefits, determines the taxable amount. Once provisional income exceeds $25,000, additional non-Social Security income results in more taxable income. This continues until 85% of Social Security benefits are taxable, after which the taxable benefits remain constant. The taxable portion of Social Security benefits for single retirees increases with higher non-Social Security income. Additional tax owed is determined by the taxpayer's marginal tax rate. Figure 2 illustrates taxable benefits for retirees with different income levels as Social Security benefits increase. For those with $10,000 in benefits, they remain untaxed unless non-Social Security income exceeds $20,000. The additional tax owed on taxable Social Security benefits is determined by the taxpayer's marginal tax rate. Married couples filing jointly may have lower taxable benefits compared to single retirees. Special considerations affecting the taxation of benefits formula include lump sum distributions, repayments, workers' compensation coordination, treatment of nonresident aliens, and wage withholding. The Railroad Retirement Act prohibits states from taxing railroad retirement benefits. States may tax Social Security benefits but are prohibited from taxing railroad retirement benefits. State personal income taxes typically follow federal taxes, with adjustments made for railroad retirement benefits and Social Security benefits. Some states calculate income taxes based on income by source rather than federal tax values. In 30 states and the District of Columbia, Social Security benefits are fully excluded from state personal income tax. Seven states tax all or part of Social Security benefits differently from the federal government, while six states follow federal tax treatment. The remaining seven states have no personal income tax. The share of Social Security beneficiaries affected by income thresholds for taxation has increased over time, with 49% affected in 2014 according to the Congressional Budget Office. The percentage of Social Security beneficiaries affected by taxation of benefits has almost doubled since 1998, with 49% affected in 2014. The taxation of benefits increases with income, and the proceeds are credited to various trust funds. In 2016, the OASI and DI trust funds received $31.6 billion from taxation of benefits, accounting for 3.4% of total income. The HI fund received $20.2 billion from taxation, making up 7.3% of its total income. Income taxes on Social Security benefits are expected to become a significant revenue source due to non-indexed income thresholds. Currently, 35% of Social Security benefits are taxable, projected to increase to over 50% by 2046. Income taxes collected from benefits are estimated to grow from 0.2% of GDP in 2016 to 0.3% by 2046. The income tax share for Social Security is projected to increase from 4% to 6.5% over the next 30 years, reaching over 7% by 2095. For Medicare, income tax on benefits will rise from 3% to 4.7% by 2040. Social Security benefits were exempt from federal income tax until 1984, based on rulings from the Department of the Treasury. The ruling on Social Security payments exempted benefits from income taxation, aligning with the program's purpose. This contrasted with the tax treatment of retirement benefits from private pension plans and government pension systems. The worker's contribution to Social Security is half of the payroll tax, known as FICA tax. The amount paid into the system is not subtracted from income subject to federal tax. Employer contributions are not part of the employee's income and are deductible as a business expense. The 1979 Advisory Council on Social Security recommended aligning tax treatment of Social Security benefits with private pensions. The 1979 Advisory Council on Social Security recommended that half of everyone's benefit be taxed as a matter of \"rough justice,\" in contrast to the National Commission's position. This was to avoid taxing more of the benefit than most people would consider appropriate, aligning tax treatment of Social Security benefits with private pensions. The National Commission on Social Security Reform recommended in 1983 that 50% of Social Security cash benefits be taxable for individuals with adjusted gross income over $20,000 for single taxpayers and $25,000 for married couples, with proceeds going to the Social Security trust funds. No indexing provisions were included, and it was estimated that 10% of beneficiaries would be subject to taxation. The 1983 Social Security Amendments recommended taxing 50% of benefits for individuals with income over specific thresholds. Congress adopted this proposal with a formula that gradually increased the taxable share as income rose, up to a maximum of 50% of benefits. Provisional income was calculated as adjusted gross income plus tax-exempt interest, certain income exclusions, and 50% of Social Security benefits. The Social Security Administration estimated that applying pension tax rules to Social Security would result in varying ratios of total employee payroll taxes to expected benefits. Workers with higher incomes would have a higher ratio, with highly paid males entering the workforce in 1993 estimated to have a ratio of 15%. However, applying tax rules for private and public pensions poses practical administrative challenges. President Clinton proposed increasing the portion of Social Security benefits subject to taxation from 50% to 85% in 1994. This would only affect recipients already paying taxes on benefits, based on thresholds of $25,000 for single filers and $32,000 for married filers. Calculating the ratio of contributions to benefits for each individual presents complex administrative challenges. The 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act increased the ratio of taxable Social Security benefits from 50% to 85%, with the additional proceeds going to the Medicare Hospital Insurance program. This measure aimed to prevent recipients from having a higher percentage of benefits subject to tax than other pension plans, while also avoiding budget reconciliation process obstacles. The 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act increased the taxation of Social Security benefits to 85%, with thresholds set at $34,000 for single filers and $44,000 for married filers. President Clinton signed the measure into law on August 10, 1993, and there have been no direct legislative changes regarding the taxation of Social Security benefits since then. A Social Security beneficiary may receive a lump sum distribution of benefits owed for prior years. The taxable portion of the lump-sum distribution can be calculated by including all benefits for prior years in the current year's taxable income or by recalculating prior year taxable benefits using prior year income. Repayments of overpaid benefits may also be required, affecting the taxable portion of benefits. The calculation of taxable Social Security benefits is based on net benefits, which is gross benefits minus any prior overpayment repayments. For married taxpayers filing jointly, net benefits are the sum of the couple's gross benefits minus the repayment. If the repayment results in negative net benefits, there are no taxable benefits, and the taxpayer may take a miscellaneous deduction or credit. Workers' compensation payments can reduce Social Security benefits for individuals under full retirement age, but workers' compensation is generally not taxable. Workers' compensation is generally not taxable and can reduce Social Security benefits for individuals under full retirement age. Nonresident aliens may receive Social Security benefits if they have engaged in covered employment and meet eligibility requirements, regardless of citizenship status. Nonresident aliens may have taxable Social Security benefits based on the Substantial Presence Test. Withholding for wage earners is based on estimated annual income taxes. Exceptions exist for nonresident aliens or U.S. citizens abroad under tax treaties. Social Security Administration determines taxes based on recipient's non-Social Security income. The Uruguay Round Agreements Act amended the Internal Revenue Code to allow voluntary tax withholding from Social Security benefits, effective from February 1999. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 permitted withholding at rates of 7% or the bottom three tax bracket rates. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended tax provisions to 2012, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made them permanent. Nonresident aliens are subject to a 30% tax withholding rate on U.S. income, with potential withholding of 25.5% on Social Security benefits."
