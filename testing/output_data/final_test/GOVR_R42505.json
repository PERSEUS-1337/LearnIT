    "content": "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, aims to increase food purchasing power for low-income households to buy a nutritionally adequate diet. SNAP is authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, reauthorized periodically through the farm bill. The 2008 farm bill changed the Food Stamp Program to SNAP and the governing law to the Food and Nutrition Act. State names for the program may vary. The USDA-FNS administers SNAP with a framework of federal law and state options. SNAP benefits are available for eligible households. SNAP benefits are available for households that meet federal financial eligibility tests. Categorical eligibility allows states to modify these rules. 42 states use broad-based categorical eligibility. To qualify for SNAP, households must meet work effort, citizenship, and legal permanent residence requirements. Maximum SNAP benefits are based on the Thrifty Food Plan and vary by household size. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) calculates benefits based on household income and size. Recipients with no income receive the maximum allotment, while those with income receive a reduced amount. SNAP has financial, work-related, and categorical eligibility tests. Financial tests require income and assets below set limits. Work-related tests may require household members to register. Under work-related tests, household members must register for work, accept suitable job offers, and fulfill state agency requirements. SNAP eligibility for Able-bodied Adults Without Dependents is limited to 3 months unless working or in a training program. Categorical eligibility rules automatically qualify some for SNAP assistance, while others are denied eligibility based on specific criteria. The SNAP program has specific eligibility criteria for noncitizens, postsecondary students, and individuals living in institutional settings. Applications cannot be denied based on residence length, lack of fixed address, or absence of identification. The household is the basic SNAP beneficiary unit, which can consist of a single person or a group living together. The household definition differs from other means-tested programs but is similar to programs like the National School Lunch Program and WIC. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) are part of the Lunch Program. Individuals living together are considered a single household if they purchase food and prepare meals together. Household members must apply together, and their income, expenses, and assets are aggregated for food stamp eligibility. However, some individuals living together can be considered separate households for program purposes, such as spouses, parents and children, and minors under parental control. Individuals 60 years or older with a substantial disability may apply separately for SNAP if they cannot purchase food and prepare meals separately from their co-residents. Certain group living arrangements, like drug addiction treatment programs or shelters, may be eligible for SNAP benefits as separate households. Elderly or disabled members in a household are entitled to different SNAP deduction rules. Households with elderly or disabled members are entitled to different SNAP deduction rules and financial eligibility criteria. One- and two-person households are guaranteed a minimum monthly benefit of $15. Different SNAP households can live together, and recipients can reside with non-recipients, with eligibility based on household size excluding non-recipients. There are two pathways to SNAP eligibility, with financial thresholds outlined. The traditional pathway to SNAP eligibility is based on income and asset thresholds outlined in the Food and Nutrition Act. Categorical eligibility allows certain households receiving specific benefits to bypass financial rules and automatically qualify for SNAP benefits. States have the option to interpret categorical eligibility. The traditional pathway to SNAP eligibility is based on income and asset thresholds outlined in the Food and Nutrition Act. States have the option to interpret categorical eligibility broadly. Eligibility for households without elderly or disabled members is determined by both gross and net monthly income, while households with elderly or disabled members are assessed based on net income only. Gross income includes all cash income except specific exclusions. Most payments to third parties, irregular income up to $30 per quarter, loans, income for caring for someone outside the household, lump sum payments like tax refunds, federal energy assistance, reimbursement for expenses, income earned by schoolchildren, self-employment income costs, federal student aid, and training earnings for dependent children are all considered for eligibility for SNAP benefits. Net monthly income is calculated by subtracting certain deductions from a household's gross income to determine the amount available for food purchases. States may also choose to exclude other types of income in their TANF or Medicaid programs. Net monthly income is determined by deducting various expenses from the gross income, including a standard deduction, earned income deduction, child support deduction, dependent care deduction, and excess shelter deduction. The standard deduction amount varies based on household size and is adjusted for inflation. The standard deduction for net monthly income is based on household size and statutorily set parameters, with minimum amounts specified for different regions. The excess shelter deduction is also limited to specific amounts for each region, indexed for inflation. The SNAP program provides deductions for households with elderly or disabled members, including standard deductions for income, child support, earned income, and dependent care. There is also an uncapped excess shelter deduction and allowance for out-of-pocket medical expenses. Household income must not exceed federal poverty guidelines for eligibility. To qualify for SNAP, households must meet income eligibility limits based on federal poverty guidelines. These limits are uniform for most states but higher in Alaska and Hawaii. Liquid assets must not exceed $2,250 for households without elderly or disabled members. Net income calculations are crucial for determining eligibility and benefit amounts. Households with an elderly or disabled member cannot have liquid assets above $3,500, annually adjusted for inflation. Counted assets include cash, savings, stocks, and nonrecurring lump sum payments. Certain assets like vehicles and property not generating income are also considered. Primary residence, business assets, and personal property are not counted. Assets that count towards eligibility for SNAP include personal property, lump sum payments, burial plots, cash value of life insurance, pension savings, and education savings. Special rules apply for vehicles, with states often only counting them to the extent of their TANF programs. Additional assets may be excluded based on TANF or Medicaid rules. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) offers categorical eligibility to households participating in specific means-tested programs like TANF, Supplemental Security Income, or state General Assistance. This allows them to bypass traditional income and asset eligibility rules for SNAP. The broad categorical eligibility for SNAP includes granting eligibility to those receiving TANF-funded benefits, allowing states to extend this eligibility by providing nominal TANF-funded benefits. 42 states offer broad-based categorical eligibility, with 5 states imposing an asset limit. States must set a gross income limit of 200% of the federal poverty line for TANF-funded benefits to make applicants eligible for SNAP, but eligibility does not guarantee a SNAP benefit. Current SNAP law has rules on employment for able-bodied adults, with state-specific variations in the SNAP Employment and Training Program. Able-bodied adults without dependents must work a minimum of 20 hours per week to receive benefits, with a 3-month limit over a 36-month period if not met. States have some flexibility in enforcing this time limit based on local labor market conditions. To maintain eligibility for SNAP benefits, able-bodied adults must register for work, accept suitable job offers, fulfill work requirements, provide necessary information to the state agency, and not quit a job without good cause. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in disqualification from SNAP for varying periods of time. In FY2016, 44.1% of SNAP participants were children; 11.8% were elderly; and 9.1% were non-elderly disabled adults, totaling 65% who would not be expected to meet work requirements. States reported that 13.4 million participants were subject to SNAP work requirements and had to register for work, accept job offers, and fulfill work obligations. Minimum disqualification periods range from one to six months, with the option to disqualify the entire household for up to 180 days for non-compliance with work requirements. In FY2016, states served approximately 692,000 participants in Employment and Training (E&T) services, which can include supervised job search, workfare, work experience, education programs, or other approved activities. States may require work registrants to participate in E&T programs, with exemptions for certain individuals. The \"ABAWD Rule\" limits SNAP benefits for able-bodied adults without dependents to 3 months out of a 36-month period unless they meet work requirements. States have the option to offer ABAWDs slots in employment and training programs or workfare programs, with some states receiving extra federal funding for pledging to serve all ABAWDs in these programs. The ABAWD rule limits SNAP benefits for able-bodied adults without dependents to 3 months out of a 36-month period unless they meet work requirements. States can offer ABAWDs slots in employment and training programs or workfare programs to avoid benefit termination. Waivers are available for areas with high unemployment rates or insufficient job availability. USDA-FNS regulation specifies criteria for waivers of the ABAWD rule. States can exempt up to 15% of ABAWDs from the time limit. The ARRA suspended the rule from 2009-2010. Many states had waivers due to high unemployment, but some have declined, leading to a decline in SNAP participation. The USDA-FNS reports show a decline in SNAP participation due to states administering the ABAWD time limit waivers. In FY2015, 31 states had statewide waivers, decreasing to 11 states in FY2016, 9 states in FY2017, and 8 states in FY2018. Non-citizens are often ineligible for SNAP benefits. Non-citizens are often ineligible for SNAP benefits, with eligibility extended only to certain groups like permanent residents, legal immigrant children, the elderly, disabled, refugees, veterans, and those with a substantial work history. SNAP benefits can be denied for rule violations, asset transfers, and college students aged 18-50 are generally ineligible. College students aged 18-50 attending higher education courses half-time or more are ineligible for SNAP benefits, unless they meet specific criteria such as being disabled, employed at least 20 hours per week, a parent, or receiving TANF cash assistance benefits. Other ineligibility rules include households with members on strike and individuals living in institutional settings, except for certain approved cases. Persons in shelters for battered women and children or the homeless cannot receive SNAP benefits unless they apply with their household. Failure to provide Social Security numbers or cooperate in verifying eligibility results in ineligibility. Automatic disqualification applies to those applying in multiple jurisdictions, fleeing arrest, or convicted of a drug-related felony. Additional felons must comply with their sentence terms to receive SNAP benefits as per the 2014 farm bill. States may disqualify individuals not cooperating with child support enforcement or in arrears on child support. Separate SNAP benefit offerings exist outside the standard application process. States have the option to provide up to five months of transitional SNAP benefits to those leaving TANF or a similar state program without requiring a new SNAP application. Benefits can be adjusted based on changed circumstances, and households may reapply for continued benefits under regular SNAP rules after the transitional period. SNAP benefits can be provided to households affected by disasters through transitional benefits or the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP). These benefits are federally financed and can be used for replacement or additional benefits. After the D-SNAP benefit period ends, households may apply for SNAP under regular program rules. The eligibility rules of SNAP determine who is eligible for benefits and the benefit calculation process determines the monthly benefit amount based on household size, net income, and the Thrifty Food Plan. The USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion sets minimal nutrition requirements for SNAP benefits, based on the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) for a four-person family. Allotments are adjusted annually for food price inflation, with higher allotments in certain states with different food costs. The TFP contents were last revised in 2006. SNAP benefits vary based on household size, net income, and location. Benefits are calculated by subtracting 30% of net income from the maximum allotment. For example, a three-person household with $400 in net income would receive $384 in benefits. Benefits are not taxable. SNAP benefits are not taxable and purchases made with them may not be charged sales taxes. Eligible one- or two-person households are guaranteed a minimum monthly benefit equal to 8% of the maximum benefit for a one-person household. The minimum benefit for FY2018 is $15 a month for households in the 48 states and DC. If the benefit calculation yields less than $15 for a one- or two-person household, they are guaranteed to receive $15. In FY2016, over 8% of SNAP households received the minimum benefit of $15 a month. States contract with private vendors for benefit issuance through EBT systems. EBT cards can include SNAP benefits for food purchases and cash benefits for other payments. SNAP benefits are issued monthly, and eligibility must be determined within 30 days of application. SNAP benefits must be made available within 30 days of application, with expedited service for households in immediate need. Benefits can be prorated for the first month based on the application date or recertification requirements. If eligibility is not met in a timely manner, benefits for the first month of a new certification period are prorated. \"SNAP benefits are prorated based on recertification date. Benefits can only be used for eligible food at authorized stores with EBT machines. Trafficking SNAP benefits for cash is illegal, with penalties for retailers and recipients. USDA-FNS detects and penalizes stores engaged in retailer trafficking.\" The FNS analysis found an increase in retailer trafficking rate to 1.5% from 1.3% in the previous study. States are responsible for detecting and penalizing trafficking recipients, with FNS providing grants and assistance. SNAP benefits can be used in approved stores for food items, excluding alcohol, tobacco, and hot foods for immediate consumption. SNAP benefits can also be used for seeds and plants for personal food production. SNAP benefits can be redeemed for meals in communal dining programs, home-delivered meals, and various shelters. In remote areas of Alaska, benefits can be used for hunting and fishing equipment. In FY2017, almost all SNAP benefits were redeemed in markets and stores, with a small portion used for meal services and delivery routes. Superstores and supermarkets accounted for the majority of authorized stores. In FY2017, supermarkets accounted for the majority of authorized stores, with approximately 82% of SNAP benefits redeemed at these stores. Convenience stores, while making up over 45% of authorized stores, only saw less than 6% of benefits redeemed. Retailers must meet inventory requirements and pass an inspection to be authorized for SNAP benefits redemption. SNAP benefits eligibility for retailers is based on staple food categories and sales requirements. Retailers must offer a variety of qualifying foods in staple categories or have over 50% of sales from eligible foods. SNAP benefits are generally not redeemable at restaurants, except for a state restaurant option where states can authorize restaurants to accept SNAP benefits. States have the option to authorize restaurants to accept SNAP benefits for homeless, elderly, and disabled individuals. California, Arizona, Rhode Island, and Florida currently operate state-administered restaurant programs for these populations. In FY2017, $63.5 million were redeemed at \"Private Restaurant/Meal Delivery.\" Farmers' markets can also become SNAP-licensed retailers, with over 7,000 authorized to accept SNAP benefits in FY2017, redeeming over $22.4 million. This marked an increase of over 5% in authorizations and nearly 11% in benefits redeemed compared to FY2016. States, localities, and farmers' market networks have implemented SNAP bonus incentive programs to promote fruit and vegetable purchases. Participants can exchange benefits for vouchers worth more than the dollar amount, with some projects using electronic currency. The 2014 farm bill established the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) grant program to provide funding for bonus incentives, allowing grantees to experiment with different methods of incentivizing SNAP purchases."
