    "content": "The Military Construction Appropriations conference report recommending $8.834 billion was approved by the House and Senate in June 2000, becoming P.L.106-246 on July 13, 2000. The FY2001 defense authorization bill authorized $8.8 billion, $787 million more than the President's request. The Department of Defense manages the world's largest infrastructure, covering over 40,000 square miles of land and a physical plant worth over $500 billion. The military construction appropriations bill provides funding for maintaining a physical plant worth over $500 billion, including construction projects, real property maintenance, military family housing operations, and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) costs. It is part of annual legislation that funds national defense, along with the defense appropriations bill. The defense appropriations bill funds military activities, excluding construction. The national defense authorization bill authorizes appropriations for defense. The energy and water development appropriations bill funds atomic energy defense activities and civil projects by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The annual defense authorization bill covers all defense appropriation measures, including military construction debates. The separate military construction appropriations bill was established in the late 1950s to address the increased defense spending for facilities, missile silos, and infrastructure. The first stand-alone military construction bill was in FY1959, P.L. 85-852, separate from annual defense appropriations or supplemental funding. Military construction funding is provided through annual defense appropriations or supplemental bills, serving as a major source for facility investments by the military services and defense agencies. Funds for real property maintenance and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation-related facilities are also included. These appropriations are generally available for obligation for five fiscal years. The military construction budget process begins with the President's budget delivery to Congress each year. In FY2001, the President requested $8.0 billion. The President requested $8.0 billion for military construction in FY2001. The conference report recommending $8.834 billion was approved by the House and Senate, becoming P.L. 106-246 on July 13, 2000. The debate focused on domestic and defense items in the FY2000 supplemental emergency appropriations. The House passed the FY2001 Military Construction Appropriations Act (H.R. 4425) on May 16, 2000. The House passed H.R. 4425 by a 386-22 vote with a Traficant amendment prohibiting funds for violators of \"Buy American\" laws. The bill reprimands the Pentagon for military construction shortfalls, denies advance appropriations requests, and expects facility modernization programs in the Quadrennial Defense Review. The $8.634 billion bill passed by voice vote, 4% over last year's bill. The Senate passed S. 2521 with a vote of 96-4, adding emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2000. The bill includes funding for military construction, family housing, and Base Realignment and Closure costs. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the Pentagon for underfunding and required contingency funding for flexibility in completing projects. The Senate passed a $8.634 billion bill with funding for military construction, family housing, and Base Realignment and Closure costs. The bill also included emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2000, covering peacekeeping costs, counter-terrorism, fuel and health-care costs for DOD dependents, and counter-narcotics costs in Columbia. The debate on the bill focused on supplemental riders on gun control. The Senate debated supplemental riders on gun control and Kosovo in bill S. 2521. A controversial provision to withdraw U.S. troops from Kosovo by July 1, 2001 was voted down. The House passed the defense authorization bill H.R. 4205, recommending $8.4 billion for military construction. The Senate recommended $8.46 billion for military construction, $430 million more than the President's request, and the FY2001 defense authorization bill became P.L. 106-398 on October 30, 2000, authorizing $8.8 billion, $787 million more than the President's request. The conferees added over $200 million of the service chiefs' unfunded requirements and emphasized improvements for military personnel and their families. The Military Housing Privatization Initiative, known as Section 2806, is extended to December 31, 2004. Congress and the Administration have debated military construction funding and planning adequacy. The Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) is used by the Department of Defense for budgeting and long-term financial planning. The Pentagon's long-term financial plan, known as the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), has faced criticism from Congress for poor military construction planning and funding sufficiency. Rep. Joel Hefley expressed concerns over the FY2001 budget request continuing a trend of inadequate planning and funding for military construction. The mismatch between planned funds and actual requests has been a point of contention in congressional criticism of the Pentagon's military construction planning. At a HASC hearing, concerns were raised about the Pentagon's military construction planning and funding. Rep. Hefley and Sen. Burns criticized the FY2001 budget request for lacking long-term planning. In response, Deputy Under Secretary Yim established an Installation Policy Board to address these concerns. The Installation Policy Board, chaired by Yim, develops tools for efficient planning, including a facilities strategic plan, sustainment model, and readiness reporting system. DOD seeks to extend the Military Housing Privatization Initiative for five more years. The Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) pilot program is set to be extended for an additional five years to address the ongoing problem of military family housing. The DOD believes that the authorities provided by the MHPI will help solve the housing situation by 2010, in conjunction with traditional government-funded construction. Testimony by Randall Yim highlighted that a significant number of DOD family housing units require extensive renovation or replacement. The Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) aims to address the military family housing problem by 2010. Testimony by Randall Yim emphasized the need for privatization, increased housing allowances, and a strong construction program to fix the issue. Congress passed the MHPI in 1996 to provide new authorities for private sector financing and expertise in military housing. The Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) provides new authorities for private sector financing and expertise in military housing. These authorities include guarantees, conveyance or lease of existing property, investments, and direct loans. The history of DOD's implementation of MHPI shows significant progress in developing program criteria and financial models. The Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) has faced challenges due to problems in DOD's centralized management structure. In 1998, the Pentagon shifted execution of housing privatization projects to the Services. So far, four projects have been completed, twelve solicited, and fourteen planned under MHPI. Progress has been slow, with concerns raised by Representative Gene Taylor about the pace of implementation. The General Accounting Office (GAO) also highlighted some issues with privatization. The General Accounting Office (GAO) raised concerns about the privatization initiative for military housing in 1998. Initial evaluation showed potential savings of only about 10% or less compared to traditional military housing. GAO criticized poor Pentagon planning, lack of integration with community needs, underutilization of local housing, and poor communication between offices. GAO recommended better integrated plans to maximize the privatization initiative and minimize total housing costs. The GAO recommended that the DOD create a privatization evaluation plan to assess the initiative's effectiveness in eliminating inadequate housing more economically and faster than traditional military construction financing. The plan should include performance measures, evaluation of costs, developer performance, and housing satisfaction for service members. DOD is pursuing utility privatization through Section 2871 of Title 10 for cost savings and infrastructure recapitalization. The goal is to privatize 1,700 utility systems by 2003, with 12 systems already privatized, saving over $10 million. The authority requires long-term economic benefits to exceed costs, divesting ownership of utility systems where feasible. The DOD is seeking Congress to amend utility privatization authority to allow installations to keep savings. Congress has consistently added funds to military construction budgets, especially for Guard and Reserve needs. For example, in FY1996, $479 million was added, followed by $850 million in FY1997, and $800 million in another year. Congress has frequently added funds to military construction budgets, with amounts ranging from $479 million in FY1996 to $875 million in FY1999. This has been a common and controversial practice throughout the 1990s, driven by concerns of chronic underfunding, differing priorities between Congress and the Administration, and the influence of individual members like Senator Bond. In recent years, Congress has added significant amounts for National Guard and Reserve construction projects, reaching a peak of $451.1 million in FY2000. This has led to growing maintenance backlogs and conflicts between congressional and Pentagon priorities. Military construction proponents argue that facilities have been underfunded for many years, as highlighted in a GAO review presented to the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. The GAO review presented to the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness highlighted Congress's concerns about the DOD's real property maintenance. The backlog for deferred maintenance has increased from $8.9 billion in 1992 to $14.6 billion in 1998. DOD facility managers have not met the goal of allocating 3% of the plant replacement value for annual construction and maintenance. Actual DOD funding typically runs at 1 to 2% of plant replacement value, with the Navy budgeting 1.8% for real property maintenance. Congressional military construction proponents welcome any additional funding. Congressional military construction subcommittees have frequently disagreed with Administration military construction priorities, often reallocating funds from construction overseas to domestic projects. Congress has added funds for quality of life improvements, arguing that the military services have neglected these areas. The debate over added projects has centered on how to prioritize military construction budgets. In 1994, Senate debated military construction appropriations bill, focusing on congressional additions to request despite defense spending constraints. Senator McCain objected to substantial amounts for unrequested projects, calling it \"pork barrel\" spending. He proposed criteria for additional projects to be on critical military lists. McCain's amendment was accepted but not included in the final bill conference version. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1995 incorporated Senator McCain's criteria for unrequested construction projects, including being essential to national security, not conflicting with the Base Realignment and Closure Act, in the services' defense plan, executable in the authorized year, and offset by reductions in other defense accounts. The House military construction committees have also used similar criteria since the 104th Congress. The military construction budget requires projects to meet specific criteria, similar to the McCain criteria, to be added. Senator McCain raised concerns about Congress adding nearly $975 million in extra projects for FY2000. The Administration proposed $8.0 billion for FY2001, but the conference report approved $8.8 billion. The FY2001 military construction budget was approved at $8.8 billion, continuing a downward trend from previous years. The enacted amount is higher than FY2000 but lower than previous years. Congressional actions and add-ons for Guard and Reserve projects are detailed in various tables. P.L. 106-246, H.R. 4425, allocated funds for military construction, family housing, and base realignment for FY2001. The House Committee on Appropriations reported an original measure, H.Rept. 106-614, on May 11, 2000, for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001.

The House Committee on Appropriations filed a report on H.R. 4205 on May 11, 2000. The Senate considered and incorporated this measure into H.R. 4425 as an amendment on May 18, 2000. H.R. 4205 was passed by the House on May 18, 2000, and became P.L. 106-398 on October 30, 2000. Additionally, S. 2549 was introduced by Warner to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2001 for military activities. S. 2549 (Warner) authorizes appropriations for military activities, construction, and defense activities for fiscal year 2001. The Senate passed the bill with an amendment on July 13, 2000.
