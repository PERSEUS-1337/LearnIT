    "content": "The National Mortgage Settlement resulted from investigations into foreclosure practices of large mortgage servicers, prompted by evidence of systematic mortgage documentation and procedural improprieties. This included signing affidavits without personal knowledge, backdating documents, not adhering to notarization requirements, and losing paperwork. The National Mortgage Settlement stemmed from investigations into foreclosure practices, including issues with foreclosure-related documents, excessive fees, and improper borrower consideration for mortgage modifications. State and federal regulators launched investigations and legal actions against top mortgage servicers for violations. The National Mortgage Settlement was announced by state and federal officials with the exception of Oklahoma's attorney general, involving the top five mortgage servicers. The settlement will provide about $25 billion in relief primarily to homeowners affected by foreclosure. It is the second largest legal settlement ever reached by attorneys general. The agreements require the servicers to comply with specified servicing standards and provide five forms of relief in exchange for a release of liability for legal claims. The National Mortgage Settlement involves the top five mortgage servicers providing $25 billion in relief to homeowners affected by foreclosure. The agreements require compliance with servicing standards and offer various forms of consumer relief, compensation for servicemembers, payments to individuals foreclosed by the servicers, and direct payments to governments for legal claims resolution. Individual homeowners are not directly involved in the agreements and do not have a private right of action to enforce them. The National Mortgage Settlement does not limit enforcement power of state or federal regulators. Federal banking regulators began examining foreclosure processes of top mortgage servicers in 2010. Mortgage servicers are being held accountable through various avenues for alleged transgressions. The banking regulators found critical weaknesses in servicers' foreclosure processes during 2009 and 2010. In April 2011, consent orders were issued to 14 mortgage servicers and third-party vendors. The National Mortgage Settlement's Servicing Standards overlap with the Federal Banking Consent Orders. The National Mortgage Settlement's Servicing Standards aim to correct alleged servicing improprieties by requiring servicers to implement over 300 specific standards, including establishing a single point of contact for delinquent borrowers and maintaining electronic documentation of interactions. Compliance with these provisions may be overseen and enforced. The Servicing Standards of the National Mortgage Settlement require servicers to document interactions with borrowers and ensure compliance with mortgage-related protections. The Consumer Relief component provides assistance to struggling borrowers with principal reductions and other forms of relief. The National Mortgage Settlement agreements require servicers to provide homeowners with various types of mortgage relief, including principal reductions, short sales, refinancings, and other modifications. Servicers must meet a minimum \"Commitment Amount\" of approximately $20 billion in relief, with different levels of credit earned for each type of relief provided. The scoring system incentivizes servicers to prioritize relief that is most beneficial to consumers, such as principal forgiveness on first lien mortgages. The National Mortgage Settlement agreements require servicers to provide homeowners with various types of mortgage relief, including principal reductions, short sales, refinancings, and other modifications. The Consumer Relief terms of the settlement generally only apply to owner-occupied, single-family, residential mortgages owned and serviced by the five mortgage companies. Borrowers of mortgages serviced by the five servicers but owned or guaranteed by others, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, do not qualify for the settlement's Consumer Relief. An independent Monitor oversees servicers' compliance with Servicing Standards and Consumer Relief terms. Each servicer and the Monitor must agree on a Work Plan detailing implementation and evaluation. The settlement agreements require servicers to provide various types of mortgage relief to homeowners. The Monitor evaluates compliance with Servicing Standards using specific Metrics outlined in Exhibit E-1. Threshold Error Rates are set for each Metric to enforce the standards. The agreements allow for additional Metrics and Threshold Error Rates if needed. Consumer Relief requirements detail how servicers plan to meet their Commitment Amount based on a credit scoring system. The settlement agreements require servicers to provide mortgage relief to homeowners based on specific Metrics and Threshold Error Rates. Servicers must establish Internal Review Groups to monitor compliance and publish quarterly Compliance Reports. The Monitor has access to these reports to verify compliance with settlement terms. The Monitor oversees compliance with settlement agreements by reviewing Compliance Reports and generating regular oversight reports. The Monitoring Committee, composed of state and federal regulators, enforces Servicing Standards and Consumer Relief terms. The Monitor has filed two Compliance Reports to date, with the first released on June 19, 2013, and the second on December 4, 2013. The Monitoring Committee has the authority to enforce Servicing Standards and Consumer Relief terms. Parties must provide advanced notice before initiating enforcement actions. The Committee has 21 days to decide on enforcement actions. If no action is taken, parties can proceed after 21 days. Disagreements can be settled in D.C. federal District Court. Exceeding Threshold Error Rate in Compliance Report leads to Potential Violation of Servicing Standards. The servicer may be in Potential Violation of the agreement's Servicing Standards. They have a chance to cure this by implementing a corrective action plan before the next quarterly Compliance Report. Failure to cure may result in penalties and court-ordered civil penalties of up to $1 million for each Uncured Violation. The servicer may face civil penalties of up to $1 million for each Uncured Violation and up to $5 million for subsequent violations of the same Metric. Penalties will be distributed to reimburse the Monitoring Committee or individual parties for enforcement costs and then to the states. The Monitor can investigate if the servicer may be engaged in a pattern of noncompliance with a material term of the Servicing Standards likely to harm borrowers, and may add new Metrics to the noncompliant servicer's Work Plan. The agreements require servicers to meet Consumer Relief requirements within two to three years of the settlement start date. Failure to comply results in penalties of 140% or 125% of the unmet Commitment Amount. Half of the penalties go to the federal government, while the other half goes to state parties. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections from financial burdens for individuals entering active military duty. It restricts lenders from foreclosing on properties acquired before active duty without court approval during and one year after service. The SCRA provides protections for active duty servicemembers, including restrictions on lenders foreclosing on properties without court approval and capping interest rates at 6%. The National Mortgage Settlement enforces SCRA rights and provides financial compensation for violations. The settlement agreements require servicers to expand SCRA protections, compensate servicemembers for foreclosures violating SCRA Sections 533 or 521 between 2006 and 2012, and hire an independent consultant to review and verify SCRA compliance for foreclosures involving eligible servicemembers. Compensation must be provided to any servicemember harmed by SCRA violations. The settlement agreements mandate servicers to compensate servicemembers for SCRA violations between 2006 and 2012. An independent consultant will review mortgage files to identify eligible individuals for financial relief. Servicers must pay for wrongful foreclosures violating SCRA Sections 533 or 521. Servicers are required to compensate servicemembers for SCRA violations between 2006 and 2012. For foreclosures violating SCRA Sections 533 or 521, servicers must pay an amount based on Federal Banking Consent Orders, lost equity, and interest. Violations of SCRA Section 527's rate cap require payment of charges exceeding the cap, plus interest, and a minimum of $500 or three times the refund amount. The settlement terms allocate payments among servicemembers and co-borrowers. The DOJ will calculate owed amounts under settlement agreements for SCRA violations, taking into account relief from private litigation and Federal Banking Consent Orders. Servicers who already compensated borrowers for violations may not have to pay the same servicemember twice, but must provide additional compensation if required by settlement terms. The National Mortgage Settlement agreements provide financial relief and require servicers to ensure SCRA compliance. The DOJ oversees compliance, approves consultants for SCRA reviews, and identifies violations. Servicers have 30 days to rebut DOJ's conclusions. The DOJ will determine compensation for SCRA violations, considering relief already provided. Servicers can petition for judicial review within 10 days. Violations require contacting credit bureaus to remove negative information. Servicers must indemnify servicemembers and co-borrowers. The servicers are required to indemnify servicemembers and co-borrowers against any third-party pursuing deficiencies on SCRA-protected mortgages. They must contact borrowers using form letters for financial relief, maintain records of communication, and submit quarterly compliance reports to the DOJ. Additionally, they must provide company policies and procedures for SCRA compliance and any future changes. The settlement agreements require servicers to pay $1.5 billion for remedial relief to qualifying mortgage borrowers affected by alleged misconduct. Borrowers had to submit a claim for relief without proving harm, with the deadline now expired. The deadline to submit a claim for relief has expired. The Special Administrator sent notices and claim forms to eligible individuals, who could also submit claims online. Each qualified claimant received a $1,480 payment based on the number of claims. Payments started on June 10, 2013. Servicers had to provide necessary information for the Borrower Payment component. A final report will detail payment recipients. Servicers paid approximately $5 billion to settle legal claims. The settlement payments were distributed to federal government agencies like the Federal Housing Administration, Veteran Housing Benefit Program Fund, and Rural Housing Service. Each state received a specific amount of the Direct Settlement Payment for purposes related to preventing foreclosures and mitigating the effects of the foreclosure crisis. The Direct Settlement Payment was allocated to states to prevent foreclosures and address the foreclosure crisis. Each state had state-specific parameters for how the funds were to be used. For example, Georgia allocated approximately $100 million to its general treasury fund, while North Carolina had detailed allocations for its portion of the payment. North Carolina received approximately $60 million from the Direct Settlement Payment. The funds were designated for various purposes including a civil penalty fund, the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency, the Conference of District Attorneys, the state Bureau of Investigation, the Consumer Protection Division, and the state's general treasury fund for costs related to mortgage fraud and foreclosure misconduct. Enforcement mechanisms were not explicitly established in the agreements. The agreements for the Direct Settlement Payment do not establish a clear enforcement mechanism. Oversight and enforcement are left to the political processes at the federal and state levels."
