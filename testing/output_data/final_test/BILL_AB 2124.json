    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 52060 of the Education Code requires school districts in California to adopt a local control and accountability plan using a state board template by July 1, 2014. The plan must be updated annually and cover the district and each school within it. The annual goals for all pupils and subgroups must align with state priorities and any additional local priorities set by the school district's governing board. Subgroups are defined as numerically significant pupil groups. The school district must outline specific actions each year to achieve goals in the local control and accountability plan, including addressing deficiencies in state priorities. An assessment of water access points at each school, with goals to fix any issues, must be included in the annual update. The department compiles assessments and sends them to the State Water Resources Control Board. State priorities include teacher assignments, credentials, access to instructional materials, and school facility maintenance. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of academic standards for English learners, parental involvement in decision-making, and measuring pupil achievement. Pupil achievement is measured by statewide assessments, the Academic Performance Index, and completion of courses for entrance to universities or career technical education programs aligned with state standards. The curr_chunk focuses on measuring pupil engagement and achievement through various indicators such as English proficiency progress, reclassification rate, AP exam passing rate, college preparedness, school attendance, chronic absenteeism, middle and high school dropout rates, and high school graduation rates. The curr_chunk focuses on measuring school climate, pupil access to a broad course of study, and pupil outcomes in various subject areas. The governing board of a school district may consider qualitative information for school quality reviews, report data in a local control and accountability plan consistently, consult with various stakeholders in plan development, and identify local priorities and goals for measuring progress. Section 116385 of the Health and Safety Code requires operators of public water systems to provide water analysis to the state board at their own expense. The analysis must be conducted by a state-certified laboratory and include samples from schools, day care facilities, and health care facilities within the system. There is no requirement to increase the number of samples collected. The person must report the date and results of sampling at schools, day care facilities, and health care facilities to the state board, along with any notices issued and follow-up actions taken. No increase in the number of samples collected is required. The person operating a public water system must report a list of schools and facilities served by the system to the state board, including sensitive populations. The state board will post this information on its website, searchable by school and district, along with a link to the system's consumer confidence report. The act creates new crimes or infractions, eliminates existing ones, or changes penalties, potentially incurring costs for local agencies or school districts. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be made if determined by the Commission on State Mandates. The act creates new crimes or infractions, eliminates existing ones, or changes penalties, potentially incurring costs for local agencies or school districts. No reimbursement is required by this act as it falls under specific provisions of the California Constitution."
