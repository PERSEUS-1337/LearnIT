    "content": "Credit assignment in Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) is poorly understood, leading to poor sample-efficiency during meta-training and ineffective task identification strategies. This paper presents a novel meta-learning algorithm that addresses the issue of poor credit assignment in gradient-based Meta-RL. The algorithm controls the statistical distance of policies during meta-policy search, leading to efficient and stable meta-learning. It outperforms previous Meta-RL algorithms in sample-efficiency, wall-clock time, and asymptotic performance. Meta-learning aims to address the limitations of traditional learning algorithms by learning how to learn, allowing artificial agents to adapt quickly to new tasks with limited experience. Deep reinforcement learning still relies on hand-crafted features and reward functions, while Meta-RL aims to acquire inductive bias in a data-driven manner for better exploration strategies and faster learning. Meta-RL is a multi-stage process where the agent adapts its behavior to a given task after a few environment interactions. Despite its wide use, there is little theoretical understanding, leaving Meta-RL on unstable foundations. Credit assignment to pre-adaptation sampling is crucial for task identification, but prior work has neglected this aspect. This study provides the first formal analysis of credit assignment in Meta-RL with respect to preadaptation sampling. In this study, the first formal analysis of credit assignment in Meta-RL with respect to preadaptation sampling is provided. A novel Meta-RL algorithm is developed based on the findings, analyzing two methods for assigning credit to pre-adaptation behavior. The study also discusses different approaches like E-MAML to address issues with meta-gradient estimation in MAML. The study analyzes two gradient-based Meta-RL formulations, Formulation I and Formulation II, introduced in Section 3. Formulation I propagates credit assignment through the update step, while Formulation II directly assigns credit from post-update return to the pre-update policy, leading to less effective credit assignment. Both formulations optimize for the same goal. Formulation II in Meta-RL loses signal due to differences in formulation and stochastic computation graph, affecting gradients and optimization steps. The credit assignment in Formulation II does not optimize for pre-update sampling distribution, impacting adaptation steps. In Formulation II of Meta-RL, the credit assignment is carried out by the second term, treating the update function as part of the unknown system dynamics. This shifts the pre-update sampling distribution for better adaptation steps. Formulation I considers the causal dependence of P T (\u03c4 |\u03b8 ) on P T (\u03c4 |\u03b8), maximizing the inner product of pre-update and post-update policy gradients to optimize for adaptation. The first meta-policy gradient formulation, J I, is expected to yield superior learning properties. The formulation introduced by BID9 aims to improve meta-gradient updates for better convergence properties. However, challenges arise in obtaining correct and low variance estimates of meta-gradients. The score function surrogate objective approach is not suitable for calculating higher order derivatives, leading to incorrect meta-gradient estimates. Even with proper implementation, high variance is observed in the meta-gradients estimation. The low variance curvature estimator (LVC) is introduced to improve meta-policy gradient updates by providing a better estimator for the hessian of the RL-objective. The estimation of the hessian of the RL-objective is challenging due to high variance in meta-gradients. The gradients of the meta-learning objective are typically computed using a Monte Carlo estimate, resulting in a biased hessian estimate. The LVC aims to address this issue and promote more accurate meta-gradient updates. The DiCE formulation provides unbiased higher-order Monte Carlo estimates for stochastic computation graphs, addressing the biased hessian estimate issue in meta-policy gradient updates. The sequential dependence of \u03c0 \u03b8 (a t |s t ) within the trajectory leads to high variance estimates of the hessian, particularly for H 12. The low variance curvature (LVC) estimator improves meta-learning efficiency by reducing noise in meta-policy gradients. Experimental results show that LVC hessian estimates outperform DiCE in sample efficiency. The text discusses a novel meta-policy search method called PROMP, which aims to improve sample efficiency in meta-learning compared to J DiCE. It utilizes the low variance curvature objective and addresses challenges in estimating the Fisher information matrix in meta-learning setups. The recently introduced PPO algorithm achieves comparable results to TRPO with the advantage of being a first-order method. PPO uses a surrogate clipping objective to safely take multiple gradient steps without re-sampling trajectories, especially in Meta-RL scenarios. Proximal Meta-Policy Search (ProMP) combines proximal policy optimization and low variance curvature objective to address changes in action and state visitation distributions. It replaces the \"stop gradient\" importance weight with a new objective that accounts for these changes. Additionally, a KL-penalty term is added to enforce a trust region around the pre-update policy, preventing shifts in state visitation. ProMP optimizes meta-policy gradient steps by enforcing a trust region around the policy, utilizing structural knowledge of meta-learning, and controlling statistical distance for efficient meta-learning. It outperforms previous algorithms in sample complexity, wall clock time, and asymptotic performance. The experimental analysis evaluates ProMP against previous Meta-RL algorithms, comparing LVC gradient estimates to DiCE estimates, exploring pre-update properties, and comparing formulation I and II in meta-gradient estimates and convergence properties on six continuous control Meta-RL benchmark environments. The study compares ProMP to MAML-TRPO and E-MAML-TRPO in sample complexity and performance. It also examines different meta-gradient estimators like LVC, DiCE, MAML, and E-MAML while optimizing with vanilla policy gradient ascent. The study compares ProMP to MAML-TRPO and E-MAML-TRPO in sample complexity and performance on various locomotion tasks. Results show ProMP's strength in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. The LVC meta-gradient estimator consistently outperforms others, while DiCE shows slow learning due to high variance in meta-gradient estimates. The poor performance of DiCE is attributed to high variance in meta-gradient estimates. Results of MAML and E-MAML are comparable, highlighting issues with pre-update credit assignment. Additional environment results are in Appendix D. DiCE formulation yields unbiased but high variance estimates, motivating the low variance curvature estimator. Meta-gradient variance of both estimators and its impact on learning performance are investigated. Relative standard deviation of metapolicy gradients and average return in three metaenvironments are reported. The low variance curvature estimate outperforms DiCE in meta-learning, with 60% lower standard deviation. LVC leads to better sample efficiency and performance in meta-policy search. Some instability is observed in LVC-VPG for HalfCheetahFwdBack, but ProMP mechanisms counteract it, resulting in a stable meta-learning algorithm. The effect of different objectives on the learned pre-update sampling distribution is evaluated in a 2D environment. Tasks involve reaching different corner locations with rewards only when close to the corner. The agent explores different regions through inner adaptation steps, allowing it to switch from exploration to exploitation successfully. The LVC objective shows superior credit assignment in identifying tasks and adapting policies accordingly. The LVC estimator demonstrates superior credit assignment in identifying tasks and adapting policies accordingly, enabling the agent to explore different regions and switch from exploration to exploitation successfully. In contrast, MAML fails to learn a sound exploration strategy for task identification, while E-MAML explores in long but random paths without a clear notion of which actions facilitate good task adaptation. In a 1D environment, the differences in gradients between formulation I and formulation II are evaluated through meta-gradient updates. Formulation I shows faster and steadier convergence to the optimum compared to formulation II, which produces noisier gradient estimates. In this paper, a novel Meta-RL algorithm, ProMP, is proposed to optimize the pre-update sampling distribution for effective task identification. The method utilizes a low variance curvature (LVC) surrogate objective to generate low variance meta-policy gradient estimates, outperforming previous approaches in continuous control tasks. Theoretical contributions are supported by illustrative examples, and two different gradient-based meta-learning formulations are discussed and compared for their effectiveness. The first meta-learning formulation, MAML BID9, defines the inner update rule as a mapping from the pre-update parameter \u03b8 and task T to an adapted policy parameter \u03b8. The update function involves sampling from task-specific trajectory distribution and updating policy parameters. The meta-objective is derived from task-specific gradients, with the inner update rule assumed to be a policy gradient descent step. The local curvature of the inner adaptation objective function is also considered in the analysis. The second meta-reinforcement learning formulation introduces the inner update function as a deterministic adaptation of policy parameters based on pre-update trajectories. The meta-learning objective is expressed as the expectation of task-specific objectives under the task distribution, assuming differentiability of the inner update function. The meta-policy gradients are expressed as the expectation of task-specific gradients, which can be calculated by inserting the inner adaptation step gradient into the formula. The differences between the gradients derived for two formulations are analyzed by rearranging terms and substituting the hessian of the inner objective. The text discusses rearranging and comparing gradient terms in meta-policy gradients, aiming to provide insight into the differences between two formulations. The analysis involves interpreting the gradient terms and their impact on shifting the sampling distribution towards higher returns. The gradient terms in meta-policy gradients aim to shift the sampling distribution towards higher returns by considering the functional relationship between pre-update and post-update policies. J post focuses on the post-update policy, while J pre focuses on the pre-update policy to achieve higher post-update returns. The post-update policy's dependence on the pre-update policy is considered in meta-policy gradients. The inner product of pre-update and post-update policy gradients steers the pre-update policy towards larger returns and better alignment, optimizing for maximal improvement. Li et al. (2017) discusses this concept. The meta-policy gradient formulation aims to optimize for maximal improvement by considering the dependence of the pre-update returns on the pre-update sampling distribution. This allows for faster and more stable learning compared to assigning credit to entire batches of pre-update trajectories. The gradient can be derived using the score function trick to estimate the hessian. The Policy Gradient Theorem allows for a surrogate objective function to be used for policy gradient estimation. The Policy Gradient Theorem allows for a surrogate objective function to be used for policy gradient estimation. A generalized procedure for constructing \"surrogate\" objectives for arbitrary stochastic computation graphs can be found in Schulman et al. (2015a). Estimating the hessian of the reinforcement learning objective has been discussed with focus on second order policy gradient methods. In the infinite horizon MDP case, a decomposition of the hessian is derived. The hessian of J inner (\u03b8) follows a specific formula, with terms H 2, H 1, H 12, and H 12 being equivalent to certain components. The hessian of the expected sum of rewards under policy \u03c0 \u03b8 and an MDP with finite time horizon H can be decomposed into H 1 + H 2 + H 12 + H 12 through a series of mathematical derivations. MDP with finite time horizon H can be decomposed into H 1 + H 2 + H 12 + H 12. Differentiating through the gradient of surrogate objective J PGT leads to biased hessian estimates. The issue of incorrect higher-order derivatives of monte-carlo estimators is addressed by DICE proposed by BID10. DICE proposed by BID10 addresses the issue of incorrect higher-order derivatives of monte-carlo estimators by introducing the MagicBox operator. This operator allows for correct higher-order derivatives in policy gradient estimators. The DICE formulation evaluates to the sum of rewards at 0th order but produces unbiased gradients when differentiated n-times. The MagicBox operator can be interpreted as a \"dry\" importance sampling weight that remains unaffected at 0th order but yields different results upon differentiation. The curr_chunk discusses the use of state value functions, state-action value functions, and advantage functions in policy optimization. It also mentions local policy search to find policy updates that maximize the expected return. The discounted state visitation frequency is used to express expectations over trajectories. The objective function remains unaffected by policy updates. Trust region policy optimization (TPRO) aims to maximize the expected advantage under \u03c0 by using a local approximation of the objective function. It introduces a lower bound for the true expected return of \u03c0. Trust region policy optimization (TPRO) approximates the bound by framing local policy search as a constrained optimization problem with a KL-constraint inducing a trust region. A practical implementation uses a quadratic approximation of the KL-constraint for the update rule. The Conjugate Gradient algorithm is used to approximate the Hessian vector product to avoid cubic time complexity. Schulman et al. (2017) propose optimizing the lower bound instead of the constrained optimization approach. Schulman et al. (2017) suggest optimizing the lower bound by adding a KL penalty to the objective. They propose two methods in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to address the issue of setting a fixed penalty coefficient \u03b2: 1) Adapting the KL coefficient \u03b2 to achieve a desired target KL-divergence between policies before and after the update, and 2) Clipping the likelihood ratio to prevent moving the policy too far from the original. Empirical results show that the latter approach leads to better learning performance. PPO objective keeps \u03c0 \u03b8 close to \u03c0 \u03b8o, allowing multiple gradient steps without re-sampling trajectories. This improves data-efficiency over vanilla policy gradient methods. Optimal hyperparameters were determined through parameter sweeps. Table 1 shows hyperparameter settings for different algorithms. PointEnv involves tasks at different corners, where the point mass must reach the goal using directional forces. Rewards are only received within a certain radius of the goal. The tasks involve running in a specific direction to reach a goal, with rewards based on distance and control costs. Each task has different trajectory lengths and adaptation steps. In one task, the agent must locate, approach, and stop at a target without knowing the goal beforehand, receiving a penalty based on distance. The agent must move quickly forward in different randomized environments with varying simulation parameters. It receives rewards based on its velocity and the distance from the goal, with tasks involving different trajectory lengths and adaptation steps. The ProMP algorithm shows improved sample complexity and better performance compared to other methods, with faster computation time. ProMP algorithm outperforms VPG in terms of update time due to fewer environment resets, leading to longer trajectories and quicker performance improvements."
