    "content": "The Act titled \"Models of Safety and Health Excellence Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of promoting safety and health excellence. The Congress finds that voluntary protection programs since 1982 have improved workplace safety and health by fostering partnerships between employers, employees, and OSHA. Employers in these programs provide a higher level of protection than required by law, resulting in lower injury and illness rates. The Act aims to recognize the leadership of voluntary protection programs in enhancing workplace safety, encourage other employers to adopt similar approaches, and ensure the continued development of such programs by OSHA. Participants in these programs have significantly lower injury and illness rates compared to industry averages, preventing workplace tragedies. The Act promotes voluntary protection programs to improve workplace safety and reduce injury rates. The Secretary of Labor establishes voluntary protection programs to promote workplace health and safety excellence. The programs may include nonstandard worksites like short-term construction sites. Small businesses are encouraged to participate through outreach initiatives.
