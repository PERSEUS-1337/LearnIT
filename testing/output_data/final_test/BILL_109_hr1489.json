    "content": "The Act titled \"Coastal Ocean Observation System Integration and Implementation Act of 2005\" serves the purpose outlined in Section 2. The Act aims to understand marine environment processes, establish an observation system for data collection, predict and mitigate natural hazards, and promote sustainable use of ocean resources. The Act aims to promote sustainable use of ocean and coastal resources by involving a diverse group of stakeholders in its development. The Act aims to promote sustainable use of ocean and coastal resources by involving a diverse group of stakeholders in its development. Section 3 defines key terms. The Act defines key terms such as Administration, Coastal waters of the United States, Council, Panel, Secretary, and System. The term \"System\" refers to the Coastal Ocean Observation System established by the Secretary under section 4. The Secretary, in consultation with the Council, shall establish a Coastal Ocean Observation System to support coastal and fishery management activities and an integrated national ocean observation system. The System shall consist of components from various agencies and entities, transmit data in real or near real time, produce forecasts, and manage collected data according to best practices. The Secretary, in consultation with the Council, may designate a unit of the System to operate marine sensors and collect ocean data. Criteria for designation include technical expertise and data collection standards. The Secretary shall establish data standards and protocols in consultation with the Council. The Secretary, in consultation with the Council and the Panel, will set standards and protocols for data collection, availability, and distribution of coastal waters data in the United States. Additionally, management, quality control, and assessment systems will be established for this purpose. SEC. 6. COORDINATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE SYSTEM. The Secretary, in consultation with the Council, coordinates observation activities in coastal waters of the US to collect data for the Act's purposes. Data collection includes relevant coastal ocean observations and supports forecast models for various activities. The Secretary ensures data collection avoids competition with the private sector and duplication of effort. The Secretary ensures that data collection activities through the System do not compete with the private sector and minimize duplication of effort. SEC. 7. CIVIL LIABILITY. Any unit of the System designated by the Secretary under section 5, and its employees, are treated as instruments of the United States for civil liability under section 2671 of title 28, US Code. SEC. 8. DATA AVAILABILITY AND PRODUCTS. The Secretary will work with the Panel and user groups to develop end-use products of the System for coastal and fishery management. A data management system will be developed to integrate all data collected by the System on coastal waters. Data collected will be used to develop forecast models for various activities including coastal and fishery management, marine navigation, weather prediction, and climate forecasting. The Secretary will conduct pilot projects in consultation with the Council to test the effectiveness of collecting and integrating coastal ocean observation data for the Coastal Ocean Observation System. The pilot projects will integrate data from multiple Federal agencies and non-Federal entities, produce operational applications, demonstrate economic and societal benefits, and advance research and development of technologies. Additionally, there will be a process for transitioning from research to operation. The Secretary, in consultation with the Council, will establish a process for funding research on new technologies for collecting coastal waters data, testing these technologies in pilot projects, and incorporating useful technology into the Coastal Ocean Observation System. Additionally, contracts and grants will be utilized for these purposes. The Secretary can enter contracts or grants with System units for coastal waters observation activities. Within 12 months of the Act's enactment, a plan for implementation must be submitted to Congress and the Council, including coordination with other agencies and fund distribution. SEC. 13. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n(a) Requirement--The Secretary must report to Congress every two years on the progress of implementing the Act, including activities, System effectiveness evaluation, benefits to users, and recommendations for modifications and funding levels.\n\nSEC. 14. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary to carry out the Act: $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2006, $35,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, and $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2008."
