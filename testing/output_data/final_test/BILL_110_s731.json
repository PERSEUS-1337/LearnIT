    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Carbon Dioxide Storage Capacity Assessment Act of 2007\". Definitions are provided in Section 2. In this Act, \"assessment\" refers to the national assessment of geological storage capacity for carbon dioxide. \"Capacity\" and \"geological storage capacity\" mean the portion of a storage formation that can retain carbon dioxide under established parameters. \"Engineered hazards\" include the location and completion history of wells that could affect storage. \"Risk\" encompasses geomechanical, geochemical, hydrogeological, structural, and engineered hazards. The \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary as defined in the Act. The term \"storage formation\" refers to a saline formation, unmineable coal seam, or oil or gas reservoir capable of storing industrial carbon dioxide. The term \"Secretary\" in this context means the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United States Geological Survey. The methodology for assessing national geological storage capacity for carbon dioxide is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary must develop a methodology for assessing geological storage capacity for carbon dioxide within 270 days of the Act's enactment. Factors to consider include the extent, capacity, injectivity, recoverable oil and gas volumes, and risks of potential storage formations in all 50 states. Coordination with federal entities is required. The Secretary must consult with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure the success of the assessment. State geological surveys and relevant entities will also be consulted for coordination. During the assessment process, the Secretary will provide stakeholders with an opportunity to review and comment on the proposed methodology. An independent verification committee of subject matter experts will be convened to ensure the assessment's accuracy and success. The Secretary will conduct a review of the methodology for capacity and risk estimation, publish the final methodology in the Federal Register, and issue a public report responding to comments received. SEC. 4. COMPLETION OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF GEOLOGICAL STORAGE CAPACITY FOR CARBON DIOXIDE. The Secretary must complete a national assessment of geological storage capacity for carbon dioxide within 2 years of final methodology publication. A public database will be established with assessment results, data on potential storage sites, and a detailed description of collected data. A report must be submitted within 180 days of completing the assessment. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress and the President describing the findings of the assessment within 180 days of completing the national assessment of geological storage capacity for carbon dioxide. The report must be made available to the public on the Internet. Authorization of appropriations for this Act is set at $20,000,000 over a 4-year period starting from the first full fiscal year after enactment."
