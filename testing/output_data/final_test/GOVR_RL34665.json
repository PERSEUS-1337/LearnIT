    "content": "ICC judges issued arrest warrants for Libyan leader Muammar al Qadhafi, his son Sayf al Islam al Qadhafi, and intelligence chief Abdullah al Senussi for crimes against humanity. The trial of Congolese militia leader Thomas Lubanga Dyilo is expected to bring the Court's first final verdict. Six Kenyan suspects, including senior government officials, appeared voluntarily before the Court. ICC judges confirmed war crimes charges against two Darfur rebel commanders. The ICC Prosecutor requested authorization to open a formal investigation into war crimes. The ICC requested authorization to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire following the disputed presidential election in 2010. The government of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and newly inaugurated President Alassane Ouattara have accepted ICC jurisdiction. The ICC, established in 2002, investigates individuals who commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The International Criminal Court (ICC) investigates war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The ICC's jurisdiction covers crimes since the Statute's entry into force. The ICC is based in The Hague, Netherlands, with 111 countries as parties to the Statute. The Assembly of States Parties oversees the Court's administration and supports it. Situations can be referred to the ICC by a state party, the ICC Prosecutor, or the UN Security Council. Currently, four situations have been referred to the Prosecutor by three countries - Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic. The International Criminal Court (ICC) investigates war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Situations can be referred to the ICC by a state party, the ICC Prosecutor, or the UN Security Council. The ICC is considered a court of last resort, only intervening when national judicial systems are unable to handle cases of the most serious crimes. The United States is not a party to the Rome Statute. The United States signed the Rome Statute in 2000 but never submitted it to the Senate for ratification. The Bush Administration opposed the International Criminal Court, citing concerns over jurisdiction, checks and balances, and the role of the UN Security Council. The Bush Administration opposed the International Criminal Court due to concerns over jurisdiction and the role of the UN Security Council. Bilateral immunity agreements were made to exempt U.S. citizens from surrender to the ICC, in accordance with Article 98 agreements. The U.S. government is prohibited from assisting the ICC in investigations or prosecutions of war crimes under the American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002, known as ASPA, covers the obligation of appropriated funds, assistance in investigations on U.S. territory, participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and sharing of classified information. Section 2015 of ASPA provides exceptions for assisting in bringing to justice specific individuals accused of war crimes or crimes against humanity. Hillary Clinton expressed a willingness to end hostility towards the ICC during her confirmation hearing as Secretary of State in 2009. In August 2009, Secretary of State Clinton expressed regret that the U.S. was not a party to the ICC but stated support for the Court. The Obama Administration is considering ways to assist the ICC in investigations involving atrocities, with a review concluding that such support would not violate existing laws. In November 2009, the U.S. began attending meetings of the ICC's Assembly of States. In November 2009, the United States started attending ICC meetings as an observer nation. In May 2010, a delegation led by Ambassador-at-Large Stephen Rapp and Legal Advisor Harold Koh attended the Rome Statute Review Conference in Uganda. The US expressed support for ongoing ICC cases and rule of law projects in African countries with ICC prosecutions. The US voted in favor of referring the situation in Libya to the ICC. The ICC has been involved in prosecuting leaders for crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, following the precedent set by the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals. Various international courts and tribunals, such as those for Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, East Timor, Cambodia, and Lebanon, have been established to address serious violations of international humanitarian law. The International Criminal Court (ICC) was established in 2002 to prosecute leaders for crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. It is a permanent, international tribunal separate from the U.N. Security Council tribunals. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) settles legal disputes between states according to international law and does not prosecute individuals. Members of Congress have varying opinions on the ICC's involvement in Africa. Many Members of Congress have differing views on the International Criminal Court (ICC) regarding Africa. Some support it as a means to address human rights violations, while others oppose it for jurisdictional reasons. Various pieces of legislation in the 111th and 112th Congress expressed objections to the ICC, with some welcoming U.N. Security Council referrals to the Court. The ICC has been involved in cases related to human rights abuses in Africa, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo, central Africa, and Darfur. The ICC Prosecutor has opened cases against 26 individuals in connection with five African countries, with particular interest in Darfur. One case against Darfur rebel leader Bahar Idriss Abu Garda was dismissed, but the prosecutor may try to re-open it with new evidence. Cases stem from investigations into violence in Libya, Kenya, Darfur, central Africa, and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The ICC has jurisdiction in Sudan, Libya, and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Five suspects are currently in ICC custody, including four Congolese nationals and one Rwandan. The ICC Prosecutor has sought summonses in connection with various conflicts in Africa. The ICC Prosecutor has sought summonses for Darfur rebel commanders and Kenyan suspects, without securing any convictions. ICC judges issued arrest warrants for Libyan leader Muammar al Qadhafi, his son Sayf al Islam al Qadhafi, and intelligence chief Abdullah al Senussi for crimes against humanity. The Prosecutor alleged that Qadhafi implemented a plan to suppress challenges to his authority through killings and persecution. The ICC Prosecutor has sought summonses for Darfur rebel commanders and Kenyan suspects, without securing any convictions. ICC judges issued arrest warrants for Libyan leader Muammar al Qadhafi, his son Sayf al Islam al Qadhafi, and intelligence chief Abdullah al Senussi for crimes against humanity, including sexual assault. The Qadhafi government denies accusations of rights abuses. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970 referred the situation in Libya to the ICC, giving jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide since February 15, 2011. The Prosecutor opened a formal investigation focusing on Qadhafi's role. The ICC President expressed concerns about the budget constraints due to the Libya investigation. In Kenya, ICC judges approved the Prosecutor's request to investigate post-election violence in 2007-2008, marking the first time judges authorized an investigation without a state referral or U.N. Security Council directive. In Kenya, over 1,000 individuals were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced during post-election violence in 2007-2008. A government of national unity was formed, and accountability for abuses has been a sensitive issue in Kenyan politics. The Prosecutor presented two cases against six individuals for alleged crimes against humanity, with summonses issued in March 2011. The suspects appeared voluntarily before the court in April and denied the accusations. The suspects in two cases in Kenya denied accusations of crimes against humanity, including murder, forcible population transfers, rape, and persecution. Key figures involved are William Ruto, Henry Kosgey, Joshua Arap Sang, Francis Muthaura, Uhuru Kenyatta, and Mohamed Hussein Ali. These cases are linked to post-election violence in 2007-2008, with accountability being a sensitive issue in Kenyan politics. The suspects in two cases in Kenya, linked to post-election violence in 2007-2008, are associated with Prime Minister Raila Odinga and President Mwai Kibaki. The ICC prosecutions targeting political figures have sparked a backlash in Kenya, with Odinga supporting the ICC cases while Kibaki criticizes them and calls for trials within Kenya. Despite earlier support for ICC involvement, the cases remain a sensitive issue with potential implications for the country's stability, inter-ethnic relations, and the 2012 elections. Polls show majority Kenyan support for ICC prosecutions over domestic trials. Kibaki criticized ICC cases, called for trials in Kenya. Suspects not charged in Kenya, parliament passed legislation urging withdrawal from Court. Efforts for deferral of ICC prosecutions by UN Security Council unsuccessful. Kenyan government's legal challenges to ICC cases also unsuccessful. Initial pledge to cooperate with ICC actions, but accused of interference by some observers and ICC Prosecutor. Some Kenyans fear ethnic tensions from ICC prosecutions, while others worry about future violence if no prosecutions occur. Concerns also include witness and victim protection, with reports of intimidation. Kenya faced criticism for welcoming Sudanese President Bashir despite ICC involvement in post-election violence. Domestic disputes over justice for victims led to ICC intervention. The Waki Commission identified suspects and recommended an independent Kenyan tribunal with international participation. The government accepted the findings but failed to establish the tribunal, leading to the submission of suspects to the ICC by Koffi Annan. The Kenyan Cabinet decided against a special tribunal and opted for a Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation process. The Kenyan government decided against establishing a special tribunal and instead opted for a Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) to oversee reforms in the judiciary, police, and investigatory bodies. The United States initially supported domestic prosecutions but now backs ICC involvement for accountability. President Obama and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg have urged cooperation with the ICC investigation. The Kenyan government chose ICC over domestic approach for accountability. U.N. Security Council referred Darfur situation to ICC in 2005. Sudan, not a party to ICC, is bound by Resolution 1593. ICC was authorized to accept the case. The Security Council referred the Darfur situation to the ICC in 2005, following the establishment of an International Commission of Inquiry. The Commission compiled a list of potential war crimes suspects, recommending the situation to the ICC. The ICC Prosecutor received the Commission's document archive and list of suspects, initiating its own investigation in June 2005. The Sudanese government also created special courts for Darfur to avoid ICC jurisdiction. The United States objected to the ICC's jurisdiction over nationals of states not party to the Rome Statute, preferring a special tribunal in Africa for accountability in Darfur. The US had previously supported a version of the Rome Statute allowing the UN Security Council to refer cases involving non-states parties to the ICC. The United States abstained on Resolution 1593 in the Security Council, which addressed sovereignty concerns and protected U.S. nationals from ICC prosecution. Despite objections, the Bush Administration supported international cooperation to address atrocities in Darfur. In 2007, the ICC issued arrest warrants for individuals accused of war crimes in Darfur, but the Sudanese government refused to comply. In 2003 and 2004, alleged crimes were committed in Darfur. The Sudanese government did not comply with ICC warrants for Ahmad Harun and Ali Kushayb. Sudanese authorities arrested Kushayb in 2008 but planned to conduct their own investigation. In 2009, Harun was appointed governor of South Kordofan State. The ICC reported Sudan's failure to cooperate in 2010. A new investigation was opened in 2007 targeting peacekeepers and aid workers in Darfur. In 2008, a sealed case was submitted against three rebel commanders. In 2008, the Prosecutor submitted a sealed case against three alleged rebel commanders in Darfur for war crimes during an attack on Haskanita in 2007. Twelve African Union peacekeepers were killed, and eight injured. One suspect, Abu Garda, denied involvement and ICC judges found insufficient evidence to hold him responsible. In 2010, two other rebel commanders, Banda and Jamus, surrendered to the Court. Banda and Jerbo, former rebel commanders in Darfur, surrendered to the Court and face war crimes charges. ICC judges confirmed the charges, paving the way for a trial. In a separate case, an arrest warrant was issued for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al Bashir for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al Bashir for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur. The warrant alleges that Bashir indirectly orchestrated attacks against civilians as part of the government's military strategy. The charges must be confirmed at a pre-trial hearing. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al Bashir for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur. Many governments and organizations supported the warrant, while African and Middle Eastern governments, as well as Russia and China, opposed it. The ICC called for full cooperation from all states and organizations. The Rome Statute and international organizations call for full cooperation with the arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al Bashir. However, there is little expectation of his arrest in Sudan due to his long-standing rule. The Sudanese government rejects the ICC's jurisdiction, but legal experts argue that cooperation is required as a U.N. member state. The ICC Prosecutor has accused Bashir of genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur. In July 2008, the ICC Prosecutor accused Sudanese President Omar Hassan al Bashir of three counts of genocide against the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa ethnic groups. ICC judges initially ruled that there were not enough grounds to believe the government of Sudan had specific intent to destroy these groups. However, in 2010, a second warrant was issued citing three counts of genocide against Bashir. The attempt to bring genocide charges was welcomed by human rights advocates, although the Prosecutor's accusation formulation received some criticism. The U.N. Commission of Inquiry concluded that the violence in Darfur did not amount to genocide, but acknowledged crimes against humanity and war crimes. Critics questioned the Prosecutor's application of genocide charges against Bashir, who rejected ICC jurisdiction over Darfur. The Bashir administration denied allegations of genocide or ethnic cleansing. The Bashir administration in Sudan denies genocide or ethnic cleansing in Darfur, accusing the ICC Prosecutor of relying on rebel leaders' testimony. Sudan has expelled aid organizations collaborating with the ICC and shut down a radio station accused of supporting rebels. Sudanese officials have taken a hard-line stance against those sympathetic to the ICC prosecution. The arrest warrant for Bashir may not weaken his power as Sudanese resentment could rally support for him. Despite the warrant, Bashir has sought support from allied states and regional organizations, including the African Union and Arab League, criticizing the ICC. The decision to prosecute an African head of state by the ICC has sparked backlash among African governments. The African Union has resolved not to cooperate with the ICC in executing the arrest warrant. Some praise the move as a step against impunity, while others criticize it as biased or neocolonial. Former South African President Thabo Mbeki proposed a \"hybrid\" court for Darfur, but did not address ongoing ICC cases. Bashir has traveled to various countries in the region since the ICC warrant was issued in 2009, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Zimbabwe, none of which are ICC parties. He also visited China in June 2011. Despite traveling to Chad, an ICC state party, in July 2010, he was not arrested due to improved bilateral relations. Similarly, in August 2010, he traveled to Kenya, another ICC state party, where authorities also did not arrest him. In May 2011, he visited Djibouti, also an ICC state party. The warrants seem to have influenced Bashir's movements. The Obama Administration has supported the ICC investigation and prosecution of war crimes in Sudan, emphasizing the need for accountability for serious crimes in Darfur. Despite ICC warrants, Bashir has avoided visiting certain countries like the Central African Republic, Libya, and Malaysia due to diplomatic pressures. U.S. officials have reiterated the importance of Bashir facing the International Criminal Court for his charges. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Obama expressed support for the ICC's decision to hold President Bashir accountable for his actions, despite concerns about the impact on diplomatic relations. Obama also criticized Kenya for hosting Bashir in defiance of ICC arrest warrants. Clinton reiterated the importance of accountability following Bashir's trip to China. Following Bashir's trip to China in June 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed concerns about countries welcoming the Sudanese president despite outstanding charges from the international criminal court. Administration officials have given conflicting views on the situation in Darfur, with Special Envoy Gration suggesting in 2009 that the Sudanese government was no longer engaged in a coordinated genocidal campaign. U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice had previously characterized Darfur as a genocide. In July 2009, President Obama referred to Darfur as a \"genocide,\" calling it a \"millstone around Africa's neck.\" Members of the 111th Congress expressed various positions on the warrant for Bashir, with Senator Feingold urging the Administration not to defer the ICC prosecution. Senator Kerry acknowledged that the warrant \"complicates matters\" but should not hinder U.S. efforts to resolve the conflict in Darfur. Congresswoman Barbara Lee emphasized the importance of supporting the International Criminal Court in holding Sudan's President Bashir accountable for the genocide in Darfur. The International Criminal Court sought to hold Sudan's President Bashir accountable for crimes against humanity, with draft legislation in the 111th Congress supporting ICC prosecutions in connection with Darfur. The ICC Prosecutor's request for an arrest warrant for Bashir in July 2008 influenced the U.N. Security Council's decision on extending the mandate for UNAMID in Darfur. Council discussions were impacted by the Prosecutor's announcement, with considerations on various UNAMID-related issues. The Council members discussed the suggestion to request a deferral or suspension of further ICC action on the case for up to 12 months to facilitate peaceful settlement efforts in Darfur and South Sudan. Concerns were raised that a positive ICC response to the Prosecutor's request for an arrest warrant could worsen the situation on the ground, putting peacekeepers and humanitarian workers at risk. Article 16 of the ICC Statute allows for a 12-month deferral of investigation or prosecution upon the Security Council's request. The U.N. Security Council can request the ICC to suspend or defer investigations under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. This request can be renewed and would be applicable for 12 months, with the possibility of renewal. David Scheffer highlighted the importance of Article 16 in the ICC Statute in addressing the Darfur situation. David Scheffer examined the purpose of Article 16 in the ICC Statute, stating it was intended for the Security Council to delay international justice for atrocity crimes in order to focus on peace and security objectives. He argued that if current proposals for Council suspension of ICC action had been foreseen, Article 16 may not have been approved. David Scheffer discussed the purpose of Article 16 in the ICC Statute, suggesting that if current proposals for Security Council intervention had been anticipated, Article 16 may not have been approved. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1828 (2008) extended UNAMID for 12 months, with the United States abstaining due to concerns about the language in the resolution. The U.S. abstained from a Security Council resolution due to concerns about a paragraph that could undermine efforts to bring President Bashir to justice in Darfur. U.S. Deputy Representative emphasized the importance of not compromising on justice. The United States abstained from Security Council votes in 2005 and 2008 regarding the ICC, showing a potential shift in policy. Uganda referred the Lord's Resistance Army to the ICC in 2003, leading to arrest warrants for LRA leaders in 2005. The LRA, led by Ongwen and Lukwiya, is accused of brutalizing civilians with crimes against humanity and war crimes. Suspects are not in custody, with some leaders killed and others in neighboring countries. Ugandan military, supported by the US, continues operations to capture LRA leaders. ICC is also investigating Ugandan military actions. Domestic and international opposition exists towards ICC actions in Uganda, questioning justice and peace agreements. The ICC arrest warrants played a crucial role in bringing the LRA to peace talks in 2006. Despite initial agreements, the LRA demands the annulment of ICC warrants for a final peace deal. The Ugandan government offers amnesty and domestic prosecutions for lower-ranking LRA fighters, willing to prosecute leaders if rebels accept a peace agreement. ICC threats are seen as a barrier to achieving a lasting peace deal in northern Uganda. The Ugandan government offers amnesty and domestic prosecutions for lower-ranking LRA fighters, willing to prosecute leaders if rebels accept a peace agreement. Uganda passed legislation for punishment of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. DRC referred crimes to the ICC in 2004. Despite the end of civil war in 2003, DRC still faces armed conflict in eastern regions. The ICC has issued arrest warrants for suspects involved in armed conflict in the volatile eastern regions of the DRC. Investigations focus on Ituri and the Kivus, with suspects in custody and one at large. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, leader of the UPC and FPLC, was issued a sealed arrest warrant in 2006. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, leader of the FPLC, in 2006. He was charged with war crimes related to the recruitment of child soldiers and transferred to ICC custody in 2006. His trial began in 2009 and has faced procedural challenges, with his defense claiming he tried to demobilize child soldiers and is a scapegoat for other militant leaders. The ICC issued sealed arrest warrants for Germain Katanga and Ngudjolo in 2007, accusing them of crimes against humanity and war crimes related to an attack on Hema civilians in Ituri in 2003. They were transferred to ICC custody in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Prosecutors appealed decisions to release Lubanga due to trial errors and lack of source disclosure. The ICC issued sealed arrest warrants for Germain Katanga and Ngudjolo in 2007 for crimes against humanity and war crimes. Bosco Ntaganda, a former deputy military commander, remains at large with warrants for war crimes related to child soldiers. Bosco Ntaganda, a former deputy military commander, integrated into Congolese armed forces in 2009 as part of a peace deal. Allegations suggest he is living openly in Goma, orchestrating killings, and involved in illicit minerals smuggling. Obama Administration's advisor raised concerns about his activities in the region. The United States pressed for the transfer of Bosco Ntaganda to the ICC due to his alleged involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity. Callixte Mbarushimana, a Rwandan national and leader of the FDLR militia, was arrested in France and transferred to ICC custody for similar charges. The FDLR, led by Rwandan Hutu extremists, operates in the conflict-ridden Kivu provinces of eastern DRC. The FDLR militia, led by Rwandan Hutu extremists, including individuals who fled to DRC after the 1994 Rwandan genocide, is accused of attacks against civilians in the Kivus. Callixte Mbarushimana, a leader of the FDLR, was arrested and transferred to ICC custody for alleged crimes including murder, torture, rape, and property destruction. The United States supports the ICC's investigations in the DRC, while Rwanda prefers to try Mbarushimana within its borders for charges related to the 1994 genocide. In January 2005, crimes in CAR were referred to the ICC Prosecutor. In May 2008, a warrant was issued for Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, a former DRC rebel leader turned politician and businessman. Bemba was accused of overseeing attacks on civilians in CAR territory between October 2002 and March 2003 as commander of the MLC rebel group. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo was invited into CAR by then-President Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9 to help quell a rebellion. He was arrested in Belgium in May 2008 and turned over to the ICC in July 2008. Bemba faced charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for alleged rape, murder, and pillaging. The prosecution argues that Bemba had command responsibility over the MLC rebel group. His trial began in November 2010, despite legal appeals being dismissed. The case has been controversial in the DRC, where Bemba's MLC operates as an opposition party. The ICC's prosecution has been praised by some observers. The government of DRC denies involvement in ICC prosecution. Observers praise ICC investigations in Africa as crucial against impunity, but debates arise over court's impact, prioritization of Africa, case selection, and effect on peace processes. Critics fear ICC jeopardizing political settlements for abstract justice. Supporters believe ICC investigations will contribute to Africa's peace. African Union strongly objects to ICC actions, especially prosecuting sitting heads of state in Sudan and Libya. Concerns arise over losing support from AU. The African Union objects to ICC attempts to prosecute sitting heads of state in Sudan and Libya, and has decided not to enforce arrest warrants for Bashir or Qadhafi. Some AU members, like Botswana, may enforce the warrants, while others quietly hold the same position. The AU Assembly endorsed Kenya's request for a deferral of prosecutions at a summit in January 2011, but no action has been taken by ICC judges or the UN Security Council. AU Commission chairman Jean Ping has accused the ICC Prosecutor of double standards regarding Africa. African parties to the ICC have not withdrawn from the Court. The ICC's founders aimed to deter future atrocities by ending impunity, with a focus on Africa where ongoing or recent atrocities occur. Despite challenges in enforcing arrest warrants and no convictions yet, the ICC's investigations in Africa are seen as crucial for reducing abysmal conduct. The African Union objects to ICC prosecutions of sitting heads of state in Sudan and Libya, with some members refusing to enforce arrest warrants. Some question the credibility of ICC prosecution due to lack of convictions. The Court's reliance on states for enforcement has caused tensions. Evidence collection may aid future prosecutions or reconciliation processes. Possibility of transitional countries like Tunisia and Egypt submitting to ICC for past abuses. Concerns over African sovereignty in ICC's investigations. President Paul Kagame of Rwanda has criticized the ICC as a form of \"imperialism\" undermining African countries. Some believe the ICC's focus on Africa is due to geopolitical pressures, drawing controversy over attempts to prosecute Bashir. African governments and regional organizations have rebuked the ICC, with accusations of hypocrisy. Supporters of the ICC argue that most investigations are based on referrals and the Prosecutor analyzes situations outside of Africa. The Office of the Prosecutor prioritizes cases based on the gravity of abuses, with crimes in Africa being among the most serious. ICC officials, including Deputy Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, claim the Court protects Africans rather than targets them. The ICC is seen as protecting Africans rather than targeting them, with supporters arguing that weak national legal systems in Africa allow the ICC to assert jurisdiction. Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan emphasized the role of the ICC as a court of last resort. Efforts to strengthen national justice systems were discussed at a 2010 meeting in Uganda, with the United States expressing support. The Prosecutor's selection of cases has been controversial, with perceptions of the ICC on the ground sometimes damaged by insufficient efforts. Some criticisms of the ICC in Africa include concerns about the Court's focus on rebel fighters over government troops, accusations of political bias in pursuing certain individuals like Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, and the perception that the ICC only targets participants in particularly serious cases. Persistent criticisms of the ICC in Africa include concerns that prosecuting individuals involved in ongoing conflicts could hinder peace processes by removing the possibility of amnesty. Critics argue that prioritizing prosecution over peace deals may not always benefit victims of conflict, especially in cases like Sudan, Kenya, and the Lord's Resistance Army. Similar concerns have been raised in Libya, where Qadhafi's refusal to step down has sparked worries about the balance between justice and peace. Persistent criticisms of the ICC in Africa include concerns that prosecuting individuals involved in ongoing conflicts could hinder peace processes. In Libya, Qadhafi's refusal to cede power has raised worries about the balance between justice and peace, as rulers facing war crimes charges have limited exile options since the establishment of the International Criminal Court in 2002. In Sudan, the attempt to prosecute President Bashir has complicated peace agreements and incentivized the ruling party to cling to power to avoid ICC trials. In Kenya, concerns persist that ICC prosecutions could destabilize the fragile political truce that has underpinned the post-2007 government of national unity. Some argue that lack of accountability for human rights violations would threaten future stability. ICC arrest warrants against LRA commanders were seen as an impediment to achieving a final peace agreement in Uganda between 2006 and 2008. Critics in Uganda, including community elders, supported traditional reconciliation mechanisms over international prosecution. The threat of ICC prosecution was seen as an important factor in finding a political solution to the conflict. The discussion on ICC arrest warrants against LRA commanders in Uganda could be a key factor in finding a political solution to the conflict in the north. Criticisms related to the case against Bashir in Sudan led to tensions with the ICC, affecting peacekeeping operations in Darfur. General Martin Luther Agwai, head of the UN-AU peacekeeping mission in Darfur (UNAMID), acknowledged that pursuing Bashir had a significant impact on UNAMID and the peace process, but not as severe as initially feared. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon emphasized the need to balance \"peace\" and \"justice\" in addressing the Darfur conflict, expressing concerns about the expulsion of aid organizations. Supporters of the ICC warrant against Bashir believe it could pressure conflict actors towards peace, with Priscilla Hayner suggesting it as a leverage for peace in Darfur. The International Center for Transitional Justice emphasizes that peace should not come at the expense of justice, as peace deals sacrificing justice often fail to bring lasting peace. It is challenging to determine the impact of ICC actions on complex processes."
