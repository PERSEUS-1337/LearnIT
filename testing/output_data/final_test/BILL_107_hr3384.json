    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer Travel Tax Credit Holiday Act of 2001\". Congress finds that consumer confidence and spending are crucial for the US economy. To prevent further decline in consumer spending and confidence, a targeted tax incentive is needed. A 10-day consumer travel tax credit holiday before the 2001 holiday season could encourage immediate purchases and counteract the decline. A tax incentive is needed to boost consumer confidence and spending in the US. A proposal for a sales tax holiday should include relief for states like Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon, which do not impose a state sales tax. These states should not be excluded from the benefits of a sales tax holiday. A tax credit for travel to make retail purchases in certain states would provide consumers with a benefit similar to a sales tax holiday. A tax credit for travel for retail purchases in states without sales tax is proposed as a new section in the Internal Revenue Code. A tax credit is proposed in the Internal Revenue Code for qualified travel expenses during the consumer travel tax credit period. Qualified travel expenses include transportation and lodging costs, excluding expenses for meals and entertainment. The term 'qualifying personal trip' refers to travel within the United States to specific destinations for the purpose of purchasing taxable tangible property. This excludes travel expenses that are deductible for business or income-producing activities. The term 'commercial lodging facility' includes hotels, motels, resorts, rooming houses, and campgrounds. Definitions for the consumer travel tax credit period and sales tax are provided. The curr_chunk discusses the collection of various taxes by retail sellers in Illinois, including sales tax, use tax, and the Illinois Retailers' Occupation Tax. It also defines the term 'use tax' as a tax on the storage, use, or consumption of tangible property not subject to sales tax. Special rules are outlined, including the denial of a tax credit to dependents if a deduction is allowable to another individual. The curr_chunk discusses the substantiation of expenses for tax credits and the denial of double benefits under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It emphasizes the need for taxpayers to provide adequate records to support their expenses. The amendment regarding travel credit under Sec. 25C applies to taxable years ending after the enactment of this Act."
