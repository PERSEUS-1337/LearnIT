    "content": "The \"Money Market Fund Parity Act of 2007\" is also known as the Act. It modernizes S.E.C. broker-dealer financing rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission must revise rules to treat securities issued by qualified money market funds similarly to other low-risk securities. This includes allowing the expanded use of these securities for financing by brokers and dealers. The revisions will impact net capital requirements for brokers and dealers. The Securities and Exchange Commission is required to update rules to allow brokers and dealers to use securities from qualified money market funds as collateral for financing, impacting their net capital requirements. The SEC must update rules to allow brokers and dealers to use securities from qualified money market funds as collateral for financing, affecting their net capital requirements. The SEC allows brokers and dealers to use securities from qualified money market funds as collateral for financing through a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Additionally, under Rule 15c2-4, brokers or dealers can invest funds obtained through underwritings in redeemable securities issued by qualified money market funds. The SEC allows brokers and dealers to transmit obtained funds to a bank for holding in escrow and invest them in redeemable securities from qualified money market funds through a clearing agency registered under section 17A(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC permits brokers and dealers to send funds to a bank for safekeeping and invest in redeemable securities from qualified money market funds through a clearing agency registered under section 17A(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The term \"qualified money market fund\" is defined by the Commission and includes open-end management companies meeting specific criteria. The SEC requires qualified money market funds to adopt policies for notifying shareholders of any changes in ratings or redemption policies, with specific timelines for notification. Exchanges registered under section 6 of this title (15 U.S.C. 78f) are required to comply with SEC regulations."
