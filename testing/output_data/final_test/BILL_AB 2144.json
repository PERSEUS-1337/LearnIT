    "title": "AB 2144",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4073.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to allow pharmacists to select alternative interchangeable biological products for prescription orders if the prescriber does not specify otherwise. Pharmacists must record the specific biological product provided to the patient within five days electronically for prescriber access. Pharmacists can select interchangeable biological products for prescription orders if not specified by the prescriber. Entry into an electronic records system provides notice to the prescriber. If the pharmacy lacks access to electronic systems, communication of the dispensed product to the prescriber is required unless certain conditions apply. Prescribers can indicate \"Do not substitute\" on prescriptions to prevent pharmacists from selecting interchangeable products. This can be done orally, in handwriting, or by checking a designated box. For electronic prescriptions, prescribers can electronically transmit the instruction or mark a box without manual initials. Pharmacists have discretion to select alternative biological products for dispensing, assuming responsibility for substitution. Prescribers are not liable for pharmacist's actions. The selected product must cost the same or less than the prescribed one. The section applies to all prescriptions, including those for individuals receiving federal assistance or under the Medi-Cal Act. Pharmacists must communicate any substitution of a biological product to the patient. The board must provide a link to the current list of interchangeable biological products on its website. The term \"biological product\" is defined according to the federal Public Health Service Act. The section defines \"interchangeable\" biological products approved by the FDA and outlines prescription requirements. It allows for immunizations and utilization controls by insurers. Section 4074 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require pharmacists to inform patients of harmful effects of prescription drugs that pose risks when taken with alcohol or impair driving ability. The warning is mandatory for drugs identified by the board. On and after July 1, 2014, pharmacists must label drug containers if a drug may impair driving ability. The board may require additional labeling. This does not apply to drugs given in health facilities or under specific circumstances. A health facility must provide information on drugs to patients at discharge, including use, storage, precautions, and compliance. Patients must acknowledge receipt of this information in writing. The policy must involve collaboration with a physician, pharmacist, and nurse, and be approved by the medical staff. Pharmacist or nurse can provide this information, not just a pharmacist. The act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
