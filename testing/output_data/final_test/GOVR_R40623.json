    "content": "The federal government loses significant tax revenue due to profits and income being shifted to low-tax countries, with estimated annual losses of around $100 billion. Tax avoidance and evasion can involve both individuals and corporations, legal and illegal actions, with multinational corporations engaging in tax avoidance by setting up operations in low-tax jurisdictions. The U.S. loses tax revenue due to profits shifted to low-tax countries. Tax avoidance by individuals and corporations can be classified as evasion, such as transfer pricing schemes. International tax evasion by individuals amounts to $40-70 billion annually. The U.S. loses tax revenue due to profits shifted to low-tax countries. Tax avoidance by individuals and corporations can be classified as evasion, such as transfer pricing schemes. International tax evasion by individuals amounts to $40-70 billion annually. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires foreign financial institutions to report information on asset holders or be subject to a 30% withholding rate, aiming to combat tax evasion. Corporate tax reductions from profit shifting have been estimated to range from $10 billion to $90 billion. Tax havens, which can be defined in various ways, have been used to evade taxes, with estimates of corporate tax reductions ranging from $10 billion to $90 billion annually. The OECD used a definition incorporating factors like low tax rates, lack of transparency, and minimal economic activity requirements in their 2000 tax shelter initiative. Economists may consider any low-tax country as a tax haven aiming to attract capital. This report discusses tax havens in a broad and narrow sense, focusing on international tax avoidance by individuals and corporations. Revenue losses from individual taxes are linked to evasion in narrowly defined tax havens, while corporate tax avoidance occurs in both narrow and broad tax havens through legal or illegal means. Evasion is often due to lack of information, and solutions may involve enforcement resources, incentives, and sanctions to improve information. President Obama and legislative proposals have addressed international tax issues, including profit shifting by multinational corporations and individual tax evasion. Various bills introduced in Congress have aimed at revising corporate international tax rules to increase enforcement and information sharing, potentially through changes in the tax code. Various bills introduced in Congress aimed at revising corporate international tax rules, including proposals to tax foreign source income currently and eliminate deferral. Former Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp proposed a lower corporate rate combined with a move to a territorial tax system. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has been engaged in international tax investigations since 2001. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has been involved in international tax investigations since 2001. In the 111th Congress, the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act was introduced by Senator Levin and a companion bill by Representative Doggett. The Senate Finance Committee has also proposed legislation addressing individual tax evasion issues. Anti-evasion provisions were adopted in the HIRE Act, and revised versions of the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act have been introduced. The Permanent Subcommittee released a study on profit shifting by multinationals in preparation for a hearing in 2012. The curr_chunk discusses tax havens, including OECD initiatives and lists, corporate profit-shifting mechanisms, evidence of profit-shifting activity, individual tax evasion, and alternative policy options. Tax havens are defined by features such as low taxes, lack of information exchange, lack of transparency, and no substantial activity requirement. The OECD created an initial list of tax havens in 2000. The OECD created an initial list of tax havens in 2000, which was used in legislation introduced in the 110th and 111th Congress to address tax haven abuse. The definition of tax havens by the OECD excluded low-tax jurisdictions like Ireland and Switzerland, which were included in studies by Hines and Rice and the Government Accountability Office. The OECD created an initial list of tax havens in 2000, excluding countries like Ireland and Switzerland. Table 1 lists 50 tax havens by geographic location, with some countries not appearing on the original OECD list. OECD focused on information exchange and removed countries from a blacklist if they agreed to cooperate. The OECD created a blacklist of tax havens in 2000, initially excluding six countries with advance agreements to share information. The list eventually dwindled to only three countries: Andorra, Liechtenstein, and Monaco, as more tax havens made agreements to share information. The reduction in the OECD list was attributed to the withdrawal of U.S. support in 2001, leading to a focus on information exchange and cooperation. The OECD's efforts to address tax havens have not been successful, with little progress made according to analysts. Recent events such as scandals involving Swiss bank UBS AG and the Liechtenstein Global Trust Group have increased interest in international tax issues. The G20 meeting proposed sanctions on tax havens, leading to commitments to information sharing agreements by some countries. The OECD has three lists for countries regarding tax standards: white, gray, and black. On April 7, 2009, four countries were moved from the black list to the gray list. Hong Kong and Macau were omitted from the list but mentioned in a footnote for committing to the standards. As of May 18, 2012, more jurisdictions have committed to the standards. As of May 18, 2012, only Nauru was on the gray list for tax havens and Guatemala for financial centers. Many countries protested being on the OECD's original blacklist but have since signed agreements for tax information exchange. The OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative focuses on rating countries for transparency and exchange of tax information. The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes rates countries based on compliance levels. As of October 2014, 105 reviews were conducted, with 71 jurisdictions receiving full reviews. Criticisms have been raised that major countries like the US and UK have aspects of tax havens. The Global Forum rates countries on compliance levels for tax purposes. Major countries like the US, UK, Netherlands, and others have been identified as tax havens. The Netherlands, in particular, is known for allowing firms to reduce taxes on dividends and capital gains. In 2006, members of the U2 band moved their music publishing company from Ireland to the Netherlands for tax benefits. The Netherlands facilitates movement to tax havens through provisions like \"Dutch sandwiches,\" raising concerns about tax avoidance. The European Commission is investigating arrangements in Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands for prohibited state aid. The EU is adding an anti-abuse clause to prevent double taxation within member states. The US and UK are also identified as having tax haven characteristics. The UK and US are identified as having tax haven characteristics. Luxembourg's Prime Minister urges EU states to challenge the US for tax havens in Delaware, Nevada, and Wyoming. Websites mention overlooked tax havens including the US, UK, Denmark, Iceland, Israel, and Portugal's Madeira Island. Concerns have been raised about the Netherlands' role in tax avoidance. The Netherlands, Delaware, Wyoming, and Puerto Rico are mentioned as tax havens. Other jurisdictions like Campione d'Italia, Sark, the UK, and Canada are also discussed. A study by The Economist shows sham corporations being set up in Wyoming, Nevada, the UK, and other places. U.S. practices aiding international evasion are highlighted by Michael McIntyre. In a meeting in late April 2009, Eduardo Silva of the Cayman Islands Financial Services Association criticized Delaware, Nevada, Wyoming, and the UK for facilitating tax fraud and allowing anonymous ownership through practices like bearer shares. Legislation in the United States was proposed to require disclosure of beneficial owners. Nicholas Shaxson categorizes tax havens into four groups, including continental European havens and a British zone of influence. In a study of tax havens, different zones of influence are identified, including continental European havens, a British zone (including the City of London and related territories), a U.S. zone (including states and territories like the Virgin Islands and Marshall Islands), and other jurisdictions. The connection with the UK, particularly the City of London, is seen as a factor in the success of tax havens. The Marshall Islands, known for flags of convenience, is a significant tax haven in the U.S. sphere of influence. Low-tax countries are also considered potential tax haven locations. In addition to Ireland, other countries with tax rates below 20% include Iceland, Poland, and the Slovak Republic. The Tax Justice Network has a list of tax havens that includes various cities and areas around the world. The Tax Justice Network lists various tax havens, including the Indian and Pacific oceans, the Marianas. Jordan is the only country not included in their list. Ronen Palan, Richard Murphy, and Christian Chavagneux report 11 different lists of tax havens, with eight countries appearing on all lists. They also suggest Belgium as a location for holding companies in Europe and discuss tax haven aspects in the United States and the United Kingdom. U.S. multinationals are not taxed on income earned by foreign subsidiaries until repatriated as dividends, with some income currently taxed under anti-abuse rules. The curr_chunk discusses the taxation of income earned by foreign affiliates or subsidiaries owned by U.S. companies, known as controlled foreign corporations (CFCs). Taxes on repatriated income are allowed a credit for foreign taxes paid, but foreign tax credits are limited to the U.S. tax amount. This limit allows excess credits in high-tax countries to offset U.S. tax liability on income from low-tax countries. Other countries also use similar systems of deferral and credit. The curr_chunk discusses how tax avoidance relates to U.S. parent companies shifting profits abroad to low-tax jurisdictions and the shifting of profits out of the United States by foreign parents of U.S. subsidiaries. This artificial shifting of profits is the focus of the report, as it can reduce taxes without affecting other aspects of the company. One study found that U.S. multinationals shift profits to low-tax countries through transfers of intellectual property and debt allocation. Evidence also shows the importance of intellectual property in profit repatriation, with pharmaceutical and technology industries being major players. Shifting profits involves borrowing more in high-tax jurisdictions and less in low-tax ones. Shifting profits to low-tax countries can be achieved through debt allocation, such as earnings stripping. This practice involves related or unrelated firms lending money to reduce tax exposure. The U.S. tax code addresses interest deductions and limits on foreign tax credits, affecting firms with excess credits. However, there is no rule to address deferral in the current provisions. The U.S. tax code lacks an allocation rule to address deferral, allowing a U.S. parent to operate a subsidiary with all equity finance in a low-tax jurisdiction. Proposed bills aim to introduce allocation rules to prevent deductions until income is repatriated. Thin capitalization rules are in place to limit earnings stripping. The United States has thin capitalization rules under section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code to limit earnings stripping, particularly for corporations with high debt-to-equity ratios. The rules restrict the deduction of interest payments exceeding 50% of adjusted taxable income, especially if paid to related or unrelated parties not subject to U.S. income tax. The issue gained attention when U.S. firms inverted to become subsidiaries of foreign parent companies, prompting the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 to address inversion by treating such firms as U.S. entities. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 addressed the issue of inversion by treating firms that inverted as U.S. entities. While there were proposals for broader earnings stripping restrictions, they were not adopted. The Treasury Department's study focused on U.S. subsidiaries of foreign parents and found evidence that U.S. multinationals allocate more interest to high-tax jurisdictions. However, assessing earnings stripping by foreign parents of U.S. subsidiaries is challenging due to limited access to the entire firm's accounts. The study found evidence of profit shifting for inverted firms, with some U.S. firms inverting by merging with foreign firms. The President proposed tighter restrictions on inversions, with bills introduced in Congress. Regulatory changes have been made to limit benefits. Another way firms shift profits is through pricing goods and services between high-tax and low-tax jurisdictions. The transfer pricing of goods and services between high-tax and low-tax jurisdictions is a common method used by companies to shift income. This can be done by adjusting prices between related companies to reflect income properly. An emerging issue in transfer pricing involves the transfer of intellectual property rights, where income can be shifted by undervaluing licenses for patents or other intangibles. Comparing prices of similar products or using alternative methods can help determine if prices are set appropriately, especially for intangibles like new inventions or drugs. Investment in intangibles presents challenges for transfer pricing as they lack comparables. In the United States, costs for research, development, and advertising are tax-deductible, leading to low or negative tax rates for intangible investments. This incentivizes investments in the US, with tax benefits offsetting future taxes on returns. Successful investments can benefit from profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions. Profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions is advantageous for successful investments, leading to negative tax rates or subsidies. Transfer pricing rules for intellectual property are complex, especially with cost sharing agreements. Firms with cost sharing arrangements are more likely to engage in profit shifting. Some firms exploit tax laws in other countries to shift profits to tax havens, like the double Irish, Dutch sandwich method used by U.S. firms such as Google. This involves transferring intangible assets to an Irish holding company with a Dutch subsidiary in between, ultimately claiming company management in Bermuda for tax purposes. The Irish holding company utilizes a tax strategy involving Bermuda to avoid corporate income tax, including the Dutch sandwich method to bypass Irish withholding taxes. European countries have raised concerns about tech giants like Google and Apple using similar tactics. Ireland plans to end the rule allowing firms to be incorporated there but have their tax home elsewhere, while maintaining a 12.5% corporate tax rate. Yahoo has been able to shift profits to tax havens like the Cayman Islands through Dutch intermediaries. The Irish holding company uses tax strategies involving Bermuda and the Dutch sandwich method to avoid corporate income tax and withholding taxes. Profit shifting to tax havens like the Cayman Islands is facilitated by these tactics. To minimize taxes, subsidiaries may contract with manufacturers in higher-tax countries like Germany. Complex regulations govern profit shifting techniques. The check-the-box provisions have expanded profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions by allowing entities to be recognized differently in different jurisdictions. This enables tactics like lending from a low-tax subsidiary to a high-tax subsidiary, with deductible interest. The high-tax subsidiary can elect to be disregarded as a separate entity under these rules. The check-the-box rules allow high-tax corporations to elect to be disregarded as a separate entity, avoiding interest income payments. The look-through rules expand this provision to more related parties and circumstances, originally temporary but extended multiple times. Hybrid entities can also be used for profit shifting and foreign tax credit benefits. The check-the-box rules allow high-tax corporations to elect to be disregarded as a separate entity, avoiding interest income payments. Hybrid entities and instruments can be used for profit shifting and foreign tax credit benefits. P.L. 111-226 provisions eliminated the practice of structuring entities to achieve tax benefits by being treated differently in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Hybrid instruments can avoid taxation by being treated differently in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Income from a low-tax country received in the US can escape taxes through cross crediting. Foreign tax credits have been separated into two baskets to limit cross crediting. Firms can strategically repatriate income to maximize benefits of the foreign tax credit limit. Studies suggest that U.S. multinationals can avoid paying U.S. taxes on foreign source income by strategically utilizing cross crediting and deferral. This is achieved by treating income from low-tax jurisdictions as foreign source income, thereby increasing the foreign tax credit limit. Additionally, income from U.S. exports can also be considered foreign source income, further allowing for tax reduction through the title passage rule. Royalty income from active business and interest income can benefit from foreign tax credits, especially in high-tax countries where royalties are deductible. This income, originating from investments in the United States, may be considered U.S. source income or placed in a separate foreign tax credit basket to prevent excess credits from dividends offsetting it. Studies by Harry Grubert and Grubert and Rosanne Altshuler have discussed this sourcing rule in relation to eliminating tax proposals. Rosanne Altshuler and Harry Grubert have discussed the sourcing rule in a proposal to eliminate tax on active dividends. The revenue loss would be offset by gains from taxes on royalties. Legislation in H.R. 4213 focused on techniques to enhance foreign tax credits, with most provisions enacted in P.L. 111-226. Profit shifting techniques and evidence of profits appearing in countries inconsistent with economic motivation are examined. The curr_chunk discusses the distribution of earnings and gross domestic product among different groups of countries. The first group consists of G-7 countries, the second group includes larger countries with GDP over $15 billion, and the third group comprises smaller countries with GDP less than $10 billion. The income-to-GDP ratios vary among the large G-7 countries. In 2010, income as a share of GDP in large G-7 countries ranged from 0.2% to 3.3%, with the US having closer ties with trading partners. Overall, the income as a share of GDP is 0.7%. Outside the UK and Canada, this income ranges from 0.3% to 0.6% and does not vary with country size. Canada and the UK have appeared on tax haven lists, possibly influencing larger income shares. There has been little change in aggregate between 2004 and 2010. U.S. source profits as a percentage of GDP are significantly larger than other countries, with Luxembourg's profits at 18% in 2004 and 127% in 2010. In Luxembourg, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Cyprus, profits as a percentage of output have significantly increased. Small tax havens like Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, and Cayman Islands show profits multiples of total GDP, indicating motives unrelated to productive inputs or markets. The data suggests a significant increase in profit shifting to tax havens, with pretax profits reported by controlled foreign corporations in these countries rising from 44% in 2004 to 59% in 2010. Various studies have shown evidence of profit shifting, with higher shares of pretax profits reported in low-tax countries compared to value added, tangible assets, sales, compensation, or employees. The data shows a significant increase in profit shifting to tax havens, with controlled foreign corporations reporting higher pretax profits in low-tax countries. Studies have found that countries like Ireland, Switzerland, and the Cayman Islands have higher manufacturing returns compared to countries like Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom due to lower effective tax rates. There are no official estimates of the cost of international corporate tax avoidance or the individual tax gap. Estimates of corporate tax avoidance vary, with some exceeding $100 billion annually. The IRS estimated a $3 billion cost related to transfer pricing audits, not accounting for increased taxes collected on audit. Legal avoidance estimates are not available. The estimated revenue loss from profit shifting by U.S. multinationals through deferral was projected to be $83.5 billion in FY2014 by the Joint Committee on Taxation, while the Administration's estimate was $63.4 billion. These figures provide an idea of the potential revenue cost of profit shifting by U.S. parent firms. The estimated revenue loss from profit shifting by U.S. multinationals through deferral was projected to be $83.5 billion in FY2014 by the Joint Committee on Taxation. This estimate could be either an overstatement or an understatement of the cost of tax avoidance. Ending deferral could potentially cut the corporate tax rate to 28% and result in a gain of about $11 billion based on corporate revenue in 2002. The revenue gain in FY2014 was about $11 billion, which could have been $26 billion if the share had remained the same. The projection of the effects of deferral in tax expenditures has increased faster than revenues. Researchers estimate a cost of $10-20 billion in 2004 from profit shifting, with a potential revenue loss of $17 billion between 1999 and 2004. Martin Sullivan suggests that profit shifting has been growing. The growth in profit shifting may be due to check-the-box, with estimates suggesting a $28 billion loss in 2007. Charles Christian and Thomas Schultz estimated $87 billion was shifted in 2001, implying a revenue loss of about $30 billion. Adjusted proportionally, this amount would be $70 billion in 2014. Estimates suffer from limits in determining how much was shifted out of high-tax foreign jurisdictions. Economic theory suggests that lower tax rates lead to lower returns, potentially understating overall profit shifting and revenue loss. Kimberly Clausing estimated that over $60 billion in revenue was lost in 2004 due to profit shifting, with $180 billion in corporate profits shifted out of the United States. This methodological approach differs from direct calculations and focuses on tax rates and profits reported. Based on econometric limitations, Clausing and Avi-Yonah estimate a revenue gain of $50 billion per year by moving to formula apportionment based on sales. This suggests the magnitude of total effects from profit shifting, as shown in other studies using different apportionment methods. The revenue loss from profit shifting was estimated to be as high as $90 billion in 2008, with alternative data suggesting $57 billion. Different methodologies found the cost of profit shifting to range from $55 billion to $133 billion in 2013. Gabriel Zucman's analysis attributed about two-thirds of the decline in effective tax rate to profit shifting. Profit shifting accounts for a significant portion of revenue loss, with estimates ranging from $55 billion to $133 billion in 2013. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign multinational companies face challenges in estimating profit shifting due to lack of visibility into parent firms. Studies show these firms have lower taxable income and higher debt ratios. Techniques like transfer pricing of intangibles and debt shifting are key methods used for profit shifting. Earnings stripping for inverted firms has also been observed. No quantitative estimate has been made, but evidence suggests profit shifting is a prevalent issue. Profit shifting is a significant issue, with estimates ranging from $55 billion to $133 billion in revenue loss in 2013. Multinationals saved $7 billion more between 1997 and 2002 due to check-the-box rules, with some of the gain potentially at the expense of high-tax host countries. Estimates conflict on the source of profit shifting, with some suggesting transfer pricing of goods as a key mechanism, while others point to leverage and intangibles. Much of the shifting is associated with trade with high-tax countries, but about 14% involves transactions with countries on tax haven lists. A study by Jost Hekemeyer and Michael Overesch found that transfer pricing accounted for 72% of profit shifting, with intangible assets playing a significant role. They also discovered that reported profits decrease by 0.8% with a one percentage point change in tax differentials between locations. Examining dividends repatriated during the 2004 \"repatriation holiday\" can provide evidence of the importance of intangibles and profits in tax haven countries. During the 2004 \"repatriation holiday,\" dividends were allowed to be repatriated with an 85% deduction, resulting in a tax rate of 5.25%. The pharmaceutical and medicine industry accounted for $99 billion in repatriations, while the computer and electronic equipment industry accounted for $58 billion. High tech firms like Pfizer, Merck, Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson, and IBM were responsible for a significant portion of total repatriations. Top firms concentrated the benefits, with the top 15 firms accounting for over half of the total repatriations. Individuals can evade taxes by purchasing foreign investments directly, putting money in foreign bank accounts, or using structures like trusts or shell corporations. This evasion is facilitated by international financial globalization and ease of online transactions. Most dividends repatriated during the 2004 \"repatriation holiday\" came from countries on tax haven lists, with top firms like Pfizer and IBM accounting for a significant portion. Individuals can evade taxes by using structures like trusts or shell corporations to avoid tax on investments, including those made in the United States. The U.S. has relied on the Qualified Intermediary (QI) program to conceal beneficial owners, rather than withholding or information collection. Information gathering from other countries is done through bilateral exchanges, as the U.S. does not participate in multilateral agreements. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) was enacted in 2010 to address tax evasion both domestically and abroad. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) was enacted in 2010 to address tax evasion both domestically and abroad. FATCA requires foreign financial institutions to report information on asset holders or be subject to a 30% withholding rate. Recently, 51 other countries signed a multi-lateral information exchange agreement to set reporting standards for fuller exchange of tax information. U.S. persons can avoid tax on U.S. source income due to rules that do not impose withholding taxes on many sources of income. Dividends, non-portfolio interest, and capital gains are not subject to withholding. The curr_chunk discusses how certain types of income, such as interest payments, capital gains, and rents, are subject to tax but can be reduced or eliminated through treaty arrangements. Techniques have been developed to transform assets into exempt interest to avoid withholding taxes. The lack of information reporting and sharing allows individuals to evade taxes, both domestically and abroad. Individuals, including foreign citizens, can evade taxes through shell corporations and trusts, taking advantage of the lack of information sharing. Guttenberg and Avi-Yonah illustrate how U.S. individuals can evade taxes by setting up a Cayman Islands operation online, transferring money without reporting to tax authorities, and making investments without withholding taxes. Foreign trusts can also be used for the same purpose. Trust protectors can act as intermediaries between grantors and trustees, potentially carrying out the grantor's wishes. These trusts can help protect income from taxes, including those invested in the United States, while allowing control and use of the funds. International taxation of passive portfolio income has been susceptible to evasion due to limited information sharing. Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) have been used, but they often focus on criminal matters and have limitations. The OECD has adopted a model agreement with dual criminality requirements for Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs), which usually allow information exchange only upon request. However, these agreements can be hindered by the requirement that the activities related to the information sought constitute crimes in both countries. In some cases, countries may have little to no valuable information to exchange, as seen with the British Virgin Islands where laws do not require identification of shareholders or directors, making it unclear what information could be exchanged. The QI program established by the IRS in 2001 required foreign banks to certify the nationality of depositors and disclose any U.S. citizens. However, some QIs relied on self-certification, raising questions about the program's effectiveness. UBS, a Swiss bank involved in a tax scandal, was a QI, casting doubt on the program. Nonqualified intermediaries must disclose customer identities to receive exemptions for passive income, but the accuracy of disclosures is questionable. The FATCA provisions in P.L. 111-147 strengthened rules for qualified intermediaries' identification of asset holders, with backup withholding provisions. The European Union's savings directive offers member countries the choice of information reporting or a withholding tax. Some countries like Austria, Belgium, and Luxembourg have opted for the withholding tax. Different methods are used to estimate corporate tax avoidance, relying on reported data on assets and income. Estimates of individual tax evasion rely on data reported on assets and income. Guttentag and Avi-Yonah estimate $50 billion in evasion based on $1.5 trillion in assets held abroad. Other estimates in 2002 were $40 billion by the IRS and $70 billion by an IRS consultant. Different methods are used to estimate corporate tax avoidance. The tax rates on dividends, capital gains, and interest have significant implications for revenue. Using a 15% tax rate on dividends and capital gains could generate about $23 billion, while a 10% tax rate on equity investments could result in $15 billion. However, the current 20% tax rate on capital gains and dividends may lead to a loss of $20 billion. Additionally, estimating a $40 billion loss from interest income at a 35% tax rate reveals the impact of tax policies on revenue. The Tax Justice Network has estimated a worldwide revenue loss of $255 billion from individual tax evasion, highlighting the need for effective tax enforcement measures. Zucman estimates $1.2 trillion in U.S. financial wealth abroad with a potential tax loss of $36 billion in 2013. The cost for the United States could be much larger, approaching $100 billion, based on estimates of offshore wealth ranging from $11 trillion to $32 trillion. It is challenging to address the corporate tax revenue loss from legal activities without changes in tax laws. International cooperation is crucial in addressing tax evasion and corporate avoidance. OECD action plan on base erosion and profit shifting includes provisions for broad changes in international tax rules. One approach to combat profit shifting is to repeal deferral and implement true worldwide taxation of foreign source income. Firms would be taxed on the income of their foreign subsidiaries, with the ability to take foreign tax credits. Repealing deferral would impact subsidiaries' ability to take foreign tax credits, potentially increasing revenue by $20 billion annually. Economic analysis suggests eliminating deferral could enhance efficiency, but concerns exist about firms incorporating in other countries to avoid the effects of repeal. Firms may avoid the effects of deferral repeal by incorporating their parent company in other countries. Inversion is a direct method to reduce tax liabilities but has been addressed by legislation. Mergers could also be used to counter deferral implementation, but may not be practical for small tax benefits. Direct portfolio investment in foreign corporations is increasing, driven by diversification rather than tax avoidance. Proposed tax reform bills have aimed to eliminate deferral. In the 113th Congress, proposals were made to eliminate deferral and address tax avoidance by taxing income in tax havens or foreign subsidiaries. Various methods were suggested, such as eliminating deferral for specified tax havens or countries with lower tax rates than the U.S. Restricting current taxation to tax havens could help with transfer pricing issues without completely ending deferral. Defining a tax haven would be crucial in this context. In the 110th Congress, a bill was introduced to define a U.S. firm as any U.S. subsidiary in a tax haven not engaged in active business. This bill listed countries similar to the original OECD tax haven list, except for the U.S. Virgin Islands. Concerns were raised about potential corporate tax avoidance and the impact on U.S. revenue. An alternative proposal suggested restricting deferral based on a tax rate lower than the U.S. rate by a specified amount to address these issues. The proposal to restrict deferral is aimed at addressing tax avoidance by U.S. firms in tax havens. One suggestion is to impose current taxation on activities that involve exporting goods into the United States from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Senator Kerry also proposed a more restrictive measure during the 2004 presidential campaign. The main challenge with these proposals is the complexity of administration, particularly in tracing sales to third parties for resale. Senator Kerry proposed a more restrictive measure during the 2004 presidential campaign to eliminate deferral except in cases where income is produced and sold in the controlled foreign corporation's jurisdiction. This approach aims to restrict artificial profit shifting opportunities, but the administration of such a plan would be challenging. Another option suggested is to require a minimum share to be paid out or tax income currently at a lower rate than the U.S. rate. In 2013, then-Chairman Baucus released a discussion draft of a proposal to tax income. The Senate Finance Committee released a discussion draft in 2013 proposing to tax foreign source income at rates of 60% or 80% of the statutory rate. Chairman Camp's tax reform proposal includes a minimum tax on intangible income as part of anti-abuse provisions. A provision to allocate deductions and credits to deny benefits until income is repatriated was also suggested in previous tax reform bills. President Obama's proposal aims to disallow deductions for foreign deferred income and allocate foreign tax credits based on repatriated income. This provision would discourage profit shifting and investment in low-tax jurisdictions, making foreign investment less attractive. It would also increase taxes on repatriated income and discourage investment abroad. The proposed tax reform aims to increase taxes on repatriated income and discourage investment in low-tax jurisdictions. It suggests implementing a per country limit for foreign tax credits to prevent profit shifting and encourage investment domestically. Various bills have been introduced in Congress to address these issues. One approach to addressing income shifting is through formula apportionment, a significant change in the international tax system. This method allocates income to different jurisdictions based on sales, assets, and employment shares. Studies suggest a substantial increase in taxes with formula apportionment, with estimates ranging from 35% to 38% revenue increase. The formula apportionment system could raise an additional $50 billion annually over the 2001-2004 period, addressing income shifting issues. However, challenges arise with intangible assets, making it difficult to estimate and allocate them accurately. The allocation of profits based on sales could lead to complications in tax administration, such as potential double taxation and income not being taxed. The European Union is considering a formula apportionment system based on various factors, which could influence the United States to adopt a similar approach. The European Union is considering a formula apportionment system to prevent double taxation, which could influence the United States to adopt a similar approach. Various provisions are being considered to prevent abuses in international corporate taxation. Legislation in 2011 addressed issues with the foreign tax credit and proposals have been made to eliminate check-the-box rules. President Obama's budget proposal included a provision to prevent subsidiaries from treating foreign subsidiaries as disregarded entities. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 considered further restrictions on earnings stripping rules as an alternative to anti-inversion measures. These provisions were not enacted but were to be studied in a Treasury report, with potential revenue-raising measures such as dropping the debt-to-asset test and lowering interest share standards. President Obama's budget proposals and Chairman Camp's Tax Reform Proposal in the 113th Congress included restrictions on earnings stripping through debt for U.S. subsidiaries of foreign parents. One issue is the cross-crediting of foreign tax credits to shield royalties from U.S. tax on income, which could be addressed by sourcing royalties as domestic income or putting them in a separate foreign tax credit basket. President Obama's proposal aims to address transfer pricing issues related to the allocation of income from exports. Michael McIntyre suggests penalties for taxpayers without proper records and a formula apportionment plan for non-compliant taxpayers. The proposal clarifies that intangibles include workforce in place, goodwill, and going concern value. The President's budget proposals aim to address transfer pricing issues, including the valuation of intangibles like workforce in place, goodwill, and going concern value. The proposals suggest aggregating intangibles for a more appropriate value and treating excess returns on intangibles in low-tax countries as Subpart F income. These measures could have significant implications for transfer pricing using intangibles. Other narrow-focused proposals address tax avoidance methods on repatriation and shifting headquarters. The proposed legislation aims to address tax avoidance methods such as shifting headquarters and avoiding taxes on repatriation. Options for addressing evasion involve more information reporting and enforcement, with some suggesting fundamental changes in tax laws. Other proposals focus on administration and enforcement without changing the tax itself. These options are drawn from various sources, including academics, practitioners, organizations, and the Internal Revenue Service. The curr_chunk discusses proposals for expanded information reporting to address tax avoidance, including multilateral efforts and bilateral agreements. Avi-Yonah, Guttentag, and Shay suggest cooperation with organizations like the OECD and G-20 to improve information exchange and persuade tax havens to adopt OECD standards. The Tax Justice Network proposes a global tax cooperation standard under the United Nations, with a panel to determine compliant states and deny recognition to non-compliant jurisdictions. Suggestions include expanding bilateral information treaties for regular exchanges, adopting the OECD model TIEA for civil and criminal issues related to tax evasion. The proposal suggests implementing measures to combat tax evasion, including the exchange of information on interest payments by banks and financial institutions. It also recommends imposing withholding taxes on income from U.S. sources by foreign intermediaries, with a refund for eligible recipients. Avi-Yonah hopes for multilateral adoption of these changes. Avi-Yonah and Guttenberg propose a carrot and stick approach to tax havens, suggesting transitional aid to move away from offshore activities and denying benefits for non-cooperating tax havens. They argue that tax havens benefit professionals more than residents and cannot exist without wealthy countries' permission. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act aims to extend tax enforcement measures. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act proposes sanctions similar to the Patriot Act for tax enforcement, with varying severity levels. Suggestions include multilateral sanctions and shifting the burden of proof onto taxpayers in court. FATCA has already made some changes to the QI program. President Obama's proposal would create a presumption that funds in foreign accounts exceeding $10,000 require an FBAR filing. Failure to file for amounts over $200,000 would be considered willful, leading to criminal and civil penalties. The HIRE Act assumes foreign accounts exceed $50,000 when adequate information is not provided. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act includes a provision to treat publicly traded firms or those with assets over $50 million as U.S. corporations, affecting hedge funds but not multinational firm subsidiaries. Sullivan argues that a provision affecting hedge funds in the U.S. would have a devastating effect on the industry, as offshore firms attract tax-exempt U.S. investors and foreigners avoiding tax filings. Legislative relief for U.S. tax-exempt investors is likely, with proposals to extend the statute of limitations from 3 years to 6 years supported by IRS officials, the Senate Finance Committee, and President Obama. Blum suggests extending the statute of limitations to 6 or even 10 years to combat overseas tax abuses. President Obama proposes funding 800 new positions to address international tax abuses. Blum argues for excluding settlements over $1 million from confidentiality restrictions to increase deterrence. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act aims to make it easier to issue John Doe summonses. The proposed Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act includes provisions to streamline the process of issuing John Doe summonses for offshore secret accounts and increase penalties for various tax violations. President Obama's proposals aim to crack down on abusive tax shelters, failure to report foreign trusts, and offshore transactions. The proposed Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act would increase penalties for trusts and foreign transactions, eliminate legal opinion protection from penalties, and introduce criminal penalties through the Fraud Recovery and Investment Act. Some tax attorneys are concerned about the severity of these proposals and their impact on tax amnesty and voluntary compliance. Additionally, the Act would prohibit the patenting of tax shelters and enhance examination processes for tax shelters. Blum suggests tightening regulations on tax shelters, including prohibiting patenting, enhancing examination procedures for bank regulators, disallowing fees based on tax savings, improving communication between enforcement agencies, codifying regulations, clarifying disclosure rules for tax preparers, and setting standards for tax shelter opinion letters. S. 569 proposes requiring record-keeping and identifying beneficial owners of corporations and LLCs, as well as studying partnerships and trusts. There is a proposal to share information from suspicious activity reports filed by financial institutions with the civil side of the IRS. Blum proposed sharing information from suspicious activity reports with the civil side of the IRS under anti-money laundering acts. The provision in the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act aims to combat international tax evasion through the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which would impose a 30% withholding rate on payments to foreign financial institutions unless specific information requirements are met. The projected impact of the foreign provisions in the act is $8.7 billion over 10 years, compared to an estimated $40 billion annual cost of international evasion. The requirements for U.S. beneficial owners are determined by the institution with oversight by the Treasury. Non-registered bonds are subject to restrictions, including an excise tax and denial of interest deductions, except for foreign targeted bonds. Foreign-targeted bonds are designed for non-U.S. persons and will be subject to U.S. tax laws if held by a U.S. person. This provision repeals the foreign targeted bond exception for interest deductibility. Non-registered state and local bond interest for these bonds are also not eligible for tax exclusion. Individuals required to file an FBAR would need to report this information. Individuals required to file an FBAR must report information on their tax return if the account holds $50,000 or more. The penalty for failing to disclose reportable information on foreign accounts is increased to 40%, with no reasonable cause exception. For foreign trusts, the initial penalty is 35% of the trust amount, with an additional $10,000 penalty for each 30-day period of non-reporting. The proposal aims to address penalties for non-reporting of foreign trusts, increasing the initial penalty to 35% of the trust amount with an additional $10,000 penalty for each 30-day period. It also extends the statute of limitations for cross-border transactions and requires electronic filing for individuals who file at least 250 returns. The legislation mandates electronic filing for financial institutions, regardless of the number of returns filed, with a focus on foreign financial institutions. It tightens restrictions on foreign trusts by treating the grantor as the owner in certain scenarios, shifts the burden of proof to the grantor, and requires information reporting to prevent tax evasion. This provision targets disguising dividends as untaxed interest and estimates a revenue increase of $1.1 billion for FY2011-FY2020. The economic substance doctrine, relevant to international tax evasion, requires transactions to meet objective and subjective tests to prevent tax avoidance. Penalties are imposed for non-compliance, with recent proposals aiming to make the doctrine more uniform through statute. This provision could raise $1.1 billion for FY2011-FY2020 according to the President's proposals. Some tax attorneys are concerned about specific rules providing a roadmap for tax avoidance. Ways and Means Committee Chairman Levin and Senate Finance Committee Baucus released a plan combining Senate and House proposals for tax benefits. Foreign provisions related to the foreign tax credit were included in the plan, raising $14.451 billion over 10 years. These provisions were adopted as part of H.R. 4213 on May 28, 2010. H.R. 4213 included foreign provisions related to the foreign tax credit, aiming to raise $14.451 billion over 10 years. However, the bill was not enacted, but similar provisions were included in a smaller spending bill, H.R. 1586, which provided funding for education and Medicaid to states. This bill was signed into law on August 10, 2010. The provision in the bill addresses the issue of reverse hybrids and mechanisms for recognizing foreign taxes paid. It proposes a matching rule to delay foreign tax credits until income is accounted for, estimated to raise $6.325 billion over 10 years. Taxpayers can acquire a firm through stock or asset purchase, with assets valued at market value for increased depreciation deductions. Foreign governments may not have a similar rule in place. The proposal addresses the issue of foreign tax credits on asset acquisitions, aiming to prevent firms from obtaining credits for excess taxes. It is estimated to raise $4.025 billion over 10 years. Tax treaties allow for income to be resourced in foreign countries, impacting U.S. source income. The proposal aims to address foreign tax credits on asset acquisitions, preventing firms from claiming credits for excess taxes. It extends the treatment to branch operations and disregarded entities, applying to taxable years beginning after enactment and estimated to raise $253 million over 10 years. The hopscotch rules issue arises from the combination of two tax provisions regarding dividends from foreign subsidiaries with multiple tiers. The foreign tax credit allowed is a blend of tax rates from tier 1 and tier 2 subsidiaries, impacting dividends paid to the U.S. parent. This issue can be used for foreign tax credits against any U.S. tax on foreign source income. The Section 956 provision aims to prevent firms from avoiding taxes by returning income to the U.S. parent through methods like lending or property transactions. It allows a tier 2 subsidiary to bypass the tier 1 subsidiary and be taxed at a higher rate of 50%. This proposal is expected to generate $1.010 billion over 10 years. The issue involves a foreign multinational owning a U.S. firm, which owns a foreign subsidiary, and the foreign subsidiary buying stock in the U.S. firm from the foreign multinational with cash. The cash payment from the foreign subsidiary to the U.S. parent bypasses the U.S. tax system by being considered a direct dividend payment, reducing the foreign subsidiary's earnings and profits. This provision aims to prevent tax avoidance and is estimated to raise $255 million over 10 years. The provision aims to prevent tax avoidance by bypassing 50% of the dividend through the U.S. tax system, estimated to raise $255 million over 10 years. Foreign tax credits are limited based on the share of total assets that are foreign, with special rules for foreign affiliates to prevent hiding interest in these types of affiliates. The proposal aims to include all assets and interest in the calculation of effectively connected earnings if they are 50% or more. This change is estimated to raise $405 million over 10 years. Dividends and interest paid by a domestic corporation to a foreign person are generally subject to withholding, but certain exemptions apply for foreign source income from active foreign businesses. Eligibility for these exemptions is determined based on the previous three-year period. The provision repeals the 80/20 company rules and makes a technical correction to foreign compliance provisions. It includes a new test for existing 80/20 companies and excludes interest on existing obligations. The provision aims to address international tax evasion and avoidance. The provision in P.L. 111-226 includes various foreign tax issues. Dividends, interest, and service payments are sourced differently. Guarantee fees are treated like interest, sourced to the payor's residence. Foreign persons' payments are U.S. source if connected to U.S. business income. Treasury will identify similar transactions. The provision is expected to raise $2.025 billion over 10 years. The proposal aims to raise $2.025 billion over 10 years through boot-within-gain revisions applicable to domestic and foreign activities. Capital gains are recognized when selling stock and using the proceeds to purchase other stocks. Gain is not recognized in stock exchanges during corporate reorganizations unless cash or property (boot) is involved. If the boot exceeds the gain, not all of it will be taxed, but if considered a dividend, it will be fully taxed. Termination of interest (liquidation) can prevent boot from being treated as a dividend. The proposal aims to raise $3.6 billion from FY2015 to FY2024 by treating certain transactions as dividends, potentially reducing U.S. tax for foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms. This provision was included in President Obama's budget proposals related to multinational corporations. The international proposals in the budget address multinational corporations, including allocation of deductions and credits, restrictions on foreign tax credits, and individual tax evasion. These provisions are projected to raise $276 billion from FY2015 to FY2024. President Obama also proposed additional resources for IRS international enforcement. President Obama presented a corporate tax reform proposal with international provisions, including elements like interest allocation for deferred income, a tax on excess intangibles, a minimum tax on foreign source income in low tax countries, and incentives for moving operations to the United States. Some of these proposals were enacted, such as provisions related to foreign tax credits in P.L. 111-226 and the HIRE Act. The FY2010 budget proposal included a significant provision targeting hybrid entities and check-the-box rules, aiming to prevent corporations from disregarding subsidiary corporations in different jurisdictions. This provision was projected to raise $86.5 billion for FY2010-FY2019 but was not included in later budgets. The tax reform proposals in 2007 aimed to deny deductions and credits until income is repatriated, with disallowed deductions like interest until repatriation. The foreign tax credit allocation rule would allow credits for repatriated foreign income. Deductions for research and experimentation were excluded from the rule. Later budget proposals focused on interest deductions with different allocation rules, projecting a revenue gain of $43.2 billion for FY2015-FY2024. The proposal aims to treat excess returns in a low-tax country on intangibles transferred from the United States as Subpart F income, projected to raise $26.0 billion for FY2015-FY2024. It clarifies rules on intangibles, including workforce in place, goodwill, and going concern value, and allows aggregation of intangibles for a more appropriate value. The proposal includes provisions to disallow deductions for reinsurance premiums exceeding 50% of basic premiums, allocate interest deductions among related firms based on earnings share, and clarify valuation of intangibles at their highest and best value. These measures are projected to raise significant revenue for FY2015-FY2024. The proposal aims to raise $48.6 billion for FY2015-FY2024 by taxing distributions characterized as reorganizations but acting as dividend repatriation. It includes provisions related to stock exchanges, boot within gain, and restrictions on foreign tax credits for dual-capacity taxpayers. This proposal was projected to raise $297 million from FY2010 to FY2019 and is part of the broader budget provision in H.R. 4213. The provision in the curr_chunk relates to taxes being substituted for royalties in oil-producing countries and includes measures to address gain on sale of a partnership interest and treatment of payments as dividends. It is projected to raise $10.4 billion for FY2015-FY2024. The provision in the FY2013 budget outline extends rules limiting foreign tax credits for asset acquisitions, projected to raise $1 billion for FY2015-FY2024. It also reduces foreign tax credits for actions that reduce earnings and profits, projected to raise $0.4 billion. Additionally, it introduces a new category of Subpart F income for digital activities, projected to raise $11.7 billion. The proposal aims to raise revenue by taxing income from digital activities conducted by related parties, including foreign base company sales income and income from property manufactured outside the firm's jurisdiction. It also targets deductions for interest and royalty payments made to related parties under hybrid arrangements. This provision is expected to generate $24.6 billion from FY2015-FY2024. The proposal aims to address tax implications for foreign reverse hybrids and inversions by ensuring that U.S. firms merging with foreign entities are treated as U.S. firms if certain ownership conditions are met. It also aims to prevent inversions if the new firm has significant business activities in the U.S. and is primarily managed there. This provision is projected to raise $1.3 billion for FY2025-FY2024. The proposal aims to extend inversion rules to all partnerships, projected to raise $17 billion. President's proposals include provisions on individual evasion, projected to raise $8.7 billion in FY2010-FY2019 and $5.4 billion in FY2011-FY2021. These provisions were adopted in the HIRE Act, including increased reporting on foreign accounts. Financial intermediaries and qualified intermediaries would be required to report financial information. Financial intermediaries and qualified intermediaries must report financial transfers and the formation of foreign entities. The reporting threshold was $10,000 in the FY2010 budget proposal and increased to $50,000 in the FY2011 proposal. The HIRE Act required individuals with foreign accounts over $50,000 to report on their tax return. The FY2010 proposal included evidentiary presumptions for civil and administrative cases related to foreign accounts. The failure to file over $200,000 is presumed willful, leading to criminal and civil penalties. Payments to foreign persons on FDAP are not eligible for withholding. The statute of limitations for cross-border transactions is extended to six years. Major revisions to corporate international tax rules are proposed in S. 3018 and S. 727. These bills eliminate tax deferral on foreign income to prevent profit shifting. The Camp proposal and S. 2091 both aim to shift from deferral to a territorial tax system, limiting profit shifting benefits. The Camp proposal includes anti-base-erosion options and limits borrowing by U.S. parent companies. S. 2091 is a stand-alone territorial tax provision. Option A proposes taxing excess earnings on intangibles in low-tax jurisdictions, similar to a previous proposal by President Obama. Option B suggests taxing income with a foreign tax rate below 10%, unless it qualifies for a home country exception. Option C would tax all foreign income from intangibles but allow a deduction, resulting in a 15% tax rate. Option C was adopted in the final tax reform bill, H.R. 1, which also lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate to 25%. S. 2091 does not have provisions restricting borrowing. The bill S. 2091 proposes a 25% U.S. corporate tax rate and includes anti-base-erosion provisions. Income in countries with tax rates lower than 17.5% would be subject to tax, except for operations conducting active business. Intangible income of Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFC) would be considered Subpart F income. The bill also includes a 17.5% tax rate on intangible income earned by domestic corporations. The bill S. 2091 proposes a 25% U.S. corporate tax rate and includes anti-base-erosion provisions. Intangible income of Controlled Foreign Corporations would be considered Subpart F income. The bill also includes a 17.5% tax rate on intangible income earned by domestic corporations. Senator Carl Levin and Representative Lloyd Doggett introduced bill S. 506 and H.R. 1265 in the 111th Congress, with provisions later included in the HIRE Act. Provisions in the Stop Tax Haven Abuse addressed in the HIRE Act include burden of proof, statute of limitations, information reporting on U.S. beneficiaries of foreign accounts, trust abuses, treatment of dividend equivalents, and passive foreign investment corporations. Section 101 of the bill addresses burden of proof changes for taxpayers in offshore secrecy jurisdictions, requiring evidence to show funds are not taxable income. It also lists tax haven jurisdictions and gives Treasury authority to add or remove jurisdictions. An important standard for exclusion is an effective exchange of information. Section 102 expands provisions in the Patriot Act related to domestic financial institutions and foreign jurisdictions. Section 103 of the bill targets shell corporations in foreign jurisdictions to prevent impeding U.S. tax enforcement. Section 104 extends the audit period to six years for offshore jurisdictions with secrecy laws. Section 105 requires U.S. financial institutions to report foreign accounts held by U.S. persons. The legislation requires foreign financial institutions to report 1099 forms for any foreign account owned by a U.S. person. It addresses trust abuses by attributing powers held by trust protectors to the trust grantor and treating any U.S. person benefitting from a trust as a beneficiary. Legal opinions are required to be more likely than not to survive IRS challenge to shield taxpayers from penalties. The legislation requires foreign financial institutions to report 1099 forms for any foreign account owned by a U.S. person and addresses trust abuses. Legal opinions are required to shield taxpayers from penalties. Section 108 prevents dividend equivalents from escaping the dividend withholding tax, while Section 109 addresses reporting by PFICs. Section 204 deals with IRS John Doe summons in cases involving offshore secret accounts. Some sections of the bill affect securities law rather than tax issues. Section 205 of the bill addresses issues related to the Foreign Bank and Financial Account Report (FBAR) requirement for individuals controlling foreign financial accounts over $10,000. It amends tax disclosure rules to allow the IRS to use tax data more easily, change penalties based on the highest average account balance in a year, and grant access to Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR). The bill includes provisions related to abusive tax shelters, such as strengthening penalties, prohibiting patenting of tax shelters, requiring examination procedures for detecting questionable tax activities, disallowing fees contingent on tax savings, removing communication barriers between enforcement agencies, codifying regulations, clarifying disclosure prohibition by tax preparers, providing standards for tax shelter opinion letters, and codifying the economic substance doctrine. It also extends sanctions for money laundering to impeding tax enforcement and strengthens and clarifies FATCA. Section 102 of the bill strengthens and clarifies FATCA by imposing additional burden of proof requirements and expanding disclosure of accounts. Section 105 would tax credit default swap payments as U.S. income. Section 106 treats funds in U.S. accounts as U.S. source income subject to tax. Other sections include requiring multinational corporations to provide country by country information and imposing penalties for hiding offshore stock holdings. The final title of the bill relates to abusive tax shelters and is similar to provisions in previous legislation. H.R. 1554, introduced by Representative Doggett, is similar to the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act in the 112th Congress. S. 1533, introduced by Senator Levin, and H.R. 3666, introduced by Representatives DeLauro and Doggett, differ in some respects from H.R. 1554. The bills include changes in the treatment of multinationals, such as the allocation of expenses and foreign tax credit. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act proposed changes in the treatment of multinationals, including expense allocation, foreign tax credit pooling, and limitations on income shifting. Representative Doggett and Senator Whitehouse introduced the bill in January 2014, with similarities to S. 1533 and H.R. 3666. The proposal also addressed the treatment of inversions and included provisions from a draft circulated in 2009. The Sullivan proposal included key changes such as extending the statute of limitations, requiring FBAR information to be filed with tax returns, increasing trust penalties, and expanding the definition of distributions. It also required entities transferring funds offshore to report to the IRS and increased penalties for underpayments associated with foreign accounts. Tax preparers would need to ask due diligence questions to determine FBAR filing requirements. The foreign trust failure-to-file penalty would be raised to a minimum of $10,000. The penalty for foreign trusts would be increased to a $10,000 minimum and the definition of property considered a distribution would be expanded to include artwork and jewelry. Fines and penalties for offshore transactions would be doubled. Offshore entities hiring workers under a government contract would be treated as American employers. The proposal also included applying the international money laundering statute to tax evasion and allocating funds for the Justice Department to pursue financial fraud. The bill introduced in the 111th Congress aims to establish uniform requirements for states regarding the disclosure of beneficial owners of corporations and LLCs, with penalties for non-U.S. citizens. It also includes a study on requirements for partnerships and trusts. This bill addresses concerns about states being used as tax havens. In the 113th Congress, various bills were introduced to make changes to tax laws affecting foreign source income. In the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to make changes in tax laws regarding foreign source income, including treating firms managed in the U.S. as domestic, repealing deferral, imposing limits on foreign tax credits, and addressing issues with firms inverting via merger. In the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to address tax laws on foreign source income, including mergers with U.S. firms. H.R. 4679, S. 2360, H.R. 4985, and S. 2489 included various provisions, with S. 268 incorporating many Stop Tax Havens Abuse legislation provisions but not the fundamental changes in the Sanders bill (S. 250)."
