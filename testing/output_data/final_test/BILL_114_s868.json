The \"American Hostages in Iran Compensation Fund\" is established in the Treasury to make payments to American hostages in Iran and their families. It also aims to satisfy claims against Iran related to the hostage-taking between 1979 and 1981. A surcharge of 30 percent is imposed to fund the compensation. A surcharge of 30 percent is imposed on fines or penalties for violations of specified laws or regulations committed after the enactment of the Act, or on settlement amounts related to suspected violations of these laws or regulations. A 30 percent surcharge is imposed on fines or penalties for violations of certain laws related to Iran, collected by the Department of State, Treasury, Justice, Commerce, or Energy. The surcharge ends when all specified amounts are distributed. The Treasury Secretary deposits collected surcharges into a fund for distribution. The surcharge imposed on fines or penalties must be paid to the Secretary of the Treasury, regardless of how the fine or penalty is paid. Amounts in the Fund are available for payments under subsection (c). Administration of fund from the Fund shall be overseen by the Secretary of the Treasury and designated representatives of the proposed class. Payments will be made to living former hostages at $10,000 per day of captivity and to the estates of deceased former hostages. The Fund will provide payments to former hostages and their families based on the number of days in captivity. Payments will be distributed in order of priority to living former hostages, the estates of deceased former hostages, and spouses and children of former hostages.

Payments are prioritized for living former hostages, estates of deceased former hostages, and spouses and children of former hostages. Recipients must consent to receive payments, and upon payment, they are precluded from filing actions against Iran for claims related to the events. All claims against Iran are waived and released once all payments are made. Any remaining funds are deposited into the Treasury. Any remaining funds in the Fund will be deposited into the Treasury after all payments have been made to recipients. The date for depositing the remaining funds is determined as the later of when all payments have been made or 5 years after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, a report to Congress must be submitted within 60 days after the termination or suspension of specified laws or regulations. If the fund is insufficient to pay all recipients within 444 days of the Act's enactment, the Secretary of State must recommend ways to expedite the payments to Congress."
