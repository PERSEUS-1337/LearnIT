The \"Iran Nuclear Agreement Accountability Act\" mandates that the President must submit any nuclear agreement with Iran to Congress within three days of conclusion. Congressional committees have 15 days to review the agreement and may hold hearings or briefings. During the 15-day period after the review, a joint resolution of approval or disapproval can be introduced in the House of Representatives or the Senate without amendments. The process involves introducing a joint resolution of approval or disapproval in the Senate or House of Representatives, which will be referred to the respective committees for consideration and floor debate. The joint resolution of approval or disapproval in the House of Representatives and the Senate is subject to the same rules as joint resolutions under section 152, with some modifications such as a shorter time frame for subsection (c)(1) and a different committee for subsection (f)(1)(A)(i). The subsection on rules of the House of Representatives and the Senate is enacted by Congress as part of their rulemaking power, applicable only to the procedure for joint resolutions and supersedes other rules if inconsistent. The subsection on rules of the House of Representatives and the Senate allows for the constitutional right of either House to change rules related to their procedures at any time.
