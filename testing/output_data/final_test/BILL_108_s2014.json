    "content": "The \"Electric Reliability Act of 2004\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Federal Power Act by adding a section on electric reliability standards. The Electric Reliability Act of 2004 defines key terms like bulk-power system, electric reliability organization, and reliability standard to ensure the reliable operation of the interconnected transmission and generating facilities. The Act grants the Commission jurisdiction over entities involved in maintaining the reliability of the bulk-power system within the United States. The Electric Reliability Act of 2004 grants the Commission jurisdiction over entities involved in maintaining the reliability of the bulk-power system. Users, owners, and operators must comply with reliability standards. The Commission will promulgate a final rule for certification as an electric reliability organization within 180 days of enactment. The Commission may certify an applicant if they can develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulk-power system, ensure independence from system users, owners, and operators, and have fair stakeholder representation in decision-making structures. The Commission certifies applicants based on their ability to develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulk-power system, ensure independence, fair stakeholder representation, and provide fair enforcement procedures. The Commission certifies applicants based on their ability to develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulk-power system. If multiple applications are received, the Commission will approve the one that best implements the section. An electric reliability organization must file proposed reliability standards with the Commission for approval if they are just, reasonable, not discriminatory, and in the public interest. The Commission must consider technical expertise from electric reliability organizations for proposed standards but cannot defer on competition effects. There are rebuttable presumptions for proposals from interconnection-wide organizations. The Commission may remand proposed reliability standards that are disapproved and can order submissions for specific matters. The Commission can enforce penalties on users, owners, or operators of a bulk-power system for violating approved reliability standards. The Commission may affirm, set aside, or modify the action taken by an electric reliability organization. The Commission has the authority to order compliance with reliability standards and impose penalties on users, owners, or operators of a bulk-power system for violations. Regulations allow delegation of authority to a regional entity for proposing and enforcing reliability standards. The Commission can delegate authority to a regional entity for proposing and enforcing reliability standards, with requirements for effective administration of bulk-power system reliability. The electric reliability organization and the Commission will presume delegation to an interconnection-wide regional entity. The Commission may delegate authority to a regional entity for enforcing reliability standards to ensure compliance with regulations. Compliance actions can be taken against the electric reliability organization or regional entity if necessary. Changes in Electricity Reliability Organization rules can be made as needed. Changes in Electricity Reliability Organization rules require filing proposed rules with the Commission for approval, which can also be initiated by the Commission itself. The rules must be just, reasonable, non-discriminatory, in the public interest, and meet specific requirements. Coordination with Canada and Mexico is also recognized. The electric reliability organization aims to gain recognition in Canada and Mexico and enter into international agreements with their governments for compliance with reliability standards. It conducts assessments of the interconnected bulk-power system in North America and has authority to enforce compliance with standards for reliable operation. The electric reliability organization does not have the authority to order additional generation or transmission capacity, or establish and enforce compliance with standards for adequacy or safety of electric facilities or services. States can still take action to ensure safety, adequacy, and reliability of electric service within their borders as long as it aligns with reliability standards. The Commission will issue a final order determining if a State action is inconsistent with a reliability standard, with the ability to stay the effectiveness of the State action. The term 'antitrust laws' is defined in this subsection. The Clayton Act defines the term 'antitrust laws' to include specific sections related to unfair competition. Certain activities related to developing and enforcing reliability standards are not automatically deemed illegal under antitrust laws, but are subject to the rule of reason. The Clayton Act includes provisions on unfair competition and antitrust laws. Activities related to reliability standards are judged based on reasonableness and factors affecting competition. Regional advisory bodies are established by the Commission upon petition from at least two-thirds of states in a region with over half of their electric loads served within the region. These bodies consist of one member from each participating state, appointed by the state's Governor, and may include representatives from agencies, states, and provinces outside the US. The regional advisory body can provide advice on governance, proposed standards, fees, and other responsibilities to the electric reliability organization, regional reliability entity, or the Commission. The regional advisory body can provide advice on governance, standards, fees, and other responsibilities to the electric reliability organization, regional reliability entity, or the Commission. The Commission may defer to the advice of a regional advisory body organized on an interconnection-wide basis. This section does not apply to Alaska or Hawaii."
