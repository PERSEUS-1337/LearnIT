    "content": "The Act titled \"Restoring the Social Security COLA Act\" increases monthly cash benefits for one month payable in 2010. The \"Restoring the Social Security COLA Act\" increases monthly cash benefits by $250 for individuals entitled to benefits under specific Federal programs. The \"Restoring the Social Security COLA Act\" increases monthly cash benefits by $250 for individuals entitled to benefits under specific Federal programs, with the applicable increase month defined as the first month after a specified timeframe. The increase is restricted to one month and individuals will receive a written notice regarding the benefit increase. The \"Restoring the Social Security COLA Act\" provides a one-time $250 increase in monthly cash benefits for individuals entitled to specific Federal programs in the applicable increase month. If an individual receives multiple benefits, the increase applies to the total amount received for that month. The increase in monthly cash benefits provided under the \"Restoring the Social Security COLA Act\" is disregarded for determining reductions in benefits under Federal programs for the applicable increase month and the following 9 months. The increase in monthly cash benefits under the \"Restoring the Social Security COLA Act\" is not considered for federal retirement purposes or taxation. It also does not result in additional payments if the monthly cash benefit is not otherwise payable. The monthly cash benefit may be suspended or reduced if the individual is confined in a penal institution, fails to make child support payments, or is an alien not lawfully present in the US. The funding for the program is outlined in Section 3. Effective February 1, 2010, a portion of unobligated discretionary appropriations from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 will be rescinded to offset increased spending. The rescission will be applied proportionately to each discretionary account and within each account to programs, projects, and activities as specified in the relevant fiscal year's appropriation Act or President's budget. The OMB Report must be submitted by March 1, 2010, detailing the reductions made to each account, program, project, and activity as part of the budget rescission process."
