This reduction in debt balances was influenced by declines in household income and net worth, prompting households to lower debt service obligations and improve their balance sheets. Deleveraging could impact job creation and economic recovery by reducing consumption, a significant driver of GDP. Deleveraging can hinder economic recovery by causing loan defaults, weakening the banking system, and reducing consumer spending and lending. This, in turn, makes fiscal policy less effective in stimulating the economy. Policy initiatives like HARP and the Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act aim to facilitate mortgage refinancing to help homeowners. Households may have more discretionary income from lower mortgage rates through refinancing, potentially stimulating economic growth. Some choose to pay down debt instead of increasing spending. Policies promoting consumption could enhance future borrowing capacity if households continue to deleverage. Data shows household deleveraging since 2008, influenced by changes in consumer demand and lending supply. Changes in consumer demand and lending supply have impacted households' ability to repay loans. Job losses and declining wealth have made it difficult for households to secure new loans. Lenders have raised standards due to rising loan losses, affecting the Federal Reserve's household debt service burden ratio. This ratio reflects the percentage of income needed for debt repayments, which has fluctuated over time. Household debt service burden ratio (DSR) is influenced by changes in household income and interest rates. Rising incomes and falling interest rates lead to a decrease in DSR. However, during the 2007-2009 recession, DSR declined due to households deleveraging and refinancing debt at lower rates. Household debt balances include mortgages, credit card debt, and nonrevolving credit like auto and student loans. Household debt usage declined significantly post-2008, unlike previous recessions. Mortgage debt, the largest share of household debt, saw a decrease, mainly due to declining home equity loan balances. Revolving credit card debt also decreased during this period. Household deleveraging post-2008 recession led to a decline in consumer credit usage. Factors influencing this include unemployment spikes, declining home values, and lenders becoming more reluctant to make loans due to high loan losses. Trigger events like a steep rise in unemployment can lead to greater loan defaults. During the 2007-2009 recession, trigger events like a sharp rise in unemployment and a decline in household net worth led to income disruptions and difficulties in repaying credit obligations. Household net worth fell for seven consecutive quarters, mainly due to declines in real estate assets. The decline in household net worth during the 2007-2009 recession was mainly due to real estate assets financed through borrowing. House prices started falling in 2007, leading to many homeowners being underwater on their mortgages. Research shows that changes in real estate values have a greater impact on consumer spending and borrowing compared to stock values. This is because most households buy stocks with cash, avoiding debt obligations if stock prices fall. Stock market declines are usually short-lived, while real estate value declines prompt longer-term financial reassessments. Household deleveraging may occur due to declining real estate asset values leading to permanent wealth reductions, impacting repayment of existing debt obligations. Precautionary savings motive may influence households to reduce borrowing when wealth drops, changing consumption behavior until desired wealth levels are restored. Household deleveraging may occur due to declining real estate asset values, leading to a decrease in borrowing and an increase in saving until desired wealth levels are restored. Cash-in mortgage refinancings became more common than cash-out refinancings by 2008, indicating a shift towards reducing outstanding mortgage balances. This trend continued into mid-2010, with a corresponding reduction in home equity loan balances used for various borrowing purposes. The increase in cash-in refinances reflects households' precautionary savings behavior in response to economic uncertainty caused by job losses. Risky mortgage practices before the 2007-2009 recession may lead to defaults if income streams are disrupted and housing assets cannot be sold to pay off mortgage balances. The 2007-2009 recession led to borrowers receiving mortgages based on house price growth rather than income growth, resulting in increased defaults on all types of loans. Charge-off rates for residential mortgages, credit card debt, and consumer loans rose due to relaxed underwriting standards and the downturn in house prices. Household deleveraging may also be influenced by a reduction in credit supply. Household deleveraging may be impacted by a decrease in credit supply, as rising loan losses make lenders more cautious about extending new credit. Banks struggling to rebuild loan loss reserves and capital reserves may be unable to make new loans. This reflects both decreasing supply and demand for credit, with lenders tightening underwriting standards and restricting new lending. The Federal Reserve's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices tracks changes in lending standards and terms, as well as loan demand. The graph from 1996 to 2011 shows loan officers tightening credit standards for consumer loans, with the most significant changes starting in 2007."
