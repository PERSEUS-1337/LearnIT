    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1363 of the Government Code is amended regarding the filing of oaths of office for various officers. Oaths must be filed with the Secretary of State or county clerk, depending on the officer's jurisdiction. Judges, county clerks, and court administrators must file a copy of their official oath with the Secretary of State. The board of supervisors of a county may require elected or appointed officers to file a new oath of office within 10 days of any legal changes. The county can keep a record of compliance, which is subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act. Every oath of office filed with the Secretary of State must include the officer's term expiration date. Failure to file a new oath of office as required by the board of supervisors is not punishable as a crime. If an appointed officer leaves office before the expiration date, the appointing authority must report the departure date to the Secretary of State. The board of supervisors of a county may require the appointing authority to rescind powers of an officer in writing. The oath of a disaster service worker must be filed within 30 days as per State Personnel Board rule. Oaths for county and city disaster service workers have specific filing locations. The board of supervisors of a county may require disaster service workers to file a new oath if they legally change their name within 10 days. The county can keep a record of those who have complied with this requirement, which is subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act. Section 24102 of the Government Code is amended to specify the requirements for an appointee to act as a deputy, including filing a written appointment with the county clerk, providing a copy to the county auditor if requested, and taking the oath of office. Failure to file a new oath of office as a disaster service worker will not be punishable as a crime, and oaths may be destroyed five years after service termination. The board of supervisors may require appointed deputies to file a new appointment within 10 days of any changes. Revocation of appointment must be done in the same manner as the appointment. After five years, the written oath of office may be destroyed. The act does not require reimbursement as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions, as defined by the Government Code and California Constitution."
