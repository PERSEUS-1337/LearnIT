The Medicare IVIG Access Act of 2007 acknowledges the importance of IVIG as a therapy for various diseases and conditions. Each brand of IVIG is recognized as a unique biologic by the FDA due to differences in fractionation and purification processes. The report by ASPE in May 2007 highlighted the complexity of IVIG manufacturing, requiring upfront investment and taking 7-12 months from plasma collection to FDA approval. Medicare changed reimbursement for IVIG in 2003 from AWP to improve access. The ASPE report in May 2007 discussed the shift in IVIG reimbursement methodology from AWP to ASP+6, effective in 2005 for physicians and 2006 for hospital outpatient departments. The change aimed to reduce reimbursement rates for IVIG providers, as highlighted in an OIG report from April 2007. The OIG report found that Medicare reimbursement for IVIG was insufficient to cover costs for many providers, with a significant percentage of sales occurring above Medicare payment amounts. The ASPE report highlighted a shift in IVIG treatment settings from physician offices to hospitals, impacting continuity of care and health outcomes. The OIG found that 61% of physicians sent patients to hospitals due to high IVIG prices, leading some to stop providing IVIG to Medicare beneficiaries. The OIG's 2007 report warned that any improvement in Medicare reimbursement for IVIG could be lost if manufacturers raised prices. CMS provided extra payments to compensate for difficulties in obtaining IVIG. Around 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries receive IVIG. Approximately 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries receive IVIG treatment for primary immunodeficiency disease. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 established an IVIG home infusion benefit, covering only the cost of IVIG and excluding infusion services. The ASPE report found that Medicare's IVIG home infusion benefit does not reimburse for infusion services. Access to home infusion of IVIG for PIDD patients is limited due to providers not accepting new patients with only Medicare coverage. This is because providers struggle to acquire IVIG at affordable prices and are not reimbursed for infusion services. Improving access to home infusion for PIDD patients can reduce infections and enhance their overall care and health. SEC. 3. MEDICARE PAYMENT FOR IMMUNE GLOBULINS. The Medicare IVIG Access Act of 2007 amended Section 1842(o)(1)(E) of the Social Security Act to collect data on payments to physicians for immune globulins and review costs incurred by physicians for furnishing these products. The Medicare IVIG Access Act of 2007 amended Section 1842(o)(1)(E) of the Social Security Act to review data on physician payments for immune globulins and provide additional payments to physicians for furnishing these products. The Medicare IVIG Access Act of 2007 amended Section 1833(t)(14) of the Social Security Act to provide additional payment for immune globulins as part of hospital outpatient services. The Medicare IVIG Access Act of 2007 requires the Secretary to review data on access to immune globulins and collect information on payment differences for these products. Additionally, the Act grants additional payment authority after the review and data collection. The Medicare IVIG Access Act of 2007 mandates the Secretary to review and collect data on immune globulins payment differences. Within 7 months of enactment, hospitals may receive additional payment for immune globulins furnished as part of covered OPD services. The Secretary will continue the preadministration-related services payment for immune globulins furnished on or after January 1, 2007, until a new payment methodology is implemented. SEC. 4. COVERAGE AND PAYMENT OF INTRAVENOUS IMMUNE GLOBULIN IN THE HOME. Coverage of intravenous immune globulin in the home is expanded to include administration services, regardless of eligibility for home health services. Individuals receiving globulin are not eligible for home health services related to the administration of the derivative. Payment for intravenous immune globulin administration in the home will be reviewed by the Secretary to determine appropriate payment amounts for providers. This includes considering data from studies on safety, access, and cost issues related to administering intravenous immune globulin at home. The Secretary will review payment amounts for providers of intravenous immune globulin in the home setting to ensure safe delivery, with amendments applying to services provided on or after January 1, 2008. SEC. 5. PATIENT ACCESS SURVEYS AND REPORTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct surveys of Medicare and non-Medicare patients needing immune globulins to assess changes in patient access and healthcare status. Survey reports will be submitted to Congress based on the findings. The Secretary will submit reports to Congress with recommendations on adjusting Medicare payments for immune globulins to ensure beneficiary access. The first report is due within 2 years of the Act's enactment, and the second report within 4 years."
