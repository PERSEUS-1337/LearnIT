    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 is no longer necessary as the Government of Iraq that posed a threat has been removed and the current Government of Iraq does not pose a threat to the United States or its interests. After more than four years of efforts by the Armed Forces and civilians, the Government of Iraq is now responsible for Iraq's future course. The sense of Congress is stated in Section 2. The sense of Congress is that robust contingency planning by the Department of Defense is necessary, particularly for a redeployment of the Armed Forces from Iraq, focusing on protection for military personnel, civilians, contractors, and nationals who have assisted the US mission in Iraq, as well as disrupting Al Qaeda. The United States Government aims to eliminate and disrupt Al Qaeda and affiliated terrorist organizations while preserving military equipment for national security interests. Contingency planning for a redeployment of the Armed Forces from Iraq includes outlining possible scenarios, timetables, and missions for the remaining forces in Iraq. The United States aims to conduct counterterrorism operations against Al Qaeda in Iraq and affiliated terrorist organizations, protect military facilities and civilians, and support Iraqi forces for their security. SEC. 3. REPORTS AND CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFINGS ON THE STATUS OF PLANNING FOR THE REDEPLOYMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES FROM IRAQ. The Secretary of Defense must provide reports every 90 days on the planning for redeployment of Armed Forces from Iraq to congressional defense committees. The reports should be unclassified, with a possible classified annex, and briefings with senior officials of the Department of Defense are required within 14 days of each report submission. The Secretary of Defense must meet with congressional defense committees to brief them on the report contents. Reporting and briefing requirements end when the Secretary certifies in writing that the Armed Forces are no longer primarily engaged in combat in Iraq. Congressional defense committees are defined as per section 101 of title 10, United States Code. SEC. 4. ARMED FORCES DEFINED as per section 101 of title 10, United States Code."
