Attempts to regulate usurious interest rates have been ongoing in America since colonial times. Currently, 15 states and the District of Columbia have implemented usury laws to protect borrowers from high-cost payday loans, while 34 states have capped annual interest rates at 36 percent or lower for certain types of consumer credit. Despite federal efforts in 2006 to limit interest rates for service members and their families, high-cost lending continues to persist in all 50 states. High-cost lending persists in all 50 states due to loopholes in state laws, safe harbor laws, and unregulated interest rates. Consumers pay billions annually for high-cost loans with exorbitant interest rates, including payday loans, car title loans, bank overdraft loans, tax refund anticipation loans, and credit cards with junk fees. A national maximum interest rate is needed to eliminate predatory lending, including credit cards with junk fees. Encouraging alternatives like small dollar loans with minimal fees and affordable repayment plans is crucial. SEC. 3. NATIONAL MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE.

Late fees are capped at $20 per late payment or per month, while insufficient funds fees are limited to $15. Adjustments for inflation may be made by the Board.
