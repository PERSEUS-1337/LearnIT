    "title": "SB 261",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3051 of the Penal Code is amended to allow for youth offender parole hearings for prisoners under 23 at the time of their controlling offense. \"Incarceration\" is defined as detention in various facilities, and \"controlling offense\" refers to the offense with the longest prison term imposed by the sentencing court. A person convicted of a controlling offense before age 23 may be eligible for parole after 15 years for determinate sentences or after 20 years for life terms less than 25 years to life, as per amended Penal Code Section 3051. A person convicted of a controlling offense before age 23 may be eligible for release on parole during their 25th year of incarceration at a youth offender parole hearing. The board shall conduct a youth offender parole hearing to consider release, acting in accordance with statutory provisions. The board must ensure that youth offender parole hearings provide a meaningful opportunity for release by reviewing and updating regulations. Psychological evaluations and risk assessments, administered by licensed psychologists, should consider the diminished culpability of juveniles and their growth and maturity. Family members, friends, school personnel, faith leaders, and community-based organizations can submit statements for review by the board regarding the individual's growth and maturity since the crime. The board will schedule a subsequent youth offender parole hearing if parole is not granted, considering factors outlined in the law. The board will complete youth offender parole hearings for individuals eligible before July 1, 2015, except for cases involving certain sentencing criteria or additional crimes committed after turning 23. The board will complete youth offender parole hearings for individuals with indeterminate life terms by July 1, 2017, and for those with determinate terms by July 1, 2021. Consultation must be conducted before July 1, 2017, for all individuals. Section 4801 of the Penal Code is amended. The Board of Parole Hearings may recommend commutation or pardon for prisoners based on good conduct, unusual sentence terms, or evidence of intimate partner battering and its effects, including physical, emotional, or mental abuse. The Board of Parole Hearings must consider intimate partner battering when reviewing a prisoner's suitability for parole. They must provide detailed reasons for their decision and report annually to the Legislature and Governor on these cases. When reviewing a prisoner's suitability for parole, the Board of Parole Hearings must consider intimate partner battering. If a prisoner committed their controlling offense before turning 23, the board should give weight to the diminished culpability of juveniles and any subsequent growth and maturity."
