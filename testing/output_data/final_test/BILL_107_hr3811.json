    "content": "The \"Health Information Independence Act of 2001\" includes sections on short title, reference, table of contents, findings, definitions, health claims, independent scientific review, legal effect of health claim recommendations, and Department of Health and Human Services budget allocation for independent scientific reviews. Congress finds that access to accurate information about the effect of nutrients on disease is crucial for informed consumer choice and public health. Despite court rulings, the FDA continues to suppress this information, hindering efforts to improve healthcare and promote the welfare of the American people. The FDA's bias against food and dietary supplement health claims goes against constitutional mandates and Congress's intent. Health claims evaluation should be handled by Independent Scientific Reviewers to ensure fairness and compliance with requirements. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term 'Independent Scientific Reviewer' is defined as a person with a Ph.D. or M.D. who has worked as a professor in relevant fields for at least 5 years, has no prior ties to the FDA or Department of Health and Human Services, except for reviewing health claim petitions. The Independent Scientific Reviewer must meet specific criteria, including having a Ph.D. or M.D., no prior ties to the FDA or Department of Health and Human Services, signing oaths to evaluate health claim petitions strictly, not discussing the petition with anyone, and providing a complete evaluation to the Secretary within 180 days. The Independent Scientific Reviewer must meet specific criteria, including having a Ph.D. or M.D., no prior ties to the FDA or Department of Health and Human Services, signing an oath to exercise independent professional judgment, free of any external influence or unscientific bias, and providing a complete evaluation to the Secretary within 180 days. SEC. 4. HEALTH CLAIMS. Section 403(r) (21 U.S.C. 343(r)) is amended to include dietary supplements and health-related conditions, and to specify that nutrients prevent, treat, or cure diseases. The Secretary must issue regulations within 30 days of receiving an evaluation from an Independent Scientific Reviewer authorizing claims on labels recommended for approval, with any recommended disclaimers. The Secretary's duties in this regard cannot be delegated. Clause (D) in subparagraph (4) is removed. SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC REVIEW. A new section is added to Chapter IV for independent scientific review. Sec. 403D of the Health Information Independence Act of 2001 mandates the Secretary to invite scientists from accredited universities to apply as Independent Scientific Reviewers every 180 days. Scientists with Ph.D. or M.D. qualifications and at least 5 years of professorship are eligible to apply. The Health Information Independence Act of 2001 mandates the Secretary to select Independent Scientific Reviewers to assess health claims filed with the FDA. Reviewers must evaluate scientific evidence on nutrient-disease associations and provide a written recommendation within 180 days. The Health Information Independence Act of 2001 requires Independent Scientific Reviewers to assess health claims for FDA approval. Reviewers must only reject claims if there is no credible scientific evidence supporting them and no accurate disclaimer to address potential misleading connotations. Recommended disclaimers should clarify the level of evidence supporting the claim. Independent Scientific Reviewers must complete reviews within 180 days of receiving a health claim petition. To qualify, reviewers must hold a Ph.D. or M.D., have 5 years of full-time employment as a professor in relevant fields, and have no prior ties to the FDA. Independent Scientific Reviewers must evaluate health claim petitions strictly according to specified criteria within 180 days. They must hold a Ph.D. or M.D., have 5 years of relevant professorial experience, and no prior connections to the FDA. Reviewers must not disclose their evaluation before submitting a complete written report to the Secretary. Independent Scientific Reviewers must evaluate health claim petitions according to specific criteria within 180 days. They must have a Ph.D. or M.D., 5 years of relevant professorial experience, and no prior FDA connections. Reviewers must provide a complete written evaluation with scientific evidence to the Secretary and exercise independent professional judgment. Failure to comply will result in disbarment from the program and no compensation. Confirmation of reviewer status must be done within 30 days of the Secretary's receipt of a request. The Secretary selects Independent Scientific Reviewers randomly to evaluate health claim petitions within 15 days of filing. The reviewer's identity remains confidential until the evaluation is complete. The Independent Scientific Reviewer evaluates all publicly available scientific evidence relevant to a health claim and recommends approval if credible scientific evidence supports it. If the evidence is inconclusive or suggestive but not conclusive, further evaluation is needed. The Independent Scientific Reviewer evaluates health claims based on credible scientific evidence. If evidence is inconclusive or potentially misleading, a concise disclaimer may be recommended for approved claims. If no credible evidence supports a claim and a disclaimer cannot eliminate misleading connotations, the claim may not be approved. The Secretary compensates Independent Scientific Reviewers and enforces sanctions for noncompliance. Sanctions for Noncompliance.-- The Secretary will pay Independent Scientific Reviewers $40,000 within 60 days of receiving all publicly available scientific evidence and a complete evaluation of the health claim. If an Independent Scientific Reviewer submits a false certification, the Secretary may debar them from the program and withhold the $40,000 fee. SEC. 6. Legal effect of health claim recommendations by independent scientific reviewers. New section added to Chapter IV regarding the legal implications of health claim recommendations. Sec. 403E requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make publicly available the evaluation and scientific evidence of health claims reviewed by Independent Scientific Reviewers within 30 days. The Secretary must publish the recommendation verbatim in the Federal Register, including whether the claim is approved or disapproved, reasons for the decision, and any required disclaimers. The order on health claims recommendations by Independent Scientific Reviewers can be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit within 90 days of publication in the Federal Register. The Department of Health and Human Services will cover all costs of implementing the Act from its existing budget. The Act eliminates the need for the FDA to review health claim petitions for foods and dietary supplements, requiring cost-saving measures within the FDA to offset implementation costs."
