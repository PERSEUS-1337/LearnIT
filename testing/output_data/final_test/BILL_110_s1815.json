    "content": "The Act titled \"All-Terrain Vehicle Standards and Compliance Act of 2007\" adopts the ANSI ATV standard as a consumer product safety standard. The Consumer Product Safety Commission must establish a safety standard for all-terrain vehicles based on the ANSI/SVIA 1-2001 publication, with modifications to the definition of an ATV and clear indication of it being a consumer product safety standard. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a safety standard for all-terrain vehicles based on ANSI/SVIA 1-2001 with necessary format changes. Certain provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act and title 5, United States Code, do not apply to this standard. The safety standard for all-terrain vehicles will be modified. The American National Standards Institute must notify the Commission of any modifications to the all-terrain vehicle standard. The Commission must take action within 120 days by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the ATV standard based on the modifications deemed relevant to safety. The Commission must amend the ATV standard within 180 days to reduce unreasonable risks of injury. Certain provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act do not apply to this amendment process. The ATV standard amendment must comply with chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 4. The ATV standard applies to all-terrain vehicles manufactured or imported for use in the United States more than 150 days after publication in the Federal Register. Compliant models can have additional features not covered by the standard. SEC. 5. Action plans are required. Each manufacturer or importer of an all-terrain vehicle must submit an action plan to the Commission for approval. The Commission must approve the plan in writing and may not unreasonably withhold approval. Existing action plans submitted before the enactment of this Act are deemed approved. Manufacturers or importers cannot distribute non-compliant all-terrain vehicles in commerce without complying with their approved action plan. Unless the manufacturer or importer complies with an approved action plan, new 3-wheeled all-terrain vehicles cannot be imported or distributed in the US. Violation of this rule is considered a violation of the Consumer Product Safety Act and can be enforced accordingly. Manufacturers or importers can amend approved action plans by notifying the Commission. The Commission must approve or disapprove proposed amendments to action plans within 60 days of notification. Failure to respond within this period results in automatic approval. If disapproved, the Commission must provide written reasons for the decision to the manufacturer or importer. The Commission's disapproval of a proposed amendment is considered final agency action for judicial review. If a manufacturer fails to comply with their action plan, the Commission can revoke its approval, leading to a halt in the distribution of the ATV. The Commission can revoke approval of an ATV manufacturer's action plan, but they can submit a new plan. If the Commission deems a specific requirement unnecessary for ATV safety, they can release the manufacturer from that obligation. SEC. 6. LABELING AND CERTIFICATION. All-terrain vehicles must have a permanent label certifying compliance with safety standards and identifying the manufacturer. SEC. 7. GAO STUDY. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the benefits and costs of all-terrain vehicles, including fatalities and injuries. Definitions will also be provided. The term \"action plan\" in this Act refers to a written document submitted by manufacturers or importers of all-terrain vehicles outlining safety measures such as rider training, safety information dissemination, age recommendations, marketing policies, sales monitoring, and other safety-related actions. The term \"all-terrain vehicle\" refers to a motorized off-highway vehicle designed for 3 or 4 wheels with a seat for the operator to straddle and handlebars for steering control, excluding prototypes. The term \"all-terrain vehicle\" refers to a motorized off-highway vehicle designed for 3 or 4 wheels with a seat for the operator to straddle and handlebars for steering control, excluding prototypes.
