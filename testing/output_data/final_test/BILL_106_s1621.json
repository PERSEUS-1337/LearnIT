    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Act of 1999\". Congress finds that the Lake Pontchartrain Basin is a large estuary draining 5,000 square miles from Louisiana and Mississippi, supporting diverse wildlife and serving as a primary seafood nursery. Urbanization, population growth, and various pollutants threaten its ecology and must be addressed for improvement. The Lake Pontchartrain Basin faces pollution challenges from fishing camps, residences, and inadequate sewage systems. Efforts by local government agencies like the Department of Environmental Quality of Louisiana and the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board aim to improve water quality in the Basin. Stormwater and sewage discharges are major sources of pollution in the area. The Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, University of New Orleans, and Regional Planning Commission are collaborating to restore water quality and habitats in the Basin. Federal agencies like the EPA and Army Corps are also involved in efforts to improve water quality. The Environmental Protection Agency, Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, and other agencies lack coordination and resources to address water quality issues in the Basin. The Act aims to coordinate restoration efforts, establish a restoration program, and provide resources for projects in the Basin. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include a new section focusing on the Lake Pontchartrain Basin. This aims to coordinate restoration efforts, establish a restoration program, and provide resources for projects in the Basin. The Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program is established by the Administrator within the Environmental Protection Agency, with definitions provided for key terms such as Basin, Council, Management plan, and Program. The Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program aims to coordinate efforts to reduce pollution and restore ecological health in the Basin. The Lake Pontchartrain Executive Council will be established to oversee the program, with key members including the Administrator, Governor of Louisiana, and Chairman of the Regional Council. The Lake Pontchartrain Executive Council, consisting of key members such as the Chairman of the Regional Planning Commission, the Chancellor of the University of New Orleans, and the Executive Director of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, will develop a comprehensive watershed management plan for the restoration and protection of the Basin with assistance from the Administrator and other authorities. Assistance provided by the Administrator includes grants for developing an annual work plan endorsed by the Council, supporting Basin-wide environmental monitoring and research, developing a comprehensive research plan, and recommending restoration. The Administrator provides funding and oversight for restoration projects in the Basin, including addressing human waste problems and assisting agricultural operators. The Administrator provides critical assistance to agricultural operators to address agricultural runoff, reroutes discharges through wetlands for natural filtration, improves water quality by eliminating sewage discharges and establishing new sanitation systems, and aims to reverse the trend of decreasing coastal acreage. The legislation aims to reverse the decreasing acreage of coastal wetlands by creating new sustainable habitats and preserving natural structural elements to reduce storm surge impacts. Authorization of appropriations is provided for priority funding for specific projects and to carry out the outlined objectives."
