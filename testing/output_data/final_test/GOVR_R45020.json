    "content": "This report provides an overview of U.S. immigration policy, covering entry policies, enforcement measures, and policies for unauthorized aliens residing in the country. It includes topics such as visa issuance, naturalization, detaining and removing foreign nationals, worksite enforcement, and immigration fraud. The primer may not cover all immigration-related topics and does not discuss specific policy issues or congressional concerns. The U.S. immigration policy is governed by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and implemented by executive branch agencies like DHS, DOS, and DOJ. The report discusses foreign-born populations with different legal statuses, including aliens who are not U.S. citizens. Legal aliens in the U.S. include immigrants and nonimmigrants, with immigrants being foreign nationals granted permanent residence and nonimmigrants being those temporarily admitted for specific purposes. Refugees and asylees are also considered legal aliens, fleeing persecution in their home countries. Refugees and asylees can eventually become lawful permanent residents. Noncitizens in the U.S. can adjust their status to lawful permanent resident (LPR) and become naturalized citizens through a process called naturalization. Unauthorized aliens are foreign nationals residing unlawfully in the U.S. Four principles guide permanent immigration: family reunification, U.S. labor market contribution, origin-country diversity, and humanitarian assistance. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) limits worldwide permanent immigration to 675,000 persons annually through family reunification, U.S. labor market contribution, origin-country diversity, and humanitarian assistance pathways. This includes 480,000 family-sponsored immigrants, 140,000 employment-based immigrants, and 55,000 diversity visa immigrants. The worldwide limit is considered a \"permeable cap\" due to exemptions for immediate relatives from numerical limits. The Immigration and Nationality Act sets a worldwide limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants annually, with exemptions for immediate relatives. Family-sponsored immigration includes immediate relatives such as spouses and minor unmarried children of U.S. citizens. Family-sponsored immigrants, including immediate relatives and preference immigrants, are subject to numerical limits. Immediate relatives have no limit on acquiring LPR status, while preference immigrants are capped at 226,000 per year with a 7% per-country limit. Family-sponsored immigrants have historically made up a significant portion of permanent immigration, while employment-based immigration is limited to five preference categories, including immigrant investors under the EB-5 visa program. Employment-based immigrants, including spouses and children of qualifying LPRs, are subject to a total annual admission limit of 140,000 and a 7% per-country cap. The high demand for immigrant visas in family-sponsored and employment-based categories often results in long waiting periods for approved applicants, especially from countries like Mexico, China, India, and the Philippines. As of November 1, 2017, there were 4.1 million approved family-sponsored and employment-based immigrants waiting for visas. The diversity immigrant visa program allows 50,000 visas annually for natives of countries with low immigration rates to the US. The diversity immigrant visa program allows 50,000 visas annually for natives of countries with low immigration rates to the US. Eligibility criteria include high school education or two years of work experience in a specific occupation. Winners are selected by lottery and must meet standard immigrant eligibility criteria. The US upholds the principle of not returning individuals to countries where their life or freedom is at risk, as defined in various INA provisions. A refugee is a person outside their home country due to persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. An asylee is similar but present in the US or at a border. Refugee admissions have numerical limits set annually by the President. For FY2018, the worldwide refugee ceiling was set at 45,000, allocated among world regions. Asylum is granted on a case-by-case basis and is not numerically limited. Aliens in the United States may apply for asylum affirmatively or defensively before an immigration judge. Aliens expressing fear of persecution receive a \"credible fear\" review and may be referred to an immigration judge for a hearing. Cancellation of removal is a discretionary relief granted by an immigration judge to aliens in removal proceedings who demonstrate ties to the US, good moral character, and no disqualifying criminal convictions. Grants are limited to 4,000 LPRs and 4,000 nonpermanent residents annually. U nonimmigrant visas are granted to victims who assist in investigating and prosecuting crimes like domestic violence and human trafficking. Recipients and their immediate family members can obtain LPR status. The annual limit for U visas is 10,000. T status is given to victims of severe human trafficking, allowing them to stay in the US for four years and apply for LPR status after three. Victims must be present in the US due to trafficking, cooperate with law enforcement, and be at risk of harm. To obtain LPR status, prospective immigrants must go through a multistep process involving federal departments and agencies. If already in the US legally, they adjust from temporary nonimmigrant status to LPR. If abroad, their petitions go to the Bureau of Consular Affairs after approval by USCIS. The consular officer or USCIS adjudicator must confirm the immigrant's entitlement to LPR status. Foreign nationals seeking immigrant status in the United States must meet specific criteria to ensure they are eligible for visas or admission under the INA's grounds for inadmissibility. The U.S. admits millions of nonimmigrants annually, including tourists, students, workers, diplomats, entertainers, and crew members. The Department of State issues 87 types of nonimmigrant visas within 24 categories, denoted by letter and numeral combinations (e.g., B-2 for tourists, E-2 for treaty investors). Applicants must demonstrate eligibility to consular officers or USCIS adjudicators. Nonimmigrant applicants must demonstrate eligibility for specific visas to DOS consular officers and CBP officers. They must show intent to stay temporarily and for a specific purpose, with restrictions on working in the U.S. Common nonimmigrant categories include B-1 business visitors, B-2 tourists, L intracompany transferees, H-1B professional workers, and J cultural exchange participants. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows nationals from certain countries to enter the United States without visas. In FY2016, millions of visitors entered the US using the VWP. Mexican citizens can apply for a border crossing card for short-term entry. In FY2017, 1.1 million Mexican nationals were issued border crossing cards for short-term entry into the United States. The BCC allows multiple entries and is usually valid for 10 years. BCC holders are limited to visits of up to 30 days within specific zones along the border. Visa issuance is required for all nonresident foreign nationals wishing to enter the US, with specific criteria for qualification. Visa applications to the United States can be denied for various reasons, including insufficient information, grounds of inadmissibility, and the presumption of seeking permanent residence. Consular officers must determine if a foreign national is eligible for a visa and may disqualify an applicant for noncompliance with immigration laws. All foreign nationals undergo admissibility reviews before a decision is made. Consular officers must assess if a foreign national is excludable under INA Section 212(a) for various reasons such as health, criminal, security concerns, public charge risk, illegal entry, and previous removal. Visa denials under INA Section 214(b) are common for nonimmigrant applicants who fail to show sufficient ties to their home country. All visa applicants must provide photographs and fingerprints. Visa applicants must submit photographs, fingerprints, and biographic information. Physical and mental examinations are required for some applicants. Consular officers make decisions on visa grants without judicial appeals. Temporary Protected Status and parole are options for legal stay in the US. Other options like Deferred Enforced Departure and deferred action are also available. Foreign nationals in the US during civil unrest or disasters may have special considerations. The INA allows DHS to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to foreign nationals from certain countries present in the United States for humanitarian reasons. TPS does not lead to permanent residency but allows for employment authorization. DHS can designate TPS for 6 to 18 months and may extend it based on country conditions. There are approximately 317,600 TPS recipients from 10 countries. DHS may also \"parole\" aliens into the US on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or public benefit. Parole is granted for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, allowing employment authorization for a specified period. It is not a formal immigration status and requires leaving when it expires or being admitted lawfully. Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) can become U.S. citizens through naturalization by meeting residency, moral character, English proficiency, and civics knowledge requirements. In 2016, there were 43.7 million foreign-born individuals in the U.S., with roughly half being naturalized citizens and the other half noncitizens. Immigration enforcement involves enforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act's civil and criminal provisions, including border security and worksite enforcement. It includes identifying, investigating, apprehending, prosecuting, and deporting foreign nationals who violate U.S. laws. Foreign nationals enter the U.S. at 329 ports of entry, where CBP officers ensure their eligibility. The CBP's enforcement mission is to ensure eligible entry into the US and exclude inadmissible foreign nationals. Possession of a visa does not guarantee admission. In FY2016, 390 million travelers entered the US, with 274,000 aliens denied admission and 21,000 arrested on criminal warrants. DHS uses a risk management strategy for screening at multiple points in the immigration process to balance facilitating lawful travelers with ensuring border security. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other departments use screening tools at U.S. Points of Entry (POEs) to distinguish between low-risk and high-risk travelers. DHS is responsible for implementing an electronic entry-exit system at POEs, but fully automating the biometric system has been challenging. Border security between POEs focuses on unauthorized land border entry, a concern since the 1970s and heightened after the September 11, 2001 attacks. CBP's unauthorized migration control strategy involves \"prevention through deterrence\" and \"enforcement with consequences,\" including criminal charges and penalties for migrants. Remote repatriation to geographically remote Mexican locations aims to disrupt smuggling networks and reduce reentry likelihood. Increased appropriations for personnel support these strategies. The United States has increased appropriations for border enforcement, including personnel, fencing, and surveillance technology, particularly after 2001. DHS has built 653 miles of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border since 1996. CBP uses various surveillance technologies. Unauthorized migrant apprehensions have fluctuated over the years, reaching peaks in 1986 and 2000 before falling to 310,531 in FY2017. The effectiveness of enforcement in reducing inflows is debated. The U.S. law allows for the detention of foreign nationals awaiting removal proceedings, with specific categories of aliens mandated for detention. Detention priorities are outlined in statutes and regulations, with recent legislative expansions. Detained aliens may be quickly returned to their country of origin through expedited removal. Aliens not subject to mandatory detention may be detained, paroled, or released on bond by DHS. In FY2016, DHS detained 352,880 noncitizens, with detention space increasing to 34,000 beds. Most detainees were prioritized for removal due to felony crimes or immigration violations. The U.S. Supreme Court limits detention of unauthorized foreign nationals to six months. ICE faces challenges in obtaining travel documents for repatriation, leading to the release of detainees, including criminal aliens, after their full detention term. The U.S. government has broad authority to remove foreign nationals who violate immigration laws, including unauthorized aliens and lawfully present individuals who commit certain removable acts. To deport a lawfully admitted alien, the government must prove violations of specific grounds of deportation outlined in the INA Section 237(a), such as criminal offenses or immigration status violations. The U.S. government has the authority to remove foreign nationals for various reasons, including criminal offenses, security risks, and becoming a public charge. The INA outlines procedures for removal, with some discretion allowed for DHS officials. Certain grounds for removal may be waived, but criminal or terrorist activities may lead to expedited removal processes. Under streamlined removal procedures, including expedited removal and reinstatement of removal, opportunities for relief and review are limited. Expedited removal allows for the removal of aliens lacking proper documentation or committing fraud without further hearings or review, unless they express an intention to stay. Following an order of removal, an alien is generally ineligible to return to the United States for a minimum of five years and possibly longer depending on the reason for and type of removal. Absent other factors, unlawful presence in the United States is a civil violation, not a criminal offense, and removal and its associated administrative processes are civil proceedings. Aliens in removal proceedings generally have no right to free government-provided counsel, although they may obtain counsel at their own expense. ICE prioritizes the removal of criminal aliens, who are noncitizens convicted of a crime in the US. Programs like the Criminal Alien Program (CAP) and National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP) target these individuals for removal. ICE collaborates with DOJ to screen for immigration and criminal violations. ICE's Section 287(g) program allows state and local law enforcement officers to assist in immigration enforcement under federal supervision. The INA provides options for removable aliens to stay in the US permanently or temporarily, including relief like cancellation of removal and defensive asylum. Employment of individuals without work authorization is prohibited by the INA. ICE's worksite enforcement program targets employers who hire unauthorized aliens, with penalties for violations including civil and criminal consequences. Immigration fraud includes document and benefit fraud, addressed by the INA through provisions for inadmissibility and civil enforcement. The INA addresses immigration fraud through provisions for inadmissibility and civil enforcement, including penalties for employers who hire unauthorized aliens. USCIS operates the SAVE system to verify immigration status for federal benefits eligibility. The unauthorized alien population in the United States is a divisive immigration issue facing Congress. Unauthorized aliens enter the country illegally or overstay visas, violating the INA. Demographers estimate the population size at around 11-12 million, with fluctuations over the years. The unauthorized alien population in the United States has fluctuated between 11.0 and 12.2 million since 2000. Scholars attribute the decline in illegal migration flows to factors such as increased border security and high U.S. unemployment. Options for addressing this population include encouraging departures or granting immigration benefits for legal status. Unauthorized aliens have no legal right to live or work in the U.S. and are subject to removal, but some limited forms of immigration relief are available under the INA. The INA provides limited immigration relief for unauthorized aliens, including crime victims and asylum seekers. Unauthorized aliens present in the US for 6-12 months face a 3-year bar on readmission, while those present for over a year face a 10-year bar. Deferred action is a discretionary mechanism allowing some unauthorized aliens to stay in the US, but it is not an immigration status and is based on administrative discretion. Deferred action may include DHS terminating removal proceedings, declining to initiate removal proceedings, or declining to execute a final order of removal. Approval of deferred action means no action will be taken against a removable alien for a specified time. DACA, initiated by the Obama Administration, grants certain individuals without lawful immigration status deferred action for two years, subject to renewal. DACA recipients can apply for employment authorization but do not have a pathway to legal immigration status. The Trump Administration announced the planned rescission of DACA on September 5, 2017, but it remains in effect due to federal court orders. Due to court orders enjoining the rescission, DACA remains in effect pending further litigation."
