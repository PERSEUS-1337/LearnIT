    "content": "The \"Military Savings Act of 2012\" may be cited as the short title. A Consumer Financial Products Pilot Program is established. The Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller) will conduct a 5-year pilot program to create financial products for active-duty servicemembers to promote savings and wealth-building. The objectives include increasing savings rates by automatically depositing special pay into savings accounts and providing alternatives to high-cost short-term lending services. The pilot program aims to provide financial products for servicemembers to promote savings and wealth-building, address obstacles to traditional banking for those with limited credit history, and avoid exacerbating credit overextension. The program will be implemented at 10 military installations. The Undersecretary will select 10 military installations for a pilot program offering consumer financial products. Financial institutions operating on these installations must agree to offer these products and notify servicemembers about their availability. The Undersecretary will consult with banking regulators in developing these products. The Undersecretary will contract for an independent evaluation of the pilot program to increase savings product usage. The evaluation will assess the program's success in achieving its goals and will be conducted by a contractor with knowledge of consumer financial products. The Undersecretary will issue a report to congressional committees after each evaluation of the pilot program. The program may be expanded nationwide to improve savings rates among servicemembers and their families. The term \"financial institution\" in this section refers to insured depository institutions or credit unions."
