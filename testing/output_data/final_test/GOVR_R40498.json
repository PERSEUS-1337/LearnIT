    "content": "There are two types of mortgage-backed securities (MBSs): those issued by government sponsored entities (GSEs) like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae, and those issued by private market participants. The laws governing these MBSs differ, with GSEs and Ginnie Mae exempt from certain federal securities laws, while private label MBSs are not. Private label MBSs must register under the Securities Act of 1933 or obtain an exemption. This report outlines registration requirements, exemptions, potential liability for fraud, and consequences for failure to register under federal securities laws. It does not cover reporting requirements or liability under the Exchange Act of 1934. The Securities Act of 1933 requires registration of offerings with the SEC or qualification for an exemption. A registration statement includes a prospectus with required information and other details on file with the SEC. Failure to file a registration statement violates the Act and results in strict liability. Sections 4 and 5 of the Act mandate registration and prospectus provision for non-exempt sales. Sections 7 and 10 outline information needed in registration statements and prospectuses for offerings under Sections 4 and 5. Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933 outlines the requirements for registration statements, including the information and documents needed as outlined in Schedule A. The Commission has the power to prescribe rules and regulations for registration statements to protect investors. Issuers of private label MBSs must use Form S-1 or Form S-3 for registration statements, with Form S-3 being the preferable option for most issuers due to its less burdensome nature. Form S-3 is preferred for MBS registration as it is less burdensome. Eligibility requires existing securities registration or filing reports for the past 12 months. Timely filing of all required reports is necessary. If the MBS offering is for investment grade securities, slightly different requirements apply. An offering of investment grade MBSs occurs when MBSs that qualify as investment grade are offered for cash and delinquent assets within the asset pool do not constitute 20% or more of the pool. If the offering is of investment grade MBSs, the registrant is not required to have securities registered pursuant to Sections 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act or be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. An offering of investment grade MBSs allows the issuer to use Form S-3 for registration, provided all required reports have been filed in the previous 12 months. If Form S-3 is not applicable, Form S-1 must be used. Shelf-registration is a common method for private label MBSs, allowing securities to be sold when the issuer deems it appropriate. Mortgage related securities automatically qualify for shelf-registration. Private label MBS offerings can qualify for shelf-registration for up to three years. If there are changes in the MBSs, a new registration statement may be required. Some changes can be described in the final prospectus. If securities are not sold within three years, another registration statement may be filed, complying with Regulation AB. Private label MBSs must comply with Regulation AB for registration statements. This regulation is tailored for asset-backed securities like MBSs, providing more relevant information for investors such as details about the assets, delinquent assets, transaction structure, servicer experience, and unique aspects of asset-backed securities. Private label MBS offerings may be exempt from registration under the Securities Act through private placement offerings or Regulation D exemptions. These exemptions allow issuers to conduct transactions without a public offering or register offerings below a specified dollar amount. Regulation D, under the Securities Act, provides guidance to issuers on offerings not considered public. Issuers must notify the SEC of sales under Rule 504, allowing sales of up to $1 million to any number of purchasers without accreditation. For accredited investors, sales of up to $5 million are permitted. Accredited investors are presumed to have the ability to obtain necessary information independently. Under Rule 506 of Regulation D, issuers can sell securities to accredited investors and up to 35 sophisticated investors without a full registration statement. Unaccredited investors can be considered sophisticated if the issuer believes they can evaluate the risks. Sales of up to $5 million to accredited investors are exempt from registration, as long as the sale is not publicly advertised. Rule 144A allows unlimited resale of unregistered securities to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) like insurance companies or employee benefit plans with over $100 million in securities. This exemption is commonly used in the private label MBS market. Section 28 of the Securities Act gives the Commission authority to exempt persons, securities, or transactions from provisions. The Securities Act allows the Commission to create exemptions for certain persons, securities, or transactions in the public interest and consistent with investor protection. Private causes of actions for material misstatements in registration statements are provided in Sections 11 and 12, with liability for controlling persons in Section 15. Section 11 establishes a private right of action for purchasers of securities based on false or misleading registration statements. Section 11 of the Securities Act establishes liability for material misstatements or omissions in registration statements. A statement is considered material if it would have deterred an average prudent investor from purchasing the securities. Liability for violations may include the difference between the amount paid for the security and its value at the time of the suit. Securities sold under exemptions from registration are not subject to Section 11 liability. A number of lawsuits have been filed by investors against issuers of MBSs alleging violations of Section 11 of the Securities Act, including failure to comply with underwriting standards, failure to disclose true risks of default, and misrepresentations about the securities' quality. As these cases progress, issues related to liability under Section 11 will become clearer. The liability under Section 11 of the Securities Act can be defeated if the purchaser knew of the untruth or omission at the time of acquisition. If damages are caused by factors other than the misstatement in the registration statement, they are not recoverable. Issuers have absolute liability under Section 11, and other individuals like corporate executives can also be sued. Defendants may use the \"due diligence\" defense. Defendants can assert a \"due diligence\" defense in Section 11 liability under the Securities Act. This defense applies to both \"expert\" and \"unexpert\" portions of a registration statement. Non-expert defendants must show they conducted a reasonable investigation and had no reason to believe there were material misstatements or omissions in the expert portion they signed. Trust is allowed for those who sign the registration statement. Defendants can assert a \"due diligence\" defense in Section 11 liability under the Securities Act. This defense applies to both \"expert\" and \"unexpert\" portions of a registration statement. Those signing the registration statement are not entitled to assume all information in it is correct because they trust those who prepared the statement. The defendants must have read the registration statement and taken into account all knowledge available to them to gauge the statements accuracy. Section 12 applies to two different scenarios, each of which may apply. Section 12 of the Securities Act creates liability for selling securities with material misstatements or omissions. Liability under Section 12(a)(1) is strict, while under Section 12(a)(2) it is not strict if the defendant can prove lack of knowledge or negligence. Liability under Section 12(a)(2) may be reduced if factors other than misstatements caused the securities' value decrease. This section applies to public offerings, not private placements like those under Rules 506. Section 15 holds controlling entities jointly liable for violations of Sections 11 and 12. This provision could be significant for private label MBS liability. In MBS offerings, issuers may need to sue controlling entities for violations of Section 11 and 12. The Commission can take action for Securities Act violations, issue cease and desist orders, and order accounting and disgorgement. Civil or criminal actions can also be pursued for violations of the act, including Section 17 violations. The Commission can take action for violations of Section 17 of the Securities Act, which is a general antifraud provision prohibiting fraud in the offer or sale of securities. Some courts have implied a private right of action under Section 17, similar to Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, but the Supreme Court has not ruled on this yet."
