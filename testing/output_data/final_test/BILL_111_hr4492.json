    "content": "The Act titled \"Metropolitan Medical Response System Program Act of 2009\" is added as an amendment to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, establishing the Metropolitan Medical Response System Program. The Secretary conducts the Metropolitan Medical Response System Program to assist State and local governments in preparing for and responding to public health and mass casualty incidents from disasters. Financial assistance in the form of grants is provided to aid in these preparations and responses. The Administrator consults with the Assistant Secretary, Office of Health Affairs for grants authorized under this section. Grants can be used to support the integration of emergency management, health, and medical systems for coordinated responses to mass casualty incidents caused by any hazard, including strengthening medical surge capacity, mass prophylaxis capabilities, and detection of various hazards. The curr_chunk focuses on enhancing various capabilities for emergency response, including radiological, nuclear, and explosive detection, mass triage, pre-hospital treatment, information sharing, medical supplies management, training, and coordination of public health and medical care providers with other emergency response entities. The curr_chunk discusses eligibility criteria for receiving grants under the Metropolitan Medical Response System Program, specifying that any jurisdiction that received funds in fiscal year 2009 is eligible. Additionally, it mentions provisions for states with no eligible jurisdictions. In fiscal year 2009, if no jurisdiction received funds through the Metropolitan Medical Response System Program or only received funds through another state, the metropolitan statistical area with the largest population in that state is eligible for a grant. In fiscal year 2009, jurisdictions eligible for grants under this section will not receive less funding than they did in 2009. The Administrator may also determine additional eligible jurisdictions for grants in certain fiscal years. In fiscal years 2010 through 2012, the eligibility of additional jurisdictions for grants is contingent on appropriations beyond what is needed to ensure no jurisdiction receives less funding than in 2009. After fiscal year 2010, jurisdictions must meet performance requirements to be eligible for grant funds under this subsection. The Administrator will distribute funds to the state where the jurisdiction receiving the grant is located. The State must provide the jurisdiction receiving grant funds 100% of the funds within 45 days of receiving them. An exception allows for 97% of the funds to be provided if it ensures no jurisdiction receives less funding than in fiscal year 2009. The Administrator ensures regional coordination for jurisdictions receiving grants under this section to enhance preparedness. Performance measures will be issued within one year of enactment. The National Metropolitan Medical Response System Working Group will issue performance measures within one year to evaluate the effective use of funds provided under this section in jurisdictions. The group consists of 10 grant managers representing different regions and jurisdictions receiving grant funds. Authorization of Appropriations.--$75,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 to carry out the program. SEC. 3. METROPOLITAN MEDICAL RESPONSE PROGRAM REVIEW. The Administrator of FEMA, Assistant Secretary of Health Affairs, and National Metropolitan Medical Response System Working Group will review the Metropolitan Medical Response System Program. This includes assessing goals, performance metrics, program improvements, and its relationship with other preparedness programs. The Metropolitan Medical Response System Program is being reviewed to assess its strategic goals, incorporation in state and local homeland security plans, eligibility for financial assistance, allocation of assistance based on risk, potential management as a contractual agreement, and resource requirements. The Metropolitan Medical Response System Program will be reviewed and a report will be submitted to the relevant committees within a year. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services in implementing certain aspects, and a definition for the National Metropolitan Medical Response System Working Group is provided. Section 635 of the Post-Katrina Management Reform Act of 2006 (6 U.S.C. 723) is repealed."
