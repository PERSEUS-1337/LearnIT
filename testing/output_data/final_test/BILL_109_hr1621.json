    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The \"Taxpayer Protection Act of 2005\" emphasizes the importance of the integrity of the Federal tax system and compliance with the tax code by individual taxpayers. It highlights the voluntary disclosure of personal information to the IRS with the expectation of secure handling by qualified personnel. The Act aims to restrict the release of taxpayer information to private collection agencies. The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 raises concerns about the disclosure of taxpayer information to private collection agencies, citing the risk of identity theft due to unauthorized disclosure. The Act highlights the IRS's previous failures in protecting taxpayer data under existing vendor contracts. The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 prohibits IRS employees from being evaluated based on collections to prevent abusive tactics. Private tax collection agencies can receive up to 25% recovery fee, leading to aggressive tactics. Congress previously canceled a pilot program in 1996 due to violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and loss of $17 million. The IRS Commissioner reported an additional $30 billion in taxes owed annually that could be collected with increased funding for IRS personnel. Earmarking $300 million for specific IRS collection functions could result in a $9 billion annual revenue increase, with a return of $30 for every $1 spent. Private collection agencies were seen as a new tool by the IRS Commissioner, but their use could actually increase costs to taxpayers. Members of the House of Representatives did not have the chance to vote on a significant policy change during the consideration of H.R. 4520, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, in the 108th Congress. The authority to enter into private tax collection contracts is repealed. The authority for private tax collection contracts is repealed, with corresponding amendments to various sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section will take effect on the enactment date of the Act but will not apply to contracts entered into before that date. The reporting requirement of section 881(e) of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 will no longer apply after the enactment of this Act."
