    "content": "The polar bear, Ursus maritimus, is the largest terrestrial carnivore and top predator in the Arctic, with 19 known populations totaling 20,000 to 25,000 animals. Two populations are within U.S. jurisdiction, with the Southern Beaufort Sea population at 1,526 animals and the Chukchi/Bering Seas population at about 2,000 animals. Data on polar bear populations are challenging to obtain, but globally, less than one-third are declining, over one-third are stable or increasing, and for the rest, data is insufficient. In the United States, the polar bear population in the Southern Beaufort Sea may be starting to decline, while over-harvest in the Chukchi Sea population is a concern. Studies suggest declining numbers in Western Hudson Bay, Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, and Norwegian Bay. The status of polar bears in the Central Arctic Basin is unknown. The status of polar bear populations in the Central Arctic Basin, where ice may be thickest, is unknown. Observers caution against interpreting studies based on nearshore regions, as little is known about what happens on drifting sea ice far from shore, especially in winter. The changing climate could make the Central Arctic Basin more important as a refuge for polar bears. The changing climate could make the Central Arctic Basin more important as a refuge for polar bears, especially as a potential refugium for polar bears due to uncertainties in ringed seal population estimates and their primary food sources. Polar bears primarily prey on ringed seals, but also consume other species like bearded and harp seals, walrus, beluga whales, narwhal, fish, and seabirds. They typically remain on sea ice year-round or spend short periods on land. Polar bears primarily prey on ringed seals and other species, remaining on sea ice year-round or spending short periods on land. Pregnant females dig dens in snow to give birth and spend the winter. Population increase rates can be as high as 5%, with a minimum viable total population estimated at 4,961 adults. Climate change poses a significant threat to polar bear biodiversity. Climate change is a major threat to polar bear populations, with studies showing that two-thirds of the world's polar bears could be lost within 50 years. The decline in Arctic sea ice due to climate warming is causing earlier ice break-up and later freeze-up, with some models predicting complete disappearance of Arctic late summer sea ice by mid-century. USGS addresses uncertainties in climate models regarding Arctic ice conditions and polar bear impacts. USGS addressed uncertainties in climate models regarding Arctic ice conditions and polar bear impacts, stating that greenhouse gas increases will cause Arctic sea ice cover to decline, with the greatest reductions at the end of the summer melt season. Climate simulations consistently show \"polar amplification\" with the largest impact in high northern latitudes. Declines in Arctic sea ice, especially in September, have been observed since the early 1990s. However, the links between climate-model predictions and threats to polar bears are considered tenuous by many scientists due to limitations in correlational studies. Distribution patterns of polar bear populations have changed in recent years, with more bears being found onshore near the Bering Sea and in parts of Canada. Inuit hunters report increased bear presence on land during summer and fall. Changes in sea ice may be a factor, and caution is needed when interpreting population variations. Some mid-latitude European populations of Arctic fox became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene, not tracking habitat shifts northward. A loss of sea ice could impact polar bears by shortening hunting seasons, increasing travel distances to preferred denning areas, reducing availability of dens for gestating females, requiring more energy for travel through fragmented ice, decreasing prey accessibility, and forcing more time on land. Climate change could affect polar bear den sites, with rain destroying ice dens and exposing young bears prematurely. Some scientists predict polar bear extinction under climate change scenarios, but not all sea-ice changes would harm them. Changes in sea ice thickness and coverage in far northern regions could improve polar bear habitat by increasing prey availability. Contaminants like petroleum hydrocarbons and persistent organic pollutants are potential threats to polar bears. Polar bears are threatened by petroleum hydrocarbons, persistent organic pollutants, and heavy metals. Climate change may increase the risk by altering contaminant pathways. Oil spills damage polar bear fur and can lead to poisoning. Elevated levels of pollutants have unknown effects on polar bears, potentially weakening immune systems and affecting reproductive success. Mercury toxicity is a significant concern. Polar bears can accumulate elevated levels of mercury without harm and are able to demethylate it. The United States allows limited subsistence harvest of polar bears, with sustainable harvest levels in the Southern Beaufort Sea but unsustainable levels in the Chukchi/Bering seas. There is concern for the Chukchi/Bering Seas polar bear population due to potential unsustainable harvest levels by Russian Natives. Climate change may impact polar bear mortality by altering habitat and prey availability. Some believe that larger male bears, targeted by hunters, are at greater risk from climate change effects. Others argue that warming climates could improve habitat conditions and prey availability. Male bears also pose a threat to cubs and juvenile bears. Some argue that reducing adult male polar bear populations through hunting may increase cub and juvenile survivorship, benefiting the species in the long run. Sport hunting, when well-regulated for conservation, can provide incentives for maintaining healthy polar bear populations, as seen in the case of big game hunters in northern Canada. Inuit hunters in Canada are allowed to allocate a portion of the subsistence harvest to sport hunters, and U.S. citizens can import sport-harvested polar bear trophies under certain permits. Under the MMPA, U.S. citizens can import sport-harvested polar bear trophies from Canada under quotas designed to maintain sustainable population levels. The permit fee is $1,000, and non-resident sport hunts only occur in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. Harvest quotas are based on recommendations from federal-provincial-territorial polar bear committees. Harvest sharing is coordinated through inter-jurisdictional meetings. The ESA listing of polar bears as \"threatened\" triggers a ban on importing polar bear products into the United States, preventing U.S. citizens from participating in Canadian conservation-based hunting programs. The ESA listing of polar bears as \"threatened\" triggers a ban on importing polar bear products into the United States, effectively stopping U.S. participation in Canadian conservation-based hunting programs. This could impact financial assistance, community support for sustainable harvest, and community-based conservation programs in NWT and Nunavut. Non-resident hunters are charged fees for trophy and tags, with additional costs for outfitter services, guides, transportation, food, and accommodations. Government license fees indirectly benefit communities by supporting polar bear research and monitoring. Nunavut spends about Can$1 million annually on polar bear research and monitoring, funded in part by a 6% goods and services tax collected by the federal government. The money that enters the local community circulates locally, with over 90% disbursed within the community. Outfitted hunts in Nunavut generated Can$1.221 million in 2001, significantly more than other tourist activities. Polar bears are protected under domestic laws in addition to the ESA listing. Polar bears are protected under domestic laws and international agreements, managed as a marine mammal in the United States. The Alaska Nanuuq Commission collaborates with the Fish and Wildlife Service for conservation efforts. The 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears and the 2000 bilateral Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation on the Conservation and Management of the Alaska-Chukotka Polar Bear Population, along with the Inuvialuit-Inupiat Polar Bear Management Agreement for the Southern Beaufort Sea, provide a basis for cooperation on polar bear management. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the polar bear as vulnerable, indicating a high risk of extinction in the wild. Polar bears are also listed on Appendix II of CITES. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) implements CITES provisions domestically to protect endangered species and wildlife of global concern. ESA prohibits interstate and foreign commerce in ESA-listed species to prevent illegal trade and international movement that could threaten their survival. FWS agents and inspectors work to control these activities within U.S. jurisdiction. On May 14, 2008, Interior Secretary Kempthorne announced the decision to list polar bears as threatened under the ESA. The listing decision was supported by environmental groups and scientific societies, while others, including Alaska, opposed it citing weak science. Special rules were also announced under Section 4(d) of ESA to address consultation and takings limitations for federal agencies. Environmental groups criticized the rules for violating the ESA and not adequately addressing species recovery. On February 17, 2005, FWS received a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity to list the polar bear as threatened under the ESA and designate critical habitat. Legal challenges were announced after the decision to list polar bears, with opponents concerned about economic impact and global climate change leverage. The Natural Resources Defense Council and Greenpeace, Inc. filed a complaint challenging FWS's delay in issuing a finding on the petition to list the polar bear as threatened. FWS found substantial scientific information supporting the potential listing of the polar bear and initiated a formal status review. The decision to list the polar bear will be based on the best available scientific and commercial information, considering factors such as habitat destruction, overutilization, disease or predation, and regulatory mechanisms. The Secretary may not consider economic effects in the ESA listing process, as it is a scientific question of whether a species is threatened or endangered. Federal agencies must ensure activities do not harm a listed species or its critical habitat. In a settlement agreement, FWS agreed to review a petition to list the polar bear as a threatened species under ESA. After a scientific review, FWS proposed listing the polar bear as threatened but did not designate critical habitat. The decision on listing was delayed, allowing an oil & gas lease sale to proceed. On February 6, 2008, the Administration stated that an ESA listing would not affect an ongoing lease sale, as polar bears were already protected under the MMPA. Following delays, environmental groups filed a lawsuit to prompt a final decision on listing polar bears as threatened. A court ruling mandated a decision by May 15, 2008, leading to Secretary Kempthorne's decision to list the species on May 14. Additionally, in late April 2008, COSEWIC assessed the status of polar bears in Canada. Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) announced the polar bear as a species of \"special concern,\" with a detailed report set for release in August 2008. Canada's Environment Minister will decide on polar bear listing under the Species at Risk Act after receiving the report. The 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears offers some protection, but over-harvesting continues in some areas. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the US and Canada for polar bear conservation. Environment Minister John Baird and the US signed a non-binding MOU for polar bear conservation. The ESA provides protections for endangered species, with special rules for threatened species like the polar bear. The polar bear is the 64th species with such rules, and its threatened status may impact efforts to address climate change and restrict Arctic oil and gas development. Some groups planned lawsuits to limit greenhouse gases or Arctic energy development to protect the polar bear under the ESA. Opponents argued that the ESA is not the best tool for addressing climate change and Arctic development. A focus on protecting polar bears from the effects of global climate change in lawsuits under the ESA's Section 7 requirement for federal agency consultation with FWS. FWS issues a BiOp to assess potential harm to the species or critical habitat, offering alternatives to avoid harm. Critics argue that a special rule under Section 4(d) cannot modify these requirements. Critics argue that addressing climate change is crucial for polar bear conservation, as loss of Arctic sea ice is a major threat to the species. They oppose using the ESA to address climate change, citing FWS's lack of capacity for consultations. The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 allows for the withdrawal of the special rule for polar bears. Other issues discussed include subsistence handicrafts, international imports, sport-hunted trophies, and takes in self-defense. The discussion focuses on takings and consultation under the ESA, with controversy over whether habitat modification is included in the prohibition on taking. The final special rule issued by Secretary Kempthorne on December 10 addresses these issues. The special rule issued by Secretary Kempthorne on December 10 exempts activities authorized under the Marine Mammal Protection Act or CITES from take prohibitions for threatened species like polar bears, stating that stricter standards of the MMPA also apply under the ESA. Under the [ESA], takings of threatened species that violate regulations are illegal. Environmental groups argue that ESA offers more habitat protection than the [MMPA]. FWS must assess if agency actions jeopardize species existence or habitat. The ESA prohibits takings of threatened species that violate regulations. FWS evaluates if agency actions jeopardize species existence or habitat, including actions like promulgating regulations, granting leases, and causing modifications to land, water, or air. Consultation is triggered based on the discrete effect of the proposed agency action, considering effects on listed species with and without the action. Some argue that all power plant emissions should be considered in consultations. Some argue that all power plant emissions should be considered when dealing with the impacts of climate change on polar ice. The final special rule narrows section 7 consultation requirements to listed species in the 'action area' to avoid consultation for every agency action producing greenhouse gases. This could limit the number of consultations regarding polar bears but may not limit their breadth, especially for permits relating to emissions of GHG at a specific site. The rule's discussion highlights the challenge of determining the impact of emissions on climate change and listed species like polar bears. It suggests that consultation may not be necessary for specific actions with weak causal links to polar bear effects, but regulations affecting all emissions may require consultation due to potential impacts on polar bears and their habitat. The causal link between regulations for permitted GHG emissions and effects on polar bears may be stronger in the future. Legal actions under various laws have been taken regarding the polar bear, including the ESA, MMPA, NEPA, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The lawsuit by the Center for Biological Diversity led to the listing of the polar bear under the ESA. The polar bear was listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) due to a petition by the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD). Legal actions were taken to ensure compliance with deadlines for listing determinations, leading to the polar bear being officially listed on May 15, 2008. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows any person to bring suit against the United States with a 60-day notice requirement. This provision allows for injunctions to stop violations of the act, specifically for non-discretionary actions like missed deadlines. Lawsuits regarding the polar bear can also be based on the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in addition to the ESA. Challenges to the law on polar bears have been made under the MMPA and NEPA, using the APA to access the courts. Lawsuits filed do not require 60 days' notice. Multiple lawsuits were filed in different district courts, with parties moving to intervene. The Judicial Panel of Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the actions before one D.C. judge. CBD amended its suit regarding polar bear listing to include claims of NEPA and APA violations. CBD challenges FWS for violating NEPA and APA by issuing polar bear special rules without proper procedures. CBD argues for a NEPA review and claims the polar bear should be listed as endangered, not threatened, with critical habitat designated. FWS had indicated critical habitat determination would follow the listing decision. The CBD filed a notice of suit against FWS and MMS regarding oil and gas industry activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, arguing violations of the ESA. The CBD also lost a lawsuit against FWS for issuing incidental take regulations for marine mammals in the Beaufort Sea. The CBD filed a lawsuit against FWS for not conducting required stock assessments under the MMPA. A settlement was reached in 2008, with FWS agreeing to prepare draft stock assessment reports for polar bears and walruses. Safari Club International also sued FWS over permits to import sport-hunted polar bear trophies from Canada. The plaintiff challenged the nullification of permits to import sport-hunted polar bear trophies from Canada, arguing that specific language in the MMPA allowed the permits to supersede the general prohibition on imports of threatened or endangered species. Safari Club International also sued FWS under ESA, disputing the listing of polar bears as threatened and questioning the timeframe for the \"foreseeable future.\" The State of Alaska also filed suit under ESA, claiming the best available science was not used. The State of Alaska filed suit under the ESA, arguing that the best available science was not used in listing the polar bear as threatened due to increasing population numbers. FWS mentioned loss of habitat as the reason for listing the species and noted the lack of effective programs to reduce habitat loss. Multiple lawsuits disputed the science behind the listing decision and questioned existing protections for the polar bear. The Cattlemen's Association led a lawsuit challenging oil and gas permits in the polar bear's habitat. Subsistence hunters sued MMS for harm to whales and polar bears from oil and gas leases in the Beaufort Sea. Two lawsuits in 2008 by the Native Village of Point Hope and environmental groups challenged MMS's decision on outer continental shelf acreage. The lawsuit challenges MMS's decision to offer 29.4 million acres of outer continental shelf public land in the Chukchi Sea for oil and gas leasing, alleging violations related to polar bears, whales, and eiders. Another lawsuit seeks to stop permits for seismic surveys in Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, claiming violations of environmental laws. MMS is working on an EIS to assess the impact of seismic testing noise on the environment, with permits being issued based on EAs in the meantime. The lawsuit challenges MMS's decision to offer public land in the Chukchi Sea for oil and gas leasing, alleging violations related to polar bears, whales, and eiders. Plaintiffs also named NMFS as defendant for issuing incidental harassment authorization for taking seals and whales during seismic surveys in the Beaufort Sea. The surveys were estimated to harm beluga whales, bowhead whales, and ringed seals, the primary food source of polar bears. Supporters argue for increased protection of polar bears, while critics suggest listing them as threatened is premature. Some scientists believe that polar bears may be capable of adjusting to current climate change, as they have survived previous warming periods. The Arctic experienced rapid warming at the end of the last Ice Age, with temperatures reaching levels warmer than today. This suggests that polar bears and other Arctic mammals could adapt to the changing climate. During the Mid-Holocene Warm Period, temperatures rose rapidly in the Arctic, peaking about 11,000-9,000 years ago near Alaska and about 8,000-5,000 years ago near Greenland and Northern Europe. This warming period saw temperatures 10\u00b0-15\u00b0 Celsius (18\u00b0-27\u00b0F) warmer than present, with a significant portion of the warming occurring within 30 years. Another warm period occurred about 1,000 years ago, leading to slightly warmer Arctic temperatures and reductions in sea ice and Greenland glaciers. During warm periods in the Arctic, Greenland glaciers reduced, creating arable land for Viking settlers. Ice did not disappear entirely, and polar bears and their prey species survived. Human-induced factors like shipping and oil exploration also impact polar bears. Human-induced factors such as shipping, oil and gas exploration, contaminants, and reduced prey populations compound the threat to the continued existence of polar bears."
