    "content": "The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), P.L. 112-144, reauthorizes prescription drug and medical device user fee programs to support FDA review of brand-name drugs, biological products, and devices. It also creates new user fee authority for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products, authorizes programs for pediatric drug studies, and amends laws related to medical device and drug regulation. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), P.L. 112-144, reauthorizes user fee programs for FDA review of drugs and devices. It includes new user fee authority for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products, pediatric drug study programs, and amendments to medical device and drug regulation laws. The legislative process aimed to complete the reauthorization before the October 1, 2012 deadline to avoid disruptions in FDA review activities. Title V permanently authorizes the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act. Title VI addresses pre- and postmarket medical device regulation. Titles VII through X cover drug regulation, including supply chain, antimicrobial development, expedited drug approval, and shortages. Title XI, Other Provisions, includes medical gas products, drug abuse, and advisory committee conflicts of interest. The report provides an overview of FDASIA by title and section, with time-specific requirements in Appendix A and a list of abbreviations in Appendix B. The FDASIA legislation reauthorizes the prescription drug user program for five years, from FY2013 through FY2017. It allows FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and biological products for specified activities. PDUFA was made possible through agreements on performance goals and the use of fees. The FDASIA legislation reauthorizes the prescription drug user program for five years, allowing FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers for review processes. User fees make up 35% of the FY2012 FDA budget and contribute 51% to the human drug program. Performance goals agreements are developed with industry representatives, patients, advocates, experts, and Congress. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) allows FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers for the review of human drug applications. The revenue from PDUFA fees supports the review process, with activities expanded with each reauthorization. FDASIA continues the approach of PDUFA, dividing revenue among application, establishment, and product fees for necessary review activities. Title I of the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 (PDUFA V) sets total fee revenue for FY2013 at $693,099,000, divided evenly among application fees, establishment fees, and product fees. It continues the authority to adjust total revenue annually for inflation and workload changes and allows for early fee payment. The user fees are meant to supplement, not replace, congressional funding for FDA activities related to drug applications and inspections. Title I of the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 (PDUFA V) authorizes fees to supplement congressional appropriations for FDA activities related to drug applications and inspections. The requirements ensure that fees do not replace appropriations, with triggers for fee collection based on spending levels and reporting obligations. The authorization covers prescription drug user fees from October 1, 2012, through September 30, 2017, with a savings clause for applications filed before October 1, 2012. Medical devices require FDA approval before marketing in the US. FDA collects fees from the industry to fund device reviews. The user fee program, modeled after PDUFA, sets performance goals for review times. The Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2012 changed the definition of establishments subject to registration. The User Fee Amendments of 2012 changed fees for premarket notification submissions, set fee amounts for each fiscal year, allowed for fee adjustments based on inflation, and permitted waivers or reductions for public health interests. The User Fee Amendments of 2012 introduced new fees for premarket notification submissions, with provisions for fee adjustments based on inflation and waivers or reductions for public health interests. Additionally, the amendments included requirements for annual performance and fiscal reports, early payment of authorized fees, and streamlined hiring of FDA employees for review processes. The Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 streamlined the hiring of FDA employees for the review of device applications to meet performance goals. GDUFA, patterned after PDUFA, became effective on October 1, 2012, and will sunset on October 1, 2017. The program defines activities for FDA to use revenue from GDUFA fees, including the review of generic drug submissions and issuance of approval letters. The Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 established various fees for manufacturers, including drug master file fees, application filing fees, annual facility fees, and a one-time backlog fee. The estimated total fee for FY2013 is $299 million, with a methodology for annual inflation adjustments. The Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 established fees for manufacturers, including annual inflation adjustments and a refund trigger if appropriations are not met. It requires annual reports, sets performance goals for GDUFA reauthorization, authorizes fees until 2017, and allows streamlined hiring authority for the Secretary. A drug may be deemed misbranded if requirements are not met. A biosimilar is a biological product similar to a brand-name product, made from living organisms. They are regulated under the Public Health Service Act, unlike chemical drugs regulated under the FFDCA. The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for generic chemical drugs but not biosimilars. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) established a new regulatory authority within the FDA for biosimilars under the PHSA, similar to the Hatch-Waxman Act for generic chemical drugs under the FFDCA. Biosimilars can be approved by demonstrating similarity to an already approved biological product. The BPCIA also authorized FDA to collect user fees for biosimilar approval. The BPCIA allows FDA to collect user fees for biosimilar biological product development, application, establishment, and product fees. Fee amounts are based on proportions of the inflation-adjusted human drug application fee. Small businesses may qualify for a waiver of the application fee for their first biosimilar biological product. The BPCIA allows FDA to collect user fees for biosimilar biological product development, application, establishment, and product fees. Fees will be available to defray the costs of the review process only if the Secretary allocates $20 million, adjusted for inflation. Annual performance and fiscal reports are required, along with an independent study of workload volume and costs. Recommendations for performance goals are to be developed for BSUFA reauthorization in 2017. Biosimilar user fees are authorized from October 1, 2012, through September 30, 2017. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) provide incentives for drug manufacturers to test products for children. The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act (PMDSIA) created reporting requirements and incentives for pediatric medical devices. FDA has the authority to require postmarket studies for approved pediatric devices. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) were reauthorized in 2007 and again in FDASIA, providing incentives for manufacturers to conduct pediatric testing of drugs and biologics. These acts created extended market exclusivity and requirements for safety and effectiveness testing in pediatric populations. Between 2007 and 2012, 369 studies were completed under BPCA, PREA, or both. BPCA also included provisions for pediatric studies of off-patent products and manufacturer-declined studies to be referred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Foundation for the NIH. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) provide information on new dosing, indications, safety, and effectiveness for pediatric populations. These acts authorize market exclusivity for pediatric studies and require the Secretary to issue standard operating procedures for review. The Pediatric Review Committee issues standard operating procedures for reviewing study plans under BPCA and PREA. The Secretary must make medical, statistical, and clinical pharmacology reviews public for studies submitted between 2002 and 2007 that resulted in market exclusivity and labeling changes. Study deferrals can be extended under certain conditions, with set timeframes for requests and responses. The Secretary must track and make deferral information public, enforce assessment deadlines, and consider products misbranded for non-compliance, but cannot withdraw approval or revoke licensure. The bill extends the waiver on the sale of certain pediatric devices until October 1, 2017, authorizes appropriations for the study of off-patent drugs at NIH, and requires reports to be submitted to committees of jurisdiction and the public every five years. The bill extends the waiver on the sale of certain pediatric devices until October 1, 2017, authorizes appropriations for the study of off-patent drugs at NIH, and requires reports to be submitted to committees of jurisdiction and the public every five years. Additionally, it mandates the Secretary to hold a meeting and report on a strategic plan for accelerated development of new therapies for pediatric rare diseases. Expertise in pediatric subpopulations, neonatology, and pediatric epidemiology is required to be represented on the staff of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics. FDA's authority to regulate medical devices varies, ranging from simple devices like tongue depressors to complex devices like implantable hips. The FDA classifies medical devices based on risk to patients: low-risk devices are class I, moderate-risk are class II, and high-risk are class III. Low-risk and some moderate-risk devices are exempt from premarket review. Manufacturers can bring moderate and high-risk devices to market with FDA's permission through premarket approval (PMA) or premarket notification submission (510(k)). PMA involves clinical studies and evidence of safety and effectiveness. The FDA classifies medical devices based on risk to patients: low-risk devices are class I, moderate-risk are class II, and high-risk are class III. Manufacturers can bring moderate and high-risk devices to market with FDA's permission through premarket approval (PMA) or premarket notification submission (510(k)). PMA is used for novel and high-risk devices, while 510(k) is for devices substantially equivalent to ones already on the market. FDA clearance is obtained through the 510(k) process, while PMA results in FDA approval. Postmarket monitoring by the FDA ensures the safety and effectiveness of devices on the market. The provisions in FDASIA make modifications to various aspects of premarket and postmarket device regulation, including efficiency, transparency, data requirements, and active postmarket surveillance. Changes are made to the 510(k) and PMA processes, requirements for postmarket studies, device recall, and tracking capabilities. Other reforms aim to increase transparency in FDA approval decisions and industry guidance processes. Title VI of FDASIA clarifies that the Secretary cannot disapprove an investigational device exemption application for certain reasons and defines the least burdensome standard for PMA applications. It aims to improve health information technology, harmonize device regulation with international counterparts, and enhance industry guidance processes. Title VI of FDASIA clarifies the least burdensome standard for 510(k) notifications, requiring necessary clinical data to demonstrate device effectiveness. The Secretary must document significant decisions and controversies, providing this information to applicants upon request. Title VI of FDASIA clarifies the least burdensome standard for 510(k) notifications, requiring necessary clinical data to demonstrate device effectiveness. The Secretary must document significant decisions and controversies, providing this information to applicants upon request. Additionally, the Secretary is required to withdraw the July 2011 draft FDA guidance on 510(k) device modifications and establish a program to improve the device recall system. A report to House and Senate committees regarding 510(k) notification for device modifications is also mandated before any new guidance or regulation is issued. The FDA is required to improve the device recall system by assessing information on device recalls, clarifying procedures for audit checks, evaluating the effectiveness of recall corrections, and documenting the basis for recall terminations. The Secretary can issue a clinical hold to prohibit a sponsor from conducting a clinical investigation if the device poses an unreasonable risk. Additionally, for new devices, the Secretary can classify them without first determining substantial equivalence. The FDA allows the Secretary to change device classification based on new information and revoke regulations by administrative order. Requirements for public comment and a device classification panel are specified, with limitations on the authority to issue the administrative order. The FDA authorizes the Secretary to enter into arrangements with nations for regulatory harmonization, participate in international forums, and reauthorize inspections and review of submissions by accredited third parties. The FDA authorizes the Secretary to enter into arrangements with nations for regulatory harmonization and participate in international forums. Additionally, a device granted a humanitarian device exemption (HDE) can qualify for an exemption to the profit ban if intended for specific medical conditions, and the Secretary is required to issue regulations for a unique device identification system by a specified deadline. The FDA requires modifications to Sentinel for medical devices, engages stakeholders for system expansion, and mandates postmarket surveillance within 15 months of order. Custom devices are exempt with limitations, and the Secretary must publish a report on regulatory strategy and recommendations. The FDA mandates postmarket surveillance for medical devices, exempts custom devices with limitations, and requires a report on regulatory strategy and recommendations. The FDA's Device Availability Demonstration Grants allocate $5.25 million annually from FY2013 to FY2017. FDASIA addresses the mismatch between FDA's statutory authority and responsibilities by allowing refusal of entry for drugs from facilities with denied inspections, enhancing penalties for counterfeit products, and requiring unique identifiers. Title VII of FDASIA enhances penalties for suppliers of counterfeit or substandard products and requires a unique manufacturing facility identifier. Congress did not reach agreement on chain-of-custody documentation and track-and-trace technologies. Members continue discussions to find a feasible mix covering domestic and foreign facilities. The registration information required from drug establishments is expanded to include a unique facility identifier and information about importers. The Secretary is required to maintain an electronic database of unique facility identifiers. Title VII of FDASIA enhances penalties for suppliers of counterfeit or substandard products and requires a unique manufacturing facility identifier. The Secretary is mandated to maintain an electronic database of unique facility identifiers and carry out biennial inspections of certain device manufacturers. Inspections for drug manufacturing establishments are conducted based on a risk-based schedule, with requirements for record submission and consequences for refusal of inspection. Adulterated drugs can be destroyed if inspection is delayed or denied. Title VII of FDASIA enhances penalties for suppliers of counterfeit or substandard products and requires a unique manufacturing facility identifier. The Secretary is mandated to maintain an electronic database of unique facility identifiers and carry out biennial inspections of certain device manufacturers. Inspections for drug manufacturing establishments are conducted based on a risk-based schedule, with requirements for record submission and consequences for refusal of inspection. Adulterated drugs can be destroyed if inspection is delayed or denied. Additionally, the Secretary's authority to administratively detain adulterated or misbranded products during facility inspections is expanded to include drugs. Confidentiality of information from foreign government drug inspections can be maintained in specified conditions. Agreements with foreign governments can be made to recognize inspections of foreign establishments. Good manufacturing practices for drugs include quality controls and safety assurance of raw materials. Title VII of FDASIA enhances penalties for suppliers of counterfeit or substandard products and requires a unique manufacturing facility identifier. The Secretary can require drug importers to provide specified information demonstrating compliance with requirements. Commercial importers must register with the Secretary and follow good importer practices. Registered manufacturers, wholesalers, or distributors must notify the Secretary of serious issues with drugs. Penalties include imprisonment for up to 20 years or a fine up to $1 million for violations. Title VII of FDASIA enhances penalties for suppliers of counterfeit or substandard products and requires a unique manufacturing facility identifier. The legislation imposes imprisonment for up to 20 years or a fine of up to $1 million for knowingly adulterating drugs to cause serious health consequences. It also includes trafficking in counterfeit drugs as a punishable offense and asserts U.S. authority to enforce the FFDCA for violations occurring outside the country. The development of new anti-infective drugs is crucial due to the potential ineffectiveness of approved drugs when infectious organisms develop resistance. The development of new anti-infective drugs is crucial as resistance can make current drugs ineffective. Sponsors may be hesitant due to short-term use and regulatory challenges. FDASIA offers incentives for new anti-infective drugs, including extended exclusivity for qualified infectious disease products. The FDA offers incentives for new anti-infective drugs, including extended exclusivity for Qualified Infectious Disease Products (QIDPs). This includes market exclusivity, priority review, fast track designation, updated guidance on clinical trials, and reporting requirements to Congress. The FDA provides incentives for new anti-infective drugs, such as extended exclusivity for Qualified Infectious Disease Products (QIDPs) and updated guidance on clinical trials for drug development. The drug approval process involves FDA approval through an investigational new drug (IND) application, followed by clinical trials in Phase I, II, and III studies to assess safety and effectiveness before submitting a new drug application (NDA) for FDA review. The FDA uses formal mechanisms to expedite drug development and review processes, including accelerated approval, animal efficacy approval, and fast track product designation for drugs addressing serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet medical needs. The FDA has mechanisms like fast track product designation and breakthrough therapy to expedite drug development for serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet needs. These provisions aim to speed up the availability of treatments while maintaining safety standards. Title IX requires the Secretary to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs designated as fast track products for serious or life-threatening conditions. It also designates an accelerated approval process based on clinical or surrogate endpoints that predict clinical benefits. Postmarket activities and expedited withdrawal of approval are also authorized. The Secretary is required to facilitate postmarket activities, expedite approval withdrawal, and review processes for drugs. The Secretary must issue guidance and amend regulations without changing safety and effectiveness standards for drug approval. Additionally, the Secretary can use evidence from sources other than controlled investigations to determine clinical benefit prediction. The Secretary must expedite the development and review of breakthrough therapy drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions with potential substantial improvement over existing therapies. The Secretary is required to develop and disseminate information on accelerated approval, fast track, and breakthrough products, as well as establish a program to encourage the development of surrogate and clinical endpoints for serious conditions with unmet medical needs. Annual reports to Congress on breakthrough therapy designations and related actions are mandated, along with timeframes for guidance. The Secretary is required to ensure consultations with stakeholders and maintain a list of external experts for new drugs and biological products for rare diseases and genetically targeted drugs. The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board must convene a working group to develop best practices for access to prescription drug information for the visually impaired. The Secretary is also required to implement a risk-benefit assessment framework in the new drug approval process. The new drug approval process is being updated without changing premarket approval criteria. $30 million is reauthorized for grants and contracts for orphan drug development. A report on demographic subgroup participation in clinical trials is required, along with an action plan for improving subgroup data. A new program funded by user fees will be created for transferable purposes. Creates a new program funded by user fees to provide a transferable voucher for a rare pediatric disease drug, terminates voucher authority after the third award, and addresses drug shortages, particularly in generic sterile injectable drugs. The immediate causes of drug shortages include manufacturing quality problems, supply interruptions, increased demand, business decisions, and unexpected events. Market concentration, global supply chains, manufacturing constraints, and pricing are believed to be underlying causes of shortages. The FDA has taken steps to address shortages by asking manufacturers to increase production. The FDA has taken steps to address drug shortages by asking manufacturers to increase production, exercising regulatory flexibility, expediting review processes, and communicating with the DEA to increase quotas of controlled substances in short supply. An executive order in October 2011 directed the FDA to use all tools to require advance notice of manufacturing interruptions and to address instances of price gouging. Immediate steps suggested include increasing notification, staffing, developing legislation for notification, and using databases to identify factors that prevent shortages. Title X of FDASIA expands requirements for drug manufacturers to notify the Secretary of production discontinuance or interruption, authorizes expedited inspections or reviews to prevent shortages, addresses Attorney General actions for controlled substances, and outlines procedures and regulations. Title X of FDASIA expands requirements for drug manufacturers to notify the Secretary of production discontinuance or interruption, authorizes expedited inspections or reviews to prevent shortages, and outlines procedures and regulations. It also requires the Secretary to submit annual reports to Congress on actual and prevented shortages, establish a task force to develop a strategic plan for shortage prevention, and maintain a list of drugs in shortage publicly available. Title X of FDASIA expands requirements for drug manufacturers to notify the Secretary of production discontinuance or interruption, authorizes expedited inspections or reviews to prevent shortages, and outlines procedures and regulations. It also requires the Attorney General to increase production quotas for schedule II controlled substances in shortage, submit an annual drug shortages report to Congress, and exempts hospitals repackaging drugs on the FDA shortage list for transfer within the same health system. Additionally, the GAO is tasked with examining the causes of drug shortages. Subtitle A\u2014Reauthorizations extends the period for manufacturers to consider non-racemic drugs separately from approved racemic drugs with the same active ingredient. It also reauthorizes Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships for FDA collaboration with educational or tax-exempt organizations. Subtitle B of the FDASIA addresses the regulation of medical gases, allowing the Secretary to approve medical gases that meet requirements through a certification process without market exclusivity or user fees. The legislation aims to provide an approval pathway for medical gas manufacturers to avoid trade and other issues associated with unapproved products. Subtitle B of the FDASIA establishes a process for certifying medical gas products meeting specific requirements, granting them approved drug status without market exclusivity or user fees. The Secretary must review and update medical gas regulations within specified timeframes. This subtitle does not apply to previously approved medical gases or those approved under standard drug approval authority. The Secretary is required to issue guidance on promoting FDA-regulated medical products online, review federal initiatives on safe prescription drug use, and collaborate on global clinical trial standards for medical products. The provision aims to streamline the approval process for medical products by allowing the use of foreign data, reducing duplicative studies, and maintaining current premarket review standards. It also requires the Secretary to accept data from international clinical trials meeting standards, establish a regulatory science strategy, and report progress on advancing medical product decision-making. The Secretary is required to include a report on progress on goals for prescription drug, medical device, generic drug, and biosimilar biological product user fee programs. Additionally, a plan to modernize FDA's information technology systems must be developed and implemented, with GAO reporting on progress by January 1, 2016. Activities to enhance scientific knowledge on nanomaterials in FDA-regulated products are also mandated. The curr_chunk discusses various requirements and provisions related to new therapies, online pharmacy websites, FDA interactions with small businesses, communication protections for Public Health Service Commissioned Officers, and compliance dates for sunscreen products. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to improve the efficiency of FDA centers, assessments of risk evaluation strategies, extension of generic drug approval period, and deadlines for drug withdrawal determinations. The curr_chunk discusses deadlines for drug withdrawal determinations, electronic submission requirements for drug and biologic applications, and strategies to solicit patients' views during regulatory discussions. The curr_chunk discusses the participation of a patient representative in agency meetings, reviewing and modifying the FDA communication plan, holding a public meeting on products containing hydrocodone, and a report on electronic patient labeling of prescription drugs. The curr_chunk discusses the development of recommendations on interoperability standards for the interstate exchange of prescription drug monitoring program information and advisory committee member conflicts of interest. The curr_chunk discusses the Secretary's responsibilities regarding advisory committees, including outreach strategies for potential members, updating guidance on conflicts of interest, and issuing guidance on financial conflicts of interest. It also prohibits the FDA from issuing guidance on laboratory-developed tests without notifying Congress for five years. Subtitle D of the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 adds specified synthetic drugs to schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act, extending temporary scheduling periods. Congress has directed specific actions to be taken by federal entities within specified timeframes in FDASIA. FDASIA directs federal entities and the regulated industry to take specific actions within specified timeframes. The Secretary of HHS is responsible for over 90% of the requirements, with FDA tracking progress on their website. The appendix lists time-specific requirements, but CRS will not update progress on these actions. The appendix includes provisions for action by the responsible entity by specific dates or within a specified timeframe. Requirements with conditional timing or no explicit time are excluded. Linked requirements are included if at least one meets the selection criteria. Dates are presented in various formats. The appendix presents time-specific requirements in date form to achieve consistent timing presentation. Dates are either provided by FDASIA or calculated based on legislative language. Recurring annual requirements are shown with the month and day of action. Time-specific requirements not tied to a date are noted as such for clarity and efficiency. The appendix presents time-specific requirements in date form to achieve consistent timing presentation. When a time-specific requirement is defined by a range, the table lists the last day of the range. A comparison to the FDA Implementation Tracking Chart shows differences in scope and level of detail, with the FDA chart including only deliverables for which FDA is responsible, while this appendix includes actions required of all federal entities. The appendix presents performance goals negotiated with industry for user fee programs specified in FDASIA. It includes time-specific requirements in date form and does not duplicate FDA's tracking efforts. Statutory deadlines are primarily enforced through private civil litigation, with courts providing agencies deference to allocate resources. Factors from TRAC case are considered for determining agency delays. The D.C. Circuit established factors to consider agency delays in taking required actions. Courts should use a \"rule of reason\" but also consider congressionally imposed deadlines. Missing a deadline does not automatically mean unreasonable delay, as shown in a case involving the Mine Safety and Health Administration. The D.C. Circuit established factors to consider agency delays in taking required actions, using a \"rule of reason\" and considering congressionally imposed deadlines. The court refused to compel the FDA to complete a review of a generic drug application despite missing a statutory deadline. The enforceability of statutory deadlines in court is determined through civil litigation on a case-by-case basis, or through congressional oversight hearings and legislative pressure. Tables 1 through 11 in FDASIA correspond to Titles I through XI, listing sections from various acts and their U.S. Code citations, actors, required actions, and timing references. Abbreviations and acronyms are provided in Appendix B."
