    "content": "The CFPB, created by the Dodd-Frank Act in 2011, is a controversial agency with debates on its effectiveness and accountability. Supporters see it as a consumer protector, while critics view it as overly powerful. Key policy questions revolve around the CFPB's structure for balancing independence and transparency, and its rulemaking's impact on consumer protection and financial access. The report focuses on Congress's consideration of legislation related to the CFPB, examining proposals from the 113th Congress that address consumer financial protection. Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to implement and enforce federal regulations. The CFPB, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, enforces federal consumer financial laws, ensures fair markets, and is headed by a director appointed by the President for a five-year term. The agency can issue rules, examine institutions, and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB is located within the Federal Reserve System, and its rules cannot be vetoed by the Federal Reserve Board. The CFPB, funded through the Federal Reserve System, enforces federal financial consumer laws for large institutions and some nonbank entities. Its funding is capped at 12% of the Federal Reserve's operating expenses, with a transfer cap of $618.7 million for FY2015. The agency can have its proposed rules set aside by a two-thirds vote of the FSOC members. The CFPB does not regulate depositories with less than $10 billion in assets, as they are overseen by prudential regulators for consumer protection. Certain industries are exempt from CFPB regulation, including automobile dealers, merchants, real estate brokers, insurance companies, and accountants. The structure of a government agency can impact its policies. The CFPB's independence from the President or Congress may lead to more technical and less political policymaking, but some argue it lacks accountability due to structural issues like a single director and external funding. Supporters highlight transparency measures such as biannual congressional testimony and funding caps. The CFPB-related legislation, including H.R. 3183 and H.R. 4604, aims to increase transparency and accountability by allowing individuals to request their information held by the CFPB at no cost. H.R. 4604 would allow individuals to opt out of CFPB collecting their personally identifiable information, require deletion of certain information after a period, and provide free credit monitoring in case of a privacy breach. It limits data collection without a Senate-confirmed director and mandates security clearance for employees accessing personal information. The CFPB uses consumer data from various sources to inform its actions. The CFPB collects information from various sources, including consumer complaints, surveys, and data vendors. It focuses on aggregated consumer data to understand market functioning but may access personal identifiers in some cases for restitution purposes. Policies are in place to protect personally identifiable information. The CFPB collects a significant amount of data but takes steps to protect and secure it, including removing personal identifiers and establishing an information-security program. The Government Accountability Office found that additional efforts are needed to reduce the risk of improper collection, use, or release of consumer financial data. The CFPB is taking steps to improve data collection and privacy practices, including implementing security measures and complying with the Paperwork Reduction Act. Critics are concerned about the amount of data collected by the CFPB and advocate for more transparency and consumer control over their data. Opponents argue that destroying data after a certain period and requiring security clearance would protect consumers, but preserving data is crucial for informed decision-making at the CFPB. They believe that keeping data allows for observing long-term consumer trends and that the collected data is mostly anonymous. Critics also argue that the proposed requirements would exceed those of other financial regulators. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that enacting H.R. 3183 would increase spending by $18 million over 2015-2024. H.R. 3193, passed by the House on February 27, 2014, includes five bills reported by the House Financial Services Committee. Enacting H.R. 4604 would cost the CFPB $83 million over 2015-2024, increasing direct spending by that amount. The House passed H.R. 3193 on February 27, 2014, which includes multiple bills reported by the House Financial Services Committee. One of the bills, H.R. 3193, aims to reduce the majority required to set aside or delay a regulation by the CFPB and change the grounds for bringing a petition to set aside a regulation. The House passed H.R. 3193, requiring the CFPB to consider the impact of its rules on depository institutions' safety and soundness. It would replace the CFPB's director and deputy directors with a five-person commission, appointed by the President and subject to Senate confirmation. The CFPB would become a stand-alone agency, no longer under the Federal Reserve, with a budget subject to congressional appropriations. The House passed H.R. 3193, which would subject the CFPB's budget to congressional appropriations, authorize necessary funds through FY2015, and place employee pay on the federal government's schedule. Supporters argue it increases transparency and accountability, while opponents see it as an effort to change the CFPB's funding and oversight structure. The changes to the CFPB's funding and leadership structure are seen as attempts to hinder its consumer protection mission. H.R. 3193 would reduce mandatory spending by $6 billion over 10 years, with a corresponding increase in discretionary spending. H.R. 3389 aims to restrict payments from the CFPB's Civil Penalty Fund to victims of penalized activities. The Civil Penalty Fund, administered by the CFPB, receives penalties from actions under federal consumer financial laws. Funds can compensate victims or be used for consumer education. $119 million was deposited into the fund by May 2014, with $31 million allocated to consumers and $13.4 million to education programs. H.R. 3389 would prevent the CFPB from using the Civil Penalty Fund for consumer education and financial literacy programs. GAO recommended documenting specific factors for funding allocation. CFPB generally agreed with GAO recommendations. Comparisons with other agencies showed differences in fund administration. The CFPB, along with other agencies like the CFTC, SEC, and CMS, have penalty funds that are remitted to Treasury. Supporters of H.R. 3389 criticize the CFPB's Civil Penalty Fund for lacking accountability and discretion in allocating funds. They argue that the CFPB should only use the fund to compensate victims, not for other purposes. Opponents of H.R. 3389 argue against the need for additional financial literacy programs, citing existing government programs. They believe the CFPB should be allowed to use the Civil Penalty Fund for financial literacy. H.R. 3770, which would reduce direct spending by $8 million over 2015-2024, was ordered to be reported by the House Committee on Financial Services on June 11, 2014. H.R. 3770, ordered reported by the House Committee on Financial Services on June 11, 2014, would establish a new federal inspector general for the CFPB, following the guidelines of the Inspector General Act of 1978. This act grants IGs independence and authority to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in federal agencies through audits and investigations. The Inspector General Act Amendments of 1988 created new IGs in designated federal entities, typically smaller agencies, with jurisdiction over programs and operations. Some IGs have authority to cover multiple agencies. H.R. 3770 proposes a new IG for the CFPB to audit and investigate, following the guidelines of the Inspector General Act of 1978. The bill H.R. 3770 proposes a new Inspector General for the CFPB to audit, investigate, and evaluate the agency. The IG would be required to present semiannual reports to congressional committees and receive 2% of the CFPB's annual funding. The President must appoint the CFPB's IG within 60 days of enactment, with the Inspector General of the Federal Reserve System serving in the interim. Upon appointment, the current IGs would be renamed accordingly. H.R. 3770 proposes renaming Financial Protection to Inspector General of the Federal Reserve System. The bill aims to establish a new IG specifically for the CFPB to increase oversight. Proponents argue that a Senate-confirmed IG would hold the CFPB more accountable, while opponents suggest that the Federal Reserve IG already conducts audits on the CFPB, potentially creating redundancies. Establishing a new Inspector General for the CFPB could lead to redundancies and unclear jurisdictional boundaries with the Federal Reserve IG. The proposed bill, H.R. 3770, sets the CFPB OIG's budget at 2% of the CFPB's overall funding, a unique provision compared to other IGs. This could potentially impact federal budget deficits. The bill H.R. 3770 proposes setting the CFPB OIG's budget at 2% of the CFPB's funding, which could limit the OIG's flexibility in requesting additional resources for its mission. Unlike most OIGs funded through appropriations, the CFPB OIG may need a different funding process to directly articulate its needs to Congress. H.R. 3770 would increase budget deficits by $49 million over 10 years. H.R. 4262 requires CFPB advisory committees to follow the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The CFPB was established as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve System, exempt from FACA. Advisory committees provide outside advice to the federal government and may be created by Congress, the President, or agency heads. FACA was passed in 1972 to address inefficiencies in existing advisory committees. FACA sets requirements for advisory committees to ensure balance, objectivity, and public accessibility. The Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Reserve System are exempt from FACA. Congress exempted the Federal Reserve System to reduce duplication of committees and federal costs. The Federal Reserve's Federal Advisory Council is funded through earnings, so applying FACA would not reduce federal appropriations. Supporters of H.R. 4262 argue that applying FACA to advisory committees can improve transparency and trust in governmental operations. Some opponents argue that FACA's requirements impose additional burdens on advisory bodies, hindering their ability to focus on substantive issues. Congress can exempt certain advisory committees from FACA provisions to allow for quicker operations. The Federal Register publication requirement can slow down advisory committee operations, with Congress having the power to exempt committees. Closed-door meetings are allowed under FACA, but H.R. 4262 may increase spending due to additional costs. H.R. 4383, ordered to be reported by the House Committee on Financial Services, would require the CFPB to establish advisory boards for small businesses, credit unions, and community banks. These boards would advise the CFPB on relevant matters and be composed of 15-20 members appointed by the CFPB director. The CFPB director would ensure participation of minority- and women-owned small businesses, credit unions serving underserved communities, and community banks serving underserved populations in advisory boards. Members would receive compensation and have travel expenses covered. The CFPB has short-term advisory boards with limited duration, but proposed permanent boards and councils would provide ongoing feedback on small business, credit union, and community bank concerns. The Academic Research Council, advising on research methodologies, would not be codified by H.R. 4383. The proposed permanent boards and councils would offer additional feedback to the CFPB on various topics identified in the bill. Opponents question the value of these entities compared to their cost, estimated at $4 million over a 10-year period. H.R. 4466, currently before the House Committee on Agriculture, would require the CFPB and other financial regulators to assess their existing federal regulations and orders. The bill H.R. 4466 would require the CFPB and other financial regulators to assess existing federal regulations and orders for conflicts, inconsistencies, or duplications before issuing new ones. Agencies must resolve any issues before finalizing new regulations and submit a report to Congress with recommendations for statutory changes if needed. The proposed requirements in H.R. 4466 are similar to existing executive orders that aim to avoid conflicting, duplicative, or outdated regulations. President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 and President Obama's Executive Orders 13563 and 13579 directed agencies to review and update regulations to eliminate inefficiencies. This includes independent regulatory agencies like the CFPB. The Executive Order 13579 directed independent regulatory agencies, including the CFPB, to conduct a retrospective review of regulations to identify and eliminate outdated or burdensome rules. The CFPB initiated a review of its regulations in December 2011, following guidance from the Office of Management and Budget. There is debate over whether the President can assign such tasks to independent agencies. Having a requirement for retrospective review in statute would emphasize the importance of such reviews at the CFPB and other covered agencies. The CFPB may face challenges in retrospective review due to its newer status, but could benefit from considering inherited regulations. H.R. 4466 aims to mandate retrospective review at the CFPB and other agencies. H.R. 4466 would require the CFPB to consider inherited regulations and prevent duplicative or inconsistent regulations in the future. H.R. 4662 would mandate the CFPB to respond to questions from regulated entities regarding potential violations of consumer financial protection laws within a specified timeframe. The CFPB is considering issuing advisory opinions and providing informal feedback on questions received. They also proposed a Policy of No-Action Letters, where companies can request a letter stating no intention of enforcement action for specific aspects of their product. Supporters of H.R. 4662 argue that the CFPB's methods of providing information to businesses do not offer enough certainty and transparency regarding compliance with federal consumer protection laws. They compare the CFPB's approach to agencies like the IRS, SEC, and FTC, which provide formal opinions in various formats. For example, the IRS issues written determinations to advise taxpayers on certain issues, while the SEC may issue a no-action letter to entities unsure about potential violations of federal securities laws. The SEC staff provides advisory opinions to clarify federal securities laws for businesses. Critics of H.R. 4662 argue that the CFPB's response time requirements are unworkable and could limit its consumer protection activities. H.R. 4804, ordered to be reported by the House Committee on Financial Services, aims to make changes to the CFPB's operations. It would prevent enforcement attorneys from participating in examinations, set criteria for data requests, establish deadlines for examinations, and limit the CFPB to one examination per institution at a time. The CFPB conducts examinations on financial institutions to assess compliance with consumer financial laws, detect risks, and coordinate with other regulators. They are limited to one examination per institution at a time and focus on entities with over $10 billion in assets, including banks, credit unions, payday lenders, and mortgage servicers. The CFPB conducts examinations on financial institutions to assess compliance with consumer financial laws, focusing on entities with over $10 billion in assets. While it is not the primary consumer protection supervisor for depositories with $10 billion or less in assets, it does have some limited supervisory authority over smaller depository institutions. H.R. 4804 would codify some of the CFPB's existing examination practices, including the presence of enforcement attorneys during supervisory examinations. Supporters of H.R. 4804 argue that the bill would provide clarity and certainty about supervisory examinations while reducing the CFPB's discretion. Opponents note that the CFPB is not the primary supervisor for depositories with less than $10 billion in assets. H.R. 4804 would impact the CFPB's supervision of large depositories and nonbank firms, not community banks. Critics argue the CFPB should have discretion in setting examination policies. CBO estimates the bill would increase direct spending by $178 million over 2015-2024 for hiring additional staff. H.R. 4811 would require the CFPB to follow procedural requirements for guidance documents, including public notice and comment periods. The final version of the guidance document, the CFPB would be required to post any \"studies, data, methodologies, analyses, and other information relied on by the Bureau in preparing and issuing such guidance.\" The bill would prohibit Bulletin 2013-02 from taking effect but would not prevent the CFPB from reissuing it after following procedural requirements. Currently, federal agencies are generally required to subject their regulations, but not their guidance documents, to notice and comment procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The APA does not require agencies to make public the studies, data, methodologies, or related information used in developing regulations, but agencies often make this information available. Executive orders encourage agencies to use the best data available and make it public. Proponents argue that guidance documents can have a significant policy impact, even though they cannot impose requirements. Subjecting guidance documents to rulemaking procedures would add transparency and public participation, but opponents argue it would limit agency flexibility. Mandating rulemaking for guidance documents could invite legal challenges and increase costs for the agency. The CFPB's proposed rule would cost $49 million over 2015-2024, increasing direct spending without affecting revenues or discretionary spending. The regulation aims to ensure fair and competitive consumer financial markets, addressing the trade-off between consumer protection and financial provider burden. Some Members of Congress believe the CFPB has struck a balance between consumer protection and credit availability. H.R. 1779, if passed, would alter CFPB's rulemaking. H.R. 1779, discussed by the Committee on Financial Services on May 22, 2014, aims to amend the definitions of mortgage originator and high-cost mortgage in the Truth-in-Lending Act to increase credit availability for manufactured homes. This change may impact the market for manufactured housing, which consists of factory-built single-family homes often located in rural areas. The Dodd-Frank Act previously altered these definitions to provide more borrower protections. H.R. 1779 aims to expand the definition of mortgage originator in the Truth-in-Lending Act to include retailers of manufactured homes or their employees who receive more compensation for a sale that includes a loan. This change is relevant to the manufactured-housing industry as it impacts rules such as the Ability-to-Repay rule. The definition of mortgage originator in the Truth-in-Lending Act may be modified by H.R. 1779 to exclude certain fees paid to manufactured-home retailers from the points and fees cap. This could reduce the risk to lenders, making them more willing to offer credit for manufactured-housing loans, but borrowers may receive fewer consumer protections. The CFPB is considering feedback on the treatment of manufactured-home retailers. The CFPB is addressing concerns about activities permissible for manufactured-home retailers without qualifying them as loan originators. H.R. 1779 would narrow the definition of high-cost mortgages, important for the manufactured-home market. H.R. 1779 aims to amend the definition of high-cost mortgages, reducing the likelihood of triggering the threshold. This would also increase the APR trigger for certain high-cost mortgages, making it less likely for manufactured-home loans to be classified as high-cost. These changes would limit fees, features, and require additional disclosures and housing counseling for high-cost mortgages, potentially benefiting consumers but imposing costs on lenders and potentially limiting credit extension. H.R. 1779 aims to increase the APR threshold for certain loans used to purchase manufactured homes, potentially expanding credit in the market. Supporters argue it would benefit consumers, while opponents fear it could lead to high-interest loans without proper counseling and disclosure. CBO projects minimal direct spending increase to implement changes to TILA. H.R. 2672, passed by the House in 2014, allows individuals to petition the CFPB for rural designation for certain counties. This designation exempts lenders in rural areas from some regulations and provides additional compliance options. The CFPB evaluates these petitions based on established criteria. The CFPB's definition of rural is discretionary, impacting eligibility for qualified mortgages. Lenders in rural areas may offer unique products, but consumers may not have the same protections. Some criticize the inflexibility of the CFPB's rural designation method. The CFPB plans to study adjustments to the definitions of 'rural' or 'underserved' in the next two years. H.R. 2672 is projected to increase direct spending by $3 million over 10 years. H.R. 2673 would create a new category of Qualified Mortgages based on creditor balance sheet inclusion. The CFPB established the definition for Qualified Mortgages (QM) as part of the Ability-to-Repay (ATR) rule. Lenders must ensure borrowers can repay the loan based on documented information. QM mortgages meet specific underwriting and product-feature requirements, such as debt-to-income ratios and fee thresholds. Compliance with the ATR rule is presumed when offering a QM. Non-compliance could lead to legal liability. The additional QM compliance option proposed by H.R. 2673 would allow any mortgage held by the lender that originated it to receive QM status without underwriting or product-feature requirements. Some argue that the ATR rule has negatively impacted lenders, especially those holding mortgages in their portfolios, as they should have discretion over the types of mortgages they originate and to whom they lend. Proponents of H.R. 2673 argue that mortgages held in the lender's portfolio should receive QM status without additional underwriting requirements. Critics suggest that the lender's risk may not align with the borrower's incentives, especially in a rising housing market where the lender may prioritize the home's value over the borrower's ability to repay. Critics are concerned that establishing a QM compliance option without additional underwriting requirements could leave consumers vulnerable to abusive practices. H.R. 2673 would have insignificant effects on direct spending and would not impact revenues or discretionary spending. H.R. 3211, passed by the House, would modify the definition of points and fees for a QM. The definition of points and fees for a Qualified Mortgage (QM) is being modified to exclude certain costs, potentially allowing more expensive mortgages to qualify for QM status. Concerns exist that lenders may be less inclined to offer non-QM mortgages, emphasizing the importance of a broader QM definition for credit availability. Compliance with the Ability-to-Repay (ATR) rule is presumed when offering a QM, which requires meeting specific underwriting and product-feature criteria, including limits on points and fees. The definition of points and fees for a Qualified Mortgage (QM) is crucial for credit availability. H.R. 3211 aims to expand credit availability by excluding certain costs from the definition of points and fees, potentially allowing more mortgages to receive QM status. This change could also promote fair competition among real estate-related services. H.R. 3211 aims to expand credit availability by excluding certain costs from the definition of points and fees, promoting fair competition among real estate-related services. CBO projects that the bill would have an insignificant effect on direct spending. H.R. 4521, on the other hand, would make modifications to CFPB mortgage rules to reduce the regulatory burden on small lenders. An escrow account is set up by mortgage lenders to cover property-related expenses like taxes and insurance. The amount owed is divided and added to the borrower's monthly payment, which is then placed in the escrow account for annual or semiannual payments. Maintaining escrow accounts can be costly for some banks, especially smaller lenders. Higher-priced mortgage loans require an escrow account for at least one year. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the escrow account requirement for higher-priced mortgage loans from one year to five years, with certain conditions for early termination. The CFPB issued a rule with additional disclosure requirements and exemptions for lenders in rural or underserved areas with fewer mortgages and lower assets. H.R. 4521 would expand the exemption for lenders regarding escrow requirements for mortgages held in their portfolio. It also addresses the role of mortgage servicers as intermediaries between mortgage holders and borrowers. Mortgage servicers collect payments from borrowers, work with delinquent borrowers to bring them current, and handle foreclosures for defaulting borrowers. They faced increased scrutiny after the housing bubble burst, leading to additional requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act and CFPB regulations. These rules include disclosure requirements, payment crediting guidelines, error resolution obligations, foreclosure initiation guidelines, and borrower contact continuity mandates. H.R. 4521 would modify the exemption for small mortgage servicers under RESPA, directing the CFPB to provide exemptions or adjustments for servicers that service 20,000 or fewer loans. Small servicers are exempt from certain disclosure requirements but must comply with mandates from Dodd-Frank, such as continuity-of-contact rules. H.R. 4521 aims to provide exemptions or adjustments for small mortgage servicers under RESPA, specifically those servicing 20,000 or fewer mortgages. Supporters argue that small financial institutions should be exempted from regulations to reduce the burden on smaller lenders. The bill would expand exemptions for small lenders and only apply the escrow account exemption to lenders below the $10 billion threshold holding the loan in their portfolio. The CBO projects that H.R. 4521 would increase direct spending by less than $500,000 in 2015 for expenses of the CFPB to prepare and enforce new rules, without affecting revenues or discretionary spending. Critics argue that expanding exemptions for small lenders would weaken consumer protections, especially for mortgage servicers who performed poorly during the foreclosure crisis."
