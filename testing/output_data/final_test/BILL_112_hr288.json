    "content": "The \"Renewable Energy Applied Partnerships (REAP) Act\" may be cited as the short title. The Act includes a pilot program for applied sciences in renewable energy. The Secretary of Energy will establish a research pilot program to award grants for partnerships improving education and training in renewable energy applied sciences. Grants can be used for teacher professional development, equipment purchase, facility improvement, and instructional program development. The Secretary of Energy will award grants for partnerships to integrate education and training in renewable energy applied sciences. Grants will support recruitment of new faculty, collaboration between faculty and industry partners, student outreach efforts, and assessment of funded activities. Partnerships must include a 2-year degree granting institution, a 4-year degree granting institution, a business or nonprofit organization, and a labor organization. The Secretary of Energy will award grants for partnerships in renewable energy fields, giving preference to those with technical preparation programs or long-term program stability without federal funding. Grants will ensure diversity in subject matter and partnerships may include educational agencies, public agencies, National Laboratories, or community-based organizations. The Federal share of activities funded by grants under this Act is limited to 40 percent, with a maximum grant amount of $1,000,000 per year. The Secretary of Energy must make project-related materials public and require grant recipients to submit reports on project outcomes within 3 years, including successful elements, failures, and potential improvements. The Secretary must make reports on project outcomes public, including analysis of potential improvements for success. The term \"renewable energy\" is defined in accordance with the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. The Secretary of Energy will evaluate activities under the Act and submit a report to specified committees. The report will highlight best practices and materials developed by grant partnerships. Authorization of appropriations includes $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, with additional funding for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 as needed."
