    "content": "In the early and mid-1970s, Congress established modern campaign finance policy, including regulations on contributions, expenditures, and disclosure. The 1974 FECA amendments and the Buckley v. Valeo decision in 1976 shaped the regulatory framework. The creation of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) was a key component of the amendments, symbolizing the ongoing debate on campaign finance policy. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is responsible for enforcing federal campaign finance laws, administering public financing for presidential campaigns, and providing campaign finance data on its website. Some criticize the FEC's bipartisan structure for hindering substantive action, leading to inadequate interpretation and enforcement of campaign finance laws. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is insulated from excessive partisanship and tensions about campaign finance law have been evident throughout its history. Working relationships among commissioners are increasingly important, with some openly criticizing their colleagues and the agency. As the FEC marked its 40th anniversary in 2015, officials debated various details, questioning the significance of the agency's anniversary. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has faced dysfunction and controversy, with reports questioning its anniversary significance. Congressional discussions on FEC organization, duties, and policy debates are crucial. The report provides context for Congress to consider oversight, funding, nominations, and potential restructuring of the FEC. Various issues, from administrative matters to campaign finance law changes, are relevant for Congress to address. Congress considers the FEC and its functions, providing a resource for examining policy questions and options of interest. The report does not analyze commission activity or discuss relationships with related agencies. It interchangeably uses the terms \"FEC,\" \"commission,\" and \"agency.\" Discussions of the FEC's authority beyond the report's scope are noted, primarily in another CRS report. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency with six members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The agency was last reauthorized in 1980 and has a professional staff of approximately 350 employees. The appointment process for commissioners has changed over time, with the most recent confirmation in 2013. Congress holds oversight hearings on the FEC periodically, with the most recent one in 2011. Major legislation related to the FEC dating back to 1995 is listed in the report's Appendix. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has a professional staff of approximately 350 employees, most of whom are civil servants. The agency's budget requests are sent directly to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget. In FY2015, Congress allocated $67.5 million to the FEC, with a request for $76.1 million in FY2016. The FEC's funding is typically included in the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bills. The FEC's origins date back to the 1960s, with modern campaign finance policy established in the 1970s through the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). In the early 1960s, modern campaign finance policy began with the enactment of FECA in the 1970s. Congress initially assigned campaign finance administrative authority to the House, Senate, and the Comptroller General. The 1971 FECA focused on disclosure of financial activity, dividing administrative and enforcement responsibilities among three supervisory offices. The Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate were tasked with administering the act for each chamber. The House and Secretary of the Senate, along with the Comptroller General, were responsible for administering the 1971 FECA. Longtime Committee on House Administration Chairman Wayne Hays supported the \"supervisory officer\" system but faced concerns about enforcement and independence. Fundraising controversies in the 1972 election cycle led to calls for an independent campaign finance agency, especially as the Watergate scandal unfolded in 1973-1974. The 1974 FECA amendments led to the creation of the FEC as an independent campaign finance agency, following the Watergate scandal. The Supreme Court's 1976 Buckley decision invalidated the FEC's initial appointment structure, which was unique and reflected various congressional proposals. The FEC's unique bipartisan structure was established as a compromise to balance independence and congressional control. Initially, eight positions were designated, with appointments made by the President, Senate President pro tempore, and House Clerk. This structure has been both praised for insulating the agency and criticized for hindering its effectiveness and leading to charges of partisan bias. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) was initially established with commissioners appointed by the President, Senate President pro tempore, and House Clerk. However, court decisions in Buckley and FEC v. NRA Political Victory Fund led to changes in the appointment method. In 1976, Congress revised the appointment process, and today all commissioners are appointed by the President with Senate approval. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) commissioners are appointed by the President with Senate approval. Qualifications for commissioners include experience, integrity, impartiality, and good judgment. They come from various backgrounds such as congressional staffers, political professionals, or election lawyers. The FEC can function with as few as four members, and no more than three commissioners can be affiliated with the same political party. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) commissioners are appointed by the President with Senate approval. Commissioners must have experience, integrity, impartiality, and good judgment. The commission can have as few as four members, with no more than three from the same political party. Commissioner terms are staggered, with two terms expiring every other April 30 during odd-numbered years. Currently, commissioners serve a single six-year term, and new commissioners may be nominated to replace resigning or deceased appointees. Some FEC commissioners have assumed office when the term for which they were nominated was already underway. Commissioners can remain in office in \"holdover\" status after their terms expire until a successor takes office. Most current commissioners are serving in holdover status as of late 2015. Expired terms are not necessarily a policy concern. In 2008, the FEC faced a challenge when its membership fell below four members, causing a loss of policymaking quorum. The four-vote threshold is crucial for authorizing significant agency activities. This issue was highlighted in 2008 due to expired recess appointments and ongoing Senate considerations. In 2008, the FEC faced a challenge with its membership dropping below four members, leading to a loss of policymaking quorum. To address this, the agency amended its rules to allow for certain duties to be carried out with fewer than four members. After new commissioners were confirmed in June 2008, the FEC dealt with a backlog of enforcement matters and other agency business. The FEC has since maintained a full policymaking quorum. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has a history of controversy, with disagreements among commissioners and differing views on the agency's role being prominent issues. Criticisms include the FEC's failure to reach consensus on key policy questions, leading to stalemates on rulemakings and enforcement actions. These debates, while not covered in depth in this report, are important for Congress to consider. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has faced criticism for rulemakings that have undermined congressional intent, especially after the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. Policy disagreements and external influences can impact the rulemaking process, with public and interest-group perspectives shaping outcomes. The FEC must navigate these challenges to implement laws as written by Congress and interpreted by courts, with the 2010 Citizens United ruling being a recent example. The Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling has influenced the Federal Election Commission's policy debates and operations. Disagreements on disclosure and enforcement have been prominent, mirroring debates in Congress. The decision invalidated FECA's prohibitions on corporate and union funding of independent expenditures, impacting the commission's environment. Despite the ruling, the FEC struggled to agree on implementing rules for almost five years. In late 2014, the FEC approved rules to remove invalidated regulations post-Citizens United, but did not require additional disclosure on independent spending, sparking debates on the agency's role in issuing new rules. The FEC has faced deadlocked votes and policy disagreements, with some commissioners pushing for more disclosure on spending post-Citizens United. Campaign lawyers suggest finding compromise on compliance questions, while some practitioners seek answers through the advisory opinion process instead of final rules. \"Deadlocked\" votes indicate disagreements, with any vote without at least four votes for or against a decision considered a deadlock. The FEC has faced deadlocked votes, with any vote without at least four votes for or against a decision considered a deadlock. Deadlocked votes essentially halt substantive commission action on unresolved matters. The FEC does not regularly compile and release summary deadlocks data, with the most recent official statistical summary dating back to 2009. In 2008-2009, the FEC deadlocked on approximately 13% of closed Matters Under Review and 17% of advisory opinions. In 2014, commissioners faced deadlocks in their vote tallies. In 2014, FEC commissioners deadlocked on 24.4% of closed MURs. There is debate about the significance of deadlocks, with disagreements on whether they hinder rulemaking or enforcement. Deadlocks have impacted policy decisions on post-Citizens United rules, coordination among political committees, and staff vacancies. The FEC commissioners deadlocked on 24.4% of closed MURs in 2014, leading to debates on their significance. Despite disagreements, the FEC manages to reach agreement on most issues, with Chairman Lee Goodman highlighting a high majority vote rate. Ambiguity surrounds deadlocks due to the lack of a standard counting method, as seen in the example of MUR 6729. The FEC commissioners deadlocked on various questions regarding MUR 6729 at the agency's September 16, 2014 meeting. The counting method for deadlocks is ambiguous, with debates on whether individual disagreements or overall decision-making halts are more important. The controversy and political sensitivity surrounding deadlocked votes at the FEC are a focal point of debate. Some view deadlocks as a failure to enforce campaign finance law, while others see them as a sign of careful consideration of legal boundaries. Focusing on deadlock statistics may not provide meaningful information as they only show vote outcomes, not the reasons behind decisions. This can understate conflict if votes are postponed to avoid formal deadlocks. The commission postponed a vote to avoid a formal deadlock, raising questions about whether deadlocks are a public policy concern. Congress anticipated deadlocks in controversial cases, creating conflict within the FEC to prevent partisan use of the commission. The Congress created conflict within the FEC through its six-member structure, with deadlocks preventing consensus on law enforcement and guidance for planned activities. Despite disagreements, the FEC has consistently faced challenges in reaching decisions. The FEC has faced challenges in reaching decisions due to disagreements within its six-member structure. The commission has made legislative requests for changes, including the proposal to require Senate political committees to file campaign finance reports electronically, which Congress has not acted upon. The FEC has recommended expanding prohibitions on campaign misconduct, including fraudulent misrepresentation and misuse of campaign funds. Congress has not enacted legislation requiring electronic filing, and some proposed changes have been tied to controversial campaign finance provisions. The FEC has expressed concerns about questionable campaign conduct that falls outside current regulations. The FEC has proposed making the Administrative Fine Program permanent to streamline enforcement for late reports. They also seek authorization to convert some Senior Level management positions to Senior Executive Service status to attract a larger applicant pool. The FEC has proposed making the Administrative Fine Program permanent to streamline enforcement for late reports. They also seek authorization to convert some Senior Level management positions to Senior Executive Service status to attract a larger applicant pool. SES appointees occupy senior civilian management positions in executive branch agencies, while SL positions are more common in agencies providing specialized services. The FEC lacks permanent occupants in several senior positions, including the general counsel position vacant since July 2013. The FEC has faced challenges in filling key positions, including the general counsel role, which has been vacant since July 2013. The frequent turnover in senior positions has been flagged by the FEC Inspector General as hindering the organization's effectiveness in carrying out its mission. Permanently filling these positions has been described as challenging by FEC management. The FEC has struggled to fill key positions, with the Inspector General questioning the dual role of staff director and CIO. Low morale among FEC personnel is also a concern, with a satisfaction index of 43%. Proposals to reorganize the FEC have been made, including changing the commissioner structure to avoid deadlocks. The FEC's bipartisan structure intentionally promotes deadlock along party lines on important issues. Restructuring the agency to eliminate even number of commissioners could reduce deadlocks and improve consensus. However, major reforms beyond addressing deadlocked votes may be necessary, and a legislative overhaul of the agency would likely be controversial. No significant campaign finance legislation has been enacted since BCRA (2002). Efforts to revamp the FEC may be difficult due to the cyclical nature of support for campaign finance legislation. Changing the commission or pursuing other major policy goals could be accomplished with sufficient demand in Congress or the public sphere. Various restructuring options have been proposed, such as giving the general counsel tie-breaking authority or creating a more enforcement-oriented agency with a powerful chair. Analysis of these options is not within the scope of this report. Recent discussions at FEC open meetings suggest consensus on transparency issues like updating the agency's website and providing more formal ways for regulated individuals to interact with the commission. This includes allowing those seeking advisory opinions to appear before the commission to address questions about their requests, addressing previous frustrations. The FEC rejected proposals to allow other parties to comment on advisory opinion requests in 2009 and 2015. Commissioners have differing views on transparency, particularly regarding public input on campaign finance policy. Campaign finance policy focuses on disclosure to prevent corruption in campaign transactions. Congress has generally favored disclosure, with the FEC responsible for facilitating it. Despite some erosion in consensus on disclosure requirements, the FEC is praised for publicizing campaign finance data. The FEC is seen as a bureaucratic sideshow in American politics, but is credited with success in making campaign finance data open to the public. Despite some criticism of outdated systems, the FEC is praised for providing timely access to campaign finance data, with reports available on their website within 48 hours. In FY2014, the FEC received almost 69,000 disclosure documents containing over 26 million transactions. The FEC has recommended that Senate political committees file reports electronically to improve data integration. IT is crucial for the FEC's operations, with costs accounting for 16% of the agency's budget in FY2016. The FEC's IT security has been a challenge since FY2004, with breaches affecting public data access. Attacks during the 2013 government shutdown disrupted operations, taking weeks to fully recover. Concerns about information security persist despite some progress. The FEC's IT security challenges have raised concerns, including the decision to have one person serve as staff director and CIO. The OIG removed IT security as a management challenge in 2015 due to management actions and a commitment to stronger security standards. However, the FEC still struggles with implementing IT projects, and the OIG will continue to monitor their progress. The FEC's website is crucial for compliance information and campaign finance reports. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has prioritized revamping its website, partnering with 18F to gather feedback and launch a new \"beta site\" in 2015 with enhanced data analysis features. The agency faces criticism for both doing too little and too much, with ongoing work on the new site. The report emphasizes key topics for Congress to consider regarding the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and its operations. Congress may need to reexamine the FEC's role and whether it meets current needs, including potential changes to agency design or laws enforced. This could involve a broad reevaluation of federal campaign finance policy, such as contribution limits and disclosure requirements. Reconsidering major topics like contribution limits, disclosure requirements, and independent spending may be preferable to narrow technical changes in campaign finance policy. Fundamental changes to campaign finance policy and altering the FEC are likely to be controversial and protracted. Congress needs to decide if they want to change the status quo and if the FEC should focus primarily on enforcement, disclosure, or other tasks. They also need to consider if other agencies should take on additional duties and how much discretion the commission should have in prioritizing its mission. Congress needs to consider various aspects of the FEC's structure and operations, including its bipartisan composition, funding adequacy, commissioner relations, legislative recommendations, and external critiques. These considerations will help determine the agency's legitimacy, partisanship, and effectiveness in carrying out its mission. The FEC can control much of its agenda, set the overall tone for the agency, allocate resources, and prioritize enforcement. However, it cannot establish its own statutory mandate, unilaterally reconcile campaign finance law, or change First Amendment provisions protecting regulated conduct."
