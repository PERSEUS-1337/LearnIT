    "content": "The \"College Savings Protection Act\" is the short title of the Act. It includes modifications to qualified tuition programs. The \"College Savings Protection Act\" includes amendments to qualified tuition programs, allowing eligible educational institutions to maintain them. Amendments also limit private qualified tuition programs to benefit plans established by states or agencies. Conforming amendments are made to various sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"College Savings Protection Act\" amends sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by replacing \"qualified State tuition\" with \"qualified tuition\" in various headings and sections related to qualified tuition programs. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to exclude education distributions from qualified tuition programs from gross income. This includes in-kind and cash distributions for qualified higher education expenses. Cash distributions for qualified higher education expenses not exceeding the expenses described in the previous clause are not taxable. If the distributions exceed the expenses, the taxable amount is reduced proportionally. Any benefit provided to a designated beneficiary in a qualified tuition program is considered a distribution to the beneficiary. The total qualified higher education expenses for an individual in a taxable year are reduced by the amount taken into account for the hope and lifetime learning credits. The credit allowed under section 25A is determined based on the aggregate distributions exceeding qualified higher education expenses for an individual in a taxable year. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, allocating expenses among distributions for determining exclusions under sections 529(c)(3)(B)(i) and 530(d)(2). Conforming amendments are made to sections 135(d)(2)(B) and 221(e)(2)(A) of the Code."
