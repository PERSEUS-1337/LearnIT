    "content": "The Higher Education Act of 1965 authorizes federal student loan programs including Direct Loan, FFEL, and Perkins Loan. As of December 31, 2019, $1.5 trillion in loans remained outstanding, with 42.8 million borrowers. Direct Loan debt totaled $1.3 trillion for 35.3 million borrowers, while FFEL program debt was $257.2 billion for 11.8 million borrowers. In 2019, approximately 11.8 million borrowers owed about $257.2 billion in FFEL program debt, with $87.7 billion held by ED and $169.3 billion held by private lenders. Additionally, about 1.9 million borrowers owed approximately $5.9 billion in Perkins Loans as of December 31, 2019. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, questions have arisen regarding student loan repayment flexibilities and debt relief options available under the Higher Education Act. The enactment of the CARES Act provides student loan relief measures. This report outlines repayment flexibilities and debt relief provisions for borrowers facing financial difficulties due to the pandemic. It discusses pre-existing loan terms, administrative and congressional actions taken to address student loan debt during COVID-19, and additional authorities for student loan relief. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, statutes and regulations authorized various relief measures for student loan borrowers. These included deferment and forbearance periods, income-driven repayment plans, and interest subsidies during deferment. Deferment allows borrowers to temporarily suspend monthly payments, with the option of capitalizing accrued interest at the end of the deferment period. Deferment periods do not count towards qualifying for loan forgiveness. Borrowers must apply for deferment for reasons like unemployment or economic hardship, especially relevant during COVID-19. During an unemployment deferment, borrowers employed less than full-time may receive a deferment for up to three years, with interest subsidy on certain types of loans. Borrowers must be actively seeking full-time employment to qualify. During an economic hardship deferment, borrowers must meet specific income criteria or be receiving public assistance to qualify. The deferment can last up to one year at a time, with a maximum of three years. Interest subsidy is provided on certain types of loans during this deferment period. During forbearance, borrowers can temporarily stop making payments, pay reduced amounts, or extend payment periods. No interest subsidies are provided, and all accrued interest is added to the loan balance at the end of the forbearance period. Forbearance does not count towards the 120 monthly payments required for PSLF. Forbearance allows borrowers to temporarily pause or reduce loan payments, but it does not count towards the 120 monthly payments needed for PSLF. General forbearance can be requested for financial hardships, employment changes, or medical expenses, lasting up to 12 months and renewable for a maximum of 36 months. During forbearance, borrowers can temporarily pause or reduce loan payments for up to 12 months, renewable for a maximum of 36 months. Unpaid interest is capitalized at the end of the forbearance period. To qualify, borrowers must have a federal student loan debt burden exceeding 20% of their monthly taxable income. Borrowers can request forbearance if their required monthly payments on federal student loans equal or exceed that amount. Borrowers can also opt for Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans, capping payments at a share of discretionary income over 20 to 25 years. Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans allow borrowers to cap their monthly payments at a percentage of discretionary income over a repayment period of 20 to 25 years. At the end of the repayment period, any remaining loan balance is forgiven. Several IDR plans are available, including Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), Income-Based Repayment (IBR), Pay As You Earn (PAYE), and Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) plans. Direct Loan borrowers are eligible for all plans, while FFEL program borrowers can only access IBR plans. Perkins Loan borrowers are not eligible for IDR plans. Recently, ED and Congress have provided relief to federal student loan borrowers, including cancelling Direct Loans for periods when individuals withdrew due to COVID-19, waiving loan limitations for affected students, setting interest rates to 0% on qualifying loans, and expanding forbearance options. Borrowers on Income-Driven Repayment plans must annually update income and family size to remain eligible, with monthly payments recalculated accordingly. Under the Higher Education Act (HEA), Direct Loan borrowers may need to repay loans if they do not complete a payment or enrollment period at an institution. Procedures for repayment vary based on attendance status. Title IV funds, including Direct Loans, must be returned if a student does not start or withdraws from a period. Institutions must notify ED or loan servicers when a student does not attend, and servicers issue final demands for repayment. In cases where a student does not begin attendance, loan servicers send a final demand letter requiring repayment within 30 days. If the borrower fails to comply, they are considered in default. In response to COVID-19, ED provided flexibility for institutions regarding Direct Loan returns for students unable to start due to school closures. This waiver allows borrowers to repay loans according to the promissory note terms without demand letters. The CARES Act authorizes waivers for Return of Title IV Aid procedures, including canceling a borrower's obligation to repay a Direct Loan if they withdraw from school due to a qualifying emergency. Repayment of Direct Loans is based on the terms of the promissory note, with a six-month grace period before repayment begins. Since July 1, 2013, a student can only borrow Direct Subsidized Loans for up to 150% of the published length of their academic program. If they exceed this limit, they lose the interest subsidy and must pay the accruing interest. The CARES Act allows exclusion of semesters not completed due to a qualifying emergency from this maximum eligibility period. The repayment period for Direct Loan, FFEL, and Perkins Loan program loans begins after a grace period following enrollment on at least a half-time basis. Direct PLUS Loans and Consolidation Loans require repayment to start when fully disbursed. Loans must be repaid after a grace period following at least half-time enrollment. Borrowers may qualify for deferment if enrolled at least half-time, with interest accruing during deferment. Flexibilities have been announced for borrowers whose in-school status was interrupted due to COVID-19. The Education Department allows schools to delay reporting student withdrawals due to COVID-19 closures. Interest is charged on Direct, FFEL, and Perkins Loans, with some exceptions for subsidized loans. Interest rates on federally held student loans are set to 0% until September 30, 2020 under the CARES Act. The CARES Act sets interest rates on federally held student loans to 0% until September 30, 2020. Borrowers will not accrue interest during this time, allowing them to enter deferment or forbearance without worrying about interest. Payments made during this period will go towards the loan principal. Borrowers do not need to apply for the 0% interest rate, as the Education Department will adjust their accounts automatically. Additionally, FFEL program lenders and Perkins Loan holders may also offer the 0% interest rate voluntarily. Borrowers ineligible for the 0% interest rate can consolidate their loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan to qualify. This allows them to temporarily cease payments without accruing interest or facing capitalization. Borrowers have options for temporary payment cessation, such as forbearance and deferment, until September 30, 2020. Additionally, ED and Congress have expanded deferment and forbearance options for qualifying loans. Federally held student loans will be placed in administrative forbearance from March 13, 2020, through September 30, 2020. Borrowers do not need to apply for this benefit as payments will be automatically suspended. Borrowers can opt out by contacting their loan servicer and request refunds for any payments made during this period. FFEL program lenders and Perkins Loan holders can also offer this forbearance voluntarily. The CARES Act specified that each month of suspended loan payments will count towards loan forgiveness programs or rehabilitation programs for Direct Loan borrowers, even though forbearance periods typically do not count towards qualifying payments for PSLF. Borrowers with FFEL or Perkins loans can consolidate into a Direct Consolidation Loan to access the forbearance benefit. The special administrative forbearance due to the CARES Act will count towards qualifying payments for PSLF, IDR plans, and loan rehabilitation. Suspended payments on nonfederally held FFEL program loans may also count towards IDR plans. Perkins Loans are ineligible for IDR plans. Institutions holding Perkins Loans can grant forbearance. The ED authorized institutions holding Perkins Loans to grant forbearance to borrowers unable to make payments due to COVID-19. The forbearance period can be extended with supporting documentation and counts towards the three-year limit. Defaulting on a federal student loan accelerates repayment and results in loss of borrower benefits. The ED may transfer defaulted borrower accounts to a private collection agency for voluntary debt resolution options. If voluntary attempts fail, involuntary collection practices may be used, including wage garnishment and offset of federal benefits. From March 13, 2020, to September 30, 2020, involuntary debt collection practices will be halted. The Department of Education has suspended proactive collection activities for federally held student loans, including Direct Loan program loans, FFEL, and Perkins Loan program loans. Borrowers with federal tax refunds or Social Security benefits being withheld between March 13, 2020, and September 30, 2020, will have the offset portion returned. Wages garnished during the same period will be refunded. Institutions are authorized to stop collection activities on defaulted Perkins Loans they hold until September 30, 2020, upon borrower notification. To regain Title IV student aid eligibility, a defaulted federal student loan borrower must make six on-time, voluntary monthly payments. Loan rehabilitation offers defaulted borrowers a chance to reinstate their loans and restore borrower benefits. Borrowers can also use a new Direct Consolidation Loan to pay off defaulted loans after making three consecutive on-time payments. The CARES Act allows borrowers of defaulted federal student loans to regain eligibility for Title IV student aid by making on-time monthly payments. Information about the loans, including repayment status, is reported to consumer agencies regularly. Any suspended payments under the Act will be reported as regularly scheduled payments until September 30, 2020. The Teacher Loan Forgiveness program offers loan forgiveness to borrowers of qualifying Direct Loan and FFEL program loans who serve as full-time teachers for at least five consecutive years in a school serving low-income families. The CARES Act allows for non-consecutive qualifying teaching years if interrupted by a qualifying emergency, with service before, during, and after the emergency counting towards the total. The HEROES Act provides flexibility and authority for the Secretary to waive or modify requirements for HEA Title IV student aid programs during a national emergency. It applies to individuals serving on active duty, those in disaster areas declared by officials, and others affected by the emergency. The HEROES Act offers support to student loan borrowers affected by national emergencies, including those in active duty, disaster areas, or facing economic hardship due to military operations. Borrowers may receive grace periods, in-school status extensions, and interest payments on certain loans. The HEROES Act provides support for student loan borrowers affected by national emergencies, offering grace periods, in-school status extensions, and interest payments on certain loans. Borrowers in specific categories of affected individuals may retain deferment for up to three years with interest paid on FFEL Stafford Loans. Perkins Loan borrowers in these categories may receive forbearance without the usual three-year limit, with the option for oral request and additional transition periods. Borrowers of FFEL program loans in specific categories of affected individuals may receive forbearance for one year with an oral request and without written documentation, along with an additional three-month transition period. Qualifying service for Teacher Loan Forgiveness or Perkins Loan Cancellation will not be interrupted during these periods. Defaulted borrowers seeking loan rehabilitation may have missed payments during these periods disregarded. For borrowers in specific categories of affected individuals seeking to reestablish eligibility for federal student aid or consolidate loans out of default, missed payments during certain periods will not interrupt the required series of payments. Borrowers in specific categories affected by circumstances may maintain their current payment amount for up to three years, including a three-month transition period, without needing to provide annual income documentation. This flexibility allows them to avoid adjustment to a standard 10-year repayment plan."
