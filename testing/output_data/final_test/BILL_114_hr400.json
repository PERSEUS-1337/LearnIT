    "content": "The bill is known as the \"Trafficking Prevention in Foreign Affairs Contracting Act.\" The bill \"Trafficking Prevention in Foreign Affairs Contracting Act\" highlights the reliance of the Department of State and USAID on contractors for services in foreign countries. Contractors sometimes employ vulnerable foreign workers from developing countries, as reported by the Office of the Inspector General in January 2011. The Inspector General found that foreign workers in certain Middle East countries were coerced by contractors to pay high recruitment fees, resulting in debt bondage. Many workers were charged fees exceeding six months' salary, with some unable to pay off the debt within two years. The Government Accountability Office reported in November 2014 that oversight of contractors' use of foreign workers by the Department of State, USAID, and the Defense Department needs to be strengthened. The GAO report recommended that agencies overseeing contractors' use of foreign workers in high-risk environments should develop precise definitions of recruitment fees and ensure that prevention of trafficking in persons is included in contract monitoring plans. The Department of Defense was the only agency to expressly concur with the GAO's recommendation and committed to defining recruitment fees in its acquisition regulations. The Department of State and USAID do not have clear definitions of prohibited recruitment fees, which increases the risk of debt bondage and trafficking among foreign workers. The Department of State and USAID lack clear definitions of prohibited recruitment fees, increasing the risk of trafficking among foreign workers. GAO found that monitoring compliance with trafficking requirements in contracts was inconsistent. The Department of State and USAID are working on defining placement and recruitment fees to prevent trafficking in persons. They are also enhancing contract monitoring to ensure compliance with anti-trafficking requirements. The Department of State and USAID are tasked with submitting reports to Congress within 180 days to define placement and recruitment fees for anti-trafficking compliance. The Department of State and USAID must submit reports to Congress defining placement and recruitment fees for anti-trafficking compliance, as well as how this definition will be applied to grants, contracts, and other practices involving workers. Actions taken and planned to ensure compliance will also be detailed in the report. The Department of State and USAID must submit reports to Congress on preventing trafficking in persons in grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. In this Act, the term \"trafficking in persons\" is defined as per the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. Passed by the House of Representatives on February 1, 2016."
