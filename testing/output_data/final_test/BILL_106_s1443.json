    "content": "The Act titled \"Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Improvement Act of 1999\" aims to enhance counseling services in schools. Congress finds that elementary and secondary school children are facing unprecedented social stresses, leading to distress symptoms and increased rates of violent crimes. Up to one in five children and youth have severe psychological problems requiring professional help. Congress finds that only 20 percent of youth with mental disorders receive professional help, highlighting the need for psychological counseling in schools. School counselors, psychologists, and social workers play a crucial role in promoting students' academic success and emotional well-being. The national student-to-counselor ratio in schools is 531 to 1. The recommended student-to-psychologist ratio in schools is 2300 to 1. It is suggested to have 1 full-time counselor for every 250 students, 1 psychologist for every 1,000 students, and 1 school social worker for every 800 students to address students' mental health needs effectively. The Federal Government can help reduce academic, social, and emotional problems among students by promoting model school counseling programs. The Federal Government aims to enhance counseling services for elementary and secondary school children by providing grants to local educational agencies for the development of model school counseling programs. This is to reduce the risk of future unemployment and aid in the school-to-work transition. SEC. 10102 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to focus on elementary and secondary school counseling demonstration programs. The Secretary may award grants to local educational agencies for counseling programs in elementary and secondary schools, prioritizing those with the greatest need for services, innovative approaches, and potential for replication. The Secretary may award grants to local educational agencies for counseling programs in elementary and secondary schools. Grants must ensure equitable distribution among different regions and areas, have a duration of up to three years, and not exceed $400,000 per fiscal year. Agencies must submit applications describing the targeted school population. The section outlines the description of the school population targeted by the counseling program, their specific needs, available resources, activities, services, training provided, evaluation methods, and collaborative efforts with other institutions. The applicant must collaborate with various organizations to enhance the program, work with higher education institutions to improve graduate programs for school counselors, psychologists, and social workers, have qualified personnel, serve diverse cultural populations, and ensure proper use of funds. The program must ensure funds supplement non-Federal sources, appoint an advisory board, and use funds appropriately. The program funded under this section must comply with specific requirements, including being comprehensive in addressing students' needs, using a preventive counseling approach, and expanding services through qualified professionals. School social workers use innovative approaches to enhance children's understanding of relationships, decision-making, and social functioning. They provide well-balanced counseling services through group and individual sessions, as well as consultations with parents and school personnel. Additionally, they offer inservice training for various school professionals and involve parents in the process. The counseling program should involve parents, collaborate with various entities, evaluate effectiveness annually, and maintain a ratio of 1 school counselor to 250 students. The legislation mandates specific student-to-counselor ratios and worktime requirements for school counselors, social workers, and psychologists funded under the program. Additionally, the Secretary is required to evaluate the programs assisted by the grants at the end of each grant period.
