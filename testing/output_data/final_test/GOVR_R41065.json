    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates the nation's largest integrated direct health care delivery system through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The VA health care system is truly public, with the federal government owning the facilities and employing the providers. It is organized into 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) with management authority delegated to them. The network includes 153 hospitals, 135 nursing homes, and 803 other facilities. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates a vast health care delivery network with 153 hospitals, 135 nursing homes, 803 outpatient clinics, 6 independent clinics, and 271 Vet Centers. Eligibility for VA health care is based on veteran status, service-connected disabilities, income, and other factors. Veterans must enroll in the system to receive care and are assigned to priority groups based on criteria like disability rating. Approximately 8.3 million veterans are enrolled in the VA health care system, with over 5.0 million receiving care in FY2009. Veterans have a choice of where to receive care, with many utilizing the private sector. VHA is a direct health care provider, not a third-party payer. Factors influencing veterans' decision to receive care from the VA include out-of-pocket costs, distance, and waiting times for appointments. The VHA provides medical services to enrolled veterans within its health care system, but can send veterans outside the system for care in certain situations. This can be done through contracts to purchase care or non-contracted fee-for-service care from community providers. In 2006, Congress directed VHA to implement Project HERO to manage the fee basis care program for veterans. Views vary on the role of the private sector in veterans' healthcare, with some advocating for all care to be provided by the VA and others seeing private sector providers as important for access to specialty services and addressing access barriers. Some believe all care should be provided by VA in VA-owned facilities, fearing quality dilution with private sector options. However, competition from private sector could improve VHA services. Balancing care between VA network and non-VA providers is a key issue for policymakers and stakeholders. Congress is concerned about increasing expenditures on contract and fee basis care services by VHA. In FY2008, VHA spent $3.0 billion on contract and fee basis care, increasing to $3.8 billion in FY2009. These expenditures now make up 9% of VHA's total appropriations. Concerns have been raised about the fee basis care program due to improper payments and lack of standardized implementation. Project HERO was established to improve management of non-VA care, with questions about its effectiveness for Congress to consider. Project HERO was established to enhance the fee basis care program within the VA health care system. The report discusses the implementation of Project HERO and its observations based on VHA and HVHS perspectives. The report does not cover the provision of dental care through Delta Dental Federal Services. Congress directed VHA to implement Project HERO in 2006. In 2006, Congress directed VHA to implement a contracting pilot program to better manage the fee basis care program. The program aimed to develop cost-effective purchased care management strategies through collaborations with industry and academia. The focus was on securing care from private sector providers in a cost-effective manner while complementing the larger Veterans Health Administration system of care. The VHA was directed by Congress in 2006 to establish managed care demonstration programs to improve care management. The program aimed to enhance fee basis care, increase patient satisfaction, and improve information exchange with community providers. The VHA implemented a demonstration program to improve care management by enhancing fee basis care, increasing patient satisfaction, and improving information exchange with community providers. Four Veterans Integrated Service Networks were selected based on high expenditures for community-based care. Humana Veterans Healthcare Services Inc. was awarded a contract for medical services, and the program became operational on January 1, 2008. The VHA implemented a program to enhance fee basis care, which became operational on January 1, 2008. This program involves contract care and fee basis care in non-VA health care facilities. VA manages authorization, claims processing, and reimbursement for services acquired from non-VA providers through the fee basis care program, mainly for outpatient care. The fee basis care program at VA involves a health care provider requesting a service for a veteran, which is then reviewed and authorized by the Chief Medical Officer. Once authorized, the veteran selects a provider and receives services, followed by processing of fee claims. The fee basis care program involves processing fee claims for care received from non-VA providers. Claims are reviewed, validated, and sent for payment to the Department of the Treasury. Veterans under Project HERO receive primary care at their local VA health care facility. Under Project HERO, veterans receive primary care at their local VA health care facility. If specific expertise or technology is not available, a non-VA provider may be requested. The fee basis care program office determines whether to refer to Project HERO for care authorization. HVHS provides authorizations for each episode of required care, contacting the veteran by phone. Under Project HERO, veterans select their own provider and HVHS schedules appointments with network providers. Appointment details are communicated to the VA facility, and veterans receive appointment letters and reminders. HVHS coordinates transfer of clinical information and requests authorization for additional services. Clinical information is returned to the VA facility within 30 days. Under Project HERO, all clinical information is channeled through HVHS and returned to the referring VA medical center for coordination of care. Claims payment is simplified, with network providers submitting claims to HVHS and receiving payment within 30 days. HVHS then submits electronic claims to VA for payment. Between January 2008 and September 30, 2009, approximately 51,000 veteran patients received care through Project HERO in four pilot VISNs, compared to 481,000 patients who received care through VHA's regular fee basis care program. There were about 111,000 outpatient visits under Project HERO authorizations during this time period. Project HERO aims to provide high-quality care to veterans through non-VA providers in the community. It represents a small percentage of outpatient medical care in the VHA, with about 111,000 outpatient visits compared to 1.8 million under regular fee basis care. The project focuses on timeliness of access, clinical information return, facility accreditation, patient safety, and patient satisfaction surveys. It is used to deliver quality healthcare when needed services are not available. The VHA policy aims to provide quality healthcare by scheduling appointments within 30 days but not more than four months beyond the desired date. All appointment requests must be acted on within seven days. HVHS must report metrics like number of appointments within 30 days, within 5 days, and patients seen within 20. HVHS reports that in August 2009, 93.9% of appointments were scheduled within five days, with an average scheduling time of 2.1 business days. Additionally, 88.2% of referred patients were seen by a HVHS provider within 30 days. HVHS and VHA have established a business process to notify VA medical centers if care providers are more than 50 miles from a veteran's home address. HVHS under the Project HERO demonstration is required to provide clinical data within 30 days of the appointment date. Reports show a decline in meeting this standard, with HVHS working on process improvements to address the issue. Average business days to return clinical information is 14.3 days as of August. HVHS reported that average business days to return clinical information is 14.3 days. Accreditation of facilities and credentialing of providers are used to evaluate quality of care. Providers under Project HERO are credentialed using VHA guidelines, including verification of education, licensing, and criminal record. HVHS only sends veterans to providers who meet VA credentialing requirements and practice at Joint Commission accredited facilities. All inpatient care facilities within the network are accredited by organizations such as The Joint Commission, CARF, ICVAL, or AOA. The VA audits HVHS for provider credentialing and facility accreditation, confirming compliance with requirements. Patient safety is a priority according to the VHA National Patient Improvement Handbook. Patient safety is a priority in Project HERO, with incidents required to be reported and investigated promptly. Complaints in the July 2009 report were mainly related to authorization process issues. HVHS conducts patient satisfaction surveys as part of the project. In July 2009, Project HERO reported high patient satisfaction rates, with over 75% of patients very satisfied with their visit. However, only 52% were satisfied with appointment wait times. Project HERO prices for medical care are based on local market rates, while VHA pays for regular fee basis outpatient care at lower rates. VHA pays for regular fee basis outpatient care based on CMS rates, with reimbursements calculated using a formula developed by CMS's participating physician fee schedule. Under Project HERO, VHA pays HVHS a value added fee ranging from $30.75 to $48.09 per claim, varying by VISN and type of service. The fee supports services such as coordinating appointments for veterans and processing provider invoices. In FY2008, VHA paid $69,000, and in FY2009, it paid HVHS $3.3 million in value added fees. Concerns have been raised about care provided outside the VA health care system, with worries about a potential shift towards private providers risking the VA system. Congress is concerned about the growth of non-VA provided care and the prudent use of taxpayer dollars for veteran care. The Project HERO demonstration aims to address concerns about timely access to quality care for veterans provided by outside providers. Mixed reviews were heard about the pilot program, with some viewing it as a \"tool in a toolbox\" for VA medical facilities to use for care outside the VA system. Project HERO is a \"concierge service\" by HVHS for veterans, providing a single point of contact for scheduling appointments with network providers outside the VA system. It enhances fee basis care by facilitating care coordination and claims payment to providers. VA is not responsible for paying for care provided outside the system directly to non-VA. HVHS established a network of providers for Project HERO, a concierge service for veterans. However, the short implementation period led to challenges in building a robust network, especially in rural areas, impacting timely access to medical care. HVHS has worked with VA to resolve issues in adapting to changing clinical needs and recruiting a provider network for Project HERO. Establishing services and pricing has been a challenge, with some VISNs noting that contract pricing is higher than regular fee basis care. However, 89% of Project HERO prices are at or below CMS rates, and provider payments are less than 7% of regular fee basis care. Education is emphasized for successful functioning. The Project HERO initiative has faced challenges in adapting to changing clinical needs and recruiting a provider network. Despite some VISNs noting higher contract pricing compared to regular fee basis care, 89% of Project HERO prices are at or below CMS rates. Provider payments are less than 7% of regular fee basis care. Education is crucial for successful network functioning, with organizational resistance to change being a common issue. The primary challenge lies in providing training to staff at all levels, especially in educating providers and fee basis care office staff. Delays in transferring clinical information without electronic sharing of medical records between VA and non-VA providers have been identified as a key issue. This delay may lead to a lack of immediate follow-up care based on diagnoses or laboratory results. The project's findings could be applied to improve the existing regular fee basis care program. The VA could implement quality metrics from Project HERO for fee basis care, create a provider network within each VISN, and conduct an independent evaluation before expanding the program."
