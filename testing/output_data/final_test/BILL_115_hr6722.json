    "content": "The \"Strength in Diversity Act of 2018\" is also known as the \"Stronger Together Program\" under Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. This program aims to promote diversity and unity in schools. Congress finds that students from low-income families are more likely to attend high-poverty schools, while racial diversity in schools leads to social and academic benefits. Attending more affluent elementary schools improves academic performance for low-income students. Additionally, students in affluent schools have a higher likelihood of attending college. Students attending racially and socioeconomically isolated schools have limited access to experienced teachers, advanced coursework, and adequate facilities. Government data shows a significant increase in schools with predominantly Black and Hispanic students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. The purpose of this part is to support the development, implementation, and evaluation of comprehensive strategies to address the effects of concentrated poverty or racial isolation by increasing diversity in publicly funded early childhood education programs and public schools. Over 7.7 million Black students and 12.3 million Hispanic students attend racially and socioeconomically isolated schools. The Secretary may reserve up to 5% of funds for national activities of significance related to research, development, and community support for school diversity grants. The Secretary awards grants from available funds to eligible entities to improve diversity and reduce isolation in early childhood education and public schools. Grants can be for planning, implementation, or both. Eligible entities can apply for these grants. Entities eligible for grants include local educational agencies, consortia, educational service agencies, or regional educational authorities with significant achievement gaps and socioeconomic or racial segregation. Planning grants last up to 1 year, while implementation grants last up to 3 years, with a possible 2-year extension for entities showing progress. Entities eligible for grants, such as local educational agencies, are showing progress on program performance measures outlined in section 4556. Entities eligible for grants, like local educational agencies, must submit applications based on the criteria outlined in section 4554. Entities eligible for grants must submit applications to the Secretary, detailing how funds will be used to improve academic outcomes in high-poverty or racially isolated schools. The implementation grant plan must include evidence or a rationale on how the project will increase diversity. Eligible entities must describe how they will identify income level and socioeconomic status for high-poverty schools. For racially isolated schools, eligible entities must detail how they will benefit these institutions. The eligible entity must provide a plan for continuing the project after funding ends, assess the impact on student achievement and enrollment diversity, and engage parents and the community in planning for diversity. The eligible entity must provide a plan for continuing the project after funding ends, assess the impact on student achievement and enrollment diversity, and engage parents and the community in planning for diversity. This includes outreach and consultation with families, estimating the number of students to be served, cooperating with evaluations, and participating in communities of practice. The eligible entity must engage in communities of practice, consult with relevant entities, consider implications on nearby educational programs, and provide a description for an implementation grant application. The implementation grant will be awarded based on the quality of applications submitted by eligible entities and their likelihood of success in improving student outcomes. Priority will be given to strategies that increase diversity in early childhood education and public schools. Priority may be given to eligible entities proposing programs that extend beyond one local educational agency, such as inter-district or regional programs, when awarding grants under section 4556. \"SEC. 4555. USES OF FUNDS.\" Planning Grants under this part require eligible entities to conduct a comprehensive assessment of educational outcomes and demographics, as well as develop a family and community engagement plan to improve diversity. The development of a formal strategy to improve diversity includes developing options, timelines, and cost estimates, implementing community preferences, building data analysis capacity, and participating in a community of practice. Implementation grants require eligible entities to implement a high-quality plan. The high-quality plan for improving diversity in education programs must include comprehensive strategies, family and community support, achievable goals, and data analysis for continuous improvement. Implementation grants activities may include recruiting, hiring, or training teachers and staff for early childhood education programs or public schools, investing in specialized academic programs, and supporting professional development activities. Investing in specialized academic programs or facilities to encourage inter-district school attendance patterns and implementing a transportation plan for bringing students to and from early childhood education programs and public schools. No activities authorized under this section should violate Federal law. \"SEC. 4556. PERFORMANCE MEASURES.\" The Secretary will establish performance measures for programs and activities funded through grants, tracking progress in improving academic outcomes, increasing diversity, and decreasing socioeconomic disparities. Increasing diversity and decreasing socioeconomic or racial isolation in publicly funded early childhood education programs, public elementary schools, and secondary schools is a key focus under this part. The Stronger Together Program requires eligible entities to submit annual reports on their progress and data supporting it. $120,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2019, with additional funding for the following 5 years. The Stronger Together Program includes provisions for findings, reservations for national activities, grant length, application process, fund usage, performance measures, annual reporting, and authorization of appropriations."
