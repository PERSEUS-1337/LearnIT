    "content": "The Act titled \"Restoring America's Watersheds Act of 2014\" includes a Water Source Protection Program under the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. The Water Source Protection Program established by the Secretary of Agriculture aims to form partnerships with end water users to protect and restore National Forest watersheds west of the 100th Meridian. These partnerships can take various forms such as memoranda of understanding or cost-share agreements. The Water Source Protection Program, established by the Secretary of Agriculture, may involve partnerships with end water users through agreements like memoranda of understanding or cost-share agreements. The Secretary may develop a water source management plan in collaboration with partners and government entities, prioritizing projects that aid in firewood gathering. Environmental analysis may be conducted as needed. The Water Source Protection Program, established by the Secretary of Agriculture, may involve partnerships with end water users through agreements like memoranda of understanding or cost-share agreements. The Program may require environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act and use the Manual on Adaptive Management for Endangered Species Act compliance. Funding and services are provided for Program implementation. The Secretary of Agriculture may accept funding and assistance from water source investment partnership participants to implement the water source management plan. The Secretary can use investments directly or indirectly through the National Forest Foundation. A Water Source Protection Fund may be established to match funds contributed by partnership participants. The Secretary may use appropriated funds to make multiyear commitments for water source investment partnership agreements. SEC. 3. FOREST SERVICE LEGACY ROADS AND TRAILS REMEDIATION PROGRAM. The Forest Service Legacy Roads and Trails Remediation Program aims to maintain and improve National Forest System roads, trails, and bridges, restore aquatic organism passage, decommission unneeded roads, and prioritize projects that protect water quality and watersheds feeding public drinking water systems. The Forest Service Legacy Roads and Trails Remediation Program focuses on maintaining and improving National Forest System roads, trails, and bridges, restoring aquatic organism passage, decommissioning unneeded roads, and prioritizing projects that protect water quality and watersheds feeding public drinking water systems. Projects under the Program must be on National Forest System roads, and the Chief of the Forest Service is required to develop a national strategy for implementing the Program within 180 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. WATERSHED CONDITION FRAMEWORK. This section adds a new framework for watershed condition to the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a Watershed Condition Framework in the National Forest System to evaluate and classify watershed conditions, considering water quality, aquatic habitat, vegetation, roads, soil, ecosystems, and terrestrial indicators. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a Watershed Condition Framework in the National Forest System to evaluate and classify watershed conditions, considering water quality, aquatic habitat, vegetation, roads, soil, ecosystems, and terrestrial indicators. This framework aims to identify priority watersheds for restoration based on factors such as wildfire behavior, flood risk, fish and wildlife, drinking water supplies, irrigation water supplies, and impacts on forest-dependent communities. A watershed restoration action plan will be developed for each priority watershed. The Watershed Condition Framework in the National Forest System will establish priority watersheds for restoration based on various factors. Each watershed restoration action plan will include major stressors, essential projects, implementation schedule, partners and funding sources, and a monitoring program. The plan will prioritize and implement restoration activities for each watershed. The Secretary will implement watershed restoration action plans, monitor restoration effectiveness, coordinate with stakeholders, and engage the public. In emergencies, a watershed may be designated for priority rehabilitation if a wildfire has significantly impacted it. The emergency stabilization activities of the Burned Area Emergency Response Team are insufficient to restore the watershed to proper function. SEC. 5. REAUTHORIZATION OF THE COLLABORATIVE FOREST LANDSCAPE RESTORATION FUND. Amends the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 to allocate $80,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2015 to 2024 for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund."
