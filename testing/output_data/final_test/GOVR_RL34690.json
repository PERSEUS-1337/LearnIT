    "content": "Horses and burros were brought to the Americas by Spanish explorers in 1500, leading to the formation of wild horse herds in North America. Native Americans incorporated these animals into their culture, and populations spread throughout the West. Wild populations increased due to escapes from ranching and mining activities in the 19th and 20th centuries. Public concern over falling populations led to the Wild Horse Annie Act of 1959. The Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 aims to protect wild horses and burros on federal lands, managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service. The law prohibits actions like killing, harassing, or selling these animals without federal authority, with criminal penalties in place. The Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 established a nine-member advisory board to advise the Secretaries on managing horse and burro populations on federal land. The agencies conduct inventories to determine appropriate management levels and are authorized to remove animals exceeding the range's carrying capacity. They can destroy old, sick, or lame animals and remove healthy ones for private adoption. If adoption demand is insufficient, healthy animals may be destroyed, but this authority has not been used since 1982. The 108th Congress made changes to the 1971 Act regarding wild horse and burro management. The 108th Congress made changes to the 1971 Act regarding wild horse and burro management on federal lands. These changes include allowing the sale of excess animals deemed too old or unable to be adopted, removing a ban on selling wild horses and burros for commercial products, and eliminating criminal penalties for processing their remains. These changes aim to help agencies achieve Appropriate Management Levels, improve animal health, protect range resources, and restore natural habitats. The 108th Congress made changes to the 1971 Act regarding wild horse and burro management on federal lands, allowing the sale of excess animals and removing bans on selling them for commercial products. Legislation in subsequent Congresses aimed to repeal these changes due to concerns about potential slaughter of healthy animals. The Bureau of Land Management set the upper limit for wild horse and burro herds at 26,576, but as of February 28, 2011, there were an estimated 38,497 animals on BLM land, exceeding the limit. The total number of wild horses and burros on federal land is 38,497, with 86% being horses and 14% being burros. The animals exceed the designated Appropriate Management Levels (AML) on the range, with Nevada housing half of them. Additionally, there are thousands more in agency holding facilities. The Bureau of Land Management has struggled to reduce the population to the national AML, with the lowest count recorded in 2007. The Bureau of Land Management has faced challenges in managing wild horses and burros on federal lands, with the population increasing by 9,997 animals (35%) by February 2011. Despite efforts to reach Appropriate Management Levels (AML) in herd management areas, only 45% had achieved this goal by 2011. Reasons for the population growth include underestimates, lack of natural predators, inadequate funding, and poor program management. Animals removed from the range are offered for adoption, sale, or sent to holding facilities. BLM projected achieving AML in fewer areas in FY2012. The Bureau of Land Management has faced challenges in managing wild horses and burros on federal lands, with the population exceeding the Appropriate Management Levels (AML) in many areas. The agency's efforts to control the population have been met with controversy and lawsuits. Concerns include the health of the animals and rangelands, funding sufficiency, and the high number of animals held in agency facilities due to low adoption rates. The Bureau of Land Management is facing challenges in managing wild horses and burros on federal lands, with costs for caring for animals in facilities being a significant portion of the annual BLM appropriation. There is debate over the use of existing authorities to reduce populations on the range and whether additional management authorities are needed. Controversial issues include the destruction of healthy animals, unlimited sales, priority in land use decisions, and removal of animals from the range. The management of wild horses and burros by the Bureau of Land Management is a contentious issue, with concerns about removal from the range, disposal of healthy animals, holding in facilities, fertility control, and management costs. Various proposals have been suggested to improve the current program, with Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar stating that the current path is unsustainable for the animals, environment, and taxpayers. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is facing challenges with the management of wild horses and burros due to unsustainable removal and holding practices. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Senate Appropriations Committee have highlighted the need for cost-effective alternatives to control populations on federal lands. The House Natural Resources Committee has raised concerns about underfunding and mismanagement plaguing the BLM Wild Horse and Burro Program since the passage of the 1971 Act. Nongovernmental organizations have expressed concerns about the management of wild horses and burros, citing damage to rangelands and wildlife habitats. The Humane Society of the United States criticizes the Bureau of Land Management for failing to protect these creatures and favoring livestock over wild horses. The Animal Welfare Institute and other organizations have criticized the Bureau of Land Management for neglecting to use fertility control as a humane management tool for wild horses and burros. Concerns about transparency and accountability within the program have led to the development of proposals for improving their care. The focus has been on BLM due to the larger number of wild horses and burros under their care compared to the Forest Service. In November 2008, the Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Board recommended ways for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to reduce wild horse and burro herd sizes and population growth. Selling animals without limitation or euthanizing excess animals were suggested as a last resort. BLM has been considering various options, including the controversial idea of destroying healthy animals under the 1971 Act due to the inability to reach Appropriate Management Levels (AML) with current practices and funding. Euthanization of healthy animals has faced opposition from horse advocates. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been considering options to reduce wild horse and burro herd sizes, including selling animals without limitation, euthanizing excess animals, or ceasing removals from the range. Ceasing removals could lead to insufficient nutrition for the herds and further damage to the environment, but it may be opposed by ranchers who rely on federal lands for forage. Horse advocates oppose euthanizing healthy animals and selling them for slaughter. The Secretary of the Interior proposed creating wild horse preserves in the Midwest and East for non-reproducing horses to control population growth. The Administration rejected slaughter or unlimited sales of animals to manage wild horse numbers. Mixed reactions arose due to concerns about fertility control, animal relocation, and high costs. The BLM is finalizing a new strategy for managing wild horses and burros. BLM is finalizing a new strategy to manage wild horses and burros, including reducing gathers, improving animal care, increasing fertility control, using best science, establishing sanctuaries, promoting adoptions, and enhancing program transparency. Initiatives include studying science management with NAS and forming partnerships for ecosanctuaries on BLM land. The establishment of ecosanctuaries on BLM land or a combination of BLM and non-BLM land is being considered, along with recommendations for the treatment of wild horses and burros in recent reports. No broad legislation to amend the 1971 Act has been introduced in the 112th Congress as of December 2, 2011. The proposed changes to the 1971 Act include prohibiting the slaughter of healthy wild horses and burros, limiting their removal from the range, creating sanctuaries, and expanding herd areas. Controversies include prioritizing wild horses over livestock for forage and land allotments. Livestock currently graze on approximately 157 million acres of BLM land. The wild horses and burros currently roam on 31.6 million acres in the West, a reduction from the 53.8 million acres in 1971. Of the reduced 22.2 million acres, 15.5 million were closed by BLM and 6.7 million by private owners. The animals are not allowed to be relocated to new areas on public lands. In 2010, forage consumed on BLM lands was approximately 432,342 animal unit months (AUMs) for wild horses and burros and 8.2 million AUMs for livestock. A long-standing controversy exists over whether to remove wild horses and burros from the range, with some advocating for their freedom while others argue for removal due to range degradation. A 2010 report by the DOI Office of Inspector General concluded that wild horse and burro gathers are necessary because BLM lands cannot sustain the growing number of animals. The debate over wild horse and burro management involves wildlife, conservation, and livestock interests. Livestock groups argue that wild horses are more environmentally destructive than domestic stock due to uncontrolled grazing. The controversy includes determining Appropriate Management Levels (AMLs) and removing animals to achieve them, set through BLM's land use planning process. The extent of damage by wild horses versus livestock remains debated due to value differences and lack of definitive data on range degradation. The BLM establishes Appropriate Management Levels (AMLs) for wild horse and burro populations based on population censuses, range monitoring, and removal efforts. AMLs aim to maintain ecological balance, land health, and genetic diversity. A minimum of 50 breeding animals is generally required to sustain genetic diversity, with AMLs reviewed every four to five years during horse gathers. The BLM manages wild horses and burros in 179 herd management areas, which is a 48% reduction from the 347 herd areas established in 1971. This reduction is due to combining some herds, removing others on private lands or areas transferred to the National Park Service, and unsuitability of some areas for critical habitat components. Concerns with wild horse and burro removal to Appropriate Management Levels (AML) include resource conflicts, lack of environmental analysis, genetic viability issues, and humane care during removal. Over a 10-year period, more animals were removed than adopted, raising questions about the effectiveness of the adoption program. During a 10-year period, 95,904 animals were removed, with 54,097 adopted (56%). Burros had a higher adoption rate due to their popularity, lower numbers, lower care costs, and guard animal abilities. In FY2010, 10,255 animals were removed and 3,074 adopted. BLM planned to remove 10,000 horses and burros in FY2011, with 3,500 adoptions. They aimed to reduce removals to 7,600 in FY2012 and FY2013 pending a National Academy of Sciences review. Adoption projections for FY2012 and FY2013 were 4,200, with more trained animals offered. The increase in adoptions for FY2012 and FY2013 to 4,200 was due to offering more trained animals. Higher removal rates over the past decade were attributed to aggressive efforts to reach AML and reduced forage availability. The closure of commercial processing plants in 2007 added 90,000 domestic horses annually to the adoption market, increasing competition for adoption. Critics argue that removals are high because funding is disproportionately used for removal rather than adoption. The primary method for disposing of healthy animals has been through adoption, with 227,383 horses and burros adopted from FY1972 to FY2009. Adoptions have been declining due to increased costs, with a minimum adoption fee of $125. New owners must wait one year before receiving title, with a limit of four animals per year. The BLM has set conditions for transportation, feeding, and care, and may reduce fees or offer incentives for adoption. The adoption process for wild horses and burros in the New Mexico region involves a $125 fee for adopters, with a $500 payment from BLM after receiving title to the animal. Changes were made to the adoption process due to concerns about animals being slaughtered, including requiring adopters to certify they have \"no intent\" to sell their animals for slaughter and establishing a monitoring program with slaughterhouses and federal inspectors. The Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Board was reestablished to assist and advise the Secretaries on wild horse and burro policy. Despite changes in law, a debate continues over whether adopted wild horses and burros are protected from slaughter. The BLM asserts it has no authority over titled animals. The agency seeks to protect horses and burros through adoption efforts, but controversy arises over the attestation that adopters must make regarding not selling the animals for slaughter. Large numbers of excess animals are being held in facilities due to removals in recent years. The 108th Congress provided a tool to reduce wild horse and burro populations. The 108th Congress provided a tool to reduce wild horse and burro populations by directing BLM to sell excess animals without limitations. Support for the sales authority is strong among livestock groups, but animal activists are concerned that sold animals may end up being sent to slaughter. Approximately 16,120 animals were available for sale as of September 2011, with 5,088 sold since the program's inception in March 2005. Sales are negotiated on a case-by-case basis with ranchers, tribes, and humane organizations. The BLM temporarily suspended the sale of wild horses and burros on April 25, 2005, due to some animals being sent to slaughter. Despite not selling animals directly for slaughter, 41 sold animals were resold and sent to slaughterhouses. Another 52 animals were sold to slaughterhouses, but Ford Motor Co. intervened to prevent their slaughter. Sales resumed on May 19, 2005, with revised procedures to protect against slaughter, including agreements not to resell or transfer animals for processing into commercial products. The 2004 law allows for the sale of animals without limitation, raising concerns about legal challenges to penalties for falsifying information. The BLM has the authority to destroy excess healthy animals but suspended euthanization in 1982 due to public backlash. Instead, the agency now focuses on providing long-term care for unadoptable animals at holding facilities. Additionally, from FY1988-FY2004, the BLM was prohibited from euthanizing healthy animals. The FY2005 appropriations act (P.L. 108-447) removed the prohibition on using funds to destroy healthy animals and instead focused on managing wild horse and burro populations. The FY2010 Interior appropriations law (P.L. 111-88) reinstated the prohibition on slaughtering healthy wild horses and burros under BLM management and also prohibited the sale of these animals for processing into commercial products. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is facing challenges in managing wild horses and burros, with controversy surrounding euthanization of healthy animals. Some advocate for alternative methods like fertility control or tax benefits for landowners. BLM is responsible for a large number of animals in holding facilities, which could become long-term costs for the government. In total, there were 41,874 animals in short- and long-term holding. In September 2011, the Bureau of Land Management had 41,874 animals in short- and long-term holding, mostly horses (41,245) and burros (629). Younger animals, 82% of horses and burros, are in short-term facilities for adoption or sale. The average time spent in short-term holding was six months in 2008 and 2009 due to limited long-term facilities. BLM aims to reduce costs by decreasing animals' time in short-term facilities. In September 2011, the Bureau of Land Management had 41,874 animals in short- and long-term holding, mostly horses and burros. Younger animals are in short-term facilities for adoption or sale, while older animals are in long-term pasture facilities in Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. The animals in long-term holding are mostly 5 years or older, with some being 11 years or older. These facilities are privately operated under contract with the U.S. government, and the horses are maintained in large pastures with an average of seven acres per horse. Adoptable animals in long-term facilities are put up for adoption when demand allows. The Bureau of Land Management has been facing challenges with managing wild horses and burros, with some animals being unadoptable and needing to be sold or placed in long-term facilities. Issues include the high cost of holding facilities and concerns about appropriate care. The BLM has been acquiring more capacity in long-term holding facilities to accommodate the increasing number of animals removed from the range. Efforts to slow reproduction include developing fertility controls for wild horses. Advocates of fertility control for wild horses argue that it improves genetic viability, health, and foal survival by delaying pregnancy in younger mares. Some believe it is less stressful than removals. Opponents question the long-term effects on herd behavior and size, preferring natural controls like disease and starvation. The Bureau of Land Management has tested one- and two-year contraception vaccines on mares, with the most effective being a one-year vaccine using Porcine Zona Pellucida (PZP) under an investigational drug exemption. However, logistical challenges make yearly administration difficult. The Bureau of Land Management has been using a two-year contraceptive on wild horses since 2004, administering it to 3,866 mares during gathers in various areas. However, there are limitations to the treatment, including the difficulty of capturing enough mares in a herd for it to be effective, the timing of administration for maximum effectiveness, and the challenge of continuing treatments in large herds if the population is reduced to Appropriate Management Levels (AML). The Bureau of Land Management has been using a two-year contraceptive on wild horses since 2004, administering it to 3,866 mares during gathers in various areas. The effectiveness of the vaccine will be assessed when herds are next gathered every three to five years. While there has not been a significant reduction in population growth overall, preliminary data shows a significant reduction in foaling rates for treated mares compared to non-treated mares. The contraceptive alone would not reduce wild horse populations to Appropriate Management Levels (AML), but would control the rate of population increase once AML is achieved in a herd. The Bureau of Land Management adopted a new approach called \"catch, treat, and release\" to administer PZP to mares in HMAs at or near AML. The goal is to treat 70%-80% of a herd's mares during gathers and return them to the range. Research efforts are focused on developing a longer-lasting fertility drug, with a focus on assessing vaccine effectiveness over several years and creating a vaccine that lasts at least three years. Beginning in 2011, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been exploring alternative population control techniques for wild horse herds. One proposed method is adjusting the sex ratio of herds to favor males, aiming to reduce the number of pregnancies on the range. This approach involves maintaining an adult herd makeup of 60%-70% males, achieved by releasing more stallions or geldings back to the range after gathers or castration. This strategy is considered most suitable for large herds with 150 or more individuals. Castration is a method proposed by the BLM to control wild horse populations in large herds where AML has been reached. This involves sterilizing captured horses before releasing them back to the range, with a focus on gelding stallions. Establishing non-reproducing herds in certain areas is another technique, with criteria such as lack of unique characteristics and limited water sources. BLM is focusing on returning geldings to the range for population control. Spaying mares is considered risky and not currently regarded as safe, effective, or humane for wild horses. Research is ongoing for new fertility control treatments, including evaluating an investigational vaccine called SpayVac to reduce foaling in mares. If successful, the vaccine may be used on wild horses on the range in the future. Other options like vasectomies for stallions are also being considered for population control. According to BLM, options for population control of wild horses include vasectomies for stallions, intrauterine devices, and an experimental vaccine called GonaCon. However, GonaCon does not provide longer-term fertility control compared to the current PZP vaccine. Funding for managing wild horses and burros has been unclear, with appropriations doubling from FY2000 to FY2009. The BLM received a significant budget increase for wild horse and burro management from FY2000 to FY2011, with goals of achieving AML and reducing budgetary needs. However, these goals were not met, leading to continued increases in funding. The Senate directed BLM to develop a new long-term plan for management, including private proposals. The Obama Administration sought increased funding for wild horse and burro management, including fertility control treatments and land acquisition for a preserve. Concerns over rising costs have led to questions about reducing adoption expenses, which have more than doubled since 2007. The cost of holding wild horses and burros in facilities has increased significantly, with expenses reaching $37 million in FY2010. This cost has been a major concern, as it accounted for 71% of the total appropriation in FY2009. Adoption expenses have also doubled since 2007, prompting questions about the efficiency of the adoption and sales systems. The cost of holding wild horses and burros in facilities has increased significantly, reaching $37 million in FY2010. Estimates for FY2011 show even higher holding costs at $43.2 million, constituting 57% of the total appropriation for wild horse and burro management. There are debates and proposals about alternative options such as fertility control and privately managed sanctuaries to address the high costs of holding. Discussions also include the possibility of additional funds supplementing appropriations and the potential for long-term facilities to become financially self-sufficient. Some questions arise regarding the financial sustainability of long-term facilities for wild horses and burros. Suggestions include increasing adoption fees and exploring alternative revenue sources like land disposals and horse sponsorships. Sales of wild horses have not met expectations, with low numbers sold and low purchase prices contributing to lower than anticipated revenue. In 2008, GAO reviewed BLM's wild horse and burro program, assessing progress in setting and meeting AML, animal management, and long-term challenges. GAO recommended actions for BLM, including issuing a handbook for consistency in establishing AMLs. BLM implemented all recommendations. BLM issued a handbook in June 2010 outlining policies for managing wild horses and burros, including establishing AMLs, gathering animals, managing habitat, and using fertility controls. GAO recommended using statistically based methods to improve population estimations and avoid undercounting animals. BLM uses statistically based methods to improve accuracy in estimating animal populations. They have implemented two methods: the simultaneous double-count method for open terrain and short vegetation, and the photographic mark-resight method for steep terrain and tall vegetation. These methods involve multiple counts and statistical modeling to estimate the number of animals not observed. GAO also noted BLM's implementation of controls for humane treatment. BLM implemented controls for humane treatment of wild horses and burros, including standard procedures, inspections, data collection, and protections against slaughter. However, they lacked transparency in providing information to the public. GAO recommended reporting on animal treatment, which BLM now does on their website. Developing alternatives to caring for animals in facilities is crucial for the program's long-term sustainability due to high costs. The GAO recommended that the BLM discuss with Congress and other stakeholders the challenges in implementing provisions of the 1971 Act regarding the management of wild horses and burros. The Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Board made 19 recommendations to the BLM on this issue. The Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Board made 19 recommendations to BLM regarding the management of wild horses and burros, including enhancing adoption and sales, euthanizing animals, slowing population growth, securing funding, and providing care through livestock permits. Some recommendations have been incorporated into BLM's proposals and actions. Recommendations also included exploring semi-privatizing the adoption program and supporting the Mustang Heritage Foundation. Other suggestions focused on increasing animal sales, such as offering animals for sale if they are 10 years old or younger and have not been adopted after three attempts. The Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Board made recommendations to BLM regarding the management of wild horses and burros, including enhancing adoption and sales. One proposal was to sell eligible animals if they are 10 years old or younger and have not been adopted after three attempts. Other suggestions included exploring overseas markets for sales and offering organizations the option to adopt or purchase groups of animals for virtual adoptions or sale to approved homes, with the condition that animals be sold with the \"intent clause\" to protect against slaughter. The Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Board recommended selling eligible animals without the \"intent clause\" to prevent slaughter. This would allow for unrestricted sale without buyer commitments to humane care. Euthanization is also considered as a last resort for unsold or unadopted animals. The Advisory Board recommended selling eligible animals without the \"intent clause\" to prevent slaughter and allowing unrestricted sale without buyer commitments to humane care. Euthanization is considered as a last resort for unsold or unadopted animals, with recommendations for humane euthanasia if animals show signs of disease or stress. Additionally, recommendations were made to slow population growth, including exploring permanent fertility control methods and establishing non-reproductive herds. The Advisory Board recommended various strategies to manage wild horse populations, such as adjusting the ratio of females to males in herds, exploring non-reproductive herds, and utilizing unproven field techniques cautiously. They advised against using spaying and vasectomies unless proven safe and effective. Recommendations also included seeking additional funding for herd management areas in Nevada to control population growth and exploring assistance agreements with advocacy groups for long-term care costs. Secretary Salazar issued proposals in 2009 to create a sustainable national wild horse and burro program aimed at reducing populations, developing new options for animals removed from the range, and minimizing costs of management. The initiative focuses on aligning population growth with adoptions to eliminate the need for additional holding by 2014. The Secretary proposed establishing wild horse preserves in the Midwest and East by 2014 to provide lifetime care for non-adopted animals. These preserves would be open to the public for viewing, tourism, and education, managed by BLM or partners on acquired land. BLM aimed to acquire private land for two preserves with a capacity of 7,200 horses, but faced funding challenges and opposition. They also hoped for partners to own five additional preserves for 17,800 horses. BLM is pursuing public-private partnerships for ecosanctuaries to manage population growth through fertility control. The Administration's budget request for FY2011 proposed an increase in costs for fertility treatments to manage population growth of wild horse herds. This included using the fertility control drug PZP on 1,990 mares, with a focus on herds exceeding Appropriate Management Levels (AML). Additionally, a new program was introduced to treat mares in herds at or near AML to reduce population growth. The Secretary also proposed managing sex ratios and introducing non-reproducing herds in selected areas. The Administration proposed managing sex ratios and introducing non-reproducing herds in selected areas to control wild horse population growth. They also suggested showcasing herds deserving recognition through secretarial or congressional designations to promote tourism. The BLM is finalizing a new strategy for managing wild horses and burros. The proposed strategy, issued on February 28, 2011, aims to reduce wild horse and burro populations, explore new options for animals removed from the range, and cut program costs. BLM plans to finalize the strategy after considering public feedback. Key actions include reducing the number of gathered wild horses and burros from 10,000 to 7,600 in the next two years and following recommendations from a National Academy of Sciences study. The proposed strategy aims to strengthen humane treatment of animals, increase fertility control measures, use science in management, and establish partnerships for long-term care of wild horses and burros. The strategy aims to establish sanctuaries for wild horses and burros, increase adoptions to 4,000 annually, encourage volunteering and ecotourism, improve transparency, and prioritize funding for fertility control. The implementation is dependent on a $76 million appropriations level for FY2011-FY2014. The BLM prioritized funding for enhancing fertility control, increasing adoptions, and conducting a study by the National Academy of Sciences on managing wild horses and burros. The study will review population estimation, gather decisions, herd growth, and fertility control, with a completion expected in early 2013. BLM will assess the need for an environmental impact statement or changes in law post-study. BLM is pursuing partnerships for wild horse ecosanctuaries to care for excess horses. Ecosanctuaries will have non-reproducing herds for public viewing and potential ecotourism. They may be located on non-BLM lands and managed by third-party organizations. Ecosanctuaries established on BLM and non-BLM lands must be within established herd areas. The goal is for ecosanctuaries to be cost-effective for the federal government compared to long-term holding facilities. BLM will pay sanctuary operators varying amounts per horse based on services provided. Proposals for ecosanctuaries with visitor facilities must outline costs and financial contributions. BLM solicited proposals in spring 2011 and is currently evaluating them for cost and technical merit, with a 6-month analysis expected for private land proposals. The establishment of ecosanctuaries on private and public-private lands is expected to take 6 months and 18 months, respectively. The first ecosanctuary on private lands is anticipated in 2012, while on public-private lands it is expected in 2013. A proposal to prevent excess horses from being slaughtered by caring for them in a sanctuary was initiated in 2008. The proponent aims to establish a sanctuary for wild horses in order to protect them as a symbol of the American West. The sanctuary would be open to the public and potentially become a tourist attraction. The proposal involves transferring up to 10,000 horses from BLM holding facilities to the sanctuary, with additional horses to be added in the future. The horses would be managed as a non-reproductive herd, and the BLM would pay a fee per head per year for their care. The proposal aims to establish a sanctuary for wild horses, offering long-term care and public amenities. Proponents argue that it would be more cost-effective than current management practices, with benefits such as removing horses from short-term holding and allowing them to roam on natural rangelands. Advocates proposed establishing a sanctuary for wild horses to provide permanent care and promote American heritage. Concerns were raised about the feasibility of the proposal, including lack of detailed plans, BLM's authority to implement it, and financial implications for the government. The December 2010 report by the DOI Office of Inspector General evaluated the necessity of wild horse and burro gathers to control herd populations and maintain range balance. Concerns about animal treatment, stress, and care quality were raised, but no evidence of inhumane treatment was found. The OIG recommended BLM to continue implementing program improvements and Secretary Salazar's initiatives. BLM is implementing program improvements and Secretary Salazar's initiatives, including research on population control methods and reducing the need for holding facilities. A task force of the American Association of Equine Practitioners evaluated BLM's treatment of wild horses and burros to improve their health and welfare. The American Association of Equine Practitioners task force evaluated the care and management practices of wild horses and burros by the BLM. They found that the agency's practices generally support the safety, health, and welfare of the animals. Recommendations included using science for determining sustainable animal numbers, prioritizing fertility controls, and ensuring safe helicopter flying patterns during gathers. The BLM is making changes to improve the management of wild horses and burros, such as adjusting capture pens for safety, providing solid footing in holding facilities, and implementing uniform anesthesia protocols. They are also working on establishing a centralized database to track the animals and their outcomes. Congress is considering funding for management goals like caring for the animals, reaching appropriate management levels, and reducing long-term budgetary needs. Congress has provided guidance on managing wild horses and burros, with legislation in the 111th Congress seeking to make changes to their management. Bills aimed to prohibit slaughter unless the animal is terminally ill, remove agency authority to sell excess animals, and limit removal from the range to specific circumstances. Legislation to amend the 1971 Act has not been introduced in the 112th Congress as of December 2, 2011. The 111th Congress sought to make changes to the management of wild horses and burros, including prohibiting slaughter unless the animal is terminally ill, removing agency authority to sell excess animals, and limiting removal from the range to specific circumstances. The bills aimed to expand the area available for wild horses and burros, establish sanctuaries or exclusive use areas, and identify new rangelands for them. The acreage where the animals roamed in 1971 was intended to be preserved to the extent practicable, currently, they roam on 31.6 million acres. The 111th Congress aimed to improve the management of wild horses and burros by expanding their habitats, establishing sanctuaries, and identifying new rangelands. Provisions included assessing the effects on range health, water quality, and endangered species, improving population estimation methods, setting appropriate population levels, implementing fertility control, and maintaining an inventory of wild horses and burros. Adoption promotion was also a key focus. The Secretary was tasked with promoting wild horse and burro adoptions through various actions, including marketing strategies, agreements with local organizations, and economic incentives for adopters. Adopters had to agree not to sell or transfer the animals for commercial purposes. Additionally, wild horses and burros could not be held in short-term facilities for more than six months. Annual reports to Congress were required on animal populations, land usage, sanctuaries, and fertility control. The Secretary was tasked with promoting wild horse and burro adoptions through various actions, including marketing strategies, agreements with local organizations, and economic incentives for adopters. Additionally, the Secretary was to track the number of animals injured or killed during gathering and holding, and determine what information on treatment of animals held and adopted could be provided to the public."
