Congress finds that the Great Lakes are the largest freshwater system on Earth, with Lake Michigan being the second largest by volume and the only one located entirely within the United States. The southern shore of Lake Michigan, known as the \"Indiana Dunes\", is geologically and biologically diverse, formed over 12,000 years by natural forces like glaciers, wind, and water. Glacial melting and water level fluctuations created up to 7 shorelines along this area. The southern shore of Lake Michigan, known as the \"Indiana Dunes\", was formed over 12,000 years by natural forces like glaciers, wind, and water, resulting in biologically diverse beaches, sand dunes, and wetlands. Indian tribes, including the Miami and Potawatomi, inhabited the region for over 10,000 years. Conservation efforts to preserve the Indiana Dunes began in 1899 with Henry Cowles, a botanist from the University of Chicago, bringing international attention to the intricate ecosystems. On October 30, 1916, 1 month after the establishment of the National Park Service, hearings were held in Chicago to establish the Sand Dunes National Park on the southern shore of Lake Michigan. Over 400 people attended, with 42 in favor of the proposal and no opponents. Plans for the park were delayed. The establishment of Indiana Dunes State Park in 1925 and the enactment of Public Law 89-761 in 1966 led to the creation of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. The Lakeshore was expanded in 1976, 1980, 1986, and 1992, now encompassing over 15,000 acres of diverse landscapes. The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore preserves diverse landscapes for public enjoyment, including 15 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline. It is biologically diverse, with 2,336 unique species, a cultural landmark attracting millions of visitors, and a crucial area for migrating birds. The Dunes Learning Center attracts youth and community members. The Dunes Learning Center aims to attract youth and community members to the Indiana Dunes, providing insight on its biodiversity and historical significance. Designation of Indiana Dunes National Park. Designation of Indiana Dunes National Park amended to replace \"National Lakeshore\" with \"National Park\" and update references accordingly. Conforming amendments made throughout Public Law 89-761 to reflect the change. The designation of Indiana Dunes National Park has been amended to replace \"National Lakeshore\" with \"National Park\" and update references accordingly.
