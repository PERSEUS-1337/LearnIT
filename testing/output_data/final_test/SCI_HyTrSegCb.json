    "content": "Neural conversational models are widely used in applications like personal assistants and chat bots, showing better performance on word level. However, for fusion languages like French, Russian, and Polish, vocabulary size can be a challenge due to multiple word forms. A proposed neural network architecture efficiently transforms normalized text into grammatically correct sentences, outperforming character-level models and being faster in training and evaluation. A new pipeline suggests generating a normalized answer first and then transforming it into a grammatically correct one using the network, yielding better performance than character-level models. Neural conversational models are commonly used in various applications, but they face high computational costs, especially in vocabulary processing. English, with its simple grammar and word forms, is the standard language for training these models. However, languages like Polish, Russian, and French have many word forms, making vocabulary storage challenging. To reduce computational costs in neural conversational models for languages like French, Polish, and Russian, a proposed model normalizes input and output sentences to a standard form. This allows for efficient morphological agreement tasks to generate grammatically correct texts. The model introduces a neural network architecture for solving morphological agreement problems in fusion languages. Additionally, a new approach is presented for building conversational models by generating normalized text and then performing morphological agreement using the proposed model. The curr_chunk discusses a morphological agreement task where a neural network architecture is proposed to learn mappings between normalized and initial sentences. The network embeds normalized words using a character-level LSTM encoder to output coherent text. The task considers dependencies between words in sequence to preserve the number of words, their order, and meaning explicitly contained in the input sequence. The curr_chunk describes incorporating global information about other words into word embeddings using a bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder model with attention. This model aims to map input characters to output characters for each word while distributing information between different words. The curr_chunk discusses a two-stage approach to building a neural conversational model, involving generating a normalized answer from a question and then using a modified Concorde model for grammatically correct responses. The Q-Concorde model incorporates question and normalized answer inputs to improve output conditioning based on question morphological features. The curr_chunk discusses the embedding of questions and answers using a character-level RNN, followed by a linear mapping. Attention mechanisms are used to address the information bottleneck in the embedding vector. Encoder-decoder models have been applied to tasks like speech recognition, machine translation, and neural conversational models. Some approaches aim to decompose input sequences for shorter information paths. Some works have focused on decomposing input sequences to shorten information paths. In (Johansen et al. (2016)), character-wise processing is followed by using embeddings for word endings in a sequence-to-sequence model, improving performance. Different approaches, such as BID3, have been proposed for predicting word forms by generating transformation rules from known inflection tables. Neural networks, like bidirectional LSTM in BID0 and BID4, have also been explored for encoding words and generating different word forms. Some works propose using different decoders for different word forms, while others suggest using one decoder with attached morphological features. BID15 builds on BID4 by passing raw data through convolutional layers before a recurrent encoder. The Concorde and Q-Concorde models have a 2-layer LSTM encoder and decoder with hidden size 512. Three baselines compared include unigram charRNN, bigram charRNN, and a hierarchical model with attention layers. The third baseline model is a hierarchical model with a layer size of 768, trained using Adam BID10 optimizer. The model is evaluated using French, Russian, and Polish corpuses from OpenSubtitles 2 database, with a focus on vocabulary size reduction through normalization. The model was evaluated for word and sentence accuracies, with the best performance among all datasets. Examples showed the model's ability to infer plural form and gender for unseen words, including rare rules in Russian. The model demonstrated the ability to infer gender from words by performing agreement with different word types. The model demonstrated the ability to correctly solve tasks involving gender agreement with the word \"one\" in French, Polish, and Russian. Results showed the model's capability to select the correct form of words in complex sentences, using markers from different parts of the sentence. The model's performance was evaluated for word and sentence accuracies, showing superior results compared to baseline models as input length increased. Our model outperforms character-level models as input length increases due to separate word embeddings, unlike baseline models. Character-level models excel with short sequences but our model handles various cases well. The model was evaluated using a corpus of question-answer pairs from Otvet.mail.ru. The conversation model constructed a corpus of question-answer pairs from Otvet.mail.ru, containing general knowledge questions. Q-Concorde model showed better performance in grasping morphological features from context compared to Concorde model. Baseline models were also trained with context concatenated to input sentence. Concorde model outperformed baselines even without access to context, and Q-Concorde model further improved Concorde's performance. The Q-Concorde model demonstrated better performance in grasping morphological features from context compared to the Concorde model. It was able to successfully carry correct case and time from the question, but also made some mistakes like using the wrong form of politeness. The model can generate different texts based on the lexical features of a question, such as tense and gender variations. The model successfully changed the gender of a word in a question from masculine to feminine. It generated grammatically correct answers but sometimes in less common forms. The Q-Concorde model was compared to a character-level sequence-to-sequence model for training conversational models. In a study comparing two models for text generation, assessors preferred a proposed model over a character-wise model in 62.1% of cases. The proposed model showed faster processing times and training speeds compared to other models. The study introduced a neural network model for morphological agreement tasks that efficiently utilizes the relationship between input and output words. The study introduced a neural network model for morphological agreement tasks that efficiently utilizes the relationship between input and output words. A modification using context sentences was proposed for better performance in a neural conversational model. The model demonstrated significant improvement over character-level models for Russian, French, and Polish languages, showing understanding of grammatical rules like tenses, cases, and pluralities."
