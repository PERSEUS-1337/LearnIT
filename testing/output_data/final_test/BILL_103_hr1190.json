The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 repeals various taxes related to corporations, including corporate income tax, alternative minimum tax for corporations, unrelated business income tax, accumulated earnings tax, personal holding company tax, alternative tax for certain mutual savings banks, tax imposed on life insurance companies, tax imposed on certain mutual insurance companies, tax on certain other insurance companies, and tax on regulated investment companies. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 repeals various taxes related to corporations, including tax on regulated investment companies, tax on real estate investment trusts, and tax on income of foreign corporations connected with United States business. SEC. 3. 10 PERCENT INCOME TAX RATE FOR INDIVIDUALS. Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to impose a 10 percent income tax rate for individuals. A 10 percent income tax is imposed on individuals based on the earned income exceeding the exemption amount, which is $10,000 adjusted for the cost of living. The CPI for October of the preceding calendar year is compared to the CPI for October of 1992 to determine any percentage increase. If the increase is not a multiple of $10, it is rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. Earned income is defined as income exceeding the exemption amount, which is $10,000 adjusted for the cost of living. The term 'earned income' includes wages, salaries, net earnings from self-employment, and certain dividends. It does not include pension or annuity payments, or tips given at the discretion of the recipient. The cost of fringe benefits included as earned income is the employer's cost of providing such benefits. SEC. 4 grants amnesty for all prior tax liability up to January 1992, exempting individuals from taxes, penalties, and interest. Exceptions include amounts paid before the enactment of the Act and taxes related to illegal activities. SEC. 5 repeals special deductions, credits, and income exclusions for individuals. Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to remove specific exclusions, deductions, and credits related to individual income tax liability. Subtitle B of the Code, which pertains to estate, gift, and generation-skipping taxes, is repealed. Effective dates are specified in Section 7. The amendments made by this Act apply to taxable years starting after enactment. The repeal of estate and gift taxes applies to estates of decedents dying after enactment. The Secretary of the Treasury must submit technical changes to the Internal Revenue Code within 90 days of enactment."
