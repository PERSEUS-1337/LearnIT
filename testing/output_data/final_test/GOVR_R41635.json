    "content": "Broad efforts are underway to expand the use of renewable energy technologies in the U.S. to increase energy production, improve security, create new industries and jobs, and reduce emissions. In 2009, renewable sources provided 3.6% of U.S. electricity, with wind contributing 51.4%, wood and biomass 24.8%, geothermal 10.4%, and solar 0.6%. Despite growth in renewable markets, costs remain higher than conventional sources, but federal tax incentives help bridge the gap. Tax incentives have reduced the cost gap for renewable energy by rewarding electricity production or investment in renewable generation capacity. In some cases, tax benefits exceed the investor's tax liability, allowing for unused credits to offset future taxes or partner with a tax-equity investor. Congress passed legislation in 2009 (Section 1603) to provide renewable energy projects with a grant in lieu of tax credits, offering an alternative way to realize federal tax benefits. The Section 1603 grant program, also known as \"Section 1603,\" offers renewable energy projects a one-time cash grant instead of tax credits to reduce the need for tax-equity investors. It was created due to a lack of tax equity capacity after the 2007 financial crisis. Initially temporary, the program was extended through 2011. This report provides an overview of how different renewable energy markets have responded to the grant option. The Section 1603 grant program was established in response to weak tax-equity markets. This report provides an overview of tax-equity markets during the financial crisis and the current status. Understanding trends in tax-equity markets may help evaluate the relevance of the Section 1603 grant program. An economic perspective is useful for evaluating a possible extension of the program. The Section 1603 grant program, established in response to weak tax-equity markets, may be more economically efficient than other subsidies for renewable energy. Policy options include extending the program or modifying existing tax incentives to mimic its benefits. The program is set to expire in 2011 without congressional action. The Section 1603 grant program, established in response to weak tax-equity markets, provides payments equal to 10% or 30% of the eligible cost basis for specified energy projects. Projects placed in service during the 2009 or 2010 tax years were eligible for the grant option, allowing them to receive a one-time cash grant in lieu of tax credits under ARRA. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the placed-in-service and construction start dates for qualifying projects to the end of 2011. Projects meeting start-of-construction requirements in 2011 and placed in service by the deadline may elect to receive a Section 1603 grant. Solar technology receives the most federal subsidization under the ITC, with a 30% tax credit available for qualified investments. The PTC provides a tax credit per kilowatt-hour for renewable energy produced at qualified facilities. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) provides a tax credit for renewable energy produced at qualified facilities for 10 years after being placed in service. The PTC has been the main incentive for wind energy since 1992, with lapses followed by short-term extensions. Wind capacity installations decrease when the PTC lapses, indicating its importance in deployment. Renewable energy investments also benefit from favorable depreciation schedules under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS). The Tax Relief, Unemployment Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended bonus depreciation for renewable energy investments, allowing for quicker cost recovery. Bonus depreciation for renewables expired in 2010 but was retroactively extended through the end of the year. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-240) extended bonus depreciation for renewable energy investments. The Act was further expanded by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-312), which allowed for 100% bonus depreciation for qualifying renewable energy property placed in service between September 8, 2010, and January 1, 2012. Section 1603 grants were created to help renewable energy project developers recover up to 30% of eligible project capital cost expenditures, reducing financial risk and providing an alternative tax credit monetization pathway. The Section 1603 grant program provides a tax credit monetization pathway for renewable energy technologies. As of October 24, 2011, 3,801 recipients received a total grant award value of $9.2 billion. Solar electricity projects received the largest number of grant awards, while wind projects received the most grant dollars. Wind projects have received the most value from the program, with $7.2 billion awarded to 205 recipients. Market response and motivations differ among technology types. In 2009, $7.2 billion in grants were awarded to 205 recipients for wind projects. Researchers have tried to quantify the impact of the Section 1603 grant program on the industry, estimating that as much as 2.4 GW of 2009 wind installations were directly enabled by the program. Wind capacity additions in 2010 were approximately 5 GW, and in the first three quarters of 2011, installations totaled 3.7 GW. The wind industry saw significant growth in the first three quarters of 2011, with installations totaling 3.7 GW, almost double the amount from the same period in 2010. Projections suggest that total installations for 2011 could reach 7 GW, a 38% increase from 2010. Critics argue that the Section 1603 cash grant had minimal impact on the industry, but it is just one of many factors influencing wind capacity additions, including economic conditions and electricity demand. The 2010 wind installation downturn was attributed to \"sluggishness in the economy.\" U.S. electricity demand rebounded to 2008 levels in the first eight months of 2010 after a 4.7% drop in 2009. Transmission access is crucial for wholesale energy projects, especially in the upper midwestern United States where high-quality wind sites lack transmission infrastructure. Natural gas prices are used as a benchmark for procuring renewable electricity. The California Public Utilities Commission uses a Market Price Referent (MPR) to assess above-market costs of renewable electricity generation, which helps contain total costs. The MPR is based on a 500MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine facility and includes natural gas price projections. Low natural gas prices make it challenging for renewable energy project developers to establish economically viable Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with utility customers. Renewable energy projects in various states have been rejected due to lower fossil energy generation costs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided policy clarity in February 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) became law in February 2009, with Treasury guidance for the program released in July of the same year. The delay in policy definition for the Section 1603 cash grant program may have contributed to the decline in wind installations in 2010. Evaluating the value of pre-2009 tax incentives compared to the benefits of the Section 1603 grant is essential. Prior to 2009, primary tax incentives for wind energy investments were the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and accelerated depreciation. Wind projects, especially in the early years of operation, often do not have sufficient taxable income to maximize the value of Production Tax Credit (PTC) and accelerated depreciation deductions. Before the availability of Section 1603, some projects would monetize these benefits through a tax equity investor at a discount to cover capital and installation costs. The availability of Section 1603 cash grants allows wind projects to choose between PTC, ITC, or cash grant for covering capital and installation costs. A present value model was created to compare the relative value of these incentives, showing the potential benefits of a Section 1603 grant for a hypothetical project. While a cash flow model would be ideal for specific projects, the present value methodology provides reasonable estimates for comparative assessment. Incentive values will vary based on project-specific financial parameters. The table illustrates hypothetical values for federal tax incentives (PTC, ITC, and accelerated depreciation) for a 50MW wind project. The total value of incentives, after discounting for tax equity investor return, is 29% to 32% of the project's total capital cost. Some projects may receive up to 65% in subsidies, but details are lacking. Results vary based on project parameters. The PTC and ITC/Section 1603 cash grant options are evaluated based on project capacity factor and installed cost. Higher capacity factors make PTC more valuable, while higher capital costs favor ITC/Section 1603. A sensitivity analysis for wind projects is provided, giving developers a choice in selecting federal incentives. Wind project developers now have a choice between PTC and ITC/Section 1603 cash grant incentives based on project capacity factor and installed cost. The availability of tax equity investors to monetize PTC tax benefits influences the incentive choice. The ITC/1603 cash grant option may lead to the development of \"marginal\" project sites with low capacity factors. The solar electricity marketplace has shown consistent growth since 2005. The solar electricity market has seen consistent growth since 2005, with 2010 being a record year for the industry. In 2011, there is a forecast for approximately 1,700 MW of new installations, although solar capacity is still smaller than the wind market. Solar projects have received a large number of Section 1603 cash grant awards, with over 19,000 individual projects funded. The majority of these projects are small installations. Solar electricity projects are impacted by the Section 1603 cash grant program, offering a choice between a 30% investment tax credit (ITC) or a Section 1603 cash grant equal to 30% of project costs. Using the 30% ITC can be challenging as it requires self-sheltering the credit to offset tax liability. The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) allows taxpayers to carry forward unused tax credits for up to 20 years, with a one-year carryback period. Small businesses may struggle to fully utilize tax credits and accelerated depreciation benefits due to limited taxable income. Section 1603 cash grants have helped thousands of small solar projects by reducing this difficulty. Prior to these grants, projects without sufficient tax liability could monetize their ITC and depreciation benefits with a tax equity investor. Solar electricity projects can monetize their ITC and depreciation incentives through a tax equity investor at a discount, receiving cash proceeds towards project capital and installation costs. The availability of the Section 1603 cash grant allows projects to choose between conventional ITC options or receiving a 30% cash grant while still benefiting from accelerated depreciation. Due diligence required for tax equity investors to structure transactions may negate tax benefits for small projects. Projects can receive a 30% Section 1603 cash grant along with accelerated depreciation. The cash grant is typically received within 60 days of application, making it more valuable than the ITC due to no transaction costs and no competition for tax equity investors. The Section 1603 cash grant is received within 60 days, providing more value than the ITC as there is no competition for tax equity investors. The cash grant offers certainty in cash flow and flexibility to project owners, eliminating taxable income risk associated with the ITC. An emerging segment of the U.S. solar PV market is Utility Scale projects, with over 5,362 MW under contract and 10,000 MW announced. Not all projects may be constructed due to various hurdles, but this analysis shows the potential value of cash grants for these projects. The Section 1603 cash grant program awards grants to utility-scale PV projects, as well as other solar technologies like CSP and CPV. A small percentage of grant dollars, approximately $703 million, goes to \"other\" renewable technologies excluding wind and solar. The number of projects in this category is limited compared to wind and solar, possibly due to the financial community's familiarity with wind and solar projects. The \"other\" technologies category faces challenges in project finance, off-take agreements, technology maturity, and longer development timelines. It includes Geothermal electricity, Biomass, Solar thermal, and Small wind technologies. Geothermal electricity projects have received 38% of grant award values, totaling approximately $261 million. Five large geothermal projects in Nevada, Utah, and California account for 99.9% of the grant awards, with capacities ranging from 18MW to 100MW. Geothermal energy properties qualify for various incentives like PTC, ITC, or cash grants. Geothermal energy projects ranging from 18MW to 100MW qualify for PTC, ITC, or cash grant incentives. Cellulosic biomass electricity projects have received $133 million in cash grant awards, with fifteen projects in eleven states. Biomass energy properties can choose PTC, ITC, or cash grant incentives. Solar thermal projects use heat from the sun for electricity, heating, or cooling structures. Solar thermal projects utilize the sun's heat for electricity, heating, or cooling structures. Over 175 grants have been awarded for solar thermal projects, totaling around $130 million. Small wind projects involve turbines with a capacity not exceeding 100 kW, with 81 projects receiving a total grant value of $48 million. Most grants for small wind projects range from $30,000 to $100,000 and offer similar incentives to solar electricity projects. The Section 1603 cash grant program was created as an alternative mechanism for renewable energy projects to access federal tax incentives due to limited availability of tax equity investor funds. It aims to fill the gap created by diminished investor demand for tax credits in challenging U.S. economic conditions. The tax equity market for renewable energy projects is challenging to analyze due to the lack of an official tracking mechanism. A survey of industry sources was used to assess the history and current state of the U.S. renewable energy tax equity market, which involves a hybrid type of investment with preferred cash flow and tax benefits. Renewable energy projects can monetize federal tax incentives through tax equity investors, who provide cash for project capital and installation costs. Tax equity investors, such as banks and financial companies, take on project performance risk but receive preferential financial treatment with moderate returns. Tax equity investors like JPMorgan, GE Capital, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and Credit Suisse provide financing for renewable energy projects to realize attractive financial returns by reducing tax liabilities and generating cash. Risks include subpar project performance and challenges in absorbing tax incentives over 5 to 10 years. The renewable energy tax equity market is difficult to analyze due to the lack of official sources or statistics. However, aggregated information shows that in 2007, $6.1 billion of tax equity was invested in various projects, with $5 billion going to wind projects. In 2008, the tax equity market saw a decline in both deal volume and investors, possibly due to poor economic conditions. Tax equity yields fluctuated between 7.5% and 10% since 2007, settling around 8%-8.5%. The number of tax equity investors continued to decrease in 2009, possibly waiting for Treasury guidance before making funding commitments. The tax equity market is recovering from 2009 lows, with record levels of investors and increasing transaction volumes in 2010. Some investors who couldn't participate in tax credit deals before are now able to do so with the Section 1603 grant program. This program allows investors to quickly recover a large portion of their investment, reducing the risk profile for tax equity. The availability of Section 1603 cash grants has changed tax equity investment deals, reducing the recovery horizon from 10 years to 5 years or less. This has led to new financial structures for renewable energy projects, giving investors multiple financing options. Assessing U.S. corporate profits can provide a macro-level view of the tax equity marketplace. The macro-level view of U.S. corporate profits since 2001 indicates a decrease in profitability, which can impact tax equity capacity for renewable energy investments. This data suggests that total domestic corporate profits serve as a theoretical maximum limit for tax equity investments. A more detailed analysis of firms specializing in renewable energy tax equity investments may provide a clearer estimate of tax equity capacity for such projects. The Section 1603 grant program is popular in the renewable energy sector, providing added incentives for investment. However, it results in greater revenue losses compared to previous tax incentives. Questions arise about the program's worth due to large budget deficits. Energy tax provisions can be evaluated economically by considering if they address key issues. The Section 1603 grants address energy market failures related to fossil energy resources and their environmental impacts. However, they may not be the most economically efficient solution. Government intervention in energy markets can be rationalized by various market failures, such as unpriced negative environmental consequences from fossil energy sources in electricity production. The Section 1603 grants aim to correct market failures in energy production by subsidizing renewable energy investments. This helps address negative externalities from fossil fuels and promotes a more efficient allocation of resources. Subsidies like Section 1603 grants reduce investment costs in renewable energy, promoting additional capacity. However, subsidizing alternative energy instead of taxing polluting sources is economically inefficient due to lower energy costs and the need for government funds from distortionary taxes. This inefficiency applies to other programs like the PTC and ITC for renewable investment. The Section 1603 grant program promotes investment in renewable energy by providing grants, but it may be economically inefficient due to inframarginal beneficiaries. These beneficiaries receive grants even if they would have installed projects without them. Cost-efficient tax incentives should have large marginal impacts, leading to greater participation in subsidized behavior. This concern applies not only to the Section 1603 grant but also to other energy tax programs. The Section 1603 grant program, like other energy tax incentives, may attract additional installations but could lead to inefficiencies by benefiting inframarginal recipients. Grants may be more efficient than tax incentives, as they direct funding towards subsidized activities without relying on tax-equity markets. The Section 1603 grant program may be more efficient than tax incentives, as it directs funding towards subsidized activities without relying on tax-equity markets. Policymakers may be hesitant to use direct grants due to government outlays and budget scrutiny. The program is related to the PTC and ITC, allowing taxpayers to choose between them or request a grant from the Treasury. The option to claim the ITC in lieu of the PTC is expected to increase revenue losses. Shifting to the ITC will shift revenue losses forward as expenditures are made in the near term. The Section 1603 grant program will result in federal outlays. The JCT estimated 10-year revenue losses of $218 million as taxpayers shifted from the PTC to the ITC. The Section 1603 grant program resulted in $158 million in 10-year revenue losses from grants paid out and $153 million in 10-year revenue gains from reduced ITC and PTC claims. The Treasury estimated $20.0 billion in outlays through 2016, with $9.2 billion paid out as of September 20, 2011. The actual cost of the program is expected to be less than the outlays. The Section 1603 grant program is expected to have a cost lower than the outlays. The grant offsets tax credits, reducing future tax expenditures. Projects receiving the grant instead of the PTC receive upfront funds from the government, leading to decreased PTC payouts in the future. However, estimates do not show reduced PTC revenue losses in the future, as PTC losses increase over time due to inflation and increased PTC-eligible production. The dampening effect of the grant on PTC revenue losses does not surpass these factors. The JCT revised the estimated tax expenditures for the Section 1603 grant program, with the one-year extension resulting in nearly $3 billion in federal revenue loss. Job creation is a key factor in evaluating renewable energy incentives, but quantifying green job growth is challenging due to the lack of precise definitions and authoritative data. Despite this, estimates have been made regarding the jobs impact of the Section 1603 grant program. Some estimates have been made regarding the jobs impact of the Section 1603 grant program, particularly in the wind sector. Bolinger et al. estimated that the grant program created 51,600 short-term jobs and 3,860 long-term jobs in the wind industry. The American Wind Energy Association warned that not extending the grant would jeopardize 15,000 wind energy jobs. The Section 1603 grant program created approximately 8,500 jobs in the solar industry, with 2,600 in installation/construction, 5,800 in manufacturing, and 60 in operations/maintenance. Comparatively, the ARRA stimulus funds were estimated to have increased employment by 1.0 to 2.9 million people. The Section 1603 grants, enacted under ARRA, had a construction start deadline of December 31, 2010. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the deadline to 2011. The grant option is popular with renewables investors and may be requested beyond 2011. Congress should consider the economic efficiency of the grant for subsidizing renewables investment. The Section 1603 grant program, enacted under ARRA, has a construction start deadline of December 31, 2011. Congress may need to decide whether to retain the grant program as the tax equity market recovers. The program has increased renewable energy use, addressing carbon mitigation and greenhouse-gas reduction policies. Congress must weigh the benefits of increased investments in renewable energy against the budgetary costs and contribution to federal deficits. Options include letting the grants expire or extending them. The Section 1603 grant program, established under ARRA, may expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends it. This program was created to address limited tax-equity availability after the financial crisis. Projects starting construction after December 31, 2011, will not be eligible for these grants but can still qualify for renewable energy PTC or ITC. Potential modifications to existing incentives are being considered to achieve benefits similar to the Section 1603 grants. The Section 1603 grant program was established to address tax-equity availability post-financial crisis. If tax-equity markets have recovered, the grants may no longer serve their purpose. However, the grants offer benefits like full AMT exemption and relief from PTC \"haircuts\" to all renewable energy projects, not just those relying on tax equity. One option for Congress is to extend the Section 1603 grant program temporarily to provide benefits similar to those of the PTC and ITC. However, temporary extensions may cause uncertainty for renewable energy project investors. An important issue is the placed-in-service deadline for wind to qualify for the PTC. Extending the Section 1603 grant option beyond 2012 would decouple the PTC placed-in-service deadline from that of the grant, potentially impacting wind capacity. Congress may need to consider a more holistic approach to long-term incentives for the renewable energy industry. Congress may need to consider a more holistic reevaluation of existing tax incentives for renewables, including potentially modifying existing incentives to allow for indirect benefits similar to those provided by the Section 1603 grant. There are more limitations on the Production Tax Credit (PTC) compared to the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) or Section 1603 grant, with PTC projects unable to offset tax liability under the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has limitations such as not being able to offset tax liability under the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) after the first four years of production. The value of the PTC may also be reduced for projects receiving federally subsidized financing. Relaxing these restrictions could increase the value of the credit for some taxpayers and expand eligibility. Additionally, allowing PTC-eligible properties to claim the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) could be an option if the grant program deadline is not extended. Investment tax incentives for wind and other renewable energy facilities were introduced in the late 1970s, with the initial renewable ITC expiring in the 1980s and replaced by the PTC in 1992. Congress chose the PTC over the ITC to reward efficient operations and avoid tax shelter concerns. Current PTC-eligible projects may still claim the ITC through 2012, and some technologies may qualify through 2013, potentially overcoming PTC limitations. However, allowing PTC-eligible projects to continue qualifying for the ITC beyond the current expiration could have drawbacks. The ITC for wind in the early 1980s was used as a tax shelter, with investors installing non-operational renewable energy equipment to generate tax credits. Allowing PTC eligible projects to also qualify for the ITC creates investment incentives over performance incentives, similar to issues addressed by Congress in the 1990s. Passive investors in renewable energy projects can only use tax credits or losses to offset other passive income. The Section 1603 grant provided immediate benefits to investors without being subject to passive income rules. Exempting renewable energy investors from passive loss rules may increase the attractiveness of renewable energy ventures to investors. However, this may lead to investors using renewable energy investments to reduce taxable income. Enhancing access to tax-equity markets by facilitating the trading or selling of tax credits is another option to consider. The LIHTC allows developers to self-shelter, sell credits to investors, or sell to a syndicator. Tax-exempt entities can benefit from investing in tax-credit eligible projects. Challenges may arise if energy tax credits are modified like the LIHTC due to the smaller market size and temporary nature of energy tax credits. The Section 1603 grant program provides additional subsidy for renewable energy projects compared to tax incentives. This may lead to increased investments in renewable energy generation, benefiting the national renewable energy portfolio. However, the added subsidy also comes with budgetary costs. Congress may need to evaluate the program's benefits versus costs and take appropriate legislative action. The Section 1603 grant program provides added subsidy for renewable energy projects, leading to increased investments in the sector. The report assesses the market response since the program's inception in 2009, noting varying motivations among technologies. Some renewable energy sub-sectors have seen market size declines, indicating other factors influence growth. To promote renewable energy expansion, Congress should consider policies addressing these factors alongside tax-based incentives. The program was established during economic challenges to address the lack of tax equity. The Section 1603 grant program was created during economic difficulties to address the limited tax equity for renewable energy projects. Congress may need to evaluate if the program is still necessary as the economy improves. The report suggests that grants may be more economically efficient than tax credits for the renewable energy sector, but both forms of subsidies are less efficient than pricing polluting energy alternatives. The Section 1603 grant program was created to address tax equity issues for renewable energy projects during economic difficulties. Congress needs to assess if the program is still needed as the economy improves. The report questions the efficiency of grants versus tax credits for renewable energy, highlighting the debate over the program's benefits compared to its budgetary and economic costs."
