    "content": "The Social Security program pays benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members, as well as the survivors of deceased insured workers. It is primarily financed by payroll taxes and federal income taxes paid by beneficiaries. Tax revenues are invested in U.S. government securities to earn interest. The Social Security program is funded by tax revenues invested in U.S. government securities, which earn interest. The trust fund balance represents the amount owed to the Social Security trust funds by the General Fund of the Treasury. Funds for benefits come from the redemption or sale of these securities, allowing surplus revenues to be used for other government spending needs. The Social Security program is financed by FICA and SECA taxes, with revenues invested in U.S. government securities. The trust funds are designated to pay current and future benefits, allowing surplus revenues to be used for other government spending needs. Employers remit FICA taxes to the U.S. Treasury, with a tax rate of 7.65% for both employers and employees. This includes 6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare Hospital Insurance. Self-employed individuals pay SECA taxes at a rate of 15.3%, with 12.4% for Social Security and 2.9% for Medicare. Social Security contribution rates apply to wages up to $132,900 in 2019. SECA taxes are deducted for federal income tax purposes, paid annually when filing taxes. In 2018, Social Security payroll taxes totaled $885.1. In 2018, Social Security payroll taxes totaled $885.1 billion, accounting for 88.2% of the program's total income. Revenue from the taxation of benefits totaled $35.0 billion, accounting for 3.5% of the program's total income. General Fund reimbursements totaled $0.2 billion, and interest income totaled $83.3 billion. The IRS processes tax returns and payments for federal taxes, depositing them in the U.S. Treasury. Trust funds within the Treasury track revenues for specific purposes, including Social Security program income and outgo. The Social Security Act authorizes two separate trust funds for income and outgo: the OASI Trust Fund and the DI Trust Fund. These funds are legally distinct and cannot borrow from each other. Projections show that the OASI fund will be depleted in 2034 and the DI fund in 2052. After depletion, income is projected to cover 91% of DI benefits and 77% of OASI benefits. Congress has previously allowed temporary interfund borrowing and tax reallocations to address funding imbalances. The Social Security Act establishes separate OASI and DI trust funds, projected to be depleted in 2034 and 2052 respectively. The trust funds receive payroll taxes allocated based on law, with a temporary provision directing more funds to the DI fund. The trust funds are projected to remain solvent until 2035, covering 80% of program costs after that. The U.S. Treasury allocates funds for Social Security benefits, with 10.03% for the OASI fund and 2.37% for the DI fund. In 2019, the allocation changes to 10.6% for OASI and 1.8% for DI. Payments are made monthly to individuals by the U.S. Treasury as directed by the SSA. Administrative costs are covered by the trust funds, incurred by various government agencies. Surplus revenues are available for spending if costs are lower than revenues in a given year. The surplus Social Security revenues in the U.S. Treasury can be used for federal government spending on non-Social Security needs. Cash flow deficits are offset by selling trust fund holdings. Cash flow operations measure current revenues and costs, with deficits requiring the use of accumulated funds. The Social Security program uses trust fund holdings to pay benefits and expenses. Cash flow deficits have occurred since 2010, with projections showing deficits continuing. The trust funds had over $2.9 trillion in holdings at the end of 2018. The 2019 Annual Report projects that the Social Security trust funds will have asset reserves until 2035, allowing benefits to be paid in full and on time. The report also shows the 75-year actuarial deficit, which is the amount by which the payroll tax rate would need to be increased to support scheduled benefits. The 2019 Annual Report projects a 2.78% actuarial deficit for the Social Security trust funds over a 75-year period. Updated data and methodologies reduced the deficit by 0.11% of taxable payroll. Asset reserves are projected to cover full scheduled benefits until 2035, with the OASI Trust Fund expected to last until 2034. The 2019 Annual Report projects a 2.78% actuarial deficit for the Social Security trust funds over a 75-year period. Asset reserves are projected to cover full scheduled benefits until 2035, with the OASI Trust Fund expected to last until 2034. The DI Trust Fund is projected to have sufficient asset reserves until 2052, 20 years later than projected in last year's report. Disability applications have been declining steadily since 2010, leading to a later projected Trust Fund depletion date for DI. The 2019 Annual Report projects a 2.78% actuarial deficit for the Social Security trust funds over a 75-year period. The projected Trust Fund depletion date is 20 years later than previously projected, with a 0.09 percentage point lower 75-year actuarial deficit. Cash flow deficits have occurred in nine of the past 35 years, compared to 20 out of 28 years before major program amendments in 1983.Projected cash flow operations for 2019 to 2034 show deficits as per the trustees' 2019 Annual Report. The 2019 Annual Report shows the ratio of noninterest income to cost for the Social Security trust funds, indicating a cash flow surplus in 2009 and a deficit in 2018. The 2019 Annual Report projects a cash flow deficit for Social Security, with noninterest income falling below costs over a 75-year period. The U.S. Treasury can cover benefits as long as trust fund balances are adequate, but additional funds may be needed when revenues are insufficient. The U.S. government must raise funds to honor Social Security trust fund obligations by increasing taxes, reducing spending, borrowing from the public, or a combination of these measures. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to invest Social Security revenues in U.S. government securities, which earn interest. Each security issued must be a paper instrument like a bond, note, or certificate of indebtedness. The Social Security Act requires obligations to be in the form of a bond, note, or certificate of indebtedness, issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. The obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States and are incontestable. The Managing Trustee may also purchase other interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Social Security trust funds can purchase U.S. government securities, with interest rates tied to market rates. Surplus Social Security revenues are shifted between government accounts, and the securities are physical documents held by the SSA. Interest or proceeds from the sale of these securities must be paid to the trust funds in the form of paper checks from the General Fund of the Treasury. The Social Security trust funds hold special U.S. government obligations that are redeemed regularly. These securities are not considered federal government resources as they represent both an asset and a liability. Social Security, like the Postal Service, is designated as off-budget, but this designation does not impact program funding or operations. Congressional budget resolutions separate off-budget totals from on-budget totals. The unified budget framework combines on- and off-budget totals, providing a comprehensive view of federal receipts and outlays. The President's budget and Congressional Budget Office use unified budget numbers for analysis. Social Security is a significant contributor to federal receipts in the unified budget. The Social Security program is a major source of federal receipts and outlays in the unified budget. The program's cash flow surplus or deficit affects the overall federal budget surplus or deficit. Social Security trust funds are invested in non-marketable U.S. government obligations, with interest earned being paid back to the trust funds. The Social Security trust funds can only hold U.S. government obligations, which are sold by the government to the trust funds as a form of borrowing. This helps the program recoup surplus revenues, earn interest, and ensure a level of return on investments. It also provides an alternative way for the government to borrow funds outside of the securities market. The Social Security trust funds hold U.S. government obligations to borrow funds outside of the securities market. The accumulated holdings represent surplus revenues invested in government obligations, totaling about $2.9 trillion by the end of 2018. This balance is often referred to when discussing the trust funds. The Social Security trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2034, with costs exceeding income starting in 2020. Over the next 75 years, program costs are expected to exceed income by 2.78% of taxable payroll on average. This gap is projected to increase over time, with costs exceeding income by 3.15% of taxable payroll in 2035 and continuing to grow until 2093. The Social Security trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2034, with costs exceeding income starting in 2020. By 2093, the program's costs are projected to exceed income by 4.11% of taxable payroll. To ensure solvency, options include increasing revenues by 2.70 percentage points or reducing benefits by 17-20%. The federal debt limit, set by Congress as part of the annual budget process, includes debt held by the public and government accounts. The balance of the Social Security trust funds affects the debt limit, as these funds are designated for future benefits. When tax revenues fall short, the government must raise resources to redeem trust fund securities. The Social Security trust funds hold U.S. government securities that must be redeemed to pay benefits. When operating with a cash flow deficit, the program relies on these securities, increasing reliance on the General Fund of the Treasury. Social Security relies on previously collected tax revenues and trust fund investments to cover funding shortfalls, as it cannot borrow from the General Fund. Over its history, Social Security has collected $21.9 trillion and paid out $19.0 trillion. The Social Security trust funds have accumulated $21.9 trillion and paid out $19.0 trillion, leaving asset reserves of $2.9 trillion at the end of 2018. The trustees project that the reserves will be depleted in 2035, but incoming receipts are expected to cover about 80% of scheduled benefits through 2093. Title II of the Social Security Act does not specify what happens if trust fund reserves are depleted. Possible scenarios include delayed full benefits or timely partial benefits. The Social Security Board of Trustees projects key dates for the trust funds from 1983 to 2019."
