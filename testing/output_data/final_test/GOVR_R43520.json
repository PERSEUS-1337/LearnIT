It is a federal block grant that allocates billions of dollars annually to support community and economic development efforts. Over its 40-year history, approximately $145 billion has been granted to state and local governments for various development activities. Additionally, around $50 billion in supplemental CDBG funds have been allocated for addressing economic recessions and other extraordinary events. In FY2013, the CDBG program was the largest federal assistance source for community development activities, ranking 20th in grant assistance to states and local governments. Federal grant assistance falls into three categories: revenue sharing, categorical grants, and block grants. Block grants are federal aid programs that provide funding for a wide range of activities within a specific functional area. Recipient jurisdictions have significant administrative discretion, with minimal federal oversight. The distribution is formula-based, narrowing grantor discretion and providing fiscal certainty for grantees. Eligibility is specific and tends to favor local government units. The CDBG program is a block grant that provides funding to entitlement communities, states, and Section 107 special project grants. Seventy percent of the funds are allocated to principal cities, metropolitan-based cities, and urban counties. In FY1975, there were 594 entitlement communities, which increased by FY2014. Title V of the American Dream Home Downpayment Act transferred authority for insular areas from Section 107 to Section 106 of the HCDA of 1974. Insular areas receive approximately $7 million in appropriations, divided based on population share. States and Puerto Rico receive 30% of funds after set-asides, acting as pass-through agents for community development activities. Currently, eligible uses of Section 107 funds include grants to states, local governments, minority serving institutions, and Indian tribes for various community development activities. Only Hawaii has chosen not to administer this program, with HUD distributing funds directly to nonentitlement communities in the state. Section 107 funds are used for community development activities, including technical assistance, knowledge transfer, and capacity building. Grants are provided to states, local governments, minority serving institutions, and Indian tribes. The program excludes Hawaii, with HUD distributing funds directly to nonentitlement communities in the state. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program allows for non-profit and for-profit entities to participate as sub-recipients, receiving funds for economic development, housing, job creation, and public service activities. The primary goal of the program is to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and suitable amenities. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program aims to develop urban communities by providing housing, economic opportunities, and expanding economic opportunities for low and moderate-income individuals. Activities must meet national objectives such as benefiting low- and moderate-income persons, preventing slums or blight, or addressing urgent health and safety threats. States and local governments must allocate at least 70% of their CDBG funds to eligible activities. HUD revamped the CDBG application and planning requirements in 1995 as part of a government reinvention effort. New rules were published for planning and reporting requirements for various grant programs, consolidating them and requiring jurisdictions to designate a single starting date for four programs. HUD revamped the CDBG application and planning requirements in 1995 as part of a government reinvention effort, consolidating grant programs and requiring jurisdictions to designate a single starting date for four programs. The consolidated plan aimed to encourage comprehensive, coordinated approaches in federal housing and community development programs, reduce paperwork, improve program accountability, and enhance citizen participation. The rule consolidated reporting requirements for CDBG programs, replacing multiple reports with one performance report. Entitlement communities must target 70% of funds to benefit low- and moderate-income individuals and meet various requirements. Entitlement communities receiving CDBG funds must submit a consolidated plan at least 45 days before their program year, with a deadline between November 15 and August 16. Components of the plan include a citizen participation plan, housing needs assessment, and community development plan. The citizen participation process requires strategies to minimize displacement, providing information on available funds and eligible activities, and offering technical assistance. The CDBG program requires entitlement communities to submit a consolidated plan outlining eligible activities and citizen participation strategies. Public hearings are held to gather feedback on housing and community development needs, with citizen advisory panels playing a key role in reviewing proposals and recommending projects for funding. The composition of citizen advisory panels for CDBG program varies widely and includes business and civic leaders, as well as representatives from organizations advocating for low- and moderate-income individuals, including the homeless. Communities must conduct housing and homeless needs assessments, including estimates of housing assistance needs, homelessness extent, special needs housing, public housing units, homeless facilities, and barriers to affordable housing. Jurisdictions receiving funds must develop and submit a strategic plan based on these assessments. Local governments receiving funds must develop and submit a strategic plan outlining priorities for affordable housing, homelessness, and special needs housing. The plan must also address supportive service needs for the elderly and persons with disabilities. It should include long- and short-term community and economic development objectives, strategies to reduce poverty levels, and involve private, public, and nonprofit institutions. Additionally, an annual action plan must be submitted to HUD, detailing resources and the number of families benefiting from the proposed activities. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for jurisdictions receiving funds, including developing a strategic plan, identifying local objectives, and submitting an annual action plan to HUD. It also mentions the need for a Comprehensive Annual Performance Evaluation Report (CAPER) to track progress. States, as pass-through agents, are responsible for overseeing the program but do not directly implement activities. States, as pass-through agents for the program, have three main responsibilities: determining fund distribution methods, selecting grant recipients, and monitoring project implementation for compliance with program rules. They must involve nonentitlement communities in decision-making and provide necessary information for project selection. States have the authority to select projects for nonentitlement communities without HUD input. Funds can be distributed competitively, by formula, or targeted for specific activities. Each state must submit a ConPlan to HUD with a five-year housing assessment, market analysis, strategic plan, and one-year action plan. The action plan should include objectives, past performance evaluation, and citizen participation summaries. The curr_chunk discusses the responsibilities of nonentitlement communities receiving CDBG funds, including minimizing displacement of low- and moderate-income persons, compliance with civil rights and environmental standards, and meeting national objectives with citizen input. HUD oversees and enforces compliance provisions. HUD is responsible for overseeing and enforcing compliance provisions for state and entitlement community programs, including certifications related to civil rights, national objectives, citizen participation, anti-displacement, labor standards, and environmental review. They review performance reports, conduct audits, and assess management of funds and compliance with the consolidated plan. If noncompliance is found, HUD may request additional information and remedial actions. HUD oversees compliance provisions for state and entitlement community programs, including certifications related to civil rights, national objectives, citizen participation, anti-displacement, labor standards, and environmental review. If noncompliance is found, HUD may request additional information and remedial actions from the community. The program's authorizing statute grants the Secretary of HUD the power to take various actions in response to noncompliance, including issuing warnings, suspending activities or funding, imposing conditions on fund use, and seeking civil action. The statute also allows for waivers in response to presidentially-declared disasters, except for provisions related to fair housing, non-discrimination, and fair labor standards. HUD can waive provisions related to fair housing, non-discrimination, fair labor standards, and the 70% low and moderate income (LMI) expenditure requirement during presidentially declared disasters. Congress has adjusted the LMI targeting requirement by reducing the percentage of funds for LMI households. After allocations to special-purpose activities, 70% of funds go to entitlement communities and 30% to states for nonentitlement communities based on population, housing, and poverty data. Formula A determines entitlement community funding based on population, poverty, and housing overcrowdedness. The allocation of funds for entitlement communities is based on population, poverty, and housing overcrowdedness. Formula B determines the distribution of funds by considering poverty, age of housing, and population growth rate. States receive nonentitlement funds based on their share of population, poverty, and overcrowded housing in nonentitlement areas. State allocations under formula B are determined by factors such as poverty, age of housing, and population growth rate. Nonentitlement communities compete for a share of the state's allocation based on poverty, age of housing, and population. HUD uses the most recent data from the Census Bureau and OMB to calculate CDBG allocations starting in FY2012. Starting in FY2012, HUD uses 2010 Decennial Census and 2005-2009 ACS data to calculate CDBG allocations. ACS data is updated annually to reflect demographic changes. Eligible CDBG activities include planning, public works, housing, public services, and economic development. Ineligible activities include acquiring or renovating buildings for general local government use. The CDBG program includes funding for various activities such as local government conduct, job creation, housing construction, and political activities. Recipients must submit an annual performance report to HUD, detailing progress, resources, and investments. The program also supports other activities like Indian Tribe set-asides and loan guarantee programs. The CDBG program includes funding for various activities such as job creation, housing construction, and political activities. It also supports Indian Tribe set-asides, loan guarantee programs, disaster assistance, and special projects. HUD awards funds to Indian tribes, including Alaskan Indian, Aleut, and Eskimos, for single purpose grants through the ICDBG Program. The Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program allows communities to leverage CDBG funds for economic development projects. Eligible activities include property acquisition, housing rehab, economic development, public facility construction, and debt service reserves. HUD can allocate up to 5% of funds for public health and safety emergencies on a noncompetitive basis. The Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program allows communities to leverage CDBG funds for various eligible activities, including property acquisition, housing rehab, economic development, public facility construction, and debt service reserves. Communities can float bonds worth up to five times their annual CDBG allocation with a repayment period of up to 20 years. Section 108 funds are available on an ongoing basis, and applicants are encouraged to meet with HUD staff before submitting a formal application. Loan funds can be re-loaned to private participants in redevelopment projects. Applicants must provide a description of activities, financing structure, and source of loan repayment when submitting a formal application. The Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program allows communities to leverage CDBG funds for various eligible activities, including property acquisition, housing rehab, economic development, public facility construction, and debt service reserves. HUD reviews applications within 90 days, with field offices aiming for 45 days. Recipients must file an annual performance report detailing progress. HUD has issued 1,818 loan guarantee commitments totaling $8.4 billion since 1977. Brownfields are abandoned industrial sites with hazardous waste. The Brownfield Economic Development Initiative (BEDI) grants, authorized under Section 108(q) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, support Section 108 loan guarantees for activities like debt service, land write-downs, and site remediation costs. BEDI grants are awarded competitively and must meet CDBG program requirements. The availability of BEDI funds is announced through a Notice of Funds Availability (NOFA) in the Federal Register. These funds can be re-loaned by eligible governmental entities to for-profit or nonprofit entities for reclaiming brownfield sites for redevelopment. However, funds cannot be used for sites on the EPA's Superfund list or for addressing contamination caused by negligence. HUD administers the program to integrate activities effectively. In administering the program, HUD integrates activities with EPA's brownfield program. HUD funds support redevelopment, while EPA funds support cleanup. BEDI grants aim to leverage private sector funds, with a maximum award of $2 million. 195 grants have been awarded since 1998, averaging $1.1 million each. Critics argue it duplicates CDBG program and faces project delays. Congress passed HERA in response to the mortgage crisis, allocating $4 million for redevelopment of abandoned homes. Emergency Assistance for the Redevelopment of Abandoned and Foreclosed Homes\u2014$4 billion in CDBG funding for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to assist states and local governments address housing market impacts. Grants awarded based on foreclosed homes, subprime loans, and delinquent mortgages. Funds used for financing, purchasing, rehabilitating foreclosed properties, establishing land banks. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $2 billion for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) to address housing market impacts. Funds were distributed competitively based on need and project quality to states, local governments, and nonprofit entities. Modifications allowed for the establishment of land banks, limited grant funds for demolition activities, and permitted the use of funds for capacity building and technical assistance. Additional funding of $1 billion was allocated in 2010 under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Act to support NSP activities. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act allocated an additional $1 billion for NSP activities, with funds awarded based on a formula considering foreclosures and subprime loans. The $7 billion in NSP funds supported 88,000 jobs, completed 75,000 affordable housing units, and demolished 25,000 blighted properties. The Obama Administration sought to expand the program with a $15 billion budget request for Project Rebuild grants in FY2015, with $10 billion awarded by formula and $5 billion competitively for NSP eligible activities. The CDBG program allows communities to use funds for urgent health and safety threats in disaster areas. HUD can expedite grant awards and suspend program requirements in presidentially declared disaster areas. States and communities can reprogram annual CDBG funds to respond to disasters. Congress has provided supplemental CDBG funds for disaster relief, mitigation, and recovery activities since FY1999, totaling over $35 billion. This program is a key tool for long-term economic recovery in affected areas. The Economic Development Initiative (EDI) is a federal program supporting economic recovery after disasters through competitive and earmarked grants. Authorized in 1994, it supplements the Section 108 loan guarantee program and awards funds based on community need, distress level, proposed plan quality, and applicant capacity. The EDI program, authorized in 1994, awards grants based on community need, distress level, proposed plan quality, and applicant capacity. The competitive component is currently inactive, with the last funding in 2000. HUD used recaptured UDAG funds to initially finance the program, with Congress designating some or all funding for specific projects since FY1998. Since 1998, Congress has funded over 8,100 congressionally designated EDI projects, with grantees required to submit detailed applications, conduct environmental reviews, and comply with various laws. Congress has sought to curb earmarking of funds since FY2010, with no appropriations for the EDI account. Neighborhood Initiative (NI) funds were first authorized under the Department of Veteran. The Neighborhood Initiative (NI) funds were authorized in 1998 under the Department of Veteran Affairs, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Act of 1998, P.L. 105-65. The act allocated $25 million for a program to integrate housing benefits with welfare reform initiatives. Factors considered for awarding NI funds included economic development strategies, neighborhood revitalization efforts, resident input, homeownership opportunities, and links between housing programs and welfare reform. Since 2001, program funds have been awarded based on the conference report appropriating funds. Around 400 projects have been funded since 1998, all congressionally directed. Section 107 allows HUD to award grants to colleges serving minority populations. Funds are awarded competitively to develop collaborative solutions to community development. The program, authorized under the Department of Housing and Urban Development Demonstration Act of 1993, funds national intermediaries like LISC, Living Cities, Enterprise Foundation, and Habitat for Humanity to provide technical assistance and seed funds to local CDCs and CHDOs for community development projects. The program funds national intermediaries to provide technical and financial assistance for community development projects. Activities must be completed within four years, with a requirement for $3 in private sector funds for every $1 in federal assistance. Over 1,000 CDCs and CHDOs have been assisted under the program. In FY2010, Congress appropriated $150 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) administered by the Office of Sustainable Housing and Community Development. The program includes Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grants (SCRPG) for regional organizations in metropolitan areas to integrate planning requirements for sustainable communities with the help of federal agencies. Funds support improvements in housing, transportation, energy, and land use planning. Community Challenge Planning Grants (CCPGs) are also provided. The Community Challenge Planning Grants (CCPGs) are competitively awarded to communities to reform building codes and zoning ordinances for sustainable growth. Funds are also allocated for research and evaluation of the grants, as well as to improve technical capacity of various organizations. The Rural Innovation Fund (RIF) assists in addressing housing and poverty-related issues for rural areas. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 created the CDBG program, emphasizing local flexibility in housing and community development. The program encourages long-term redevelopment efforts and has been modified over time to increase funding eligibility and flexibility. The CDBG program has evolved over time, with changes including expanding eligible activities, adjusting fund distribution to entitlement communities, introducing a second allocation formula to address bias concerns, and giving state governments more administrative control. Congress has also authorized supplemental programs, which some believe divert resources from the core CDBG program."
