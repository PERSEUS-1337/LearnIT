Consumers are now exposed to an average of 3,000 commercial messages daily, compared to 560 ads 30 years ago. Advertising generates a significant portion of revenue for traditional media and online platforms. Digital advertising has become a major source of revenue for newspapers and internet companies, covering costs for free apps and reaching millions of potential customers at low cost. It offers advantages such as greater access to consumers and tailored ads based on online behavior. However, it has also caused disruptions in the industry by pushing down advertising rates. The decline in advertising rates due to ad-supported websites, online video, and blogs has forced traditional media to seek new business models. Total national and local ad revenues were $219 billion in 2012, down 9% from 2008. Television industry still captures the largest share of revenues, with digital advertising representing a growing fraction. Total advertising revenue accounted for 1.4% of GDP in 2012. Advertising agencies play a significant role in ad spending, with revenue of $94.8 billion in 2012, accounting for 44% of total ad spending. This is an increase from 2008 when these firms' revenue was $89.2 billion, representing 37% of total ad spending. The shift towards online advertising has led to the growth of ad agencies, ranging from small operations to multinational conglomerates. The U.S. advertising industry in 2012 consisted of 18,700 business establishments, with the five largest global advertising holding companies dominating the market. These companies controlled a significant portion of global ad agency revenue and more than half of U.S. agency revenue. Omnicom and Publicis announced a merger, pending approval, raising concerns about market power. A 2008 study suggested the industry was not overly concentrated, but recent analysis by IBIS World indicates otherwise. The U.S. advertising industry has seen increased consolidation among agencies, with market research firm IBIS World noting a rise in industry concentration. The growth of digital advertising raises questions about the future role of advertising agencies, as online ads are more data-driven and use algorithms to determine pricing and placement. This digital-driven disintermediation may allow some advertisers to place their ads directly. Digital-driven disintermediation in the advertising industry may lead to advertisers placing ads directly, reducing the importance of advertising agencies. Employment at ad agencies is a key indicator of demand for advertising services, with personnel costs accounting for a significant portion of expenses. The U.S. advertising industry employed 178,500 workers at an average annual pay of over $90,000 in 2012, with employment fluctuating around 200,000 over the past decade. Approximately 37% of advertising industry employment is in New York or California. The U.S. advertising industry has seen significant changes in compensation structures, with fixed fees replacing traditional commissions. Advertising agencies are diversifying into non-advertising businesses like market research and customer relationship management to generate revenue. This shift has made revenue less cyclical compared to advertising income. The advertising industry has seen changes in compensation structures, with fixed fees replacing commissions. Revenue from non-advertising sources is less cyclical. Structural changes in advertising began in 1995 as consumers shifted to online platforms. Internet advertising revenue in the US reached $37 billion in 2012, a 500% increase from 10 years earlier. Online ad spending is projected to reach $61 billion by 2017. Trillions of digital ads are served annually across various devices. According to Nielsen data, over 209 million Americans were active online in January 2013, with Facebook reporting nearly 230 million daily views on desktop and mobile devices in the US by June 2013. Online advertising surpassed print advertising spending in 2011, leading to financial stress for print publications. Despite efforts to increase online ad revenue, few have been successful in offsetting print revenue losses. In 2012, online ad revenue accounted for 15% of total newspaper advertising revenues, up from 7% in 2007. Print and online advertising have similarities but also significant differences. On the Internet, newspapers face tough competition from numerous websites, bloggers, and social media platforms, leading to lower advertising rates compared to traditional media like broadcast television. Online advertising offers various pricing models such as cost-per-click or keyword purchase, with a vast supply of ad inventory available. Despite the challenges, digital advertising has become a dominant force, surpassing print advertising spending in 2011. The online advertising market is concentrated, with the top sellers accounting for a large portion of revenue. Real-time bidding systems like Google's DoubleClick and Facebook's Exchange allow automated buying and selling of ad inventory. RTBs make up 13% of online ad spending, but are predicted to handle 27% of U.S. online display advertising by 2016. Automated ad exchanges may expand to sell other forms of advertising like digital radio and electronic billboards. Some companies are developing automated ad buying systems for television and radio. Automated ad buying systems for television and radio are raising regulatory and legal concerns regarding data privacy and anticompetitive practices. Measuring advertising effectiveness is challenging, with Nielsen and Arbitron providing viewership and audience data. Audience data on radio shows and stations is used to set ad prices on traditional media outlets. Outlets commission studies for demographic information, like age distribution of readers, to attract advertisers. Advertisers are skeptical of audience measurement techniques, especially with the rise of digital media consumption. Digital editions of newspapers accounted for 19.3% of total circulation in March 2013. Cross-platform audience measurement services are lacking nationally. In the digital world, advertisers can track consumer response in granular detail through various digital platforms like personal computers, mobile devices, cable and satellite set-top boxes, and mobile phones. Companies like Google gather extensive data on consumer interests and behavior to tailor ads effectively. The ability to monitor consumer response in granular detail through digital platforms has significant financial implications for advertisers and sellers of advertising. 66% of online ads in 2012 were priced on a performance basis, like cost-per-click, where ineffective ads resulted in little or no payment. Concerns about the accuracy of digital metrics include low click-through rates, click fraud, and the impact of accidental or fraudulent clicks on mobile advertising budgets. Arbitron and Nielsen are developing advanced cross-platform measurement tools for audio and video content. Arbitron includes high-definition and streaming listening in its ratings, while Nielsen plans to measure TV shows based on social media chatter and video viewing on streaming services and gaming consoles. comScore introduced vCE to track viewing on TV, web, and mobile. Accidental or fraudulent clicks can cost companies 40% of their mobile advertising budgets. Nielsen and Arbitron, along with Rentrak and TRA, are developing advanced cross-platform measurement tools for audio and video content. The Federal Trade Commission approved Nielsen's acquisition of Arbitron, with the condition of sharing certain technology to ensure competition in TV and radio audience measurement. The collection of data for advertising purposes has raised concerns among some Members of Congress and industry regulators. Some Members of Congress and industry regulators have raised concerns about data collection for advertising purposes, particularly regarding customer targeting, privacy safeguards, and consumer awareness. The Senate Commerce Committee and the FTC have examined industry practices closely. Search advertising has become a significant part of the digital ad market, accounting for nearly half of the revenue in 2012. Search advertising accounts for about 6% of the overall ad market and nearly half of the digital ad market. It is seen as an effective way to match relevant information with user interests, allowing advertisers to reach potential customers at the right moment. Advertisers only pay when a consumer clicks on an ad, and they can track user behavior on their website. The dominance of search advertising has raised antitrust concerns, especially in Europe where Google holds a market share of over 90% of all Internet searches. The European Commission investigated Google for potential abuse of dominant position in online search, responding to complaints about unfair treatment of competitors in search results. The investigation also raised concerns about the use of secret algorithms. Despite privacy and antitrust scrutiny in the US, the FTC found no evidence of search result manipulation by Google. Ad networks, consisting of over 300 companies, pool web pages to facilitate advertising across various digital platforms. They deliver ads from central servers for targeting, tracking, and reporting impressions. Online publishers use networks like Google Ad Network and Yahoo!SearchMarketing to sell unsold inventory. Ad networks are crucial for small web ventures with limited marketing resources. The rise of ad exchanges matches ad buyers with sellers to fill excess inventory. Ad networks and ad exchanges affect prices for ad-dependent companies by buying and selling ad space at discounted rates. Some established companies argue that ads sold via brokers are less effective than direct sales on their websites. Lawmakers are starting to focus on the proliferation of ad networks and exchanges. The White House, IAB, and leading ad networks like Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft have agreed to self-regulatory guidelines to prohibit websites engaging in copyright piracy or selling counterfeit goods from participating in ad networks. Advertisers are adapting quickly to changes in digital consumer behavior, with mobile advertising revenues projected to reach $27 billion by 2017. Social networking sites account for a significant portion of time spent online by U.S. adults, with revenues primarily coming from advertising sales. Advertisers can target users' demographic information through social media advertising, although they may pay less for ads on mobile devices due to lower purchase rates. According to Nielsen's 2012 Social Media Report, a third of users are annoyed by ads on social networks. More than half of U.S. households own a dedicated game console, with casual, social games being the most popular. Advertisers are targeting consumers through ads in digital games and mobile gaming revenues were around $200 million in 2012. Six out of seven U.S. consumers watched video content online in 2012, according to a survey by Accenture. Advertisers have adapted to selling ads against consumer-generated video content online. Viral ads are gaining popularity, and U.S. spending on digital video ads is projected to double by 2016. Advertisers use personal data to target consumers with relevant ads, raising privacy concerns among advocates. Privacy advocates are concerned about commercial enterprises collecting consumer information online. They urge legislation for more control over data collection. Website owners fear stricter privacy standards may impact targeted ads. Contextual advertising targets users based on recent online activity, while behavioral ads use past browsing behavior. Behavioral ads raise more privacy concerns due to data collection. A company uses tracking cookies to collect and analyze consumer's online activity to create targeted ads based on their interests. These ads can be more profitable than other forms of online advertising. Companies claim that the data collected is anonymous and disclosed in privacy policies. Mobile devices also use location-based data for advertising purposes. Behavioral tracking through mobile devices allows advertisers to serve location-based ads, despite concerns about privacy and consumer exploitation. Calls for mandatory constraints on behavioral advertising have been made by consumer groups, as the practice remains largely unregulated in the United States. The use of third-party tracking cookies on websites has raised concerns about intrusive monitoring and privacy violations. Companies like Google Adsense, DoubleClick, and Facebook have faced regulatory actions related to web tracking. The FTC has taken enforcement actions against several companies for their use of tracking technology. The FTC recommended a \"Do-Not-Track\" registry to allow consumers to opt out of online tracking, noting concerns about irresponsible handling of consumer information. Some web browsers have \"do not track\" features, but their effectiveness is questioned. Google reported that 17% of U.S. viewers using Firefox had enabled the setting. The Digital Advertising Alliance's (DAA) turquoise Advertising Option Icon was created in response to pressure from the FTC for online behavioral advertising. Users can click on the icon to access a disclosure statement on data collection and a voluntary opt-out mechanism. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is working on global tracking standards. Critics argue that the DAA Icon does not provide enough information on data collection practices. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is a group consisting of computer scientists, consumer advocates, and companies like Microsoft and Google. They are working on global tracking standards, but have not yet reached a consensus on technology or policy components related to consumer web tracking. Congress has a history of regulating advertising to ensure fair competition, protect consumers from misleading messages, limit children's exposure to certain ads, and restrict promotion of harmful products. Recently, federal agencies like the FTC have focused on digital advertising. Several federal agencies, including the FTC, FDA, and FCC, are involved in regulating advertising. The FTC is responsible for protecting consumers from false, deceptive, or unfair claims in both online and traditional advertising. The FDA enforces regulations on food package labeling, health claims, and prescription drug advertising. The FCC regulates advertising on radio, television, and telephone. The FCC regulates advertising on radio, television, telephone, satellite, cable television, and the Internet. They are also focusing on children and digital media. The CFPB oversees financial product advertising and has rules against misleading claims. The FEC oversees political ads, and state regulations also impact online advertising. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) oversees political ads, while state regulations also impact online advertising. Many states have laws affecting digital advertising, with some, like California, Maryland, and New York, introducing legislation on consumer or child online privacy. California, for example, has laws requiring commercial websites to have a privacy policy for residents and allowing minors to remove publicly posted content on social media sites. The advertising industry also has self-regulatory measures in place. The Advertising Self-Regulatory Council (ASRC) oversees the sale of firearms, alcohol, and tobacco, aiming to develop standards of \"truth and accuracy\" for national advertisers. It includes recommendations for corrective actions and an internal appeals process. Other initiatives focus on promoting healthier food and beverage choices in advertising targeted at children and improving consumer confidence in electronic advertising. The IAB, founded in 1996, sets voluntary standards for online businesses and advertisers, representing over 500 media and technology companies. It aims to establish principles for online behavioral advertising and provide guidance for the mobile environment. The IAB works to fend off intrusive legislation and has released voluntary guidelines for behavioral advertising. It also sets standards for advertising in social media and on mobile platforms, striving to standardize online advertising practices. According to Pew Research, only 38% of consumers know how to limit information collected by websites. Regulators in the US and Europe are scrutinizing tracking technology, with the EU having strict privacy laws like the Cookie Directive. The US approach is more industry-based, posing compliance challenges for US companies in Europe. The FTC recommended a Do Not Track framework in 2012 and privacy protections for mobile services. The FTC recommended a Do Not Track framework in 2012 and strengthened privacy protections for children under 13 in 2013. The revised COPPA rule expanded the definition of \"personal information\" and updated how companies obtain parental consent. Additionally, the FTC updated Dot.com disclosures for online advertising to provide guidance on avoiding unfair or deceptive business practices. In December 2010, the Department of Commerce Internet Policy Task Force released a green paper on commercial data privacy issues, recommending the establishment of a Privacy Policy Office and a commercial data privacy framework for businesses. The White House also released a consumer data privacy framework in 2012, addressing third-party personal data collection and targeted ads. Senators reintroduced the Do-Not-Track Online Act of 2013, requiring companies to honor user requests not to have online ads targeted to them. In April 2013, the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on industry self-regulation of online behavioral advertising. Senators reintroduced geolocation privacy legislation to prohibit the interception, disclosure, and use of geolocation information. In the House of Representatives, the Online Communications and Geolocation Protection Act was reintroduced with similar provisions. Representative Joe Barton plans to reintroduce the Do Not Track Kids Act. Representative Edward Markey plans to reintroduce a bill in the 113th Congress that would prohibit the collection and use of minors' information for targeted marketing. The bill also aims to strengthen privacy protection for children by including features such as an eraser button for parents to delete information gathered by companies."
