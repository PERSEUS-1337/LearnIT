    "content": "The Act titled \"Safety in Defense Contracting Act\" requires the Secretary of Defense to debar companies that jeopardize the health or safety of government personnel or are guilty of contract fraud. The Safety in Defense Contracting Act mandates the Secretary of Defense to debar defense contractors who cause serious harm or commit fraud in covered contracts. The Safety in Defense Contracting Act requires the Secretary of Defense to debar subcontractors who have caused serious harm or committed fraud in covered contracts. The Safety in Defense Contracting Act mandates that the Secretary of Defense must debar subcontractors from defense contracts if they have caused harm or committed fraud. This applies to contracts exceeding $500,000 for goods or services awarded by the Department of Defense. The debarment only applies to contracts sought by an offeror for similar goods or services as those involved in the determination of wrongdoing. The debarment required by the Safety in Defense Contracting Act applies for a minimum of five years after a determination of wrongdoing. The Secretary of Defense can waive the debarment on a case-by-case basis if it jeopardizes national security. Dispositions in criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings that trigger debarment include convictions, findings of fault resulting in monetary penalties of $5,000 or more, and fault findings in administrative proceedings. In an administrative proceeding, fault and liability resulting in a monetary fine of $5,000 or more or reimbursement, restitution, or damages exceeding $100,000 can lead to consequences. In criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings, a matter can be resolved by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault if it could have led to specified outcomes. SEC. 3. WITHHOLDING OF CERTAIN CONTRACT FEES. Defense contractors receiving a level III corrective action request from the Defense Contract Management Agency will have award or incentive fees withheld by the Secretary of Defense for that fiscal year. Any fees already paid must be reimbursed by the contractor."
