    "content": "Tax treaty proposals in prior Congresses have focused on U.S. tax treatment of foreign firms conducting business in the United States. Foreign firms earning business income in the U.S. are subject to corporate income tax and a flat \"withholding\" tax. This tax applies whether the foreign firm operates through a U.S. subsidiary or a branch of the foreign parent company. The United States taxes foreign-chartered corporations on income from U.S. business activities and applies a withholding tax on various types of income received from U.S. sources. The withholding tax rate is typically 30%, but can be reduced or eliminated under bilateral tax treaties. Intra-firm income repatriations may be exempt from withholding tax. Since the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the United States has imposed a 30% \"branch tax\" in addition to the withholding tax on foreign firms' U.S. source income. This could result in a combined tax rate of up to 53.8% on dividend payments, but it is usually lower due to tax deductions for intra-firm payments. The United States imposes a branch tax on foreign firms' U.S. source income, in addition to withholding tax. Tax deductions for intra-firm payments can lower the combined tax rate on dividend payments. Foreign firms can eliminate U.S. corporate income tax by making tax-deductible payments to related foreign parents, such as interest on intra-firm debt or royalties for intangible assets. Tax treaties often reduce or eliminate withholding tax, with provisions for non-discrimination and information exchange by tax authorities. The U.S. imposes branch tax and withholding tax on foreign firms' U.S. income. Tax deductions for intra-firm payments can lower the tax rate on dividends. Tax treaties reduce withholding tax and allow for information exchange. Some countries do not have tax treaties with the U.S., leading to firms using \"treaty shopping\" to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax. \"Treaty shopping\" is a strategy used by foreign firms to avoid U.S. withholding tax by routing income through third countries with lower tax rates. This practice is also utilized by foreign portfolio investors. H.R. 3200 and H.R. 3962 focus on deductible payments to target treaty-shopping by foreign corporations. Firms from countries not on the IRS tax-treaty list can benefit from treaty shopping by routing income through countries with lower tax rates. This strategy can be beneficial for firms facing high withholding tax rates, as it can significantly reduce tax liabilities. Treaty shopping is not limited to deductible payments like interest and royalties but can also apply to non-deductible payments such as dividends. Treaty shopping can benefit non-deductible payments like dividends by reducing withholding tax rates with the United States. Countries must have favorable treaty provisions to be attractive for this strategy, with no taxes that negate the advantage of reduced U.S. tax. Some countries have a 0% rate for interest payments, but \"limitation on benefits (LOB)\" provisions may restrict the use of certain countries as conduits for U.S. income. In the 111th Congress, proposals like H.R. 3200 and H.R. 3962 aim to limit tax treaty benefits on U.S. withholding tax for deductible related-party payments. This mirrors a previous proposal from the 110th Congress. The proposal would apply a higher withholding tax rate if a U.S. subsidiary made a payment to a foreign corporation with a common foreign parent, compared to making the payment directly to the parent. The provision in H.R. 3200, H.R. 3962, and H.R. 4849 aims to limit tax treaty benefits on U.S. withholding tax for deductible related-party payments to a foreign corporation with a common foreign parent. The withholding tax rate would be 15% for payments to the subsidiary, regardless of the nominal 0% rate, if there is at least 50% common ownership. This provision would not apply if there is a tax-reducing treaty with the parent's home country. The proposals in the 110th Congress aimed to curb treaty shopping by withholding taxes at the rate of the common foreign parent for payments deductible under the U.S. corporate income tax. The provisions were modeled after previous bills and required a 50% common ownership between the U.S. corporation and the payee corporation linked to a common foreign parent. Supporters were concerned about tax revenue from foreign firms reducing their U.S. tax obligations. The anti-treaty-shopping proposal aims to prevent foreign firms from reducing U.S. withholding taxes, which impacts tax revenue collected by the United States. Supporters argue for fairness, while opponents fear increased costs for U.S. firms. Previous Congresses have also attempted to restrict treaty shopping, with one alternative being to include restrictions in tax treaties. The United States has included limitation on benefits (LOB) clauses in tax treaties to prevent treaty shopping. However, renegotiating all treaties with such provisions would be time-consuming and not all countries may agree. Legislation in TRA86 also restricted treaty shopping by foreign firms. Under its terms, a treaty cannot reduce the branch tax for a foreign firm where less than 50% of the firm's stock is owned by residents of the treaty country, or where 50% or more of the firm's income is used to meet liabilities to non-residents. Earnings stripping rules under Section 163(j) prevent foreign firms from avoiding U.S. corporate income tax by making tax-deductible payments to the foreign parent. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 introduced provisions to limit earnings stripping by foreign firms in the U.S. These provisions deny deductions for interest payments to related corporations after a certain threshold of interest payments and debt-finance level is exceeded. The goal is to ensure that foreign firms pay some U.S. tax on their U.S. income, addressing treaty shopping and withholding tax avoidance issues. The proposed treaty-shopping restrictions in H.R. 3200, H.R. 3962, and H.R. 4849 aim to increase revenue by $3.8 billion and $7.7 billion over 5 and 10 years. The economic analysis questions whether these plans would enhance U.S. economic welfare by balancing tax revenue collection with attracting foreign investment. Collecting tax revenue from foreign firms keeps profits in the U.S. economy instead of repatriating them to their home country. Foreign investment can increase wages by boosting labor productivity through capital increases. While it may create new jobs in specific areas, its overall impact on the U.S. economy is more on wages than on aggregate employment. This contrasts with the focus on job creation in discussions about foreign investment. The basic economic principle states that in functioning markets, labor is paid based on its marginal product. Foreign investment can increase domestic wages, but higher taxes on foreign investors can reduce their positive impact on wages. The optimal policy is to tax foreign investors to balance tax revenue and wage reduction. The analogy of a goose and golden egg is used to illustrate this concept. The elasticity of supply of foreign investment plays a crucial role in determining the optimal tax rate on foreign firms. Treaty shopping restrictions could potentially eliminate all U.S. tax on U.S. earnings for foreign firms. Economic theory suggests that increasing taxes on foreign investment could enhance U.S. economic welfare, but possible counter-actions by foreign investors need to be considered. The analysis does not consider potential counter-actions by foreign governments, which could negate any benefits to the United States. Some argue that the anti-treaty-shopping proposal in H.R. 2419 may void existing U.S. tax treaties, but this is not addressed in the report."
