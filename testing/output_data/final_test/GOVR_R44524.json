    "content": "Both the United States and European Union have large agricultural sectors with significant government support. Both regions have reoriented their agricultural policies since the mid-1990s in response to budget pressures and international trade rules. EU policymakers have faced additional pressures due to the EU's expansion to 28 nations and 508 million people as of 2013. The report compares the agricultural sectors and policy frameworks of the United States and EU, highlighting the importance of trade between the two entities. It discusses major differences in agricultural and geopolitical settings driving their policy frameworks, historical context, and current agricultural policy structures. The comparison includes agricultural support programs and outlays based on international data sources. The EU is a key trading partner and competitor of the United States in global markets for goods and services, including agricultural products. In 2013-2015, the EU accounted for 17% of total U.S. merchandise exports and 9% of U.S. agricultural exports. The EU ranked as the fifth most important destination for U.S. agricultural products. On the other hand, the United States accounted for 19% of total EU merchandise exports and 14% of EU agricultural exports. The EU was the third largest source for U.S. agricultural-product imports. The United States and EU have significant differences in their agricultural sectors. The US has double the farmland but fewer farms compared to the EU. EU has more farms spread across its member countries. EU's domestic support per acre is higher than the US, while US outlays per farm are much larger. Despite a large farm population, the number of farm holdings in the EU has been declining. The number of farm holdings in the EU has been declining, with an estimated 10.8 million farms in 2013. The average size of EU farms is 43 acres, contrasting with the US where there are 2.1 million farms with an average size of 477 acres. The technological scale of agricultural production varies across the EU's member states, with Eastern European countries slower to adopt new technology due to small farm sizes. For example, Romania has 3.6 million farms averaging 11 acres each, Poland has 1.4 million farms averaging 28 acres, and Italy has over 1 million farms with an average size of 37 acres. The EU has a large number of farms with small average sizes, limiting economies of scale in advanced agricultural production. The EU also has a larger commercial animal population compared to the US, but with smaller average animal numbers per farm. This, along with a larger rural population in the EU, influences EU farm policy emphasizing rural development and exemptions for small farming units. The EU has a large number of small farms, limiting economies of scale in advanced agriculture. US and EU farm support programs differ in size, scope, and development process. US focuses on dairy and row crops, while EU supports a broader range of farm and food sectors. The EU agricultural policy supports a wide range of farm and food products, including traditional row crops, sugar, dairy, livestock products, and fruits and vegetables. Both the US and EU use similar policy instruments such as price-triggered supports, direct payments, supply controls, and border measures. The origins of current US farm policy date back to the Great Depression when a significant portion of Americans relied on agriculture for their livelihood. The EU established the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 1962 to ensure a unified market with common prices, product preference for domestic production, and financial support for agriculture. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was established in 1962 by the EU to protect the internal market from foreign imports, provide financial solidarity through common financing of agricultural programs, and achieve objectives such as increasing productivity, ensuring fair living standards for farmers, stabilizing markets, and ensuring food availability at reasonable prices. This was primarily done through intervention in commodity markets, setting target prices, levying tariffs on imports, and providing export subsidies. In the 1960s, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was established by the EU to protect the internal market, increase productivity, stabilize markets, and ensure fair living standards for farmers. This involved intervention in commodity markets, setting target prices, levying tariffs on imports, and providing export subsidies for various agricultural products. The United States benefited from Europe's agricultural import needs in the 1940s and 1950s, leading to large U.S. stocks of grains and cotton by the late 1950s. In response, U.S. farm policy implemented supply management provisions in the 1960s, including acreage planting restrictions and global food aid donations for surplus removal. The economic crisis led to increased support for agricultural sectors in the United States and the EEC. The CAP resulted in high consumer prices and budget expenditures, accounting for a significant portion of the EEC budget. EEC trading partners criticized the CAP for distorting world markets and hindering global agricultural trade. The CAP's generous support programs led to budget outlays as the EEC expanded to 12 members by 1986. By the mid-1980s, overproduction and large stock accumulations in the EEC and U.S. resulted in intense budgetary pressures for reform. The CAP shifted the EEC from food deficit to surplus by 1982, increasing the EEC's share of world food exports. In response, the U.S. implemented the Export Enhancement Program in 1985 to protect its market share. The United States and the EU recognized the need for agricultural trade reforms to protect market share in international markets. The US began reducing direct farm support levels in the 1985 farm bill, which included lowering price-support loan rates and introducing special marketing loan provisions. The 1990 farm bill further reduced acreage eligible for income support payments and tied set-asides to end-of-season stocks. The EEC also felt pressure for reform due to overproduction and stock accumulations. In the early 1990s, the EEC faced budgetary concerns and the need for reform as enlargement towards larger countries with smaller farm households loomed. The MacSharry Reforms of 1992 reduced internal support prices and introduced production-based payments. The creation of the EU in 1993 and the establishment of the WTO further pushed for a shift towards a more liberalized market and trade environment in agriculture. The 1996 U.S. farm bill (P.L. 104-127) and EU's Agenda 2000 reforms aimed to reduce export subsidies, domestic support, and increase market orientation in agriculture. The U.S. farm bill replaced target-price deficiency payments with direct payments and extended marketing loan repayment provisions to major crops, reducing the role of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in commodity management. The Agenda 2000 reforms in the EU aimed to increase market orientation in farm policy by lowering support prices, introducing production-based direct payments, and requiring farmland to be taken out of production. Budget disciplines were established in 2002 to reduce community spending on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In 2003, further reforms focused on market orientation, establishing Pillar I for direct payments and market support policies, and Pillar II for rural development policies. The decoupled direct payment (DP) became a major component of Pillar I, replacing production-based payments under commodity-specific CMOs. The 2003 reforms in the EU decoupled support from prices and production, moving towards full decoupling. A ceiling on Pillar I spending was imposed, with increases limited to 1% per year. Farm income support was made contingent on meeting new agricultural and environmental norms. Budget restrictions limited the intended doubling of Pillar II spending by 2013. Reforms were also made to CMOs supporting hops and Mediterranean commodities, with further reform of the EU sugar program in 2006. The 2008 CAP Health Check simplified the direct aid system. The 2003 reforms simplified the CAP's direct aid system, shifted funding to rural development, clarified support for new EU countries, and increased milk quotas leading to their abolition in 2015. The 2008 reforms included changes to the EU wine sector and sugar reform, with the abolition of sugar quotas by 2017. The 2008 CAP Health Check eliminated partial decoupling for most commodities by 2012. The CAP Reform Post-2013 further simplified the CAP by reducing licensing requirements, removing production constraints, and increasing environmental compliance for payments. The 2013 CAP reform introduced increased flexibility for member states in funding allocation, convergence criteria for minimum national payments by 2020, and other changes. The CAP has evolved from heavy market intervention to more targeted and environmentally friendly support since the 1990s, with market-related measures decreasing significantly. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) governs agricultural policies and programs for the EU's 28 member countries. The CAP budget for 2014-2020 is \u20ac408.3 billion, with a focus on promoting viable food production, sustainable management of natural resources, and climate action. Market support has decreased to 4%, with decoupled direct payments accounting for 71% of the budget. Rural development makes up the remaining 24%. The 2013 CAP reform maintained two separate pillars focusing on greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, soil, water, rural employment, growth, and poverty. Direct payments were expanded to include seven components and are subject to cross compliance requirements. Member states also implement supplementary measures funded at the national level. Pillar I funds market measures and common market organization. The Common Market Organization (CMO) under the CAP includes decoupled direct payments per hectare and market support schemes for various agricultural sectors. By 2007, 21 separate CMOs were consolidated into a single CMO covering all agricultural products. The CMO addresses market intervention, trade with third countries, competition rules, state aid, and exceptional measures to mitigate market disruptions. The 2013 CAP reform made the CMO policy more market-oriented, reducing the role of intervention tools as safety nets. Restrictions on production volumes for sugar, dairy, and wine were removed, allowing farmers to respond to global market signals. A Crises Reserve fund was established to address agriculture sector crises. The 2013 CAP reform established the Crises Reserve fund of \u20ac400 million annually to address market disruptions in the agriculture sector. Direct payments under Pillar I fund the Crises Reserve, with unused funds reverting back for use in the following year. The reform also introduced the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) to replace the Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS), with some members continuing to use SAPS until 2020. The direct payments are classified as non-market distorting green-box payments by the WTO, shifting from \"decoupling\" to non-commodity \"targeting\" while maintaining their green-box status. The CAP's Pillar I includes the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) with harmonized payment per hectare and a mandatory 5% reduction for support above \u20ac150,000. A green payment offsets environmental costs, with 30% of funds allocated to it. The CAP's Pillar I includes the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) with harmonized payment per hectare and a mandatory 5% reduction for support above \u20ac150,000. 30% of funds are allocated to green payments, which include per-hectare payments for specific farming practices, a young farmer scheme, payments for areas with natural constraints, and additional payments for small farmers. Small farmers can receive additional payments of up to \u20ac1,250 per farm, with waived greening requirements and cross compliance restrictions. Voluntary coupled support is available for specific products or product groups, with certain member states offering redistributive payments to support smaller farming operations. These components are compulsory for member states, while others are optional. Member states must allocate 30% of their direct-payment funds for greening, with the remaining 70% for basic payments. BPS payments are subject to degressivity, with some countries applying reductions up to 100%. The EU's rural development policy, part of CAP's Pillar II, was introduced under \"Agenda 2000.\" Pillar II of the EU's rural development policy, introduced under \"Agenda 2000,\" aims to finance projects targeting farms and small enterprises in rural areas. Member countries design and co-finance activities to achieve a balanced agriculture that is environmentally friendly, climate-resilient, and innovative. Each state implements rural development strategies based on EU measures in six priority areas. The EAFRD funds the EU's rural development policy, promoting food chain organization, restoring ecosystems, resource efficiency, and social inclusion in rural areas. Each EU country receives funding for seven years, with a minimum of 30% allocated to environmental and climate change measures. The EAFRD funds the EU's rural development policy, with a minimum of 30% allocated to environmental and climate change measures. Member states must implement new delimitation by 2018 to receive direct payments. Farmers must comply with environmental and agricultural measures, including statutory management requirements and good agricultural and environmental conditions. The obligation of maintaining land in good agricultural and environmental condition includes standards for soil protection, habitat preservation, and water management. Violations can result in reduced direct payments for farmers. The EU's current MFF for 2014-2020 allocates \u20ac58.3 billion per year for CAP spending, with majority going to direct payments. Member states have flexibility to shift up to 15% of funding between pillars to meet national goals. Total spending for EU farm programs includes direct aid, conservation, and rural support. The EU's farm programs spending for 2011 is nearly $109.3 billion (\u20ac56.4 billion), accounting for 45% of the budget. Decoupled DP spending is estimated at $54 billion (\u20ac40 billion) for 2012-2014. The 2014 U.S. farm bill reshaped the safety net by eliminating direct payments and adding new programs. The 2014 U.S. farm bill reshaped the safety net by eliminating direct payments (DP) and introducing new partially coupled payment programs: Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC). Unlike the EU, where direct payments make up the largest share of the budget, domestic nutrition programs comprise the largest share of projected farm bill outlays in the U.S. The U.S. farm commodity safety net consists of traditional farm commodity programs with support based on fixed prices, and the marketing loan program establishing minimum prices for various commodities. The 2014 U.S. farm bill replaced direct payments with Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) programs for covered crops like corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, and peanuts. Federal crop insurance offers subsidized insurance for over 130 commodities to help farmers manage risks. Agricultural disaster assistance is permanently authorized for livestock and orchards. A comparison of EU and U.S. agricultural support programs and outlays is based on data from the WTO and OECD. Since the mid-1990s, total farm sector support in the United States has increased significantly, while EU total support has slightly decreased. The United States traditionally uses less trade-distorting support compared to the EU, which has made substantial reductions in trade-distorting support. Support for market-distorting commodity is measured as a share of total gross farm receipts. Support for market-distorting commodity programs has decreased for both the EU and United States, with the EU's share remaining double that of the U.S. The EU has reduced its use of trade-distorting policy support measures since the mid-1980s. Non-commodity support programs, such as conservation and rural development, have increased substantially in both regions. Excluding consumer-targeted supports, both the EU and United States provide similar levels of support as a share of total gross farm receipts. The EU and United States provide similar levels of support as a share of total gross farm receipts. U.S. consumers benefit from agriculture-based support programs like SNAP, while EU consumers transfer more support to agricultural producers than they receive in benefits. WTO member countries report their outlays in support of domestic agriculture to the WTO to monitor policy compliance. The notification data monitors countries' compliance with WTO limits on domestic agricultural support. The EU and US have reduced trade-distorting amber box program outlays since the mid-1990s. The US averaged $12.1 billion annually in amber box support, mainly for dairy, grains, pulses, oilseeds, sugar, and cotton. The EU provided a larger $47.3 billion annually in amber box support, spread across various commodities like dairy, sugar, grains, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, olive oil, and wine. Unlike the US, the EU included fresh and processed fruits and vegetables in their market support. During 1995-2010, EU and US reduced trade-distorting amber box program outlays. US amber box support decreased by 50% to $6.0 billion, with dairy, sugar, and grains dominating. EU's support dropped by 81% to $8.8 billion during 2011-2012, with dairy and grains receiving larger shares while fruits and vegetables saw a slight increase in support. Support for fruits, vegetables, olive oil, and wine declined sharply in the EU and United States, while sectors like sugar, cotton, and livestock saw a decrease in support. The Overall Trade-Distorting Support (OTDS) measure shows a decline in both countries, with the EU experiencing a significant drop in amber box and blue box programs. In the United States, there was a 22% increase in de minimis exclusions, offsetting the decline in amber box spending. The OTDS for the United States peaked in 1999 at $34.6 billion but has since decreased, averaging $13.8 billion. The EU's Overall Trade-Distorting Support (OTDS) declined from $131.8 billion in 1995 to $13.7 billion by 2012, with a $14.7 billion average in 2011-2012. The EU reduced its use of blue box exemption by 83% and shifted towards green-box-type programs. In contrast, the United States' green box spending was mainly on domestic food aid, averaging $109.5 billion during 2011-2012. EU decoupled direct payments make up 46% of green box spending, with general services, environmental payments, and structural adjustment investment aids also receiving significant support. Overall, EU agricultural sector spending decreased by nearly 10% in real terms to $112.7 billion in 2011-2012 compared to 1995-2010. In comparison, US outlays for combined OTDS green box measures have grown faster, reaching $145.5 billion. The United States and the EU have increased their green box agricultural support, with the US providing more for domestic food aid while the EU focuses on environmental and rural development programs. Both entities are shifting towards less market-distorting agricultural policies. EU rural development spending is significantly larger than U.S. outlays, with average EU outlays of $13.8 billion and $18.8 billion compared to U.S. average outlays of $0.1 billion. Policy changes since 2012 are expected to impact spending levels and WTO notifications for both entities, with the U.S. eliminating dairy price and income support programs and implementing a margin insurance program. U.S. dairy outlay notifications are expected to decrease starting in 2015. The removal of upland cotton as a covered commodity and the implementation of a new cotton insurance-type program is expected to result in negligible support outlays to cotton producers starting in 2014. U.S. decoupled income payments were eliminated, and related notifications will decline to zero starting in 2015. Outlays under the PLC and ARC programs are expected to raise outlays for grains and oilseeds to approximately $4 billion per year starting in 2015, offsetting the elimination of previous dairy price supports. In the EU, 2013 reforms could reduce total amber box outlays significantly, with decoupled payments potentially increasing marginally. The OECD evaluates agricultural policies in major developed economies, including the US and EU, using the PSE measure. The PSE value as a percent of total gross agricultural output has been decreasing for both the US and EU. US producer support was 22% of gross farm receipts during 1986-1988, peaking at nearly 25% in 1999. The US PSE share peaked at nearly 25% in 1999 due to low market prices, but has since declined to about 8-10% in 2014. The EU's PSE has also decreased from 39% in 1986-1988 to about 19% in 2014, still double that of the US. EU agricultural policy reforms have reduced producer support by shifting towards direct payments and away from market price-triggered support. The EU has shifted towards decoupled direct payments to farmers, reducing internal support levels. Average EU farm prices were only slightly higher than world market prices in 2012-2014, with sugar, beef, and poultry prices still above world prices. The US maintains open borders for trade, except for sugar and dairy products. The EU has improved market access for agricultural products through bilateral agreements and lower tariffs, with the end of milk and sugar quotas in 2015 and 2017 as significant steps in this direction. The EU and United States have reduced spending on producer subsidies, shifting towards non-commodity policy measures to support rural areas. This includes funding for extension, research, infrastructure, marketing, and public services. GSSE spending as a share of gross farm receipts has increased steadily since the 1994 Uruguay Round. The EU's GSSE share has averaged 14% since 2010, while the U.S. share has averaged 9%. U.S. consumers have benefited from these changes since the mid-1990s. Since the mid-1990s, U.S. consumers have benefited from government agricultural supports, including policies that incentivize food production, lower trade barriers, and target certain population subgroups for greater food access. The U.S. Consumer Support Estimate (CSE) has been positive since 2000, averaging 15% of gross farm receipts during 2010-2014. In contrast, EU consumers have helped underwrite subsidy transfers to their agricultural sector. The CSE measures the burden on consumers through high internal producer-support prices or import barriers. The EU's Consumer Support Estimate (CSE) has been negative from 1986-2014 but has shown an upward trend. Both the EU and the United States heavily support their agricultural sectors, with a shift towards market-oriented policies since the 1980s. Traditional support programs have been replaced with decoupled support. The United States and EU defend their farm support programs to ensure food supply safety. Criticisms persist on the need for government intervention in agriculture. Lack of substantial reform in farm programs has impacted global trade negotiations. A comparison of EU and U.S. farm support programs remains relevant for upcoming domestic farm bill negotiations. The United States is preparing for domestic farm bill negotiations and engaging in international trade negotiations with the EU, Pacific Rim nations, and the WTO."
