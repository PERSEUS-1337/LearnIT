    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts Section 4689 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, emphasizing the priority of providing opportunities for adults with developmental disabilities to live in their own homes with necessary support. Supported living arrangements should mirror typical living situations and adapt to the changing needs of the individual without requiring them to move. Consumers have the right to choose where and with whom they live, control their home environment, and receive flexible services tailored to their needs. Services should focus on helping individuals make choices and build relationships while living in their own homes. Regional centers can assist in securing homes and providing necessary supports. The supported living services include assessment of consumer needs and assistance in finding and modifying homes. Supported living services include assessment of consumer needs, facilitating circles of support, advocacy, development of employment goals, skills training, 24-hour emergency response systems, adaptive equipment maintenance, hiring personal care assistants, respite care, and community participation facilitation. Assessment of consumer needs can start before 18 years old to prepare for independent living at 18. Regional centers provide information and education to consumers about supported living services. They also monitor the quality of services provided, ensuring adherence to principles, alignment with individual needs, delivery of services, effectiveness, and consumer satisfaction. The planning team for consumers receiving supported living services must confirm the utilization of all available natural supports. Regional centers must use the same provider for consumers in the same domicile, as long as individual needs are met. Rent and household expenses for supported living homes are the responsibility of the consumer and any roommate. A regional center may make rent, mortgage, or lease payments for consumers receiving supported living services if it is necessary to meet specific care needs and ensure health and safety. The regional center can assist consumers with accessing natural supports during rent, mortgage, or lease payments for up to six months, with a review of necessity every quarter. The regional center can assist consumers with accessing natural supports during rent, mortgage, or lease payments for up to six months, with a review of necessity every quarter. If contributions are no longer appropriate, a transition period of up to six months is allowed. Paid roommates and live-in support staff in supported living arrangements must pay their share of expenses. Regional centers overseeing supported living services vendors must ensure that administrative costs are reasonable and necessary, limited to allowable costs for community-based day programs. They should also use the most cost-effective rate methodologies for determining negotiated rates. \"Household expenses\" refer to general living expenses like utilities and food consumed at home. A supported living services provider must assist a Medi-Cal beneficiary in applying for in-home supportive services within five days of moving into the arrangement. Efficiencies in providing supported living services can be achieved by sharing tasks among housemates, ensuring individual needs are met. The planning team must consider this when developing, reviewing, or modifying a consumer's individual program plan. The regional center and service provider should collaborate to determine if tasks like meal preparation, menu planning, laundry, shopping, household chores, or errands can be shared. If so, the regional center will purchase the prorated share of the activity. Consumer must be informed of any reduction in services and provided with fair hearing rights. The IPP team must complete a standardized assessment questionnaire during the development, review, or modification of a consumer's IPP to ensure appropriate supports are provided. The questionnaire, developed with input from stakeholders, helps determine necessary services and cost-effective methods of supported living services. The department will post the questionnaire on its website and provide it to regional centers by June 30, 2012. Supported living service providers must conduct comprehensive assessments to understand the consumer and develop a support plan aligned with their choices and needs. Regional centers must inform the consumer of any service reductions and provide fair hearing rights. Independent assessments can still be completed. Direct care workers providing supported living services must complete 15 hours of behavioral intervention training within three months of being hired."
