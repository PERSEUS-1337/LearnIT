Congress finds that Public Law 102-460 directed the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study of the lower Delaware River for inclusion in the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The Lower Delaware Wild and Scenic River Study Task Force prepared a river management plan to protect the river's values. 24 municipalities along the river passed resolutions after the study was completed. Segments of the Delaware River eligible for designation passed resolutions supporting the Lower Delaware River Management Plan, agreeing to implement its goals, and endorsing the river's designation. The Lower Delaware River Management Plan is supported by resolutions from segments of the Delaware River, endorsing the river's designation. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is amended to designate paragraphs for Elkhorn Creek, Clarion River, and Lamprey River. The Lower Delaware River and associated tributaries are added as paragraph 161. The Lower Delaware River Management Plan is endorsed by resolutions from segments of the river.
