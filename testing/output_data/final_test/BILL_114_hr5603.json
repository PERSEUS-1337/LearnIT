The Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative estimates that $20-40 billion is lost annually to corruption in developing countries. In 2014, $480 million in corruption proceeds linked to former Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha was forfeited. The Department of Justice established the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative in 2010 to forfeit proceeds of foreign corruption and return them to the victims. Corruption in developing countries leads to annual losses of $20-40 billion, with only $5 billion repatriated in the last 15 years. This weakens governments, reducing resources for fighting terrorism and building strong institutions. The United States has effective programs to reward individuals who assist in identifying and convicting criminals, seizing illicit assets and proceeds of criminal activity. The United States has programs to reward individuals for identifying and convicting criminals and seizing illicit assets. However, existing rewards programs do not specifically provide monetary incentives for recovering stolen assets linked solely to foreign government corruption. Foreign government corruption involves officials stealing, misappropriating, or diverting assets for personal gain through embezzlement or bribes. This may not always lead to forfeiture actions or BSA violations, making it difficult to provide rewards under existing Treasury Department authorities. Officials take bribes to allow government resources to be expended in ways that lack transparency. They often use the US and international financial system to hide stolen assets. Whistleblowers who expose foreign corruption face risks to their safety and need incentives like monetary rewards and asylum to protect themselves and their families. It is the sense of Congress that a Treasury stolen asset recovery rewards program is needed to identify and recover stolen financial assets linked to foreign government corruption and hidden behind complex financial structures. This program aims to intensify the global fight against corruption and assist in returning stolen assets to the affected countries. A Treasury stolen asset recovery rewards program is needed to identify and recover stolen financial assets linked to foreign government corruption and hidden behind complex financial structures. The Department of the Treasury establishes the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Rewards Program to pay rewards for eliminating stolen assets linked to foreign government corruption from U.S. financial institutions. The rewards program, administered by the Secretary of the Treasury, allows for the payment of rewards to individuals providing information leading to the seizure of stolen assets in U.S. financial institutions or linked to foreign government corruption. The rewards program, administered by the Secretary of the Treasury, allows for the forfeiture and repatriation of stolen assets in U.S. financial institutions or linked to foreign government corruption. Coordination is in place to prevent duplication or interference with reward payments. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other agencies, establishes procedures for offering, administering, and paying rewards under this section, including identifying actions, analyzing data, and approving payments. Prior approval of the attorney general is required. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other agencies, establishes procedures for offering, administering, and paying rewards under this section. Before making a reward in a matter with Federal criminal jurisdiction, written concurrence of the Attorney General is required. Rewards are paid from the Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, with a limitation of $25,000,000 annually unless waived by the President. The President can waive the $25,000,000 annual limitation on rewards by providing written notice to the Secretary and Congress at least 30 days before any payment. No award can be made without information submitted under penalty of perjury, and the maximum reward amount is $5,000,000 unless personally authorized by the Secretary for exceptional cases. Written approval is required for any reward payment under this section. The Secretary must approve and certify rewards under this section, and only an Under Secretary can be delegated this task. Protection measures will be taken if the recipient's identity needs to be safeguarded. Rewards can be in the form of monetary payments. Ineligibility, reduction, or denial of rewards can occur under certain circumstances. Ineligibility, reduction, or denial of rewards may apply to government officers or employees who provide certain information while on duty. If an individual involved in actions leading to theft, misappropriation, or corruption is seeking a reward, the Secretary can reduce the award or deny it altogether. The Secretary can deny rewards to individuals convicted of criminal conduct related to theft, misappropriation, or corruption. The Secretary's determinations under this section are final and not subject to judicial review. Additionally, the Secretary is required to issue a report detailing stolen assets within the United States or under the control of a U.S. person. The Secretary must issue a report on stolen assets held by any United States person, efforts to identify more stolen assets, and interactions with international financial institutions. Ongoing investigations are excluded from the report. The curr_chunk provides definitions related to financial assets for ongoing investigations by appropriate committees of Congress.
