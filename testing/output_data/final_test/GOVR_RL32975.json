The Act allocated $22.5 billion for medical services, including $1.2 billion for emergency purposes, as well as funds for medical administration, facilities, and research. No fee increases proposed by the President were recommended. The House and Senate adopted the conference report for the Military Construction, Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2006, which allocated funds for medical services, facilities, and research. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006 (P.L.109-148) was signed into law on December 30, 2005, providing $225 million for the Veterans Health Administration for hurricane recovery and pandemic preparedness. Total funds appropriated for VHA reached $29.3 billion. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides benefits including disability compensation, pensions, education, training, medical care, and home loan guarantees. VA's budget includes mandatory and discretionary spending for various programs administered through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA). The VA's budget includes mandatory and discretionary funding for programs like disability compensation, pension benefits, vocational rehabilitation, and medical care. In FY2005, about 48% of the total VA budget authority was discretionary, with a focus on supporting VA medical care. VHA operates a large healthcare system with hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, and outpatient clinics. VHA also provides grants for state-owned nursing homes and collaborates with the Department of Defense. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) collaborates with the Department of Defense to share healthcare resources. In FY2004, VHA served 4.7 million unique veteran patients, with outpatient visits reaching 49.9 million. VHA spent 56% of its medical care obligations on outpatient care and manages the largest medical education program in the US. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) offers education degrees in 40 health profession disciplines. In FY2004, over 84,000 healthcare professionals received training in VA medical centers. The report provides an overview of the federal appropriation process, VHA's enrollment process, funding levels for FY2005, budget shortfalls for FY2005 and FY2006, supplemental appropriations for Gulf Coast hurricanes and avian flu preparation, total VHA funding for FY2006, and the Administration's major budget proposals for FY2006. The federal budget process starts with the President's budget request to Congress, followed by the development of the annual budget resolution by the Budget Committees of the House and Senate. The House and Senate develop the annual budget resolution, setting spending and revenue levels for the upcoming fiscal year and the following four years. The resolution is not binding and does not allocate funds to specific programs, but program assumptions are discussed in the accompanying report. Appropriations Committees divide allocations among subcommittees responsible for appropriations acts. Authorizing committees may also consider legislation affecting program spending. Committees have discretion in recommending legislative changes and are not bound by Budget Committees' recommendations. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reorganized their subcommittees at the beginning of the 109th Congress. The House reduced its subcommittees to ten, while the Senate reduced theirs to twelve. This restructuring gave jurisdiction over funding for VA programs to specific subcommittees in both chambers. Prior to this change, appropriations for VA programs fell under different committees. The House and Senate Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Subcommittees were responsible for VA's medical care appropriations and major policy proposals. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established a national enrollment system for inpatient and outpatient care based on veterans' status. Entry into the VA health care system begins with enrollment application at any time during the year. VA health care eligibility is primarily based on \"veteran's status\" from military service, including active-duty status and honorable discharge. Veterans are placed into Priority Groups 1-6, with high priority given to those with service-connected disabilities or lower incomes. Veterans eligible for VA health care include those with disabilities incurred in duty, former POWs, Purple Heart recipients, catastrophically disabled veterans, World War I veterans, those exposed to hazardous agents, and those with low income. VA considers income, net worth, and health insurance coverage to determine priority category and copayments. VA may bill insurers for nonservice-connected care. The VA health care system is funded through various appropriations accounts and supplemented by other revenue sources. Veterans who do not fit into the priority groups based on service-connected conditions and income levels are enrolled in Priority Group 7 or 8. Congress appropriates funds for medical care, research, prosthetics, administration, and construction of medical facilities for VA facilities. The VA health care system is funded through appropriations and cost recovery collections. VHA can bill veterans and insurers for nonservice-connected care to offset costs. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 allowed VHA to retain funds in the Medical Care Collections Fund. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 appropriated $28.1 billion for VHA, with allocations for medical services, administration, facilities, and equipment. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 allocated $3.7 billion for medical administration, $402 million for medical and prosthetic research, and $370 million for Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES)-related activities. The Act did not approve the Administration's proposal to fund VHA through an alternative account structure or include copayment changes. The Military Construction Appropriations and Emergency Hurricane Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2005 was signed into law on October 13, 2004. The Veterans Health Administration received additional funding through the FY2005 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. This bill provided $1.5 billion in supplemental appropriations for veterans medical services for FY2005, with a total appropriation of $29.7 billion for VHA. This included funding for medical services, administration, facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. Additionally, $2.0 billion was allocated for medical care cost collections. The Veterans Health Administration received $1.5 billion in supplemental appropriations for medical services in FY2005, totaling $29.7 billion. The President's FY2006 budget requested $30.4 billion for VHA, with allocations for medical services, administration, facilities, and research. The House passed H.Con.Res. 95 providing $31.7 billion for VA's programs, while the Senate approved $68.9 billion for both discretionary and mandatory programs. The House and Senate passed budget resolutions for FY2006, with the House directive to reduce direct spending on veterans' programs not included in the Senate version. The conference agreement included $31.8 billion for VA discretionary programs, exceeding the President's recommended level. No language directed reductions in direct spending for veterans programs. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 2528 for Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs for FY2006, with $28.8 billion appropriated for VHA. The House passed the bill on May 26, 2005, allocating $31.0 billion for VHA, including $2.2 billion for specialty mental health care. The Committee fenced off these funds to ensure they are dedicated to mental health care. The MIL-QUAL appropriations bill allocated $4.1 billion for medical administration, with reductions in VHA's information technology programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $3.3 billion for medical facilities and $393 million for medical and prosthetic research. Additionally, H.R. 2528 appropriated funds for construction projects. The MIL-QUAL appropriations bill provided $25.0 million for Grants for Construction of State Extended Care Facilities, $79 million less than the FY2005 enacted amount. The increased medical care cost for FY2005 was about $1 billion more than the FY2005 enacted amount, as announced at a hearing of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. The Secretary testified on the need for additional funding for veterans' health care programs in FY2006. The Senate passed a bill with emergency appropriations for veterans' medical services in FY2005. The Administration requested additional funding for medical services in FY2005, including for new veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The FY2005 budget did not account for the impact of extended operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The VA now estimates 103,000 veteran patients from Iraq and Afghanistan entering the system. The requested amount includes funding for long-term care, increased workload, reducing backlog, dependents' healthcare, emergency medical equipment, and utility costs. The House passed a bill providing $975 million for veterans medical services in FY2005. The Administration submitted a budget amendment for FY2006 requesting an additional $1.97 billion for VA medical services, including funding for increased workload, long-term care services, reducing backlog, addressing increases in patients and utilization of services, and replenishing carryover funds from FY2005. The Administration requested an additional $1.97 billion for VA medical services in FY2006, including funding for increased workload, long-term care services, reducing backlog, and addressing increases in patients and service utilization. In response to the FY2005 budget shortfall, $1.5 billion in supplemental appropriations was provided for VA medical services, with provisions to carry over unused funds into FY2006. The FY2006 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill (P.L. 109-54) provided additional funding for FY2005. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 2528 (S.Rept. 109-105) for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs for FY2006, allocating approximately $31.3 billion for VHA, including medical services, administration, facilities, research, and information technology. The MIL-CON appropriations bill allocates $33.5 billion for VHA, including $2.2 billion for information technology. A separate account for information technology for the entire VA is created to better organize and report VA's IT efforts. Additionally, $607 million is recommended for construction major projects and $209 million for construction minor projects. The MIL-CON appropriations bill provides $104 million for grants for construction of state extended care facilities, the same as FY2005 enacted level. The Committee did not approve the Administration's fee proposals, citing concerns about forcing needy veterans to leave the VA system. The Committee's recommendation aims to meet the fiscal needs of the VA without burdening the veteran population. The VA should request adequate funding levels without implementing new fees. The Senate passed the MIL-CON appropriations bill with a requirement for the VA to report any budget shortfalls. The House adopted the conference report making appropriations. The House adopted the conference report on the MIL-CON-QUAL-VA Appropriations Act for FY2006, which was signed into law on November 30, 2005, allocating $22.5 billion for medical services. The funding would only be available upon the President's official budget request revising the budget amendment from July 14, 2005. The conference committee provided $1.2 billion for VA medical services in FY2006, with a focus on specialty mental health care for veterans returning from OIF and OEF. Approximately $464 million was allocated to treat 110,000 OIF and OEF veterans, with designated specialized medical treatment facilities for mental health. The conference committee designated specialized medical treatment facilities for mental health and PTSD as \"Centers of Excellence\" at the Waco, San Diego, and Canandaigua Veterans Administration Medical Centers. $2.9 billion was appropriated for medical administration in P.L.109-114, a decrease from previous years due to funding reallocation for information technology development. The MIL-CON-QUAL-VA Appropriations Act provided $3.3 billion for medical facilities, a 12.3% decrease from FY2005. $412 million was allocated for medical and prosthetic research, a 2.4% increase from FY2005. P.L. 109-114 allocated $607 million for construction major projects, with $532 million for CARES-related projects. VA was directed to allocate $15 million for Gulf War Illness research. The bill also included language restricting VA's ability to reduce services or infrastructure of 18 facilities on the CARES list without prior approval. The MIL-CON-QUAL-VA Appropriations Act allocated $199 million for construction minor projects, with $155 million for CARES recommendations. Additionally, $85 million was appropriated for grants for state extended care facilities. Quarterly reports on VHA's financial and service status are required by the conferees. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act provided $10.5 billion for hurricane-related disaster relief, followed by a second act providing $51.8 billion. President Bush submitted a reallocation request in October 2005. President Bush submitted a reallocation request to Congress on October 28, 2005, transferring $17.1 billion from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund to respond to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and other disasters. The request was attached to the FY2006 Defense Appropriations bill, including funds for replacing medical centers in New Orleans and Biloxi, covering veterans' benefits processing costs, and repairing national cemeteries. The President requested funding for medical services, operating expenses, and construction projects to replace and repair medical centers in New Orleans and Biloxi. Additionally, funds were requested for cleaning up and repairing national cemeteries damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Another request was made for various departments including Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Defense, Homeland Security, the Interior, State, and Veterans Affairs. The Administration requested funding for avian influenza surveillance programs and to establish real-time data links with the CDC. The House adopted the conference report for the FY2006 Department of Defense Appropriations bill, which included funding for medical services, operating expenses, and construction projects. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006 was signed into law on December. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006 (P.L. 109-148) was signed into law on December 30, 2005. $23.0 billion is appropriated for medical services in FY2006, a 2.6% increase over the FY2006 request. $2.9 billion is allocated for medical administration, a $1.8 billion decrease from FY2005. $3.3 billion is provided for medical facilities, a 12.3% decrease from FY2005. $412 million is allocated for medical and prosthetic research, a 2.4% increase from FY2005. The total funding for VHA for FY2006 is $29.3 billion, a 3.5% decrease from the President's budget request. Funding for construction major projects is $975 million, a decrease from the total FY2006 request. The Department of Defense Appropriations bill provided funding for a new hospital in Biloxi, Mississippi, but not for a replacement hospital in New Orleans due to insufficient information on cost. The total funding for construction minor projects for FY2006 is $201 million, a decrease from the FY2006 request and FY2005 enacted amount. These amounts are not included in the total VHA budget as they are funded separately. Supplemental appropriations for FY2005 and FY2006 are exempt from across-the-board reductions. Additional funding requests were made for medical services in both years, with emergency funds allocated. Bills were passed in the House and Senate to add funds for medical services. The FY2006 appropriations bill was signed into law on August 2, 2005. Additional funding requests were made for medical services in FY2006. The Administration requested an additional $1.977 billion for medical services for FY2006. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported favorably on H.R. 2528, designating the amount as an emergency appropriation. The House and Senate adopted the conference report on H.R. 2528, also designating the amount as an emergency appropriation. The funding includes medical services, administration, and facilities. The Medical Care Cost Collection Fund receipts are restored to VHA as an indefinite budget authority. The Administration proposed legislative and regulatory changes to refocus the veterans' health care system. The Administration proposed legislative and regulatory changes to refocus the veterans' health care system, including assessing an annual enrollment fee, increasing pharmaceutical copayments, eliminating copayments for hospice care, authorizing VA to pay for emergency care in non-VA facilities, revising eligibility criteria for long-term care, placing a moratorium on grants for state extended care facilities, exempting former POWs from long-term care copayments, and eliminating mandatory long-term care daily. The Administration proposed legislative changes including an annual enrollment fee for Priority 7 and 8 veterans, based on income levels. Former POWs would be exempt from long-term care copayments, and mandatory long-term care daily census requirements would be eliminated. In FY2004, veterans with certain income levels were placed in Priority Groups 7 and 8 based on means test thresholds. The President proposed an annual enrollment fee for these groups, but Congress did not approve it. The MIL-QUAL and MIL-CON appropriations bills also did not include provisions for an enrollment fee. The MIL-QUAL-VA Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-114) does not include provisions for an enrollment fee on veterans. The House Veterans Affairs Committee recommended a $230 enrollment fee for Priority Group 7 veterans and a tiered enrollment fee for Priority Group 8 veterans based on income. The fees proposed were Tier 1 - $230, Tier 2 - $250, Tier 3 - $350, and Tier 4 - $500, applying to both current and new enrollees. The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee agreed to approve a $250 annual enrollment fee for higher income veterans without service-connected injuries. The Administration also proposed increasing pharmacy copayments from $7 to $15 for Priority Group 7 and 8 veterans. Congress has not approved these proposals in previous budget requests. The MIL-QUAL and MIL-CON appropriations bills passed by Congress do not authorize an increase in pharmacy copayments. The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999 allowed VA to increase medication copayment amounts and establish annual caps. The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999 allowed VA to increase medication copayment amounts and establish annual caps. An annual cap of $840 was set for veterans in Priority Groups 2-6, with no cap for Priority Groups 7 and 8. Effective January 1, 2006, the medication co-payment was increased to $8 for each 30-day supply for nonservice-connected conditions, with an annual cap of $960 for Priority Groups 2-6. No cap was set for Priority Groups 7 and 8. The $250 annual enrollment fee and increased prescription drug copayments would reduce the number of veteran patients by approximately 213,000 in FY2006. This would generate $454 million in revenue and save an additional $202 million for the VA. The MIL-QUAL-VA Appropriations Act directs VA not to include proposals like increased copayments and enrollment fees in future budgets unless savings are realized. Congress has had to find resources to make up for unrealized savings projections in the past. The Administration is proposing to exempt hospice care from inpatient and outpatient copayments for veterans. Legislation in 2004 and 2005 exempted veterans in nursing homes from extended care copayments. The Veterans Health Care Act of 2005 (S. 1182) initially included a provision to exempt veterans receiving hospice care from copayment obligations, but the final version passed by the Senate did not include this provision. The Administration is proposing to reimburse out-of-pocket expenses for emergency care treatment provided to certain insured veterans in non-VA facilities. The Administration's proposal aims to reimburse insured veterans' out-of-pocket expenses for emergency care obtained outside the VA system for nonservice-connected conditions. VA would act as a secondary payer to private insurance or Medicare, covering the co-payment amount veterans would have paid if they received care from VA. The Veterans Health Care Act of 2005 would authorize VA to reimburse eligible veterans for emergency treatment expenses incurred outside the VA system. VA's long-term care program offers a range of services for veterans with chronic illness or disability, including nursing home care, home-based care, and respite care. The Veterans Health Care Act of 2005 authorizes VA to reimburse eligible veterans for emergency treatment expenses outside the VA system. VA's long-term care program includes nursing home care, home-based care, and respite care services for chronically ill and disabled veterans. VA provides nursing home care through VA-operated, contracted community, and state veterans nursing homes, with eligibility and admission requirements varying by state. The Veterans Health Care Act of 2005 authorizes VA to reimburse eligible veterans for emergency treatment expenses outside the VA system. VA's long-term care program includes nursing home care, home-based care, and respite care services for chronically ill and disabled veterans. VA provides nursing home care to veterans with 60% service-connected disability ratings who are classified as unemployable or catastrophically disabled, as well as to veterans requiring nursing home care due to military service-related conditions. VA also offers nursing home care to veterans enrolled in VA's health care system on a discretionary basis depending on available resources. In its FY2006 budget proposal, the Administration suggests revising VHA's eligibility criteria for long-term care services provided in VA, community, and state nursing homes. The proposal aims to restrict per diem payments for veterans in state nursing homes, saving $294 million in FY2006. The number of veterans receiving per diem payments would decrease significantly. The House Committee on Appropriations rejected the proposal, urging VA to work with stakeholders for quality long-term care options. The committee report states that current funding for long-term care services in state veterans nursing homes is sufficient, rejecting proposals to revise eligibility criteria for per diem payments. The VA could face financial challenges if eligibility rules are restricted to only certain priority levels of veterans. The conferees rejected proposals to revise eligibility criteria for long-term care in veterans nursing homes. Sufficient resources are provided to maintain long-term care for all veterans through various facilities. VA grants are given to states for extended care facilities, with a maximum of 65% of the total project cost. The Administration proposed a one-year moratorium on grants in FY2006 to review long-term care infrastructure. No funding has been requested for grants for state extended care facilities in FY2006. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $25 million for safety improvements in state home facilities for FY2006, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $104 million for the grant program. The Senate Committee criticized the VA for not requesting funding for the program and recommended maintaining the funding at the FY2005 level to avoid jeopardizing current projects. The Administration is proposing to exempt former POWs from paying copayments for long-term care services, as authorized by the Veterans Health Care, Capital Asset, and Business Improvement Act of 2003. This proposal would eliminate any remaining copayment obligations for former POWs. The Administration is proposing to exempt former POWs from copayments for long-term care services. The Veterans Health Care Act of 2005 introduced a provision to eliminate copayment obligations for former POWs, but it was not included in the final bill. The Administration is requesting Congress to repeal mandatory staffing and care service requirements. The Administration is proposing to repeal mandatory staffing and care service requirements for long-term care in VA facilities. This change aims to provide veterans with home and community-based services while reserving nursing home care for those who cannot be cared for in a home setting. The proposal seeks to reduce the average daily census of veterans in long-term care beds. The Veterans Health Care Act of 2005 proposed reducing the average daily census of veterans in VA nursing homes and increasing funding for home and community-based services. The Act initially included a provision to repeal mandatory staffing requirements but was passed without this provision. Veterans with service-connected disabilities are exempt from outpatient prescription copayments. There is an annual medication copayment cap for veterans in priority groups 2-6. Veterans in Priority Groups 7 or 8 do not have an annual copayment cap. Veterans with a Purple Heart are in Priority Group 3. Priority Group 7 veterans who are catastrophically disabled and placed in Priority Group 4 are still subject to copayment requirements. Priority Group 6 veterans may be billed for health insurance and copayments for non-service-related conditions. Combat veterans can receive care for potential service-related conditions within two years of discharge. Priority Group 6 veterans can receive care for potential service-related conditions within two years of discharge. Priority Group 7 veterans are responsible for inpatient copayments and per diem copayments. Priority Group 8 veterans are responsible for full inpatient copayments, per diem copayments, outpatient, and medication copayments for nonservice-connected care. The Medical Services account provides funds for treatment of veterans and eligible beneficiaries in VA medical centers, nursing homes, outpatient clinic facilities, and contract hospitals. It also covers hospital and outpatient care for certain dependents and survivors of veterans under CHAMPVA. Additionally, funds are used for training medical personnel and supporting VA's medical programs, including medical and prosthetic research. The Medical Administration account funds the management and administration of VA's health care system. The Medical Facilities account provides funds for the operation and maintenance of VHA's infrastructure, including utilities, engineering, capital planning, leases, food services, and facility repair. The Medical and Prosthetic Research account funds medical, rehabilitative, and health services research, supporting basic and clinical studies to advance knowledge for efficient interventions. The prosthetic research program develops aids for disabled veterans, while the health services research program focuses on improving healthcare delivery for veterans. Overhead costs are funded by the Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF), which includes copayments and insurance payments from veterans. In FY2004, the Administration proposed consolidating various medical collections accounts into the Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF). The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 granted VA permanent authority to deposit funds from different accounts into MCCF for medical services for veterans. These funds do not have to be spent in any particular way. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 granted VA permanent authority to deposit funds from different accounts into MCCF for medical services for veterans, which are available until expended."
