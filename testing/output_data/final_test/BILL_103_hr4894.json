This title may be cited as the ``Berne and GATT Retroactivity Act of 1994''. SEC. 202. RESTORED WORKS. Section 104A of title 17, United States Code, is amended to read as follows: ``SEC. 104A. COPYRIGHT IN RESTORED WORKS. Copyright subsists in restored works and vests automatically on the date of restoration. The term of copyright in restored works published or registered before January 1, 1978, is 75 years from the date of first publication or registration. For works created on or after January 1, 1978, the term of protection follows the guidelines in section 302. Works in which the copyright was ever owned or administered by the Alien Property Custodian and would be owned by a government or instrumentality thereof are not considered restored works. Ownership of restored copyright initially vests in the author as per the source country's law. A notice of intent to enforce the copyright against reliance parties can be filed with the Copyright Office. Remedies for infringement are available immediately upon restoration for parties not considered reliance parties. Upon restoration, the title shall be available for any infringing act started after the restoration date. Remedies for copyright infringement against reliance parties are accessible if the owner files a notice of intent within 24 months of restoration and infringement occurs 12 months after publication in the Federal Register. Upon restoration, infringement for reliance parties is deemed to have commenced prior to registration if the owner serves a notice of intent to enforce the restored work. Infringement can also occur after publication of the notice in the Federal Register or after receipt of a notice of intent by a particular reliance party. Upon restoration, infringement for reliance parties is deemed to have commenced prior to registration if the owner serves a notice of intent to enforce the restored work. Notices of intent filed with the Copyright Office to enforce a restored work must be signed by the owner of the copyright or the owner of the exclusive right filing the notice and identify the title of the restored work. The Register of Copyrights must publish lists of restored works and their ownership in the Federal Register every 4 months, starting 4 months after the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property becomes effective in the US. The Copyright Office maintains a list of notices of intent to enforce restored works, available for inspection. The Register of Copyrights can set fees for processing these notices. Within 30 days of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property taking effect in the US, the Copyright Office must act accordingly. The Copyright Office will establish regulations for filing notices of intent to enforce restored works in the US. Owners can also register a claim of copyright simultaneously. Notices of intent can be served on reliance parties, identifying the restored work and objection, with contact information provided. The owner must provide contact information for the reliance party. Immunity from liability is granted to individuals who warrant that their work does not violate copyright laws. Definitions for terms are provided for clarity. The Intellectual Property Act of 1994 defines terms related to copyright restoration, eligible countries, and reliance parties. Eligible countries are those that have joined the World Trade Organization or adhered to the Berne Convention. The term 'reliance party' refers to a person who engaged in acts that would have violated copyright laws before certain agreements came into effect, and continued to do so afterwards. The term 'restored work' refers to an original work of authorship that is protected under copyright law, not in the public domain in its source country, and in the public domain in the United States due to noncompliance with formalities imposed by US copyright law. The term 'source country' of a restored work refers to a country other than the United States where the author is a national or domiciliary. The source country of a restored work is determined by the nationality or domicile of the majority of foreign authors, or by the country with the most significant contacts with the work if the authors are not foreign. For published works, the source country is where the work is first published or where it is simultaneously published in multiple eligible countries. The sale of restored works without authorization can only occur within a specified period and limited to one copy at a time after that period. HR 4894 IH----2"
