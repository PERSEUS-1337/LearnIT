    "title": "SB 1383",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California acknowledges the harmful impact of short-lived climate pollutants like black carbon, fluorinated gases, and methane on air quality, public health, and climate change. These pollutants are more potent than carbon dioxide and pose a significant environmental risk, contributing to premature death. Efforts to reduce these emissions can have immediate benefits for both climate change and public health, especially in areas with poor air quality. The Legislature aims to support policies improving organics recycling and biomethane use from solid waste facilities. Disposal reduction targets are set as statewide averages, not minimum requirements for each jurisdiction. The state board is required to implement a climate pollutant strategy to reduce methane, hydrofluorocarbon gases, and black carbon emissions by specified percentages below 2013 levels by 2030. The state board must coordinate with other agencies, hold public hearings, evaluate scientific information, and prioritize measures with cobenefits before approving the short-lived climate pollutant strategy. This includes job growth, public health benefits, and potential for innovation. The state board must coordinate with other agencies, evaluate scientific information, and prioritize measures with cobenefits before approving the short-lived climate pollutant strategy. This includes job growth, public health benefits, and potential for new innovation in technology, energy, and resource management practices to reduce methane emissions and landfill disposal of organics. The state board is restricted from adopting methane emission control requirements for organic waste disposal in landfills until January 1, 2025. A new section in the Health and Safety Code defines terms related to reducing short-lived climate pollutants. The state board, in consultation with the department, will adopt regulations to reduce methane emissions from livestock and dairy manure management operations by up to 40% below 2013 levels by 2030. Prior to adopting these regulations, the state board must fulfill certain requirements. The stakeholders will work together to address challenges in developing dairy methane reduction projects. They will hold public meetings in various locations and consult with the department to meet regulatory goals. The state board, in consultation with the department, will conduct research on dairy methane emissions reduction projects and consider developing methane emissions reduction protocols. A report on the progress will be posted on the state board's website, and regulations will be implemented after January 1, 2024, if certain conditions are met. The regulations for dairy and livestock manure management methane emissions reduction projects must be technologically feasible, economically feasible, cost-effective, include provisions to minimize leakage, and evaluate achievements of incentive-based programs. The state board will analyze the progress of dairy and livestock sectors in achieving emission reduction goals by July 1, 2020. If insufficient progress is due to funding or technical barriers, the goals may be reduced after consultation with stakeholders. The state board, in consultation with the commission and the energy commission, will establish energy infrastructure policies to promote dairy biomethane projects by January 1, 2018. A pilot financial mechanism will be developed to reduce economic uncertainty related to environmental credits from dairy projects producing low-carbon fuels, with recommendations for expansion to other biogas sources. The commission, in consultation with the state board and the department, will direct gas corporations to implement at least five dairy biomethane pilot projects by January 1, 2018. Gas corporations may recover the reasonable cost of pipeline infrastructure for these projects in rates. The state board will provide guidance on credits generated under the Low-Carbon Fuel Standard regulations and the market-based compliance mechanism by January 1, 2018. Projects developed before the implementation of regulations will receive credit for at least 10 years, with the possibility of an extension as allowed by the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. The state board will only implement incentive-based mechanisms for enteric emissions reductions until a cost-effective and scientifically proven method is available. Voluntary reductions can contribute to meeting emission goals, except for methane emissions from dairy and livestock operations to achieve greenhouse gas reduction targets. Section 39730.8 of the Health and Safety Code defines terms related to reducing short-lived climate pollutants, including the Public Utilities Commission and State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission. The state board retains authority to acquire planning information and regulate emissions, while voluntary reductions can help meet emission goals. The energy commission, in consultation with the state board and the commission, will develop recommendations for the use of renewable gas in the Integrated Energy Policy Report. This includes biomethane and biogas, considering cost-effective strategies aligned with state policies and climate goals, such as the Renewables Portfolio Standard program and Low-Carbon Fuel Standard regulations. State agencies will consider adopting policies to increase the production and use of renewable gas, including biomethane and biogas, to meet climate change and renewable energy goals. The commission will consider additional policies to support the development and use of renewable gas, prioritizing fuels with the greatest greenhouse gas emissions benefits. A new chapter on Short-Lived Climate Pollutants is added to the Public Resources Code to achieve organic disposal reduction targets. The department, in consultation with the State Air Resources Board, shall adopt regulations to achieve organic waste reduction goals for 2020 and 2025. This includes requiring local jurisdictions to impose requirements on generators and penalties for noncompliance. Investment in organics recycling capacity and robust funding mechanisms are needed to support these goals. The department may establish different requirements and timelines for local jurisdictions based on their progress in meeting organic waste reduction goals. Penalties for noncompliance shall not exceed a certain amount authorized by law. The regulations regarding penalties for noncompliance with organic waste reduction goals shall take effect on or after January 1, 2022. Local jurisdictions may charge fees to cover their costs in complying with the regulations. The department will analyze progress in achieving organic waste reduction goals by July 1, 2020, including the development of new organics recycling infrastructure and funding commitments. The curr_chunk discusses reducing regulatory barriers for organics recycling facilities, policies for permitting infrastructure, and markets for products like biomethane and compost. The department may include incentives or additional requirements in regulations to facilitate progress towards organic waste reduction goals. Local jurisdictions can adopt additional requirements beyond the regulations. No reimbursement required by this act as local agencies or school districts can levy charges to cover mandated services."
