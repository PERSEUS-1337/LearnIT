    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Chronic Care Practice Research Network Act of 2007\". The Congress finds that Medicare spending involves beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions, leading to duplicative tests, contradictory information, adverse medication responses, and preventable hospital visits. Traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage do not meet the unique needs of these beneficiaries. Medicare has implemented demonstration projects to improve care for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions, but there is limited translation of evidence-based results to the wider chronic care community. As the population of Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions grows, more effective actions should be taken to test care models and implement best practices promptly. The United States Government should collaborate to address these challenges. The United States Government should partner with qualified health care institutions to develop and implement improvements in coordinated care for Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. This collaboration will help translate evidence-based results into clinical practice more effectively. The Medicare Chronic Care Practice Research Network aims to develop and apply improved practices in coordinated care for Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Medicare Chronic Care Practice Research Network within 60 days of the enactment of this Act. The Network will initially operate for at least five years, with the possibility of extension based on its performance and benefits to the Medicare program. The purpose of the Network is to enable highly qualified providers to improve coordinated care for Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. The Medicare Chronic Care Practice Research Network, established under section 1807 of the Social Security Act, aims to develop evidence-based chronic care management practices for Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. The Network will focus on beneficiaries in the Medicare fee-for-service program with two or more chronic illnesses, aiming to reduce costly care. The Medicare Chronic Care Practice Research Network aims to improve care management for Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions by implementing specific interventions and providing a standardized framework for all beneficiaries. Financial support includes collaboration, networking, and dissemination of guidelines and findings. The Medicare Chronic Care Practice Research Network provides financial support for research, infrastructure, patient recruitment, care management, and evaluation activities at project sites to improve care management for Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. The Medicare Chronic Care Practice Research Network conducts research at project sites and establishes target enrollment numbers based on demographics. The Network has a Board of Directors chaired by the CMS administrator. The Board of Directors for the Medicare Chronic Care Practice Research Network includes the Director of the Agency for Health Research and Quality, the Director of the National Institute on Aging, and appointed members selected by the Secretary. The Secretary appoints at least 8 individuals to serve on the Board, including one representing each MCCD site, with the option to add more members. The Secretary may appoint additional members to the Board, including those representing Network project sites not already represented. Each member appointed under this shall serve a five-year term. Vacancies will not affect the Board's duties and will be filled by the Secretary. The Board is responsible for project evaluations. The Board is responsible for project evaluations, including internal and external evaluations of each Network project site. Within 60 days of appointment, the Secretary convenes a meeting to initiate the Network and begin planning. Biennial reports on the Network's progress are to be submitted to Congress. The curr_chunk discusses the need for a research infrastructure to test interventions for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries efficiently. It includes evaluating quality, satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, scalability, collaboration benefits, and any other relevant information determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will issue public reports every two years on recommended chronic care practices and guidelines based on effective care models for managing Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic problems. The Secretary is authorized to waive provisions of the Social Security Act for the Network to carry out activities under this section. Funding will be appropriated from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will allocate $60,000,000 over a 5-year period for the Network project site, defined as the site of a chronic care management program under the Medicare program."
