    "content": "Shortcut connections have become standard in convolutional neural networks due to the success of residual networks. The effectiveness of shortcuts is attributed to acting as linear counterparts to nonlinear layers. Different types of linear connections were tested in small image classification networks, showing that some linear connections can be more effective than identity shortcuts. The best linear connection type may depend on network width and depth. Residual networks (resnets) have become a dominant force in image classification tasks, incorporating low-, medium-, and high-level features in a multi-layer fashion. They have overcome challenges like vanishing gradients by using identity shortcut connections. Resnets have achieved state-of-the-art performance with very deep neural networks, sometimes exceeding 1000 layers. The importance of shortcut connections became clear in 2015 with the emergence of HighwayNets and resnets. In 2015, Residual networks (resnets) emerged with gated shortcut connections and identity shortcut connections, making them easier to train and more effective in practice. Recent arguments suggest that the effectiveness of resnets may not be solely due to their depth, but rather because deep resnets create ensembles of shallower networks. Recent arguments suggest that the effectiveness of Residual networks (resnets) is not solely due to extreme depth but rather their ability to create ensembles of shallower networks. Wider residual networks with 10-50 layers have shown better performance and faster training than very deep ones. Shortcut connections have been proven to help in practice, with various hypotheses on their effectiveness. In this paper, a new hypothesis is investigated regarding shortcut connections in networks. The focus is on combining linear and nonlinear functions at each layer rather than just the identity mapping. Recent evidence suggests that wider, shallower networks may benefit from identity connections over general linear connections. Experiments using small networks with different block variations are conducted to explore this idea further. The study explores the use of tandem blocks in networks, combining linear and nonlinear functions. The experiments involve small image classification networks constructed from these blocks to compare different architectures. The focus is on comparing performance rather than extreme network depth, aiming to gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Our experiments show that general linear layers perform as well as the identity shortcut in resnets, even when sacrificing width. The best linear connection type in tandem networks depends on network width and depth. Tandem blocks consist of linear and nonlinear parts in parallel, allowing any linear map. The outputs are summed and passed to subsequent blocks without additional nonlinear activation functions. Recent work has shown that removing the activation function after the sum in resnets improves performance. Identity shortcuts are preferred over other linear maps in this configuration. The study tested the importance of identity shortcuts with properties like having no parameters, maintaining feature size, and bypassing multiple nonlinear convolutional layers. Five different tandem blocks were considered, each with one or two layers of activated convolutions. The curr_chunk discusses the structure of residual blocks in neural networks, which consist of either one or two layers of activated convolutions. The linear part of each block includes identity maps or convolutions of size 1x1 or 3x3. In cases where identity maps are not feasible, 1x1 convolutions are used to adjust the width. The outputs of the linear and nonlinear parts are combined at the end. The block variants include standard residual blocks with two activated convolutional layers and an identity connection. The curr_chunk discusses different types of residual blocks in neural networks, such as B id (1, w), B 1\u00d71 (2, w), B 1\u00d71 (1, w), and B 3\u00d73 (1, w). These blocks use various combinations of 1x1 and 3x3 convolutions with identity connections or nonlinear activations. The goal is to explore the effectiveness of these block structures rather than introducing a new architecture. The curr_chunk investigates the effectiveness of different tandem blocks, including residual blocks, to determine the necessity of shortcut connections and the viability of learnable convolutions as an alternative. The five tandem blocks used in the experiments are shown in Figure 1, with traditional resnets on the left and more general tandem nets on the right. Expectations for the performance of these blocks in deeper networks can vary. The curr_chunk discusses the experiments conducted to compare the effectiveness of different tandem blocks in neural networks. The focus was on building networks of varying widths and depths using five chosen tandem blocks and testing them on image recognition datasets. The goal was to determine the impact of shortcut connections and the use of learnable convolutions in creating more robust networks with fewer parameters. The experiments aimed to compare five different block types in neural networks, focusing on their strengths and weaknesses. Each model had the same number of layers and learnable parameters, with varying widths for different block types. The experiments used a simple architecture with three shape hyperparameters to control the number of parameters in each block. The experiments compared five block types in neural networks with the same number of layers and parameters but varying widths. The architecture used three shape hyperparameters to control the number of parameters in each block, resulting in networks with 6d + 2 layers. Dropout and L2 regularization were applied in all models, with specific rates determined for each architecture. The weight decay and dropout rates were determined for each architecture separately through grid searches. Optimal values varied but were always modest (dropout: 0.1 to 0.2, weight decay: 0.0001 to 0.0003). Simple image augmentation was used for training data. Batch normalization layers were tested in different places but did not improve performance as expected. We observed that networks with batch normalization achieved similar performance on average but were less stable and more sensitive to learning rates. Training networks with batch normalization also took much longer. We initialized weights from a truncated normal distribution with zero mean, scaled by fan-in. Base standard deviations varied between networks, affecting learning outcomes. Non-random initialization schemes were explored in a separate experiment. In a separate experiment, non-random initialization schemes were tested to see if networks could learn identity maps on their own. The Adam method with recommended hyperparameters was used for all experiments, with a learning rate schedule significantly improving results. The model B 1\u00d71 (1, w) consistently outperformed other models in different runs, with the best performance achieved using a specific learning rate schedule. The study tested different models on image recognition problems like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST. The tandem models consistently outperformed the resnet models in various challenges. The model B 1\u00d71 (1, w) performed best or near best each time, with B 3\u00d73 (1, w) doing better in shallower networks and B 1\u00d71 (2, w) in deeper networks. Average final accuracy for the five runs is listed in the results. The study compared tandem and standard residual blocks on image recognition tasks like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Tandem blocks consistently outperformed standard blocks, with B 1\u00d71 (1, w) variant excelling. The results showed that in most cases, tandem blocks outperformed standard blocks in terms of test accuracy. The study compared tandem and standard residual blocks on image recognition tasks like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Tandem blocks consistently outperformed standard blocks, with B 1\u00d71 (1, w) variant excelling. On CIFAR-100, B 1\u00d71 (1, w) performed at the top, while on SVHN, B 1\u00d71 (1, w) excelled again. B 3\u00d73 (1, w) showed improvement with deeper networks on SVHN. Fashion-MNIST dataset also showed B 1\u00d71 (1, w) with the strongest performance. In Fashion-MNIST dataset, B 1\u00d71 (1, w) had the strongest performance, while the resnet B id (1, w) was also competitive. The tandem block B 3\u00d73 (1, w) performed better on deeper networks. Singular value decompositions of weight matrices with 1 \u00d7 1 linear convolutions showed that the linear convolutions did not learn identity maps regardless of initialization scheme. The network learned that identity maps are not optimal in these applications. General linear connections with learnable weights have similar benefits to identity maps in residual blocks and can even improve performance. Linear connections do not learn identity maps, confirming that the success of residual networks is due to using linear maps alongside nonlinear ones. Replacing identity maps with convolutions leads to better results. The study found that replacing identity maps with convolutions resulted in improved performance in various experiments. Adjusting layer widths to maintain similar parameter counts, general linear convolutions were more effective than identity maps in conjunction with nonlinear convolutions. Tandem blocks with a single nonlinear convolution outperformed those with two, and 3 \u00d7 3 convolutions in linear connections were more beneficial in wide networks. The study suggests exploring more types of tandem blocks and their applications."
