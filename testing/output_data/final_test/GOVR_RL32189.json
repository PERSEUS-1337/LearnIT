    "content": "The September 11, 2001 attacks raised concerns about the security of various institutions in the US, including the water supply infrastructure. This sector is vulnerable to physical disruption, bioterrorism, and cyber attacks. Damage from a terrorist attack could disrupt vital services, endanger public health, and even result in loss of life. The government and private sector have taken security measures since 9/11, but there are still policy issues and congressional interest in ensuring the security of the water infrastructure. The 9/11 attacks raised concerns about the security of water supply infrastructure, with vulnerabilities to physical disruption, bioterrorism, and cyber attacks. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover highlighted the strategic importance of water facilities in 1941. Interconnections with other infrastructure systems like electric power and transportation, as well as the chemical industry, make security a critical issue. The August 2003 electricity blackout in the Northeast US revealed vulnerabilities in wastewater treatment plants. During emergencies, wastewater treatment plants in various cities without backup power discharged untreated sewage, leading to boil-water advisories in communities. Natural disasters like hurricanes and floods have caused significant damage to infrastructure systems, including water, power, and transportation. Water infrastructure systems encompass various sources of untreated water, treatment facilities, distribution systems, and wastewater treatment facilities nationwide. The water infrastructure in the United States includes 77,000 dams and reservoirs, thousands of miles of pipes and sewer lines, 168,000 public drinking water facilities, and 16,000 wastewater treatment facilities. Ownership and management are both public and private, with the federal government responsible for some dams and diversion structures. Many water projects were built by the federal government for irrigation and flood control purposes. The largest federal water facilities in the United States are managed by the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Reclamation reservoirs, especially along the Colorado River, provide water to millions in southern California, Arizona, and Nevada. Reclamation has 471 dams creating 348 reservoirs with a total capacity of 245 million acre-feet of water. The Corps operates 276 navigation locks and 11,000 miles of commercial navigation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates 276 navigation locks, 11,000 miles of commercial navigation channel, and 1,200 projects including 609 dams. It supplies water to cities, towns, and industries from 116 lakes and reservoirs, serving approximately 1 million residents in the District of Columbia and northern Virginia. The Corps facilities also produce significant amounts of power, with Hoover and Glen Canyon dams representing a large portion of the Bureau of Reclamation's electrical capacity in the West. Additionally, Grand Coulee Dam provides a substantial portion of the total hydroelectric capacity in the West. The federal government is responsible for only about 5% of dams that could cause significant damage, with the rest owned by state, local governments, utilities, and private owners. Large urban water utilities serve over 75% of the U.S. population and are potential targets for terrorist attacks, while smaller systems are less protected and more vulnerable. Numerous smaller water systems are less protected and vulnerable to attacks, potentially causing widespread panic, economic impacts, and loss of public confidence. Attacks could disrupt operating components, power systems, reservoirs, and pumping stations, hindering firefighting efforts and risking catastrophic flooding. Bioterrorism or chemical attacks could contaminate water systems, endangering public health. Concerns about the potential risks of biological agents in water systems have led to heightened awareness. Factors such as stability, virulence, culturability, and resistance to detection are important in assessing the threat. Cyber attacks on water utility systems could lead to theft, corruption of information, or service disruption. Water infrastructure systems are typically prepared for extreme events, with a historical focus on natural disasters. Following the events of September 11, 2001, federal dam operators increased security measures, closing visitor facilities at several dams and coordinating with the National Guard and local law enforcement. The Corps also temporarily closed its facilities to visitors, with ongoing security reassessments. Security threats, including the risk of terrorism, are now a key focus alongside natural disasters in the protection of water infrastructure systems. Following the heightened security measures implemented after 9/11, most facilities have reopened with ongoing security reassessments. Additional security measures remain in effect at dams, powerplants, and other facilities, including limited access, road closures, and random vehicle inspections. Operators of water and wastewater utilities are under heightened security conditions, with a focus on assessing vulnerabilities and prioritizing security improvements. Local utilities, especially in urban areas, have emergency preparedness plans in place to address redundancy of operations, public notification, and coordination with law enforcement and emergency response officials. Many plans were developed to respond to natural disasters, domestic threats, and cyber attacks, with a focus on Y2K impacts on computer systems. Water supply was identified as critical infrastructure in President Clinton's PDD-63 for national protection efforts. Utility officials are cautious about disclosing system details to prevent alerting terrorists to vulnerabilities. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) partnered with the American Metropolitan Water Association (AMWA) and American Water Works Association (AWWA) to safeguard water supplies from terrorist acts. A vulnerability assessment tool was developed by the Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratory to assess physical and cyber vulnerabilities in water systems. An Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) supported by an EPA grant was established for operational purposes. An ISAC, supported by an EPA grant and led by AMWA, was established in December 2002 to disseminate alerts to water utilities about potential threats and solutions. Various agencies are conducting research on infrastructure protection, detection, and treatment of chemical agents, and developing assessment tools for evaluating threats to water systems. The CDC is working on guidance for biological agents and their persistence through water treatment practices. The 2001 report highlighted gaps in water sector research, including the need for threat assessments, agent identification, establishment of a center of excellence, and application of information assurance techniques. Wastewater treatment facilities received less attention compared to drinking water systems. The focus on protecting wastewater treatment facilities is greater than on drinking water systems due to the environmental threat posed by their destruction. Vulnerabilities include access to underground sewers for placing destructive devices, turning pipelines into weapons, and the release of toxic chemicals from damaged containers, such as chlorine gas, which can be deadly to humans. Some water and wastewater utilities have switched from using chlorine gas to safer alternatives like sodium hypochlorite or ultraviolet light since the 2001 terrorist attacks. However, concerns remain about facilities in heavily populated areas still using chlorine gas. Over 2,800 utilities are subject to risk management planning requirements under the Clean Air Act to prepare for accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Advocates suggest implementing federal standards to ensure safe use of dangerous chemicals in facilities like wastewater treatment plants. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board recommended increased regulation for facilities using chlorine gas, such as wastewater treatment plants, to install emergency isolation devices for rapid shutdown in case of leaks. A 2006 Government Accountability Office report found that many large wastewater utilities have improved security measures since 2001. Many utilities have conducted security assessments without federal mandate. Some facilities do not use gaseous chlorine for disinfection. However, collection system vulnerabilities have been largely neglected due to complexity and cost. Converting from chlorine gas is prioritized over collection system protections, with costs ranging from $650,000 to over $13 million. The water infrastructure sector lacks federal standards for security incidents and recovery. EPA cannot mandate security improvements or standards, but voluntary protocols and tools have been developed since 2001. Utility organizations are using software and training to assess vulnerabilities, with EPA providing grant assistance. In 2002, EPA awarded grants to large and medium drinking water utilities for vulnerability assessments. EPA awarded grants to large and medium drinking water utilities for vulnerability assessments. Grants were also provided to organizations for training and technical assistance to help small and medium utilities improve security. Guidance documents were developed in 2004 to assist utilities in enhancing the security of their systems after completing vulnerability assessments. The EPA has awarded grants for vulnerability assessments and provided training to improve security for water utilities. The agency has also created a National Homeland Security Research Center to develop tools for responding to attacks on water systems. The EPA established a Water Security Division to address security events and vulnerabilities in water systems. They provide guidance, training, and support for utilities, as well as implementing a research plan to improve water security. In 2007, the National Research Council found that EPA has useful contaminant information and tools, but areas like physical and cyber security need improvement. GAO reports suggest federal funding should focus on upgrades, training, and relationships for water security. The experts recommend federal funds for upgrades, training, and relationships in water security, including replacing hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives. Priority should be given to utilities serving critical assets and large populations. EPA's Water Sector Initiative aims to test and demonstrate best practices for water utilities nationwide. The EPA's Water Sector Initiative aims to serve as a model for water utilities nationwide by testing and demonstrating contamination warning systems. Grants were awarded to install early warning systems in five cities, and the focus has expanded to include natural disasters and protection of hazardous chemicals. Additionally, the EPA supports the establishment of Water/Wastewater Agency Response Networks to facilitate emergency response. The EPA has established Water/Wastewater Agency Response Networks (WARNs) in about 20 states to facilitate emergency response in the water sector. They also provide guidance documents and tools like the Vulnerability Self-Assessment Tool (VSAT) and Water Contaminant Information Tool (WCIT) to support utility preparedness and response. The response plans include a Water Contaminant Information Tool (WCIT) for federal, state, and local agencies, a Tabletop Exercise Tool for Water Systems (TTX Tool) for emergency preparedness, and a Water Health and Economic Analysis Tool (WHEAT) for quantifying impacts. Officials have been reassessing federal infrastructure vulnerabilities, with a focus on site security for high-risk assets. Reclamation's site security program focuses on protecting high- and significant-hazard dams, hydroelectric plants, and other facilities. Vulnerability and risk assessments were conducted at 280 high-priority facilities between FY2002 and FY2006, leading to enhanced security measures such as increased staffing and restricted access. The Corps also has programs in place to protect its facilities and coordinate security systems, as well as assist in emergency preparedness for regional/national emergencies, including terrorism. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FEMA participate in the Interagency Committee on Dam Safety (ICODS) to respond to national emergencies, including terrorism. A 2003 White House report outlined a national strategy to protect critical infrastructures, focusing on water sector initiatives like improving security, monitoring capabilities, information exchange, and contingency planning. DHS is mandated to coordinate securing the nation's critical infrastructure, including water. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is mandated to coordinate securing the nation's critical infrastructure, including water infrastructure, through partnerships with the public and private sectors. It is responsible for implementing core elements of the national strategy for protection of critical infrastructures. One of its tasks is to assess infrastructure vulnerabilities, which wastewater and drinking water utilities have been doing since the 9/11 attacks. President Bush issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-7 in 2003 to establish a national policy for identifying, prioritizing, and protecting critical infrastructure as part of homeland security. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is tasked with coordinating the protection of critical infrastructure, including water systems, through partnerships with public and private sectors. In 2003, President Bush issued a directive to prioritize and secure critical infrastructure. DHS developed the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) in 2006, updated in 2009, to enhance protection and resilience of the nation's vital resources. The plan involves partnerships between industry sectors and the government to secure key resources. The Department established the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) to coordinate federal infrastructure protection programs with the private sector, state, local, and tribal governments. In 2004, CIPAC established a Government Coordinating Council (GCC) and non-government coordinating council for each sector, including the Water Sector Committee. The water sector plan for wastewater and drinking water was developed in conjunction with the Sector Coordinating Councils in 2007. The water sector plan for wastewater and drinking water focuses on four goals: sustaining protection of public health and the environment, recognizing and reducing risks, maintaining resilient infrastructure, and increasing communication and public confidence. Some sector plans, including those for dams, were not released to the public due to security sensitivity issues. The drinking water and wastewater sector plan is well-developed but did not provide added value. DHS plans to develop a risk analysis method for infrastructure protection. The Risk Analysis and Management for Critical Asset Protection (RAMCAP) plan aims to standardize risk measurement and consequences assessment across infrastructure sectors. Some in the drinking water industry are concerned that RAMCAP may require new vulnerability assessments, potentially disregarding assessments completed under the 2002 Bioterrorism Preparedness Act. Small and rural utilities, in particular, prefer to build on existing security models for conducting RAMCAP and similar activities. Cyber security remains a significant concern alongside physical security for facilities. The Water Sector Coordinating Council has developed guidance on protecting drinking water and wastewater systems from cyber attacks. The Homeland Security Department and EPA are involved in ensuring security for water systems. DHS has been preparing guidance documents on how water systems can protect themselves from security threats. Roles in providing security to water utilities are being clarified. The Water Sector Coordinating Council serves as a point of contact for DHS to vet water security policies. The WaterISAC provides security information to 450 water utilities, while the HSIN is a free platform for information sharing among DHS, EPA, and utilities. The Water Security Channel (WaterSC) is a bulletin board for security-related information for DHS, EPA, and utilities. It disseminates security bulletins to over 8,400 entities. Policymakers are considering initiatives for enhanced physical security and coordination in the water sector. Key questions include whether protective measures should focus on large water systems or all facilities, and who is responsible for additional security steps. The federal government has limited control over the water infrastructure sector. The distributed ownership of the water infrastructure sector complicates risk assessment and management due to limited resources. Adequacy of security safeguards is a concern for all, with options like restricting visitor access at federal facilities being considered. Non-federal operators are also worried about security measures. After 9/11, New York City closed reservoirs to recreational activities as a precaution. Policymakers are exploring ways to improve coordination and information exchange in the sector. Policymakers are examining measures to improve coordination and information exchange on vulnerabilities, risks, threats, and responses in the water infrastructure sector. This includes efforts by the WaterISAC and the Department of Homeland Security, particularly in coordinating with other federal agencies and non-federal entities operating water systems. Discussions have been ongoing to clarify roles in providing security to water utilities and negotiating agreements for joint research projects. In response to a directive from Congress, EPA issued a report in November 2005 to define its relationship with DHS regarding the protection and security of the nation. The report identified general authorities, ongoing projects, and existing project-specific MOUs between the two entities. However, potential duplication and overlap among agencies still remain unresolved. The potential for duplication and overlap among agencies, such as DHS and EPA, may not be resolved. Information sharing in the water sector is done through various mechanisms, including DHS's HSIN, WaterISAC, and Water Security Channel. Some are concerned about the multiple advisory groups leading to inconsistent information, while others are hopeful for compatible networks to form. In March 2006, GAO highlighted the need for better coordination between EPA and DHS in sharing security threat information with water systems. The Water Sector Coordinating Council and industry groups are working on improving coordination efforts. Congressional attention was drawn to DHS-EPA coordination in the 110th Congress. In the 110th Congress, congressional attention was focused on DHS-EPA coordination. The House Appropriations Committee urged DHS to collaborate with EPA on water security issues, emphasizing the need for federal outreach, risk assessment techniques, and publicizing protective measures. Coordination between critical infrastructures, such as water and electric power, was also highlighted due to their interdependencies. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council is conducting a regional resilience study in the Philadelphia region, focusing on interdependencies of water and critical sectors like energy, telecommunications, and transportation. EPA's ability to collect and analyze security data from water utilities, particularly vulnerability assessments under the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act, is being examined. EPA officials believe the act allows for overall compliance review and data aggregation but limits the agency from requesting or analyzing further information. The EPA's ability to collect and analyze security data from water utilities is being examined. Some believe that the agency should have the authority to review and analyze information to identify threats and prioritize protection plans. Research is focusing on real-time monitoring of water supplies and information technology development. Policymakers are considering resource needs and how to allocate them to public and private sector priorities, including the issue of funding physical security improvements for utilities. Since 9/11, Congress has provided appropriations to the Corps, the Bureau, and EPA for security-related programs to protect water infrastructure. Funding was allocated for risk assessment and implementation of security measures for public safety and facility protection. Both agencies have implemented physical hardening measures since FY2004. Since FY2004, both agencies have implemented physical hardening and other protective measures at their facilities. Reclamation's security budget includes a law enforcement program, facility fortification, and security assessments. Security activities have focused on National Critical Infrastructure dam facilities, with recent upgrades at other facilities to protect against terrorist threats and criminal activities. Reclamation and the Corps have implemented security improvements at their facilities, including personnel, information, facility, operations security, and law enforcement. Funding from the Corps covers security costs for administrative buildings and general use facilities, as well as project-specific upgrades. EPA funding has supported vulnerability assessments for drinking water systems to meet compliance requirements. EPA provides support for water security initiatives, including training utility operators and developing contamination warning systems for drinking water. Congress approved the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Act in May 2002. EPA funding has also supported vulnerability assessments for drinking water systems. In May 2002, Congress approved the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Act (P.L. 107-188) requiring drinking water systems serving over 3,300 people to conduct vulnerability analyses and submit them to EPA. Grant funding was authorized to help utilities comply. Legislation allowing Reclamation to contract with local law enforcement to protect facilities was also enacted during the 107th Congress (P.L. 107-69). In 2001, legislation for a six-year grant program for research on water supply security was considered but not enacted. The House approved a bill in 2002 authorizing $220 million in grants for vulnerability assessments. In the 108th and 109th Congress, bills were proposed to provide grants for vulnerability assessments by wastewater treatment utilities, but no action was taken. Concerns were raised about the lack of requirement for submitting assessments to the EPA. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved similar legislation in both Congresses. S. 2781 in the 108th Congress aimed to encourage wastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and provide funding for site security plans. It addressed concerns raised by the GAO about the lack of efforts to address vulnerabilities in collection systems. The bill also authorized EPA research on this topic and considered requiring high-risk facilities to switch to safer technologies. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 2883, the Wastewater Treatment Works Security Act of 2009, aimed to enhance security at wastewater utilities storing hazardous substances. The bill proposed grants for vulnerability assessments, security upgrades, and worker training. Concerns were also raised about funding security costs at Bureau of Reclamation facilities post-9/11. Since 2005, the federal government has requested that users fully reimburse for guards and patrols for site security costs. Project beneficiaries are expected to cover post-9/11 security cost increases as project O&M expenses, leading to debates on whether these costs should be the federal government's responsibility. This issue is particularly concerning for beneficiaries of Reclamation's high-priority dams like Hoover and Grand Coulee. The House Natural Resources Committee and Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held hearings on security costs for Reclamation facilities in 2006 and 2007. Legislation enacted in 2008 requires water and power users to pay for security guards, with a cap of $18.9 million indexed for inflation. Reclamation's budget has included this annual reimbursability ceiling since FY2009. The issue of security for wastewater and drinking water utilities was also debated in connection with chemical plant security legislation during the 109th Congress. During the 109th Congress, debates arose over including water systems in comprehensive chemical plant security bills. Water system officials argued against inclusion, citing existing vulnerability assessments and potential duplicative requirements with the Clean Air Act's Risk Management Plan provisions. Congress later included provisions in a bill for FY2007 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security to establish security measures. The Chemical Security Act authorized DHS to set security standards for chemical plants, requiring vulnerability assessments and security plans. Water systems were excluded from these requirements, creating a regulatory gap. CFATS regulations were implemented in 2007 but were set to expire in 2009. The exclusion of the water sector from the Chemical Security Act created a regulatory gap as chemicals like chlorine are present in unregulated wastewater and drinking water facilities. DHS is considering ways to enhance safeguards at water utilities using gaseous chlorine. EPA and DHS officials supported removing the exemption for water facilities from chemical security regulations in 2008. Water utilities resist being included in DHS's CFATS rules due to potential costly mandates. There are concerns about coordination between EPA and DHS if legislation is passed. Legislation concerns coordination between EPA and DHS regarding water utility sector roles. Congress has considered extending and modifying chemical security standards since P.L. 109-295. Various proposals include creating permanent DHS rules for facilities or requiring EPA to establish risk-based security rules for drinking water plants. Water utilities are urging congressional committees not to create a dual regulatory arrangement between EPA and DHS for drinking water and wastewater security. There is debate over whether facilities should implement inherently safer technology to reduce the consequences of a terrorist attack. Regulated facilities in high-risk categories may be directed to reduce the consequences of a chemical release from an intentional act if feasible and significantly reduces risk. Including water facilities in security measures would close a major gap and strengthen antiterrorism standards. Legislative proposals in the 112th Congress differed but aimed to address these issues. Opponents argue it would be costly with little security benefit, while water utility officials support EPA leading water security efforts but oppose mandatory measures. The bills proposed in the 112th Congress regarding water utility issues aimed to preserve the exemption from the DHS CFATS program and did not mandate inherently safer technology. Separate Senate legislation included provisions for safer technology and expanding CFATS coverage to wastewater and drinking water facilities. Despite not being enacted, the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 extended the CFATS program. Since 2001, water utilities have been enhancing security measures. In the 113th Congress, there is potential interest in increasing oversight of homeland security activities in the water utility sector to enhance facility and system protections."
