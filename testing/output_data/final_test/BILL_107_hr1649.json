    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended by adding a new section called \"PART M--PREKINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS\" which includes findings related to prekindergarten programs. High-quality preschool education programs are effective in preparing children for school and improving their success throughout their lives. Children who receive prekindergarten education are less likely to repeat grades or require special education. These programs have a significant positive impact on children from low-income families, improving their cognitive skills and behavior. High-quality early childhood education improves children's cognitive skills, pre-reading abilities, and reduces behavioral problems. A long-term study found that children who received such education were more likely to enroll in college, find employment, and delay parenthood. \"Definition section for SEC. 10996B.\" Prekindergarten is a program for children aged 3, 4, and 5 that supports their development and prepares them for kindergarten. Eligible providers include licensed programs, Head Start agencies, and accredited schools. Prekindergarten teachers must have or be working towards a bachelor's degree in early childhood development. Prekindergarten teachers must have or be working towards a bachelor's degree in early childhood development. SEC. 10996C authorizes a program. The Secretary can provide grants to States for prekindergarten early learning programs. States must designate an agency to administer the program and submit an application with assurances of providing matching funds. The Secretary can provide grants to States for prekindergarten early learning programs, with requirements including a description of how grant funds will be used to expand existing efforts, collaborate with local child care agencies, supplement existing funds, and ensure no supplanting of funds. The State must outline how grant funds will be distributed to various prekindergarten providers, support the recruitment and retention of qualified teachers, identify eligible children and providers, and prioritize full-time programs over part-time ones. \"SEC. 10996D. LOCAL APPLICATIONS.\" \"A local educational agency or eligible prekindergarten provider seeking a grant must submit an application to the State agency with required information. If the State prekindergarten program is not run by the local agency, subgrants are awarded to eligible providers. The application must demonstrate the need for a prekindergarten program and describe collaboration with local early education providers.\" The prekindergarten provider must ensure qualified staff, maintain a 1-10 teacher to child ratio, use funds to enhance existing early childhood programs, and collaborate with community organizations for program development. The prekindergarten program must meet diverse needs of children, collaborate with local schools for smooth transitions, describe intended results and measurement tools, and ensure funds are not used for construction or renovation. Funds under this part may be used for construction or renovation of facilities, excluding minor remodeling for program purposes. \"SEC. 10996E. USES OF FUNDS.\" An agency or prekindergarten provider receiving a grant must use funds to establish, enhance, or expand prekindergarten programs for children aged 3 to 5. This includes focusing on children's developmental needs, purchasing educational equipment, and seeking accreditation from a national body. The prekindergarten program can use funds to obtain accreditation, support teachers in meeting credential requirements, provide stipends for professional development, and cater to the needs of working parents. Additionally, funds can be used for transporting students to and from the program. The prekindergarten program funded under this part requires local educational agencies to submit annual reports on children served, teacher numbers, and funding sources. The Secretary must also submit an annual report to Congress evaluating these programs. Authorization of appropriations is also outlined. Authorization of appropriations for the prekindergarten program: $2 billion for 2001, $4 billion for 2002, $5 billion for 2003, $8 billion for 2004, and $10 billion for 2005."
