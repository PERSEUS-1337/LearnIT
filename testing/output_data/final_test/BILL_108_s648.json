    "content": "The \"Pharmacy Education Aid Act of 2003\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that pharmacists are crucial to the healthcare system, but there is a shortage threatening pharmacy services. The Institute of Medicine linked medication errors to pharmacist shortages. Congress recognized the increasing demand for pharmacists in the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999. A study conducted in 2000 found an emerging shortage of pharmacists in the United States due to increased demand for pharmaceutical care services. The study projects a shortage of pharmacists due to factors unlikely to change without fundamental shifts in pharmacy practice and education. It predicts a 20% increase in prescriptions filled by community pharmacists by 2004, while the number of pharmacists is expected to only increase by 6% by 2005. Access to pharmacy services in rural areas is hindered by remoteness, lower economic returns, and other obstacles. The demand for pharmacists will increase with the growing use of prescription drugs. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a loan repayment program for pharmacists serving in critical shortage facilities. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a loan repayment program for pharmacists who meet specific criteria, such as holding a pharmacy degree, having educational loans, and being licensed in the state where the designated health care facility is located. The Secretary may enter into an agreement with eligible individuals to serve as full-time pharmacists for a minimum of 2 years at a designated facility, with payments made on their outstanding educational loans. The payments under the loan repayment program may cover principal, interest, and related expenses on government and commercial loans for undergraduate or graduate education, including tuition, fees, books, and living expenses as determined by the Secretary. Payments are made for each year of obligated service contracted by the individual. The Secretary may pay up to $35,000 on behalf of an individual for loans in exchange for service. The amount paid is determined based on maximizing agreements, incentivizing service in areas with pharmacist shortages, and providing incentives for service. The Secretary may pay up to $35,000 for loans in exchange for service, incentivizing pharmacists to remain in underserved areas. Loan repayments must be made by the end of the fiscal year after completing obligated service to avoid tax liability. The Secretary may make additional payments to individuals equal to 39 percent of total loan repayments made for the taxable year. Payment schedules can be established with loan holders, and preferences are given to qualified applicants with the greatest financial need. Annual reports are required within 18 months. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress detailing the Pharmacy Education Aid Act program, including applicant and recipient numbers, loan repayments, educational institutions attended, practice locations of recipients in critical shortage areas, default rates, and outstanding default funds. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress on the loan repayment program, including reasons for default, participant demographics, costs and benefits evaluation.

The program established under this section will follow provisions similar to the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program, including reimbursements for increased tax liability and bankruptcy. Individuals who breach their agreement will be liable for the award amount and interest if they fail to provide health services as required. The program established under this section will provide health services for a specified period. The Secretary may waive liability if compliance is impossible or causes extreme hardship. Any amount owed to the government must be paid back by a certain date. The program established under this section provides health services for a specified period.
