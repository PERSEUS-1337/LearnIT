The Act \"Government Settlement Transparency Act of 2005\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to disallow deductions for fines, penalties, and other amounts paid to a government entity for violating laws or being investigated. Exceptions include restitution or amounts paid to comply with the law. Taxpayers can apply for deductions on amounts that constitute restitution for harm caused by violating laws or to comply with laws, as long as it is identified in a court order or settlement agreement. Identification in the agreement alone is not sufficient to meet the requirements. Taxpayers can apply for deductions on amounts that constitute restitution for harm caused by violating laws or to comply with laws, as long as it is identified in a court order or settlement agreement. This paragraph outlines exceptions for amounts paid or incurred as reimbursement to the government or entity for investigation or litigation costs, and for amounts paid or incurred by court order in a suit where no government or entity is a party. Certain nongovernmental regulatory entities are also exempt under specific conditions. The text discusses exceptions to deductions for amounts paid as taxes due and introduces a new section for reporting deductible amounts in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The text introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding reporting information on fines, penalties, and other amounts. The appropriate official of a government or entity involved in a suit or agreement must report the amount to be paid as a result of the suit, any restitution or remediation amounts, and any compliance-related payments. A suit or agreement is described if it involves a violation of a law under the government or entity's authority, with a court order or an agreement related to an investigation or inquiry. The government or entity conducts an inquiry into potential law violations within its authority. The aggregate amount in court orders and agreements related to the violation must be $600 or more. The Secretary can adjust the reporting threshold as needed for efficient administration of internal revenue laws. The required return must be filed within 30 days of a court order. The government or entity must provide a written statement to individuals involved in a settlement within 30 days of a court order or agreement. The statement should include the name of the government or entity and the information submitted to the Secretary. The term 'appropriate official' is defined as the person in control of the suit, investigation, or inquiry. A new item is added to the table of sections in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section apply to amounts paid or incurred on or after the enactment date of this Act, except for amounts paid or incurred under any binding order or agreement entered into before that date. This exception does not apply to orders or agreements requiring court approval unless approval was obtained before that date."
