    "content": "Americans prepare for retirement in various ways, including Social Security benefits, employer-sponsored pensions, IRAs, and other financial assets. Policymakers are concerned about households maintaining their pre-retirement standards of living. Employers offer pension plans, either defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC) plans, to provide retirement income. In retirement, individuals receive monthly payments based on a formula using length of service, accrual rate, and final salary. DC plans like 401(k) involve worker contributions to an account with possible employer matches. IRAs allow contributions from earnings or rollovers. Congress provides tax incentives for retirement savings, such as income tax deductions for employer contributions to DB pension plans. Tax incentives for retirement savings include income tax deductions for employer contributions to DB pension plans, deferral of income taxes on contributions to DC retirement accounts, and tax deductions for some contributions to IRAs. The U.S. Treasury is estimated to forgo $117.2 billion in income in FY2013 due to these incentives. Congress supports increasing retirement income security, with changes in employer-sponsored pensions over the past 30 years. Since the passage of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, there has been a shift from employer-sponsored defined benefit (DB) pensions to defined contribution (DC) pensions. This trend has led to more households taking on greater responsibility for their retirement savings. Many Americans now rely on their DC accounts as a major source of income in retirement, with 68% expecting 401(k), IRA, or other retirement savings accounts to provide income. The amounts saved for retirement are crucial for evaluating public policies on retirement income security. Despite tax incentives, 57% of Americans worry about outliving their savings in retirement. Factors like education, income, family size, and tax policy impact wealth accumulation. Households have various saving options, with some prioritizing other goals over retirement savings. Congressional Research Service analyzes retirement preparedness. The Congressional Research Service's analysis of the 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances found that 29.1% of U.S. households prioritize saving for retirement. Congress has provided tax incentives to encourage retirement savings, such as excluding employer contributions from taxable income. The adequacy of current retirement savings is a topic of academic and policy literature. Earnings in DC accounts are deferred until distributed. Some employers sponsor DB or DC pension plans, and individual workers may also contribute to IRAs. In DB pension plans, retirees receive a monthly payment based on length of service and final salary average. In DC plans like 401(k), workers contribute. 403(b), 457(b), and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) are common retirement plans where workers contribute a percentage of their wages. Employers may match contributions. IRAs are tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings. Individuals under 70\u00bd with earnings can establish and contribute to an IRA. Rollover allows transfer of assets from a retirement plan to an IRA. Figure 1 shows household net worth distribution by marital status and age. Household net worth is calculated as assets minus debt, including financial assets like retirement accounts and non-financial assets like real estate. Data is from the 2010 SCF, a survey by the Federal Reserve. In 2010, among married households with a head younger than 35, 25% had net worth less than $1,170, 50% had less than $15,000 (median), and 75% had less than $63,900. Median net worth increased with the age of the head of the household, and was higher for married households than single households within each age group. Households aged 55 to 64 had the highest percentages of retirement assets. Households aged 55 to 64 had the highest percentages of retirement assets. Households with a head older than 74 owned the lowest percentage of retirement assets, possibly due to drawing down retirement assets or having a DB pension plan. Tables provide median and average values for household net worth components among single households. Among married households, there are large differences between the average and median values of household net worth components. For example, for households with a head aged 45 to 54, the median net worth was $181,000 while the average net worth was $769,222. Ownership of business interests and non-residential real estate was not common among American households in 2010. In 2010, married households had significantly larger assets and debt compared to single households. Median values for business interests and non-residential real estate were $0 for all age groups among single and married households, indicating that at least half of households did not own these assets. Single households had lower asset and debt values than married households, with median retirement assets at $0 for all age groups. However, there was a substantial increase in median non-retirement financial assets for single households aged 75 or older compared to those aged 65 to 74, with a 214.5% increase. The age of the householder is 65 to 74. Median non-retirement financial assets increased by 214.5% to $19,500 and average non-retirement financial assets increased by 96.6% to $177,593. Among married households with the head aged 75 or older, median non-retirement financial assets increased by 34.3% to $38,000 compared to those aged 65 to 74. Average non-retirement financial assets declined by 11.0% to $307,153. The changes in assets are not fully explained by decreases in other assets like businesses. Principal residence was the largest component of household assets for all single and married households under 55 years old. For married households with the head aged 55 or older, non-retirement financial assets were the largest component of assets, surpassing retirement assets. Most households had small amounts in their DC plans or IRAs, with a majority of single households having no retirement assets in 2010. Married households had a greater percentage of retirement assets compared to single households in each age group. The percentage of households with retirement assets increased with the age of the head of the household, peaking at 55 to 64 years old. Among single households, at least half did not have any retirement assets. Married households had a higher percentage of retirement assets compared to single households in each age group. Among married households, 70.6% of those with heads aged 55 to 64 have retirement assets, the highest percentage in Figure 2. In 2010, 50.4% of U.S. households had retirement assets, with 31.6 million having between $0 and $50,000. Households without labor force participation likely did not contribute to retirement accounts. Approximately 1.8 million U.S. households had retirement assets greater than $1.0 million in 2010. The Obama Administration's FY2014 budget proposed prohibiting contributions to retirement accounts exceeding the amount needed for a $205,000 annuity from a DB pension plan. This amount was estimated to be around $3.4 million for DC plan assets. Individual participation in a DB plan would impact the maximum account balance. Individual participation in a DB plan would affect the maximum account balance. Those expecting DB pensions in retirement would need less than the proposed $3.4 million for $205,000 yearly income. Each person with a DB pension would have a different DC account limit, which could change annually. Only households with earnings can contribute to IRA and 401(k) plans. Table 5 shows the distribution of retirement account balances among households with members in the labor force. Some households with retirement assets below $3.4 million and DB pension benefits may be affected by the proposed limit. Those expecting income from a DB pension will have lower retirement account balances. In 2010, 283,000 households had balances between $2.0 million and $3.0 million, while 130,000 had balances of $3.0 million or more. In 2010, 283,000 households had retirement account balances between $2.0 million and $3.0 million, while 129,983 households had balances of $3.0 million or more. More households have DC assets than IRA assets, with 33.0 million households (28.0%) having IRA assets and 41.0 million (34.9%) having DC assets. Less than 1.0% of U.S. households had retirement assets of $1.0 million or more. Retirement age is generally considered to be between ages 62 to 67, with eligibility for Social Security benefits at age 62 and Medicare at age 65. In 2010, households aged 62 to 67 had varying retirement assets. Married households were more likely to have a retirement plan. Older households had more DB pensions, reflecting a decline in DB plans and rise in DC plans over 20 years. The percentage of households with DC and IRA assets followed a \"hump-shaped\" pattern, increasing with age before declining. This trend reflects the shift from DB to DC pension plans over the past 20 years. Younger households were more likely to have DC pensions, while older households had IRAs, possibly due to rollovers from DC plans. Figure 4 illustrates the quartiles of retirement wealth among households with retirement assets. Among households, as the head's age increased, median retirement wealth also increased for both single and married households. For those aged 55 to 64, the median retirement assets in 2010 were $48,000 for single households and $132,000 for married households. Factors limiting retirement assets for those aged 65 or older include being retired and having a DB pension plan instead of assets in a DC plan or IRA. The principal residence is often the largest asset owned by households. The principal residence is often the largest asset owned by households, with some using it for income in retirement through methods like reverse mortgages or selling. Single households generally had higher percentages of housing as a total asset compared to married households, except for those aged 75 or older. The percentage of housing as a total asset typically decreased with the age of the household head, indicating the accumulation of non-housing assets as they aged. In 2010, the value of home equity increased with the age of the household head, reaching over 90% for those aged 75 or older. U.S. households owned $10.1 trillion in retirement assets in 2010, which was 14.5% of all household assets. In 2010, U.S. households owned $10.1 trillion in retirement assets, accounting for 14.5% of all household assets. Among households with retirement assets, the median amount was $44,000, with $178,859 as the average amount. For households with DC pension plan assets, the median was $31,000, and for those with IRAs, the median was $40,000. This data emphasizes the importance of retirement savings. The data in this report emphasize the importance of understanding factors that affect retirement asset accumulation, such as demographic characteristics, financial situation, and employment status of households. In 2010, retirement assets for households generally increased as the age of the head of the household increased. In 2010, retirement assets for households generally increased with the age of the head of the household. There was no clear pattern in the percentage of wealth that retirement assets represented as the age of the household increased. Younger households had fewer retirement assets due to fewer years to save and other financial priorities. Older households aged 75 or older had fewer retirement assets compared to those aged 55 to 64. In 2010, households with heads aged 55 to 64 were more likely to have income from a DB pension plan, reducing the need for a DC pension or IRA. Ownership of assets like businesses or real estate could also impact retirement asset accumulation. 67.3% of households owned their principal residence, which could influence their retirement income sources. Analysis of the 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) revealed that 9.7% of households with children prioritize saving for their children or estate over saving for retirement. The SCF provides detailed information on U.S. household finances, including assets, debt, and demographic data. Wealth in the SCF includes financial assets and liabilities of the household unit, consisting of the head, spouse, and dependent children. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) analyzes wealth data of households, including financial and non-financial assets. It does not estimate wealth from Social Security or pensions. The SCF sample represents 6,492 households out of 117.6 million U.S. households, with 41.9% single and 58.1% married. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) analyzes wealth data of households in the U.S., oversampling wealthy households for accuracy. The Federal Reserve ensures data quality and includes all U.S. households, not just working ones. Retirement income adequacy is a concern for both working and non-working households, with many owning retirement assets from previous employment or IRAs. Future analysis may focus on specific household subsets. The curr_chunk discusses the inclusion criteria for the population in the survey, focusing on households where the head or spouse is working."
