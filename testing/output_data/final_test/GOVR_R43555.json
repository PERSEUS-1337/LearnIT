    "content": "The 113th Congress has prioritized fighting trafficking in persons (TIP) in the United States, considering it a significant human rights concern. TIP involves violations of labor, public health, and human rights standards, as well as criminal law. The United States is a source, transit, and destination country for trafficking victims, with as many as 17,500 people trafficked into the country annually. It is estimated that 100,000 U.S. citizen children are victims of trafficking within the United States. Domestic human trafficking in the U.S. primarily involves labor exploitation in various industries such as domestic service, agriculture, manufacturing, and more. Sex trafficking offenses are more commonly investigated and prosecuted than labor trafficking. Noncitizens are more vulnerable to labor trafficking, with foreign victims more prevalent in labor trafficking compared to sex trafficking. Women and children are the main victims of sex trafficking in the U.S. Labor exploitation often occurs in migrant labor camps. Migrant labor camps are common settings for labor exploitation and trafficking. Anti-trafficking efforts include victim protection, public education, and investigation/prosecution of trafficking offenses. Various government departments provide assistance to trafficking victims, including housing, job training, counseling, and legal aid. Federal agencies like the FBI and ICE investigate trafficking cases, with public awareness campaigns run by HHS and DHS. The FBI and ICE coordinate on human trafficking cases, prosecuted by DOJ. Congress has been actively engaged in anti-human-trafficking efforts through legislation like the TVPA and its reauthorizations. Grant programs for victims and law enforcement, new criminal laws, and oversight on anti-TIP policy are key components. The TVPA's grant programs were reauthorized through FY2017 in 2013. This report discusses domestic human-trafficking-related issues of significant congressional interest in the 113th Congress. The TVPA defines \"severe forms of trafficking in persons\" as sex trafficking induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or involving individuals under 18, and labor trafficking through force, fraud, or coercion. Federal statutes do not formally define human trafficking. This report is related to trafficking in persons issues of congressional interest in the 113th Congress. Human trafficking involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain labor or services, leading to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. Legislation related to trafficking, including the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2013, has been discussed in the 113th Congress. The E. Clay Shaw, Jr. Missing Children's Assistance Reauthorization Act (P.L. 113-38) was enacted on September 30, 2013. Other related legislation includes the Fraudulent Overseas Recruitment and Trafficking Elimination Act (H.R. 3344), the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2013 (H.R. 3530), the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2013 (H.R. 3610), the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Improving Opportunities for Youth in Foster Care Act (H.R. 4058), the SAVE Act of 2014 (H.R. 4225), and International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking (H.R. 4573). The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) and the Supporting At-Risk Children Act (S. 1870) address issues related to human trafficking, including restoring victims, protecting foreign national workers, criminal justice, improving data, and domestic sex trafficking of children. Human trafficking involves a range of actors from family-run organizations to transnational organized crime syndicates, and thrives on demand and conditions of vulnerability such as youth, gender, poverty, and social exclusion. Human trafficking victims face mental and physical abuse to control them, including debt bondage, isolation, violence, and fear. U.S. anti-trafficking efforts focus on victim assistance and pending legislation aims to improve victim services. Issues include equal treatment of all victims and addressing labor and sex trafficking. The United States faces challenges in providing adequate services for victims of human trafficking, including labor and sex trafficking. There is confusion over eligibility for services under anti-trafficking grant programs, with a focus on funding for programs targeting U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. The Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and Labor have programs to assist trafficking victims, but only DOJ and HHS receive specified funding. Funding for victim services, especially for minor sex trafficking victims, is a growing concern. The funding for victim services in the United States, particularly for minor sex trafficking victims, has been a growing concern. Congress has allocated approximately $20-28 million annually for victim services, with a recent increase in funding recommended by the Department of State. However, there is a lack of targeted federal funding to support state child welfare agencies' anti-trafficking efforts, and NGOs are calling for an overall increase in funding for comprehensive services. Recently, Congress has made amendments to grant programs to make sex trafficking victims eligible for assistance. The 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (P.L. 113-4) amended grant programs to include services for sex trafficking victims, such as legal assistance and support for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who are also victims of trafficking. Additionally, the act expanded grants to tribal governments to combat violence against women to include sex trafficking and created a new grant program to address the needs of youth victims of various crimes, including sex trafficking. The 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (P.L. 113-4) expanded grant programs to include services for sex trafficking victims and amended the grant program for state and local law enforcement's anti-trafficking programs to focus on U.S. citizen and noncitizen victims. Pending legislation in the 113th Congress aims to create new programs to enhance services for trafficking victims, such as a national communication system to help victims communicate with service providers. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2013 (H.R. 3530/S. 1738) authorizes grants for domestic child human trafficking deterrence programs to aid victims and prosecute offenders. Eligible entities include state or local governments meeting specific criteria. The grants can be used for specialized training programs, law enforcement units, prosecution units, and court programs to assist child trafficking victims. The Department of State's TIP report recommends increased funding for relevant agencies to provide victim services. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2013 (H.R. 3530/S. 1738) recommends increasing funding for relevant agencies to provide victim services. S. 1738 would impose a $5,000 assessment on convicted individuals for certain criminal offenses related to trafficking and exploitation of children. The assessment would go into a new \"Domestic Trafficking Fund\" for grants and victim programs. Alternatively, H.R. 3530 would increase the cap on the existing Crime Victims Fund over time. The CVF, established in the mid-1980s, collects fees for state victim programs. Under the TVPA, noncitizen trafficking victims are certified by HHS for services. S. 1738 aims to amend the TVPA to address eligibility for U.S. citizen and LPR victims for certain services. S. 1738 would amend the TVPA to assist U.S. citizen and LPR victims of trafficking, allowing them access to services without certification. H.R. 3610 / S. 1733 would enable trafficking victims to qualify for the Job Corps program without meeting income requirements. Victims may require medical care, psychological treatment, and job training for recovery. S. 1733 and H.R. 3610 aim to increase restitution for victims of peonage, slavery, or trafficking. S. 1738 focuses on assisting U.S. citizen and LPR victims of trafficking without certification. Congress is concerned about unaccompanied minors entering the U.S. potentially becoming trafficking victims. The 2013 TVPA reauthorization (P.L. 113-4) includes provisions for the custody and care of unaccompanied minor trafficking victims. It mandates the DHS Secretary to establish a pilot program for independent child advocates at immigration detention sites. Children in HHS custody who receive U status are eligible for services like refugees, with states being reimbursed for foster care. S. 744 also aims to protect unaccompanied alien children from human trafficking by transferring responsibilities from HHS to DOJ. The bill aims to protect unaccompanied alien children from human trafficking by transferring responsibilities from HHS to DOJ. It includes provisions for mandatory training for DHS personnel, hiring child welfare professionals in CBP offices, and screening children to prevent trafficking. Some Members of Congress argue that migrant workers are vulnerable to exploitation by labor contractors and human traffickers. Current law provides protections for foreign workers, such as mandatory training for DHS personnel and screening to prevent trafficking. The bill P.L. 113-4 criminalizes the destruction or concealment of another person's passport or immigration documents in the context of fraud in foreign labor contracting. S. 744 and H.R. 3344 aim to regulate foreign labor contractors and combat human trafficking by requiring them to provide workers with written information about employment terms and conditions. Employers and contractors would be prohibited from discriminating against workers based on various factors and could not charge workers a fee for contracting activity. Contractors would need to register with the Department of Labor every two years, provide annual reports, and post a bond. The Secretary of Labor would maintain a list of registered contractors, investigate complaints, impose fines, and individuals could sue for damages. Employers must use registered contractors. H.R. 4225 aims to enhance investigations and prosecutions of human trafficking offenses by allowing the prosecution of entities that knowingly advertise individuals for commercial sex acts involving force, fraud, or minors. It also targets entities that benefit from ventures engaged in such advertising. S. 1738 aims to enhance law enforcement targeting of criminal enterprises engaged in human trafficking by prohibiting \"aggravated human trafficking racketeering\" and expanding prosecutors' ability to obtain wiretap orders for investigations involving human trafficking, child sexual exploitation, and child pornography production. It also enhances penalties for crimes related to human trafficking, child exploitation, and repeat sex offenders, and revises statutes related to travel for illicit sexual conduct. H.R. 3530 and S. 1738 aim to combat sex trafficking by targeting both the supply and demand. The bills prohibit patronizing or soliciting commercial sex and require the Attorney General to enhance law enforcement capabilities to detect, investigate, and prosecute trafficking activities. Federal legislation has focused more on penalizing traffickers, but these bills seek to increase focus on prosecuting buyers of commercial sex. The Innocence Lost National Initiative, a partnership between the FBI, DOJ, and NCMEC, aims to recover prostituted children and prosecute child sex trafficking perpetrators. Data on trafficking crimes is not uniformly collected, but efforts are being made to improve reporting with new legislation like S. 744. S. 744, passed by the Senate, introduces new reporting requirements for human trafficking offenses in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports and designates human trafficking as a Part I crime for funding calculations. Domestic sex trafficking of children involves a commercial sex act with individuals under 18 years old, who are considered trafficking victims regardless of consent. The exact number of child victims in the U.S. is unknown due to challenges in defining the population. Most victims are U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. Commercial sexual exploitation of children is a significant issue fueled by various factors. Commercial sexual exploitation of children is driven by individual, relationship, community, and societal factors, increasing the risk of exploitation. The National Academy of Sciences recommends collaboration among multiple stakeholders to address child sex trafficking. The 113th Congress has passed legislation touching on various policy areas to combat sex trafficking of children. The 113th Congress passed legislation (H.R. 3092, H.R. 3530, S. 1738, S. 1870, H.R. 4058, S. 1733, H.R. 3610) addressing child sex trafficking, providing support to victims, requiring reporting of missing children, and incentivizing states to enact \"safe harbor laws\" to protect minors from prostitution and trafficking. The Missing and Exploited Children's (MEC) program, administered by the Department of Justice, supports missing and sexually exploited children through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). The E. Clay Shaw, Jr. Missing Children's Assistance Reauthorization Act reauthorized the program, adding a new requirement for NCMEC to assist in identifying, locating, and recovering victims of child sex trafficking. Subtitle A of the Victims of Child Abuse Act supports the expansion and improvement of Children's Advocacy Centers (CACs) to provide support services for child abuse victims and their families. CACs coordinate a multi-disciplinary response to child abuse and are located in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The law also requires the establishment and support of regional children's advocacy centers to increase their presence and improve their practices. Training and technical assistance are funded for attorneys and others involved in child abuse cases. H.R. 3530 and S. 1738 aim to expand the definition of \"child abuse\" for Children's Advocacy Centers (CACs) to include child pornography and human trafficking. The bills would provide grants for specialized programs to help victims of child pornography and require grantees to meet oversight and accountability requirements. H.R. 3530 also reauthorizes funding for CACs, regional children's advocacy centers, and training programs through FY2019. State and local child welfare agencies are responsible for promoting the safety and well-being of children, including child victims of sex trafficking who may come to their attention through the CPS hotline. Children in foster care, especially those who run away, are vulnerable to trafficking due to limited agency capacity, inadequate training, and high caseloads. Both S. 1870 and H.R. 4058 aim to involve state child welfare agencies in responding to child sex trafficking by aligning with the TVPA's definitions. The bills also propose amendments to child welfare provisions, including Title IV-E of the Social Security Act for federal reimbursement to states for foster care maintenance payments. The bills S. 1870 and H.R. 4058 aim to involve state child welfare agencies in responding to child sex trafficking by aligning with the TVPA's definitions. They propose amendments to child welfare provisions, including Title IV-E of the Social Security Act for federal reimbursement to states for foster care maintenance payments. State child welfare agencies would be required to develop policies to identify and assist children at risk of sex trafficking. The bills S. 1870 and H.R. 4058 propose new requirements for state child welfare agencies to identify and assist child victims of sex trafficking, including those in foster care or at risk of trafficking. The policies would apply to children under state supervision, regardless of their foster care status, up to age 26. The bills S. 1870 and H.R. 4058 require state child welfare agencies to identify and document child victims of sex trafficking in foster care or under state supervision. They also mandate reporting on measures taken to protect these children, coordinate with relevant agencies, and immediately report trafficking information to law enforcement. Additionally, H.R. 4058 calls for the establishment of a data collection system for children in foster care and adoption under the Social Security Act. The Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) was developed by HHS to provide national information on children in foster care and adoption. Both S. 1870 and H.R. 4058 aim to revise AFCARS data collection to include information on sex trafficking, either within the Child Welfare Outcomes report (S. 1870) or in a separate report to Congress (H.R. 4058). Shelters for child sex trafficking victims are limited, with other facilities available for runaway and at-risk youth. Shelters for sex trafficking victims are limited, and other facilities like runaway shelters are not adequate for their needs. S. 1870 proposes agencies to provide safe housing for youth victims of trafficking within one year. Runaways are vulnerable to trafficking due to being easy targets for pimps. The Dallas Police Department found a strong correlation between sex trafficking and runaway status, with a higher likelihood of victimization for repeat runaways. Proposed bills aim to improve reporting and protocols for missing or abducted children, especially those in foster care. The bill aims to address children running away from foster care by implementing protocols to determine if they are victims of sex trafficking. It requires HHS to establish the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking within one year of enactment, with a report due to Congress within two years summarizing information on at-risk children. The bill requires the establishment of the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking within one year of enactment. The committee, composed of up to 21 members, will advise the HHS Secretary and the Attorney General on policies to improve the nation's response to domestic sex trafficking of minors. The bill created a new grant program for child sex trafficking victims, allocating funds to NGOs for services like counseling and legal aid. At least 67% of the grant amounts must go to NGOs, while 10% is for victim services or provider training on child sex trafficking. The 2013 TVPA reauthorization specifies that individuals under 18 involved in commercial sexual activity should be treated as victims, not criminals. Safe harbor provisions should be included in state anti-trafficking laws to provide assistance to these victims. S. 1733 and H.R. 3610 incentivize states to enact safe harbor laws for minors involved in commercial sexual activity, treating them as victims and diverting them to child protection services. The Senate version links compliance to Edward Byrne Memorial JAG funds, while the House version gives preference for community policing grants to compliant states. The Department of Justice will prioritize community policing grants for states with safe harbor laws. Concerns about coordination and duplication of efforts in anti-trafficking activities have led to the establishment of the Senior Policy Operating Group. S. 1733 aims to implement a National Strategy for Combating Human Trafficking. S. 1733 aims to implement a National Strategy for Combating Human Trafficking, which includes integrated efforts at various levels of government, internal Department of Justice coordination, federal interagency coordination, and measurable objectives. The bill also requires the Attorney General to report on human trafficking investigations and activities annually. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) establishes minimum standards for sex offender registration in the U.S. Offenders are classified into three tiers, with Tier III being the most serious, including individuals convicted of egregious crimes. Tier III offenders face the strictest registration and notification requirements, while Tier I and Tier II offenders have less severe predicate offenses. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) categorizes offenders into three tiers based on the severity of their crimes. Tier III includes the most serious offenses such as sexual assaults and offenses against children under 13. Proposed amendments aim to redefine Tier II and Tier III offenders, with a focus on offenses comparable to or more severe than sex trafficking against minors. H.R. 4573 directs the establishment of the \"Angel Watch Center\" in ICE to receive information on travel by child-sex offenders and notify destination countries. It also urges the President to negotiate agreements with foreign governments on sharing information about international travel by child-sex offenders."
