The Port Security Grants Act of 2005 authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a grant program to allocate Federal financial assistance for implementing Area Maritime Transportation Security Plans, addressing port security vulnerabilities, and supporting non-Federal projects contributing to port security. Grant awards consider national economic and strategic defense considerations of individual ports. The Port Security Grants Act of 2005 authorizes grants for port security measures, including promoting integration of security efforts, information sharing, and joint harbor operations centers. Funds can be used for implementing security plans, addressing vulnerabilities, and supporting additional security personnel for State and local agencies. The Security Plan for a port area includes provisions for increased threat levels, acquisition of security equipment, and development of joint harbor operations centers involving Federal, State, and local officials. The port security grants aim to establish a common operation center focused on port area security, conduct vulnerability assessments, and organize port-wide exercises to enhance emergency preparedness. Grants cannot be used for constructing buildings or acquiring land without Secretary approval. Federal funding for projects should not exceed 75% of the total cost, with exceptions outlined. The port security grants aim to enhance port area security with a common operation center, vulnerability assessments, and emergency preparedness exercises. Grants cannot fund building construction or land acquisition without Secretary approval. Federal funding for projects should not exceed 75% of the total cost, with exceptions for small projects costing under $25,000 and potential reduction in matching requirements for meritorious projects. The Secretary determines eligible applicants for port security grants, requiring applications to include project need, coordination methodology, and cooperation agreements. The Captain of the Port must determine if the security project addresses port vulnerabilities identified by the Coast Guard and complies with the Area Maritime Transportation Security Plan. The Secretary will issue guidelines for accounting and review procedures to ensure grant funds are used appropriately. Project approval is required to ensure consistency with vulnerability assessments. The Secretary will ensure that grant funding for projects in port areas aligns with vulnerability assessments, promotes cooperation among stakeholders, and helps implement security plans. Funding must meet matching requirements, projects must be completed promptly, and recipients must have the authority to carry out the project. Coordination and cooperation are key priorities for projects receiving grants. The Secretary will ensure that projects receiving grant funding in port areas are coordinated with other projects and may require cooperative agreements among users. Grantees must maintain records for review and audit by specified authorities. The Secretary will submit an initial report on security funding and compliance to the Committee on Homeland Security within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will submit an unclassified report to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives annually regarding the progress made in meeting port security grant program objectives for fiscal years 2007 through 2012. The report will identify any necessary funding modifications to achieve these objectives. The Secretary will submit an annual report to the Committees on Homeland Security regarding progress in meeting port security grant program objectives, including recommendations for program improvement. Authorization of appropriations totaling $400,000,000 annually from 2007 to 2012 for the Secretary to implement the Act, funded by duties collected by United States Customs and Border Protection."
