    "title": "SB 1117",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3605 of the Probate Code is amended to apply only to special needs trusts established after January 1, 1993. The statute of limitations for claims by certain state departments and counties is tolled while the trust is active. Upon the beneficiary's death or trust termination, the trust property is subject to claims by specified entities as if it were part of the beneficiary's estate. Upon the death of the special needs trust beneficiary or termination of the trust, the trustee must notify specified state departments and counties. Failure to provide this notice prevents the statute of limitations from running against the claims of the departments or counties. The trustee must notify state departments and counties upon the death of the special needs trust beneficiary or termination of the trust. The department, county, or city and county have four months to make a claim with the trustee. If the claim is rejected, they can petition the court for an order directing the trustee to pay the claim as a preferred claim. If trust property is insufficient, the trustee must petition the court for instructions on how to pay the claims. If trust property is distributed before four months after notice without payment of the claim, the department, county, or city has a claim against distributees to the full extent of the claim or each distributee\u2019s share of trust property, with interest and accruing costs. The trust property of a deceased beneficiary in a special needs trust is protected from claims by state and local entities if the property is transferred to the trust of a surviving sibling who is also a beneficiary. Section 14009.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended accordingly. Section 14009.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to allow the department to claim against the estate of a decedent for healthcare services received or property distributed, with exceptions for individuals under 55 and certain circumstances. The department can make a claim against the estate of a surviving spouse or child for medical assistance received, with exceptions for individuals under 21 or who are blind or disabled. Any statute of limitations for reimbursement claims does not apply. The U.S. department can make a claim against the estate of a surviving spouse or child for medical assistance received, with exceptions for individuals under 21 or who are blind or disabled. A surviving child who is the beneficiary of a special needs trust may receive property from the trust of a deceased sibling. The department may waive its claim if enforcing it would cause substantial hardship to other dependents, heirs, or survivors. The department notifies individuals of waiver provision and hearing opportunity. Definitions for \"decedent\" and \"dependents\" are provided."
