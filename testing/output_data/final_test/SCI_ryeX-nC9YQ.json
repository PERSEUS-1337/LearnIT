Previous research focused on algorithms like low-precision stochastic gradient descent and their convergence rates. The number of bits required for error bounds increases with model dimension $d, which is problematic for large-scale models like deep learning. This study introduces dimension-independent bounds for low-precision training using fixed-point arithmetic, providing insights into algorithm convergence as parameters scale. Low-precision computation is a technique that replaces 32-bit or 64-bit floating point numbers with smaller numbers like 8-bit or 16-bit fixed point numbers in machine learning models. This method has gained attention for deep learning, with specialized hardware accelerators developed to support it. The focus is on proving new convergence bounds for low-precision training with various quantization schemes, such as low-precision floating-point computation and logarithmic quantization. The major application for low-precision computation is training ML models using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Research has focused on low-precision versions of SGD, with empirical and theoretical analysis proving convergence bounds for low-precision training in various settings. The bounds for low-precision training in ML models depend on the dimension d of the model, with error increasing as d increases. More bits of quantization are needed to achieve the same level of error as d increases. The error or number of bits needed increases with dimension d in low-precision training algorithms, as seen in prior work. This dependence on d is unsatisfying for tackling large-scale problems on big data. In this paper, the authors address the issue of increasing error or bits needed with dimension d in low-precision training algorithms. They provide dimension-free bounds on the convergence of LP-SGD and study non-linear quantization schemes. Their results are summarized in Table 1, with contributions including conditions for proving dimension-free bounds on SGD convergence and analysis of quantized iterates on strongly convex problems. The study focuses on non-linear quantization schemes for strongly convex problems, proving dimension-free convergence bounds for SGD using logarithmic quantization. It also explores quantization with low-precision floating-point numbers, optimizing the accuracy of training algorithms by assigning bits to exponent and mantissa. Experimental validation supports the theoretical analysis. The research contributes to the field of low-precision training algorithms, aiming for faster machine learning processes. Low-precision training methods aim for faster machine learning processes by using low-precision models like binarized and ternary networks. These approaches focus on faster inference rather than faster training, with some achieving good results despite lacking theoretical convergence results. Another approach involves making aspects of SGD low-precision while solving the same optimization problem as the full-precision version. In low-precision training methods, iterates of SGD are stored and computed in low-precision arithmetic. Previous work has shown dimension-dependence in this setting, except for one paper that required 1-sparse gradient samples. Other studies have looked into quantizing the training set and communication numbers among parallel workers. In low-precision training, SGD iterates are stored and computed using low-precision arithmetic. The algorithm solves the minimization problem iteratively by updating the vectors with a step size and randomly chosen component function at each iteration. This approach aims to complement existing theoretical approaches and explain the success of empirical work in machine learning. In low-precision training, SGD iterates are quantized and stored in a low-precision format using fixed-point arithmetic with a quantization gap \u03b4. Gradient samples outside this set are mapped to the representable numbers. The quantization function Q(x) rounds numbers using randomized rounding, ensuring E[Q(x)] = x within the representable range. For low-precision SGD, the update step involves simple quantization. Prior bounds on LP-SGD convergence often depend on the number of dimensions d. The variance inequality in quantization increases the squared error in LP-SGD analyses, leading to dimension dependency. However, by bounding the variance with problem properties independent of dimension d, results can be achieved without dimension dependence. By bounding the variance with problem properties independent of dimension d, dimension-independent results can be achieved in LP-SGD analyses. This non-constant bound depends on w and can replace the dimension-dependent bound to bound the convergence of algorithms. The non-constant bound for convergence in LP-SGD analyses depends on the variable w, requiring new assumptions about the problem. Assumptions include Lipschitz continuity of loss function gradients in different norms, crucial for analyzing SGD on convex objectives. Assumptions 2, 3, and 4 in prior work (De Sa et al., 2018) bound the L1 norm, assume strong convexity of the total loss function, and bound the gradient of each loss function near the optimal point in LP-SGD analyses. These assumptions are crucial for analyzing SGD on convex objectives. The assumption in the current text chunk is that the gradient for each loss function at the optimal point can be bounded by a constant \u03c3. This assumption is crucial for analyzing low-precision SGD, as shown in Theorem 1, which provides a bound on the expected objective gap after T update steps. The text discusses the convergence rate and limit of an optimization problem, highlighting the importance of choosing an appropriate step size for convergence. It introduces new parameters to guarantee dimension-independent convergence without weakening the rate, emphasizing the significance of these parameters in achieving optimal results. The text illustrates the importance of introducing new parameters \u03ba 1 and \u03c3 1 for bounded convergence. Experimental validation was done by analyzing noise floor size of SGD and LP-SGD as dimension changes for synthetic problems. A class of linear regression models with fixed parameters was chosen for the experiments. The text discusses the non-uniform selection of entries in a linear regression model to ensure constant mean as dimension increases. Parameters like \u03b1, \u03b2, p, and s were set for the problem, with convergence of SGD and LP-SGD shown in FIG1 (b). Changing dimension d affects initial convergence rate but not noise ball size. FIG3 (a) measures the eventual loss gap that the algorithm converges to. The noise ball size and eventual loss gap of the algorithm are measured in FIG3 (a) as the dimension changes. The average loss gap remains almost unchanged regardless of dimension, validating dimension-free bounds. FIG2 (b) shows how the gap changes with new parameters while keeping d, \u00b5, and \u03c3 fixed. Changing \u03c3 1 has a significant effect on the gap. Changing \u03c3 1 has a significant effect on LP-SGD compared to SGD, validating theoretical results. Quantization to a set of points can still be done with randomized rounding. However, the natural dimension-dependent bound may lead to poor performance in LP-SGD analysis. The specific NLQ method discussed introduces a tight bound on quantization variance, known as logarithmic quantization or \u00b5-law quantization. This method is defined recursively with fixed parameters \u03b4 and \u03b6, where linear quantization is a special case with \u03b6 = 0. A dimension-independent bound on quantization variance is proven for this scheme, satisfying the dimension-free variance bound with parameters \u03b4, \u03b6, and \u03b7. The NLQ method introduces a tight bound on quantization variance with parameters \u03b4, \u03b6, and \u03b7. This bound is a generalization of linear quantization and can be applied to low-precision training algorithms. Theorem 2 states that LP-SGD on an objective satisfying certain assumptions and using a quantization scheme with a dimension-free variance bound will achieve a specific result if \u03b6 < 1/\u03ba. This result is consistent with logarithmic quantization being linear when \u03b6 = \u03b7 = 0. By optimizing quantization parameters and fixing the representable range, the number of bits needed to achieve the objective gap is log2O(R\u03c3/\u03b5)\u00b7log1+\u03c31/\u03c3. The NLQ method introduces a tight bound on quantization variance with parameters \u03b4, \u03b6, and \u03b7, applicable to low-precision training algorithms. The number of bits needed to achieve the objective gap is log2O(R\u03c3/\u03b5)\u00b7log1+\u03c31/\u03c3, with a dimension-dependent factor hidden within a log term. This suggests NLQ as a promising technique for low-precision training at scale. Floating-point quantization (FPQ) is also discussed, where quantization points are floating-point numbers. Floating-point quantization (FPQ) involves quantization points represented as floating-point numbers with exponential bits and mantissa bits. The exponent range is determined by a bias term, and non-standard bias can be considered using a scaling factor. Denormal floating point numbers address underflow by replacing the 1 with a 0 for the smallest exponent value, ensuring that floating-point quantization meets certain bounds. The FPQ scheme using randomized rounding satisfies variance bounds for normal and denormal floating-point quantization. This can be combined with Theorem 2 to determine convergence rates for low-precision floating-point SGD. Optimal allocation of bits between exponent and mantissa can be predicted by minimizing the objective gap. The optimal number of exponential bits can be approximated with upper and lower bounds. The optimal number of exponential bits for minimizing the objective gap in low-precision floating-point SGD can be approximated using Theorem 4. The noise ball size increases as the number of exponential bits increases, with an optimal setting of be = 2 for linear quantization. Theoretical asymptotic error minimization varies between normal and denormal FPQ, with the optimal assignment of be being O(log(b)) for normal FPQ and independent of b for denormal FPQ. The optimal assignment of exponential bits for low-precision floating-point SGD can be approximated using Theorem 4. Experiments on synthetic and MNIST datasets show that setting exponential bits to 5 minimizes the noise ball size effectively. In an experiment on the MNIST dataset, logistic regression was run with L2 regularization and specific problem parameters. The observed loss gap for LP-SGD using 16-bit floating point formats was plotted, showing the predicted optimal number of exponential bits to use. The results validated the use of IEEE standard half-precision floating-point. In this paper, dimension-independent bounds on the convergence of SGD for low-precision training are presented. The study validates the use of IEEE standard half-precision floating-point numbers with 5 exponential bits. The analysis extends to non-linear quantization methods like logarithmic and floating point quantization, showing promising results for reducing the number of bits required in training. The research suggests ways to allocate bits between exponent and mantissa in floating point quantization. The hope is to encourage further exploration of non-linear quantization techniques. The algorithm for low-precision SGD is detailed, with bounds on convergence presented. The proof for results in Table 1 considers convergence limits and the minimum number of bits required for accuracy. Linear and non-linear quantization methods are discussed, highlighting the importance of representable range and quantization equality. The proof for low-precision SGD involves setting limits on convergence and determining the minimum number of bits needed for accuracy. Linear and non-linear quantization methods are compared, emphasizing the significance of representable range and quantization equality. In the proof, the upper bound on the second moment of stochastic gradient samples is considered, leading to the derivation of the desired expression. The proof for low-precision SGD involves setting limits on convergence and determining the minimum number of bits needed for accuracy. In Theorem 2, it is shown that by replacing the dimension factor with parameters of the loss functions, the objective gap can be ensured to be \u03b5 with specific requirements on \u03b6 and \u03ba. The number of bits needed for non-linear quantization is derived based on the constraints of \u03b6, leading to the conclusion that log(1 + \u03b6) \u2265 \u03b6/2 for accuracy. The proof involves setting limits on convergence and determining the minimum number of bits needed for accuracy. By replacing the dimension factor with parameters of the loss functions, the objective gap can be ensured to be \u03b5 with specific requirements on \u03b6 and \u03ba. The number of bits needed for non-linear quantization is derived based on the constraints of \u03b6, showing that any 1-dependent terms are inside the double logarithm. The proof of Lemma 2 involves considering positive and negative cases for normal FPQ, setting quantization points and parameters, and proving specific inequalities for different cases. The analysis includes special cases where q i = 0 and extends conclusions to other scenarios based on concavity and minimum values. The proof extends conclusions to cases where v \u2264 0, showing that D can contain both positive and negative numbers. In the de-normal FPQ case, quantization points are specified, and parameters for nonlinear quantization are set. Lemma 3 deals with linear quantization under low-precision representation. Lemma 3 deals with linear quantization under low-precision representation. The proof follows a similar structure as lemma 1 in a previous study. It shows that for any w, v \u2208 R where Q(\u03b4,b)(w) = w, the result can be obtained by summing up all dimensions. The quantization is unbiased, with variance calculated accordingly. The quantization function Q(\u03b4,b) is unbiased and its variance is calculated accordingly. When w + v is outside the representable region, it is mapped to the nearest representable value. This operation makes w + v closer to w*. By summing up all dimensions, the inequality is proven. Additionally, Lemma 4 states that under Lipschitz continuity, if i is sampled uniformly at random from {1, ..., N}, then for any w, E[g] is defined. Lemma 5 proves that under logarithmic quantization, for any w, the quantization function Q is non-linear. The proof extends to lemma 1, focusing on the positive case first and then showing the negative case symmetrically. The lemma holds for each dimension, proving that for any w, v \u2208 R where v \u2208 D, a specific inequality is satisfied. The proof involves showing that for any w, v \u2208 R where v \u2208 D, the quantization function Q is non-linear. By considering two cases - when w is outside or within the representable range - and using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, it is demonstrated that a specific inequality is satisfied. The function achieves a minimum at v = 0 or v = q i , with calculations showing the concavity and positivity of the function. The lemma is proven for cases where w and v are both positive or both negative, showing that the function achieves a minimum at v = 0. Assumptions are modified to show the theorems in a more general sense, with gradients of loss functions being L 1 -Lipschitz continuous. The lemma proves that the function achieves a minimum at v = 0 for cases where w and v are both positive or negative. Assumptions are generalized for gradients of loss functions being L 1 -Lipschitz continuous in the sense of p-norm. Theorems are proven for all real numbers p, showing strong convexity near the optimal point. The proof demonstrates the result for low-precision SGD, utilizing inequalities and assumptions to derive the final inequality. By introducing a constant C and setting it accordingly, the inequality simplifies to a manageable form for further analysis. The proof of Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 involves deriving quantization points and parameters for nonlinear quantization bounds in low-precision SGD. The calculations lead to expressions for noise ball and parameters like ne, be, and B in the context of quantization and noise analysis. The noise ball size is determined by equations involving ne, be, and B in the context of quantization and noise analysis."
