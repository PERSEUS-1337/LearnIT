    "content": "In 1996, Congress enacted the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA; P.L. 104-330) to consolidate federal housing funding for Native Americans into a block grant, giving tribes more control over affordable housing decisions. The centerpiece of NAHASDA is the Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG), providing housing assistance to tribes through formula funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). NAHASDA consolidated federal housing funding for Native Americans into a block grant, giving tribes control over affordable housing decisions. The Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG) provides housing assistance to tribes through formula funding from HUD. NAHASDA also includes a loan guarantee program and funding for training and technical assistance. Additionally, the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG) program was authorized in 2000 to provide housing for low-income Native Hawaiians. Tribes support NAHASDA but advocate for changes to enhance their housing improvement abilities. Tribes advocate for changes to NAHASDA program requirements to improve housing conditions in tribal areas. Proposed changes include streamlining program requirements, providing more flexibility for tribes, and requiring HUD to be more responsive. Congress is also concerned about tribes' unspent NAHASDA funds and the reauthorization process. Some Members of Congress oppose reauthorization of the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant due to concerns about race-based benefits. Debate continues over providing NAHASDA funding to the Cherokee Nation amidst a legal dispute involving Cherokee Freedmen's membership. NAHASDA programs' authorization expired in FY2013, prompting Congress to consider changes and address housing issues affecting Native tribes. The 114th Congress considered NAHASDA reauthorization legislation, but no bills were enacted. This report outlines policy issues related to NAHASDA raised by tribes and Congress. It compares provisions of reauthorization bills from the House and Senate with existing law. For more information, refer to CRS Report R43307. Some tribes have raised issues regarding proposed changes to the NAHBG program requirements, which have been advocated by the National American Indian Housing Council. Tribes vary in size, history, culture, and geography, leading to differing opinions on potential changes to NAHASDA. The NAHBG provides formula funding for affordable housing activities benefiting low-income Native Americans. The NAHBG program provides funding for affordable housing activities benefiting low-income Native American households in tribal areas. The program has requirements to ensure housing remains affordable and complies with federal regulations. Tribes advocate for changes to streamline federal requirements and increase flexibility in setting their own requirements. Some tribes face challenges when combining funding from different federal programs for affordable housing due to varying requirements, such as environmental reviews under NEPA. This can create tension with goals of tribal flexibility and self-determination. Some tribes have suggested that meeting NAHASDA's standards for certain cross-cutting requirements should be sufficient to satisfy other federal agencies' requirements when multiple funding sources are used in a NAHBG-assisted project. Congress has made efforts to address overlapping environmental review requirements in Native American housing by directing HUD to work with other federal agencies to develop a coordinated environmental review process. HUD and other federal agencies were directed to simplify tribal housing development and infrastructure needs by developing a coordinated environmental review process. The agencies consulted with tribes and TDHEs, providing interim and final reports to the appropriations committees. Prevailing wage requirements for workers on NAHBG-assisted projects were also addressed under the Davis-Bacon Act. NAHBG-assisted projects may be subject to tribally determined prevailing wage rates, which can satisfy the requirement to pay a prevailing wage under NAHASDA. However, other federal funding sources may still require Davis-Bacon wages, creating complications for projects using both NAHASDA and other funds. Tribes are advocating for more flexibility in setting housing program requirements, including the use of tribally determined prevailing wages for all federal funding sources. Many tribes seek flexibility in setting maximum rents for NAHBG-assisted housing units to cover maintenance costs without receiving ongoing operating subsidies. Many tribes seek flexibility in setting maximum rents for NAHBG-assisted housing units to cover maintenance costs without receiving ongoing operating subsidies. Tribes argue that higher rents could reduce administrative burdens and promote tribal self-determination, while others fear it may make housing unaffordable for low-income households. Lawmakers express concerns about ensuring affordable housing under NAHASDA's objectives. NAHASDA funds are intended for moderately designed housing, not luxury units. HUD sets total development cost (TDC) limits based on construction costs in the area. Tribes can establish their own standards but must not exceed TDC by more than 10% without HUD approval. Tribes must not exceed TDC limits by more than 10% without HUD approval. They can request a variance for specific projects or adjustments to TDC limits, providing information to support their request. Tribes seek timelier responses from HUD and more flexibility to exceed TDC limits, citing higher costs for energy-efficient housing development. Tribes request more flexibility from HUD to exceed TDC limits for housing projects, citing time and procedural burdens. HUD has concerns about exceeding TDC by more than 10% without approval, as it may impact funding for other housing units. NAHBG-assisted housing must be affordable for low-income households as per NAHASDA requirements. Housing assisted with NAHBG funds must remain affordable for the property's useful life, with binding commitments required to ensure affordability. Tribes seek flexibility in setting affordability periods for certain NAHASDA investments, proposing exemptions for privately owned units with minimal NAHBG funding. HUD may waive certain NAHBG requirements under specific conditions, such as exceeding the total development cost by more than 10% and environmental review factors. Some tribes have raised concerns about HUD's slow response to waiver requests, impacting the affordability of housing assisted with NAHBG funds. Tribes have urged Congress to enact time limits for HUD to respond to waiver requests under NAHASDA, emphasizing the need for quicker approvals to carry out affordable housing activities. They also advocate for HUD to be required to waive certain requirements if specific conditions are met, rather than just allowed to do so. HUD stresses the importance of balancing timeliness with accuracy and sometimes delays approvals due to needing additional information from tribes. Additionally, tribes seek flexibility in using sanitation facilities construction funding from the Indian Health Service in conjunction with HUD funding. Tribes advocate for using IHS sanitation facilities funding with HUD-funded housing to ensure infrastructure is included in the cost of new homes, preserving IHS funding for existing housing. Tribes advocate for combining IHS sanitation facilities funding with HUD-funded housing to include infrastructure costs in new homes, balancing the need for additional housing and related infrastructure. They argue for the flexibility to use federal funds for tribal housing and infrastructure as needed. The NAHASDA authorizes funding for training and technical assistance for Native American housing interests through national or regional organizations, with a shift towards competitive awarding of funds since FY2012. The NAHASDA authorizes funding for training and technical assistance for Native American housing interests through national or regional organizations. Recent appropriations laws have led to HUD distributing funding to multiple groups through a competitive process, which the NAIHC has opposed, arguing that it is best positioned to assist tribes. Some tribes have concerns about changes in technical assistance funding, with Congress noting unexpended NAHBG funds totaling $1 billion in July 2013. The Navajo Nation receives the largest allocation due to its size and housing needs, accounting for a significant portion of unspent funds. The Navajo Nation receives the largest NAHBG allocation due to its size and housing needs, leading to slow spend-out issues in the past. Capacity issues, staff turnover, and construction delays contribute to unexpended balances for tribes. Some tribes save funds for years before undertaking new construction projects. HUD is working with tribes to help them spend funds more timely. Congress has set a five-year deadline for tribes to expend NAHBG funds, with funds available for up to 10 years from appropriation. Previously, there was no deadline for tribes to spend their funds. Congress has begun directing HUD to notify tribes of their allocation amounts within 60 days of the appropriations law being enacted. Additional provisions have been considered to reduce grant amounts for tribes with large unexpended funds or limit some tribes' funding. A provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 required a reduction in formula allocation for tribes with undisbursed funds exceeding three times their formula allocation. This provision applied to tribes eligible for formula allocations of at least $8 million. In FY2016, a provision in the HUD appropriations bill aimed to limit any single tribe's NAHBG allocation to 10% of the total funding, affecting mainly the Navajo Nation. NAHASDA was amended in 2000 to include the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant for affordable housing activities for low-income Native Hawaiians in Hawaii. The Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG) and the Native Hawaiian Housing Loan Guarantee Program provide assistance for affordable housing activities for low-income Native Hawaiians on Hawaiian Home Lands. These programs have not been reauthorized since FY2005, but funding has been continued through annual appropriations acts. Opposition to reauthorization stems from debates about federal government support for programs benefiting Native Hawaiians. The debate over reauthorizing the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant largely revolves around the federal government's relationship with Native Hawaiians. Unlike federally recognized tribes, Native Hawaiians are not recognized as a separate political entity by the federal government. Some argue that programs benefiting Native Hawaiians could be seen as race-based and potentially unconstitutional. Lawmakers supporting reauthorization believe the federal government should provide assistance to Native Hawaiians similar to tribes. The debate over reauthorizing the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant centers on providing assistance to Native Hawaiians similar to Native Americans. The Cherokee Freedmen, descendants of former Cherokee slaves, are in ongoing litigation over tribal membership rights. The Cherokee Freedmen claim tribal membership rights based on an 1866 treaty, while the Cherokee Nation has tried to remove them from membership rolls. In 2008, Congress included language in the NAHASDA reauthorization law prohibiting Cherokee Nation from receiving funding unless a specific injunction in tribal litigation on the Freedmen dispute remained in effect. The injunction in tribal litigation on the Cherokee Freedmen dispute maintained tribal membership for the Freedmen pending resolution of the case. The federal litigation also has an injunction in place for the same purpose. NAHASDA has been reauthorized twice since 1996, with the most recent authorization expiring in FY2013. The 113th Congress considered reauthorization legislation but did not enact any before the end of the session. During the 114th Congress, both the House and Senate considered separate versions of NAHASDA reauthorization legislation. H.R. 360 was passed by the House, while S. 710 was favorably reported by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. Both bills aimed to reauthorize Native American and Native Hawaiian housing programs, with changes to NAHBG requirements. During the 114th Congress, H.R. 360 and S. 710 were proposed to reauthorize Native American housing programs with changes to NAHBG requirements. Both bills addressed issues from the report, but ultimately no NAHASDA reauthorization legislation was enacted."
