Reductions in marginal tax rates and tax benefits for businesses, as well as changes to provisions affecting depreciation, interest deductions, and credits, have impacted taxes on capital income. Some provisions were set to expire in 2010 but were extended for an additional two years, with further extensions under consideration. Bonus depreciation, which expired in 2004 but was reinstated in 2008, is also being considered for extension. The temporary tax reductions enacted in 2001 through 2004 were reinstated in 2008 and extended during the recent recession. The largest reductions include a one-year extension of individual rate reductions costing $94 billion, estate and gift tax repeal costing $31 billion, and reduction in tax rates on dividends and capital gains costing $26 billion. Income tax reform, including corporate and business tax reform, may also be considered. The impact of these tax provisions on higher- or lower-income individuals is a key issue. The report discusses the distributional effects of tax provisions on capital income and behavioral responses. It examines how shifts in asset types and savings rates can alter distributional effects. Capital income can be earned directly or passively, with three major types of passive capital income. The distribution of passive capital income is uneven, with larger shares accruing to a small portion of the population. Income is more concentrated among higher-income individuals compared to wage income. The distribution of passive capital income is uneven, with larger shares accruing to a small portion of the population, especially among higher-income individuals. Capital gains are more concentrated among the wealthy compared to dividends and interest income. This concentration is influenced by the risk-taking behavior of high-income individuals who prefer investing in stocks and bonds. High-income individuals tend to prefer investments with higher tax rates, leading to a concentration in capital gains and stocks. Capital income, including tax-exempt municipal bonds and interest in pensions and IRAs, is not always taxable. This uneven distribution of passive capital income is more pronounced among the wealthy, who favor riskier investments like stocks and bonds. The implicit rent from owning consumer durables, like owner-occupied housing, is not taxable. Tax cuts on capital income mainly benefit higher-income individuals, especially cuts in capital gains tax. Estate tax is concentrated among top asset classes, with a small percentage paying estate taxes. Corporate source income, received as dividends and capital gains, suggests that corporate taxes may not lead to behavioral responses. The data suggests that corporate taxes fall on higher-income individuals, while capital income taxes contribute to the progressivity of the tax system. However, the analysis is incomplete due to portfolio shifts and potential effects on savings behavior. Behavioral responses to differential taxes may result in the burden falling on all owners of capital. The burden of tax falls on all capital owners as capital migrates between heavily and lightly taxed sectors, leading to adjustments in pre-tax returns until after-tax returns are equated. This shifting effect only applies to normal returns, not excess returns due to market power. The burden of tax falls on capital owners as capital migrates between heavily and lightly taxed sectors, leading to adjustments in pre-tax returns until after-tax returns are equated. Excess returns due to market power should be capitalized in the firm's value. Labor may share some burden, but overall, the tax burden is attributed to owners of capital. A Treasury study shows that capital income is concentrated at high levels, with the top 1% holding over 30% of capital income but only 10% of labor income. Capital income taxes contribute to the progressivity of the tax system by falling on higher-income individuals, even with shifts in capital allocation. However, in an open economy, the burden of capital income tax may shift to labor when capital migrates abroad. The burden of a tax imposed in one country can shift to labor, making capital income taxes regressive for higher-income individuals. However, this outcome is rare and requires specific conditions such as territorial tax application, perfect substitutability of capital investments, and no response from trading partners. These conditions do not apply to the United States. Personal level taxes are applied on a residence basis and corporate taxes are not entirely territorial. Imperfect substitutability of assets or products can cause less tax to fall on labor. Inflation and debt-financed capital can lead to a subsidy at the firm level. The ultimate burden of capital income taxes falls on capital and higher-income individuals, even with an open economy. The burden of a capital income tax can be shifted to labor if individuals reduce savings in response to a reduction in return. However, the outcome is uncertain as it depends on various factors and assumptions in economic models. There is doubt about individuals' ability to make complex optimizing decisions about saving, with some suggesting that taxes on capital may have no effect or even increase savings based on rule-of-thumb guidelines and empirical evidence. The empirical evidence suggests that savings rates tend to be steady over time, contradicting certain optimizing models. The subsections discuss alternative models like the Ramsey model, life-cycle model, and bounded rationality, along with a brief review of empirical evidence. The Solow model, developed before the 1970s, assumed a fixed savings rate to explain economic growth. Models of economic cycles and growth were created to account for depressions, recessions, and steady growth of output and productivity. The Solow model with a fixed savings rate explained steady growth in output and productivity in the U.S. postwar period. Dissatisfaction with these models led to the development of new macroeconomic model variations, including intertemporal models that allowed individuals to make consumption decisions over time. These models treated technological advance as exogenous and characterized by steady state growth. Intertemporal models like the Ramsey and OLG models are commonly used in academic journals for predicting economic variables, but are not utilized by government or private sector forecasters. There is a disconnect between the models used by forecasters and those in academic literature, with forecasters typically relying on sticky price or wage models for short-term predictions. Academic economists have also reacted to the complexity and assumptions of intertemporal models. Intertemporal models like the Ramsey model depict individuals as optimizing over time with rules of thumb leading back to the Solow model. Savings in these models are perfectly elastic in the long run, resulting in a significant response to changes in tax rates on capital income. The Ramsey model portrays the economy as a series of identical infinitely lived individuals optimizing over time. The intertemporal substitution elasticity (IES) measures the change in consumption ratio in different time periods relative to price changes. The Ramsey model, commonly taught in macroeconomics, is one way to model the effects of capital income tax through rational individual choice. Another model, the life-cycle model, considers individuals with finite lives and new generations being born. If bequests are driven by interdependent utility functions, the life-cycle model aligns with the outcomes of the Ramsey model. The life cycle model analyzes savings behavior influenced by various factors such as income and substitution effects, capital income taxes, consumption substitutability, behavioral responses, bequests, retirement period, wage growth, and tax revenues. The outcomes of savings can vary depending on these factors. The imposition of a tax on capital to finance spending may reduce saving in certain models, but in others with specific characteristics, savings could actually fall. A capital income tax cut may not increase savings significantly, and the burden would still partially fall on capital. Tax increases used to reduce other taxes, especially in a system where wages are the other major tax base like in the U.S., could increase the capital stock. However, an increase used to reduce consumption taxes may lead to a reduction in savings. Raising capital income taxes to reduce the deficit could expand the capital stock, with workers benefiting if consumption decreases. The life cycle model shows sensitivity to revenue disposition, leading to different outcomes based on how revenues are utilized. The Ramsey model is preferred by tax analysts for its simplicity, but it has limitations such as not allowing for preference heterogeneity or differential tax rates. In contrast, the life cycle model can accommodate these factors without issues. In the Ramsey model, families with bequest motives will eventually own all capital stock, but reaching the steady state may take a long time. The model also assumes a continual dynastic link across descendants. Both the Ramsey model and the life cycle model have theoretical problems, such as the assumption that consumers can optimize consumption over a long period. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of using economic models that require advanced knowledge and programming skills. It mentions Bernheim's concept of \"bounded rationality\" which suggests that individuals struggle with complex problems, making it difficult to assess behavior using certain models. The response to this criticism is that individuals only need to behave as if they are optimizing, similar to how experienced poker players may act based on odds knowledge. Players may base their bets on odds knowledge without being able to state those odds. Bernheim outlines three conditions for this behavior: frequent repetition and observation of outcomes, easy observation of others' choices, and access to expert advice. Life cycle savings lacks these conditions, and financial advice often does not align with intertemporal models. Financial planners typically recommend rules of thumb like saving a percentage of income or accumulating a target savings amount. The curr_chunk discusses the concept of fixed saving rates and target savings approaches in financial planning. It mentions examples of advice given by economists regarding the percentage of income to save for retirement. This advice aligns with intertemporal models and the Solow growth model. The National Retirement Planning Coalition provides tools to calculate the necessary savings amount. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of estate and gift taxes on savings behavior, particularly for high-income donors. It highlights how the estate tax may influence the savings behavior of heirs by reducing the value of the net bequest, leading to potential increases in savings or labor supply. The impact of estate and gift taxes on savings behavior is uncertain, with competing income and substitution effects for donors and recipients. Empirical evidence suggests little savings response, with small effects on savings rates and consumption-leisure substitution. Realistic life cycle models struggle to produce significant savings effects due to low intertemporal substitution elasticities. Elasticities hinder life cycle models from showing significant savings effects from capital income taxes. Limited evidence exists on the impact of estate taxes on wealth accumulation. The 2004 Economic Report of the President suggests shifting the tax to labor based on economic theory. Empirical work indicates that capital income taxes may be partially shifted, but the relationship between tax rates and returns is complex. The papers by Casey Mulligan suggest that capital income taxes are not shifted to labor income, contrary to popular belief. Despite significant variations in tax rates over the twentieth century, the estimated pre-tax return remained relatively constant. This assessment is based on a careful analysis of Mulligan's work, which challenges the traditional view on tax burdens. The analysis challenges the traditional view on tax burdens, suggesting that capital income taxes are not shifted to labor income. The pre-tax return remained relatively constant despite variations in tax rates over the twentieth century. Theoretical models supporting the shift of tax burdens have not been empirically tested and may not align with most evidence on saving behavior. Approaches involving fixed savings rates seem more consistent with bounded rationality models. The analysis challenges traditional views on tax burdens, suggesting that capital income taxes may have little effect on savings. A two-period model is used to illustrate the uncertainty surrounding tax cuts on capital income. The two-period model examines the relationship between consumption and income, considering factors like relative valuation, rate of return, and substitution elasticity. The model assumes fixed labor hours and explores how different levels of work in each period impact consumption. The two-period model analyzes the impact of income on consumption and savings. The relationship is affected by factors like the rate of return, substitution effect, and human wealth effect. Changes in the rate of return can influence consumption in both periods, with savings rising due to the substitution effect and falling due to the income effect. Isolation causes consumption to fall and savings to rise when the rate of return falls. The relative size of these effects determines whether savings rise or fall with an increase in the interest rate. The savings rate, (WL 1 -C 1 )/WL 1, changes positively for a tax cut as long as 1- a(C 1 /C 2 ) (4) s >\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 (1 + a/(1+r)). The parameter a measures the time horizon of earnings relative to consumption. Empirical evidence suggests small intertemporal elasticities, leading to ambiguity in models assuming significant retirement in the second period. In a multi-period model, savings are influenced by intertemporal substitution elasticity and the time horizon of earnings compared to consumption. Factors like retirement period, lifetime wage path, and bequests can also impact savings. The use of revenues from a capital income tax increase is crucial, with scenarios like tax cuts affecting government spending. Tax cuts on capital income can have various effects, such as reducing government spending, offsetting tax increases on wage income, or adding to the deficit. These changes can impact savings rates and the distribution of transfers among different age groups. The use of revenues from a capital income tax increase is important in understanding the overall economic impact. In a two-period model, a tax cut reduces transfers for the old, leading to increased savings due to intertemporal substitution elasticity. However, if the transfer occurs in the first period, a tax cut is less likely to increase savings as it would reduce income and consumption for the young. This negative effect resembles a human wealth effect and is unlikely to occur in practice. In a life cycle model, tax cuts financed by deficits may lead to a fall in the capital stock due to ambiguous effects on private savings and decreased public savings from government borrowing. This short-term effect is influenced by myopic behavior, where individuals believe current wages and returns will remain fixed. Resolving the deficit becomes crucial for long-term stability in the model. Various factors in the life cycle model can impact the magnitude and direction of these effects. The life cycle model's features and assumptions, such as lower intertemporal substitution elasticities, tax cuts offset by higher wage taxes or deficits, inclusion of bequests, and incorporation of risk, can influence the prediction of a savings decrease with a cut in capital income taxes. Bequests, especially when they are fixed targets due to uncertainties like longevity and health in old age, tend to push results towards less savings. Incorporating risk that cannot be eliminated by the market also plays a role in the model. Incorporating risk in wage earnings, expectancy, health, and rate of return leads to precautionary savings and accumulation of bequests for self-insurance. Factors like longer retirement period, slower productivity growth, and declining wages in later years also impact consumption and savings decisions. The assumption of a minimum subsistence amount of consumption limits substitutability in consumption. Life cycle models face uncertainties in calibration without bequests, affecting outcomes significantly. Including bequests is crucial for accurate savings behavior modeling. Wage tax shifts can decrease the capital stock in models with bequests. The 2004 Economic Report of the President discusses empirical evidence on whether firms try to mark up prices in the short run to shift the burden to consumer prices. Economists question this short-run shifting as it requires firms to make irrational decisions that could lead to smaller profits and sales decline in a competitive environment. Despite reservations, a study in the 1960s argued for evidence of short-run shifting of the corporate tax. In the 1960s, a study argued for evidence of short-run shifting of the corporate tax, but most economists believed the effects were not accurately controlled for other factors. The study conducted two empirical estimates, regressing pre-tax profits against tax rates to determine the shifting impact. The author presents a scatter diagram showing the average values for five-year intervals and initially finds a coefficient of -0.27, suggesting a 27% shift. However, after excluding outlying periods like World War II and the Great Depression, the regression line shows little variation in pre-tax returns, indicating minimal shifting despite substantial tax rate changes. Instead of running a regression on this data, the author decides to stop. The author excludes pre-World War II data due to reliability issues, leading to a regression line with a coefficient of -0.51 indicating tax shifting. However, when controlling for forecasted unemployment, the relationship disappears, suggesting no short-run shifting. Mulligan concludes that there is evidence of long run shifting in capital taxes, despite little change in pre-tax returns over time. This conclusion is based on a different estimating strategy using Euler Equation Regressions. The analysis shifts to estimating consumption growth using the consumption Euler equation from an intertemporal model. The equation links expected growth in consumption to the after-tax rate of return and the Intertemporal Elasticity of Substitution (IES). It is challenging to separate the effects of IES on growth from short-term tax shifting. Mulligan sets the IES to 1 by regressing consumption growth against after-tax income. The analysis examines consumption growth by regressing it against after-tax income, with a coefficient of zero indicating short-term shifting and 0.08 suggesting no shifting. Results are mixed, and the study concludes that there is significant capital tax shifting in the long run, little in the short run, and rules out over-shifting. The analysis suggests significant capital tax shifting in the long run, with no effect on saving indicated by data in scatter diagrams. Studies attempting to link savings rate to after-tax return have mostly found small effects. Studies linking savings rate to after-tax return have found small effects, with no significant long-term shifting indicated. Criticisms include the inconsistency of policy changes and expectations over time. The consumption Euler approach is also vulnerable to criticisms, such as unanticipated tax rate changes. An unanticipated permanent fall in the marginal tax rate on capital income leads to a sudden decrease in current consumption, shifting the economy to a new growth path. Consumption growth would initially be higher due to a higher rate of return, but would gradually slow until reaching a new steady state. The theoretical model suggests that if the Intertemporal Elasticity of Substitution (IES) is large, consumption growth must be influenced by profits and taxes. If the rate of return is fixed, the IES is virtually zero, implying a slow adjustment to a new equilibrium in the Ramsey model. The Ramsey model suggests that a large Intertemporal Elasticity of Substitution (IES) leads to slow adjustments in reaching a new equilibrium. The author raises concerns about the Mulligan paper, including the impact of technology, population growth, and institutional factors on aggregate consumption growth. Additionally, the author uses average tax rates instead of marginal tax rates to drive the savings response. The property tax rate is a concern due to its impact on individuals' choice of where to live. The pre-tax return has remained stable over time, indicating that taxes do not significantly affect savings behavior. The burden of taxes falls on capital owners rather than labor."
