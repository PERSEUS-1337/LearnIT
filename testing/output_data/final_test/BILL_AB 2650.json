    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The State of California recognizes the Armenian Genocide annually and urges Turkey to acknowledge and address the genocide, as defined by the United Nations. Genocide denial perpetuates the effects of genocide even after the active phases have ended. The government of Turkey denies the Armenian Genocide, refuses to compensate victims, engages in genocide denial and historical revisionism, and pursues lobbying campaigns to rewrite history. Efforts to erase Armenian culture include ethnic cleansings and destruction of religious sites. Mentioning the genocide in Turkey can lead to criminal prosecution under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code. The State of California, with the largest Armenian American population in the US, has adopted legislation to divest from countries like South Africa, Sudan, and Iran for human rights violations. Armenians in California, descendants of genocide survivors, contribute to various sectors but still face challenges due to Turkey's denial campaign. The State of California invests public funds in Turkey, which denies the Armenian Genocide and funds its denial campaign. This contradicts California's stance on recognizing the genocide and urging Turkey to acknowledge its responsibility. The government of Turkey, not the people, is responsible for human rights violations and genocide denial. California invests in Turkish bonds, enabling denial of the Armenian Genocide. Divesting funds would show non-complicity and encourage acknowledgment and reparations. The new section added to the Government Code defines terms related to the government of Turkey and public employee retirement funds. The board is prohibited from investing public employee retirement funds in Turkish government-issued or controlled investment vehicles. They must liquidate existing investments in Turkey by July 1, 2018, or within six months of federal sanctions on Turkey. The board will engage with Turkey to determine its stance on the Armenian Genocide. Investments must be liquidated by January 1, 2019, or within a year of federal sanctions. The board must report to the Legislature and Governor within a year of federal sanctions on Turkey, listing liquidated investments, engagements with the Turkish government, and reasons for not liquidating certain investments. The board must report to the Legislature and Governor within a year of federal sanctions on Turkey, listing liquidated investments, engagements with the Turkish government, and reasons for not liquidating certain investments. Nothing in this section requires the board to take action unless consistent with fiduciary responsibilities described in the California Constitution. Section 16642 of the Government Code is amended. The Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System board members, officers, employees, research firms, and investment managers shall be indemnified and held harmless by the State of California from all claims and liabilities related to investment decisions. The Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System board members, officers, employees, research firms, and investment managers may restrict, reduce, or eliminate investments as per specific sections."
