Funding for the Department of Commerce increased for the 2010 decennial census, leading to overall increases in CJS funding for FY2009 and FY2010. However, funding for DOJ, NASA, and NSF also saw small increases during that time. Decreased appropriations for the Department of Commerce, DOJ, and NASA contributed to the overall decrease in CJS funding from FY2010 to FY2013. Funding for NSF remained relatively steady during this period. Overall, CJS funding has increased since FY2014.
