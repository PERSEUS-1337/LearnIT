    "content": "The \"Soil Health and Income Protection Program Act of 2017\" or the \"SHIPP Act of 2017\" amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to include the Soil Health and Income Protection Program. The term 'eligible land' in the Soil Health and Income Protection Program Act of 2017 refers to land selected by the owner for enrollment, with a cropping history or considered planted in the past 3 years, and verified as less-productive compared to other land on the farm. It excludes land covered by a conservation reserve program contract. The Soil Health and Income Protection Program Act of 2017 establishes a voluntary program for eligible land to conserve soil, water, and wildlife resources. Eligible land can only be enrolled in the program during the first crop year after the enactment of the section. An agreement must be entered into by the Secretary and the owner. The agreement for eligible land in the Soil Health and Income Protection Program Act of 2017 must be entered into by the Secretary, the owner, and the operator if applicable. It requires planting the lowest cost perennial cover crop determined by the State conservationist and paid for by the owner or operator. The Soil Health and Income Protection Program Act of 2017 allows eligible land to be harvested for seed, hayed, or grazed outside nesting and brood-rearing periods. The land may also be eligible for a walk-in access program and receive payments from a nonprofit wildlife organization in exchange for not harvesting conserving use cover. The annual rental rate for a payment under an agreement described in subsection (b) is 50 percent of the average rental rate for the county. Not more than 15 percent of eligible land on a farm may be enrolled in the program. Each agreement is for a term of 3, 4, or 5 years, with the option for early termination by the Secretary. The Secretary may allow early termination of an agreement for eligible land if deemed necessary. Owners and operators can terminate the agreement by paying the amount of rental payments received under the agreement to the Secretary. Beginning, small, socially disadvantaged, young, or veteran farmers and ranchers may pay 50 percent of planting costs under an agreement determined by the Secretary. The annual rental rate for a payment under an agreement described in subsection (b) shall be 75 percent of the average rental rate for the county. Harvesting, haying, and grazing of eligible land outside the established period shall have conditions, including maintaining adequate stubble height. The annual rental rate for eligible land under an agreement described in subsection (b) is 75 percent of the county's average rental rate. Harvesting, haying, or grazing must maintain adequate stubble height to protect the soil. If eligible land is harvested for seed, it cannot be insured under the Federal Crop Insurance Act and the rental payment is reduced by 25 percent. Funding is authorized for the implementation of this section. The Agricultural Act of 2014 is amended to include a soil health and income protection program agreement. Changes are made to the Federal Crop Insurance Act to increase benefits for participation in the program. The Corporation may increase a premium discount by up to 2 percent (or 3 percent for certain farmers) for agricultural commodities planted in an insurable unit with eligible land enrolled in the soil health and income protection program. The Corporation can increase a premium discount by up to 2 percent (or 3 percent for certain farmers) for agricultural commodities planted in an insurable unit with eligible land enrolled in the soil health and income protection program. An increase in the premium discount applies only for discounts less than 80 percent and does not apply to catastrophic risk protection plans. For agricultural producers with multiple insurable units on one farm, at least one unit with eligible land qualifies for the premium discount. Increase in premium discount for insurable units with eligible land enrolled in soil health and income protection program under the Food Security Act of 1985. Discount applies to all insurable units of the agricultural producer on the farm."
