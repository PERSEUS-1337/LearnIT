    "content": "Since 2014, non-grandfathered plans in the non-group and small-group markets must offer a core package of health care services known as the Essential Health Benefits (EHB). The EHB is not specifically defined by the ACA but includes 10 benefit categories. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is responsible for defining and updating the EHB, ensuring it is equivalent to benefits typically provided under employer-sponsored insurance plans. The Department of Labor conducts surveys to determine typical benefits for comparison. The HHS Secretary must ensure that Essential Health Benefits (EHB) are balanced across 10 categories without discrimination based on age, disability, or life expectancy. They must consider diverse healthcare needs, review EHB, and report to Congress on accessibility issues and potential updates based on medical evidence. The HHS Secretary periodically reviews Essential Health Benefits (EHB) for potential modifications based on medical evidence or scientific advancements. A reference plan approach for EHB was outlined in December 2011, considering employer-sponsored coverage and recommendations from reports by DOL and the Institute of Medicine. Each state identifies a reference plan for non-group and small-group markets. The HHS Secretary periodically reviews Essential Health Benefits (EHB) for potential modifications based on medical evidence or scientific advancements. States select EHB-benchmark plans as reference plans for non-group and small-group markets, updating them based on available plans in previous coverage years. States select EHB-benchmark plans as reference plans for non-group and small-group markets, choosing from four options: 1. Small-group market health plan, 2. State employee health benefit plan, 3. Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) plan, or 4. Non-Medicaid Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). If a state does not choose, the default EHB-benchmark plan is the largest health plan in the state's small-group market. States select EHB-benchmark plans for non-group and small-group markets from options like small-group market health plans, state employee health benefit plans, FEHB plans, or non-Medicaid HMOs. Benchmark plans must cover all 10 EHB categories, but some state plans may not include all categories, requiring supplementation. The EHB-benchmark plan may need supplementation if it does not cover all 10 EHB categories. States can supplement the plan by adding a category from another benchmark plan option. If a state defaults to a benchmark plan, HHS may supplement it with plans from the small-group market or national FEHB plans. CMS released additional guidance for certain Essential Health Benefit (EHB) categories, including pediatric oral and vision services, habilitative services, and mental health and substance use disorder services. They outlined separate processes for supplementing these categories in EHB-benchmark plans that do not cover them. HHS also provided guidelines for supplementing pediatric oral and vision services. For pediatric oral and vision services, states supplement their EHB-benchmark plans with either a FEDVIP plan or a CHIP plan with the highest enrollment. In 2014-2016, 49 states and DC supplemented for pediatric oral services, with 25 states choosing FEDVIP and 24 states selecting CHIP. For pediatric vision services, 45 states and DC supplemented, with 38 states choosing FEDVIP and 7 states selecting CHIP. In 2017, 32 states have to supplement their EHB-benchmark plans for pediatric oral services. HHS proposed policies for coverage of habilitative services in employer-sponsored plans to supplement EHB-benchmark plans. States could define benefits if the benchmark plan lacked coverage for habilitative services. If not defined, plans had to cover similar benefits for habilitative services as for rehabilitative services. For the 2016 coverage year, HHS modified the habilitative services benefits policy by adopting a uniform definition for habilitative services. These services help individuals keep, learn, or improve skills and functioning for daily living, such as therapy for children with developmental delays. States may still define habilitative services, but they must align with the federal definition. HHS finalized additional guidance for habilitative services for the 2017 coverage year. Plans must now have separate visit limits on habilitative and rehabilitative services, and must provide mental health and substance use disorder services compliant with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. The Addiction Equity Act requires health insurance to cover mental health services on par with medical and surgical benefits. HHS outlined requirements for prescription drug services, including a drug exceptions process for enrollees to access clinically appropriate drugs not covered by their plan. The process takes 72 hours for a standard exception and 24 hours for an expedited review request. If granted, the drug must be treated as an Essential Health Benefit. For 2016, health plans must have an updated formulary drug list on their websites, including price tiers. The list must be easily accessible to enrollees, the state, and the general public. In 2017, plans must use a pharmacy and therapeutics committee to develop formulary drug lists that cover a broad range of drugs and do not discourage enrollment. The committee will also review and approve plan policies affecting consumer access to drugs. Prior to the passage of the ACA, states had laws called state benefit mandates that required health plans to cover certain health care services, providers, and dependents. These mandates include coverage for substance abuse treatment, chiropractors, or adopted children. States may require non-group and small-group plans to cover these mandates along with the Essential Health Benefits (EHB). States can also impose additional benefit mandates, but they must cover the costs for plans offered in the exchange. The Essential Health Benefits (EHB) plan quantifies the cost of additional benefits based on actuarial analysis. There is variation in EHB coverage among states in terms of services, amount, duration, and scope. For example, some states may cover bariatric surgery while others do not, and even among states that cover it, the specifics may vary. The duration and scope of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) coverage vary among states, with differences in services, amount, and duration. State benefit mandates and variations in coverage among plans within a state contribute to these differences. For example, plans may offer substitutions for EHB coverage if they are actuarially equivalent and within the same category. The ACA requires non-group and small-group health insurance plans to offer Essential Health Benefits (EHB), including up to 20 physical therapy visits and 20 occupational therapy visits. Plans offered through exchanges must be Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) and comply with cost-sharing limits. Substitutions for EHB coverage can be made if actuarially equivalent. The ACA requires non-group and small-group health insurance plans to offer Essential Health Benefits (EHB), including physical therapy and occupational therapy visits. Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) must be offered through exchanges and comply with cost-sharing limits. Multistate Plans (MSPs) are nationally available QHPs offered through exchanges, with benefits equivalent to state-selected EHB-benchmark plans. Child-only health insurance plans in exchanges must comply with state standards for benefit mandates, substitution of benefits, and habilitative services. These plans are available for individuals under 21 and are treated as a type of QHP, subject to EHB requirements. Catastrophic plans in exchanges offer EHB and coverage for at least three primary care visits, with lower monthly premiums but high deductibles and cost sharing. Catastrophic health plans have high deductibles and cost sharing, do not meet minimum coverage requirements, and are only available for individuals under 30 or those exempt from ACA requirements. Certain health plans like grandfathered, large-group, self-insured, and dental-only plans are not subject to EHB requirements. Grandfathered plans have a unique status under the ACA and must comply with some but not all regulations. Large-group market plans, typically employer-sponsored insurance plans with 50 or more employees, are exempt from many ACA market reforms, including Essential Health Benefits (EHB) coverage. However, they still play a crucial role in providing benefits and coverage related to EHB. Changes to benefits, cost sharing, and access to coverage can cause these plans to lose their grandfathered status. Self-insured plans are a type of group health plan where organizations directly provide health coverage for their members. They bear the risk for covering medical expenses and may contract with third-party administrators for administrative duties. These plans are not subject to many ACA market reforms, including Essential Health Benefits (EHB). In the exchanges, individuals can get dental coverage through a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) or a standalone dental plan. Dental-only plans must cover pediatric oral services but are not required to cover all Essential Health Benefit (EHB) categories. The ACA sets annual cost-sharing limits for EHB, prohibiting deductibles on preventive services and capping out-of-pocket expenses. In 2016, the limits are $6,850 for individuals and $13,700 for families, increasing to $7,150 and $14,300 in 2017. Prior to the ACA, plans could set lifetime and annual limits on covered health benefits. The ACA prohibited these limits on Essential Health Benefits (EHB), but plans can still impose limits on non-EHB benefits. Minimum essential coverage, defined in the ACA, refers to the requirement for individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty. Minimum essential coverage under the ACA includes various private and public health insurance options, such as employer-sponsored plans, individual coverage, Medicare, and Medicaid. Noncompliance with this requirement incurs a penalty."
