    "content": "Since the 1940s, the San Joaquin River in Central California has seen a decline in Chinook salmon populations due to water diversion for agriculture by the Bureau of Reclamation's Friant Dam. In 1988, conservation and fishing groups sued the Bureau of Reclamation for river restoration to support salmon recovery. The operation of Friant Dam violated state law by destroying downstream fisheries. Parties negotiated a Settlement Agreement in 2006 to restore fisheries in the San Joaquin River through new water releases. Congressional authorization and appropriations are needed for full implementation. The Joaquin River Restoration Settlement aims to increase water flows for restoring fisheries, reducing diversions for off-stream purposes like irrigation and hydropower. Water used for restoration flows may not directly correspond to reductions in water deliveries, with flood water releases potentially providing significant restoration flows in wet years. No water would be released for restoration in the driest years, avoiding reductions in deliveries to Friant contractors. The Joaquin River Restoration Settlement aims to increase water flows for restoring fisheries, reducing diversions for off-stream purposes like irrigation and hydropower. Restoration flows released in late winter and early spring may minimize reductions in deliveries to Friant contractors, depending on Millerton Lake storage replenishment. There will be impacts on existing surface and groundwater supplies and adjustments in local economies. Opposition to the Settlement and its legislation remains, but the majority of stakeholders are directly affected. The Settlement Agreement for the Joaquin River Restoration has support from various stakeholders, including water contractors, environmental groups, and community organizations. Congressional approval and funding are needed for full implementation. Failure to secure legislation may result in court-ordered remedies with potentially more severe consequences. Key challenges include financing, balancing fisheries restoration with water management, and addressing concerns of non-participating stakeholders without disrupting the agreement. The Settlement in the lawsuit Natural Resources Defense Council v. Rodgers involves the operation of Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River, part of the Bureau of Reclamation's Central Valley Project in California. The Friant Division of the CVP is located in the southern San Joaquin Valley, with the river flowing north to the Bay-Delta. Congressional approval and funding are necessary for full implementation of the Settlement Agreement for the San Joaquin River Restoration. The Friant Division Service Area in the San Joaquin Valley is crucial for agriculture, relying on surface water from the Bay-Delta. Growers also use groundwater, managing both sources for water reliability. The region spans 250 miles from Stockton to Bakersfield, facing growth and economic challenges. Despite this, it is home to highly productive agricultural counties. The Friant Division Service Area in the San Joaquin Valley includes Fresno, Tulare, Kern, and Merced counties. The area faces environmental challenges, including the court-ordered restoration of the San Joaquin River. The Central Valley Project (CVP) is a reclamation project administered by the Bureau of Reclamation, with the Friant Dam storing water for irrigation purposes. The Friant Division in the San Joaquin Valley serves irrigation and water districts in Fresno, Kern, Madera, Merced, and Tulare counties. Reclamation's operation of Friant Dam diverts most of the San Joaquin River's flow, leading to dry river stretches and the destruction of native fish species. The diverted water from Friant Dam supports an agricultural economy from north of Fresno to Bakersfield. However, water diversions have led to the decline of California fisheries, particularly salmon populations in the San Joaquin River. Historical spawning runs of spring-run Chinook salmon in the river may have exceeded 200,000 fish annually. Historical spawning runs of spring-run Chinook salmon in the San Joaquin River may have exceeded 200,000 fish annually, with a viable population existing into the 1940s. However, operation of Friant Dam caused stretches of the river to dry up, leading to the decline of the population. Today, Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon are listed as threatened under the ESA. Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon have been extirpated from the San Joaquin River drainage and now only inhabit the Sacramento River drainage. Native fall and late-fall-run Chinook salmon continue to spawn in small numbers in the San Joaquin River tributaries. Fall-run Chinook salmon are not listed under the ESA but are considered a species of concern. Litigation over the San Joaquin River's waters has been ongoing for decades, with the most recent settlement stemming from a 1988 lawsuit. The 1988 lawsuit led to litigation over water service contracts between Friant Division water users and Reclamation. Environmental groups, led by NRDC, challenged the contract renewals in federal court on environmental grounds, including violations of NEPA, ESA, and the Reclamation Act of 1902. Reclamation must comply with California state laws regarding water use in irrigation, specifically California Fish and Game Code \u00a7 5937. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California has reviewed the application of this law multiple times since 1988. In 2004, the court found that Reclamation had violated \u00a7 5937 in relation to the San Joaquin River, which was mostly dry except during very wet periods. The San Joaquin River is mostly dry, with historical fish populations destroyed. A 2006 trial was set to determine a remedy for water use violations. Settlement negotiations began in 2005, leading to a final agreement accepted by the District Court in 2006. The Settlement agreement for the San Joaquin River was accepted by the District Court on October 23, 2006. It aims to restore fish populations and address water supply impacts for Friant water contractors. Congressional authorization and appropriations are required for implementation, with a deadline of December 31, 2006, after which the Settlement may become void. The Settlement agreement for the San Joaquin River was accepted by the District Court on October 23, 2006, aiming to restore fish populations and address water supply impacts for Friant water contractors. Implementation legislation was considered in the 110th Congress but was not enacted. Title X of H.R. 146 in the 111th Congress contains a revised version of the legislation, addressing direct spending and restoration flow provisions. No party has officially elected to void the Settlement, and objections were raised by third parties regarding the legislative proposal and timeline imposed by the Settlement Agreement. The San Joaquin River restoration Settlement legislation faced opposition from various parties, including third parties not part of the agreement. Bills were introduced in Congress but not enacted due to budgetary concerns and financing issues for construction projects. The San Joaquin River restoration Settlement legislation involves construction projects costing between $250 million and $1.1 billion, seeking federal funding with budgetary challenges. H.R. 146 aims to address concerns but faces complications as it impacts areas beyond the Friant Division Service Area. The proposed legislation, H.R. 146, aims to address concerns about the San Joaquin River restoration Settlement. Funding for the Settlement may impact salmon restoration projects in other river basins. Recent events limiting water exports could affect the implementation of water management goals. Failure of Congress to act may lead to court-ordered remedies with severe consequences for water users and third parties. The recent actions regarding the Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River have raised broad policy issues related to California water management. The implications of a court decision on dam operations could impact water users and communities. The management of the San Joaquin River ties into broader decisions regarding the Central Valley Project and State Water Project. The CVP and SWP are limited in exporting water south of the Bay-Delta due to court decisions related to the Delta Smelt. Water management goals in the Settlement may rely on moving water in and out of the Bay-Delta, impacting the ability to recapture and reuse San Joaquin River restoration flows. This restoration effort will require multi-year water planning, investments, and infrastructure for buying surplus water and purchasing water in dry years. The future of water resource management in the Central Valley involves multi-year conjunctive management with financial resources for buying surplus water and purchasing water in dry years. Integration of federal, state, local, and private infrastructure projects is crucial. The outcome depends on whether Congress addresses the issue given current water resource authorization practices and budget constraints. A Settlement Agreement was only reached after the U.S. District Court intervened, leading to difficult choices for Congress regarding budget, water delivery, and ecosystem health trade-offs. The San Joaquin river restoration is a response to economic and ecological damage from 60 years ago, causing debates over water supplies and Friant Dam operations complying with state law."
