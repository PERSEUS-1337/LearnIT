The table of contents for the Act is provided. Extension of Build America Bonds is addressed in Section 2 of the American Infrastructure Investment Act of 2010. The text discusses amendments to the dates related to Build America Bonds, extending payments to issuers, and reducing the percentage of payments. The amendment to section 6431 includes changes such as replacing \"The Secretary\" with \"In general--The Secretary,\" updating \"35 percent\" to \"the applicable percentage,\" and defining \"applicable percentage\" as a percentage determined in a table. During the years 2009 to 2012, the applicable percentage for qualified bonds issued varies from 35 percent to 30 percent. The amendment allows for current refunding bonds to be treated as qualified bonds if certain conditions are met, including having the same or earlier maturity date and not exceeding the outstanding amount of the refunded bond. The amendment clarifies that current refunding bonds must have the same or earlier maturity date and not exceed the outstanding amount of the refunded bond. Additionally, it specifies the applicable percentage and determination of average maturity for such bonds. Furthermore, it includes capital expenditures for levees and flood control projects in the context of section 54AA(g)(2). SEC. 3. EXEMPT-FACILITY BONDS FOR SEWAGE AND WATER SUPPLY FACILITIES. Bonds for water and sewage facilities are exempt from the volume cap on private activity bonds. Amendments are made to sections 146(g) and 146(k) to allow for this exemption. Additionally, tax-exempt issuance by Indian Tribal Governments for water and sewage facilities is addressed in section 7871. The amendments made by this section apply to obligations issued after the enactment of this Act, specifically relating to facilities described in section 142(a). Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to section 7871(c) by including paragraph (4) in addition to paragraph (3). SEC. 4 extends the exemption from alternative minimum tax treatment for certain tax-exempt bonds to January 1, 2012, and includes 2011 in the heading. SEC. 5 extends and allocates additional recovery zone bond authority. These amendments apply to obligations issued after December 31, 2010. The amendment extends Recovery Zone Bond Authority to January 1, 2012 and allocates bond limitations based on unemployment numbers for each state in 2010. The amendment extends Recovery Zone Bond Authority to January 1, 2012 and allocates bond limitations based on unemployment numbers for each state in 2010. Allocations are made to ensure that no State receives less than 0.9 percent of the national recovery zone economic development bond limitation and facility bond limitation. States must reallocate their allocations among counties and large municipalities based on 2009 unemployment numbers. Each State must reduce the 2010 national recovery zone economic development bond limitation allocated to counties and large municipalities based on previous allocations. The recovery zone facility bond limitation is allocated to counties or large municipalities in each State based on the national recovery zone facility bond limitation allocated under subsection (a)(3)(A). Counties or municipalities can waive any portion of their allocation, with unallocated portions considered waived if not used for bonds issued before May 1, 2011. The allocation waived under this subparagraph can be reallocated by the State. Large municipalities in a county are treated as part of the municipality, not the county. The term '2009 unemployment number' refers to the number of unemployed individuals in a State, county, or municipality in December 2009. The 2010 national recovery zone economic development bond limitation is $10,000,000,000, and the recovery zone facility bond limitation is $15,000,000,000. Any allocation of these limitations shall be treated in the same manner as an allocation of national recovery zone bonds. The State has the authority to waive any 2009 allocations not used for bonds issued before May 1, 2011, allowing reallocation of waived allocations. SEC. 6 amends section 38(c)(4) to allow the new markets tax credit against alternative minimum tax. The amendments apply to qualified equity investments made after March 15, 2010. SEC. 7 extends tax-exempt eligibility for loans guaranteed by Federal Home Loan Banks until December 31, 2011. SEC. 8 extends temporary small issuer rules for allocation of tax-exempt interest expense by financial institutions until 2011."
