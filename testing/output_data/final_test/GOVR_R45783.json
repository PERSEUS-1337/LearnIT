    "content": "Intercity passenger rail in America has a long history dating back to the 19th century when railroad companies built extensive track networks for both freight and passenger transportation. Federal regulation, such as the Hepburn Act of 1906 and the Transportation Act of 1958, played a significant role in shaping the industry. However, by the mid-20th century, passenger rail services faced stiff competition from faster jet airliners and private automobiles. In the mid-20th century, passenger rail services in America faced competition from faster jet airliners and private automobiles. The rail industry's financial health worsened, leading to deferred maintenance and reduced speeds. Congress passed the High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 to support research and development of new transportation technologies, resulting in the establishment of the Metroliner, the nation's fastest rail service on the Northeast Corridor. In the years since the establishment of Amtrak, Congress has played a role in supporting passenger rail service through various forms of federal assistance. There is ongoing debate over the justification of federal subsidies for passenger rail, with the Trump Administration calling for a shift of decision-making and cost responsibility to states. Amtrak was created by Congress to maintain intercity passenger rail service and relieve private railroad companies of money-losing operations. Initially structured as a contracting agency, Amtrak eventually took over ownership of the Northeast Corridor and implemented improvement programs to reduce travel times between major cities. Amtrak was created by Congress to maintain intercity passenger rail service and relieve private railroad companies of money-losing operations. The law that created Amtrak also stipulated that Amtrak pay host railroads for the incremental costs specific to its usage of tracks. Congress granted Amtrak \"preference\" over freight trains in using rail lines, but Amtrak has struggled to enforce this preference. Several railroads continued to operate long-distance passenger services after 1970 rather than contracting with Amtrak, with the last of these services being discontinued in 1983. Amtrak itself discontinued some of its original routes. Amtrak, created by Congress in 1970, has been required to maintain a \"national network\" of long-distance trains. Federal funds cover operating losses and capital expenditures. In 1991, ISTEA empowered the Secretary of Transportation to designate high-speed rail corridors with a $5 million annual set-aside for safety improvements. This provision aimed to boost maximum speeds on rail lines. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21, P.L. 105-178) increased the number of high-speed rail corridors to 11, totaling roughly 9,600 miles. These corridors consist of interlocking or diverging lines, with extensions added over time. Most corridors are between 100 and 500 miles in length, designed to make rail competitive with other modes of transportation. The federally designated high-speed rail corridors, totaling approximately 1,500 miles, currently lack intercity passenger rail service. Some segments were previously served by Amtrak, while others have not had service since before Amtrak's inception in 1971. Funding for this network is no longer dedicated, but federal designation remains part of efforts to enhance passenger rail, including through the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA) created grant programs to enhance passenger rail service, authorizing up to $3.725 billion for intercity rail development. The 111th Congress allocated $10.6 billion for rail services in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and subsequent Department of Transportation Appropriations Acts. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) published a High-Speed Rail Strategic Plan in the same year to improve rail services. The High-Speed Rail Strategic Plan outlined the Obama Administration's priorities to improve intercity passenger rail service using funds from PRIIA and ARRA. FRA awarded 158 grants under the HSIPR Grant Program, with 80% going to large-scale projects in federally designated corridors. Most grants focused on incremental improvements to existing services, except for California's high-speed rail project. The 112th Congress rescinded $400 million of the $10.6 billion previously appropriated for HSIPR grants, leading to delays in project delivery and some states declining funding. Remaining projects are still in progress, with some requiring additional funding for construction. The FAST Act reauthorized passenger rail programs after PRIIA expired in 2013. While it did not authorize large capital grants like PRIIA, it included measures to improve passenger rail. Some projects initiated under PRIIA were advanced on a smaller scale. Intercity passenger rail projects also received funding from U.S. DOT's TIGER/BUILD grant. Passenger rail projects have been advanced using funds from the U.S. DOT's TIGER/BUILD grant program, created under Section 11301 of the FAST Act. The program has allocated $916 million out of $1.103 billion authorized from FY2016 through FY2020. While it has not increased speed or frequency in intercity passenger rail, it has been used for implementing Positive Train Control systems. The Federal-State Partnership for State of Good Repair program was created under the FAST Act to fund the rehabilitation or replacement of aging infrastructure for passenger rail service. $997 million was authorized, with $675 million appropriated so far. Preference is given to projects with a 50% nonfederal share, joint applications, and projects sponsored by entities other than Amtrak. The program focuses on intercity passenger rail projects for infrastructure replacement or rehabilitation. The Restoration and Enhancements program covers operating costs for reinitiating passenger rail services, different from other FRA grant programs that fund infrastructure improvements. The program aims to restore service along the Gulf of Mexico coast, with funding available since FY2017. A $33 million CRISI grant was awarded in 2019 to the Southern Rail Commission for capital improvements. The federal government has taken steps to improve passenger rail by supporting the acquisition of new rail cars and locomotives. Amtrak periodically rehabilitates its fleet, and some states have purchased specialized rail equipment. Section 305 of PRIIA tasked Amtrak with creating a committee to procure standardized rail equipment for use. The committee was formed to procure standardized rail equipment for state-supported short distance corridors, including diesel locomotives and bi-level passenger cars. Five states jointly procured 130 passenger cars and 32 locomotives using a mix of state and federal funds, including a $268 million HSIPR grant. Siemens won the locomotive procurement, while Sumitomo Corporation of America won the passenger car procurement. Nippon Sharyo was to assemble the cars at a factory in Rochelle, IL. Nippon Sharyo was replaced by Siemens in assembling rail cars due to a failed prototype test, leading to delays and changes in the procurement. A portion of the $268 million grant expired and was returned to the Treasury. Federal regulations, including \"Buy America\" requirements and FRA safety standards, constrained the procurement of new rail equipment. Passenger rail cars must withstand certain crush forces to operate in mixed traffic with freight trains. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) safety standards in the United States make it challenging to deploy passenger rail equipment designed for Europe or Asia without modifications, increasing production costs. In 2018, FRA regulations introduced Tier III passenger rail equipment for speeds up to 220 mph on dedicated tracks or 125 mph on lines shared with freight trains. This allows for greater variety in train car designs and eligibility for federal loan programs like RRIF for passenger rail projects. The federal loan programs RRIF and TIFIA were not specifically designed for passenger rail, limiting their application to intercity rail. Amtrak has used RRIF loans for locomotives on the Northeast Corridor, which generates a profit. Amtrak's RRIF loans total over $3 billion, representing a significant portion of the program's loan amounts. Amtrak's on-time performance in 2018 was only 73%. Amtrak's on-time performance in 2018 was 73%, with half of long-distance trains arriving within 15 minutes of schedule. Freight lines may prioritize their operations over Amtrak's, leading to delays. The NEC also experienced late arrivals, with state-supported routes now on par with NEC reliability. Amtrak has criticized host railroads for the delays. Amtrak's on-time performance has dropped from historic highs, with blame placed on host railroads. A dispute between Amtrak and Norfolk Southern over delays led to threats of further action. The 110th Congress attempted to address on-time performance issues in Section 207 of PRIIA. The 110th Congress passed Section 207 of PRIIA to address on-time performance issues in the rail industry. This included developing minimum performance standards, incorporating them into rail service contracts, and resolving disputes through arbitration. The Association of American Railroads sued to block the standards in 2011, leading to a Supreme Court ruling that Amtrak could regulate other private entities. The 2010 standards were suspended during legal proceedings. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Amtrak does not have undue coercive power over its competitors without an arbitrator to enforce standards. The Supreme Court upheld the federal government's authority to set performance standards. Efforts to improve intercity passenger rail focus on infrastructure and equipment upgrades on existing routes. Constraints on increasing speeds include existing line geography and control by freight railroads. The federally funded programs aim to improve Amtrak's route network by extending infrastructure life, enhancing reliability, increasing service frequency, and reducing trip times. The Northeast Corridor received nearly $1 billion in HSIPR funds for various projects, including infrastructure improvements and environmental studies for future projects. Freight railroads controlling most lines used by Amtrak have little incentive to allow higher speeds or more frequent passenger service without concessions. The PRIIA funding program aims to improve infrastructure and engineering studies for large unfunded projects, including a corridor improvement plan for the Northeast Corridor (NEC). The NEC Future planning project identified goals for rail service and recommended specific infrastructure investments. The Selected Alternative, approved in July 2017, improves speed and capacity without building a new parallel route. One limitation is the path taken by trains along the coast of Long. The existing Northeast Corridor faces limitations due to tight curves along the coast of Long Island Sound in southeastern Connecticut, reducing speeds and trip times. Proposed solutions include constructing new tracks farther inland for increased capacity and reliability, particularly after the flooding of the rail tunnel under the Hudson River during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The Gateway Program aims to address these issues and improve both reliability and capacity for intercity service. The Gateway Program is a $24-29 billion project aimed at increasing reliability and capacity, including a new two-track tunnel under the Hudson River. Funding challenges exist as Amtrak and New Jersey Transit have limited resources. Amtrak's NEC operating profit is pledged to repay a federal loan. Amtrak's Gateway Program faces funding challenges, including repaying a $2.45 billion federal loan in 2022. Current federal transportation grant programs do not provide predictable large amounts of funding over many years. The program aims to improve intercity and commuter rail services but lacks multi-year funding support. The Gateway program faces funding challenges as federal grant programs do not provide multi-year funding. The Portal North Bridge and Hudson Tunnel Projects are seeking Federal Transit Administration funding, but face doubts about their financial commitments. Most federal grant funding for rail improvements goes to routes outside the Northeast Corridor. The HSIPR program involved using public funds to improve privately owned rail infrastructure or facilitate its purchase by a public agency. Critics argue that the program's investments were spread too thinly to make significant service improvements. Developing true high-speed rail services with federal assistance will be challenging due to the pressure to distribute funding widely. State-supported routes have driven much of Amtrak's ridership growth in recent years, with several states receiving federal funding to enhance services. Several states received federal funding to improve rail infrastructure and increase speeds on state-supported routes. Some projects have been successful, while others, especially larger corridor improvement projects, have faced delays. The Chicago-St. Louis corridor improvement program aimed to enhance rail capacity rather than implement true high-speed rail. The Chicago-St. Louis corridor improvement program aims to enhance rail capacity, reduce interference from freight trains, and increase passenger train speeds to 110 mph. However, certain segments of the route are congested with freight and commuter traffic, limiting speed improvements. A study identified alternatives for double-tracking the entire corridor, potentially reducing travel times by nearly two hours at a cost of $4.9 billion to $5.2 billion. The costs of implementing alternatives for the Chicago-St. Louis corridor improvement program are estimated between $4.9 billion and $5.2 billion. Projects in Springfield are under construction with TIGER grants, but environmental reviews for other segments were suspended in November 2018. Norfolk Southern no longer wanted to maintain a section of the corridor, leading to the State of Michigan purchasing it with HSIPR grant funds. The State of Michigan used grant funds to purchase a section of the corridor from Norfolk Southern, allowing for improvements to increase speeds to 110 mph. Upgrades funded by ARRA have already reduced trip times between Chicago and Detroit by 25 minutes. Further improvements are being considered, including increasing daily round trips and selecting a new route from Chicago to Michigan City, IN. On November 30, 2018, FRA halted the planning process for a new route from Chicago to Michigan City, IN. The derailment of an Amtrak Cascades train near DuPont, WA on December 18, 2017, led to the suspension of the Point Defiance Bypass route. Amtrak has since been operating trains on its original route. Amtrak complied with NTSB recommendations to reduce the fleet of certain passenger cars following a 2017 derailment. Efforts to improve financial stability focus on reforming long-distance routes with high operating subsidies and low on-time performance. These routes serve small communities that rely on Amtrak for connectivity. The federal government supports Amtrak's long-distance routes through annual appropriations to the National Network, totaling $1.2 billion in FY2020. This funding helps cover operating subsidies and capital projects to maintain service. Congress has authorized gradual increases in grants, with appropriations generally meeting or exceeding authorized levels. For FY2019, $50 million was allocated for capital grants to support long-distance service on tracks where Amtrak is the sole operator and positive train control is not required by law. Amtrak received $50 million in FY2019 for capital grants to support long-distance service on tracks where Amtrak is the sole operator and positive train control is not required by law. This funding helped sustain operations of the Southwest Chief route, with local communities receiving federal TIGER grants to maintain the tracks. Amtrak initially considered replacing trains with buses in certain areas due to a lack of matching funds, but the $50 million set-aside allowed for the continuation of service. The $50 million from FY2019 appropriations funded the remaining project costs, allowing train service to continue along the entire route. The Administration and Amtrak proposed changes to long-distance train service, including replacing a section of the Southwest Chief with bus service. The FY2020 budget request suggested eliminating operating support for long-distance trains, with states eligible to apply for Restoration and Enhancements funding to bridge the gap. Federal funding would gradually decrease over five years. Federal funding for train service would be phased down over five years, with states taking full responsibility by FY2024. States could negotiate with Amtrak for schedule changes or discontinuing segments. Amtrak is open to modernizing the National Network with enhanced federal funding to serve more passengers efficiently. CEO Richard Anderson expressed this in a letter to Senator Moran. Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson emphasized the need to reevaluate the role of long-distance trains in the network and the decision Congress faces regarding funding. The FY2019 Appropriations Act recognized the importance of long-distance routes in providing transportation access to millions of riders in rural areas. The need to sustain routes and services for connectivity in the National network is highlighted, despite low daily boardings at some stations. Congress has tried to increase competition in passenger rail, but Amtrak's advantages make it challenging. A program under Section 214 of PRIIA allows other operators to bid for certain routes currently operated by Amtrak. Amtrak's program under Section 214 of PRIIA allows other railroad companies to bid for long-distance routes, with FRA selecting a winning bidder entitled to an annual operating subsidy. The program was revised in the FAST Act to include up to three routes for a four-year period with the possibility of renewal, capped at 10% below the prior fiscal year's subsidy level. No bids were submitted initially, but the program aims to increase competition in passenger rail services. The FAST Act revised Amtrak's program under Section 214 of PRIIA to allow other railroad companies to bid for long-distance routes, expanding eligibility to include states and partnerships. Despite the potential for significant investments in new infrastructure, no bids have been submitted for projects to retain or improve existing Amtrak services. A funded study in New York State estimated $14.7 billion for 125-mph rail service from NYC to Albany and Buffalo. The California High-Speed Rail program aims to connect LA and SF with speeds over 200 mph, with completion now expected by 2033. The California High-Speed Rail (CAHSR) project, initially planned for completion in 2028, is now delayed until 2033 due to insufficient funding. Despite receiving $3.9 billion in federal grants, the projected cost of construction has escalated, with the Central Valley segment alone estimated at $10.6 billion. Governor Gavin Newsom acknowledged the need for additional funding to complete the full system. The California High-Speed Rail project is facing delays until 2033 due to insufficient funding. Governor Gavin Newsom clarified that the project is not canceled, with the Central Valley segment expected to improve passenger rail service. The federal government is trying to reclaim grant money, but California is challenging this in court. The project has already spent a $2.6 billion grant, while a $929 million grant remains untouched. After Florida rejected a federal HSIPR grant for a Tampa-Orlando rail project, All Aboard Florida (AAF) planned a new intercity rail line from Miami to Orlando via West Palm Beach. The service, known as Brightline, uses tracks owned by Florida East Coast Industries (FECI) and offers faster service than Amtrak's route. AAF sought a $1.6 billion federal RRIF loan for construction, but no loan was approved. Brightline rail service between Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach began on January 13, 2018, with service expanding to Miami by May 19 of that year. Service to Orlando is expected to begin in 2022. All Aboard Florida applied for allocations to sell $600 million of private activity bonds for the Miami-West Palm Beach segment and $2.25 billion for the West Palm Beach-Orlando segment. The project is subsidized by federal tax exemptions on the bonds. All Aboard Florida also acquired XpressWest, a company planning a rail service between Las Vegas and Los Angeles, but a RRIF loan was not issued. XpressWest was planning a high-speed rail line with a connection to California HSR system in Palmdale. Virgin Group partnered with All Aboard Florida, rebranding Brightline and XpressWest as Virgin Trains USA. Construction of the Las Vegas-Southern California line was delayed for two years. Texas Central Partners is planning a high-speed rail line between cities. Virgin Trains USA postponed its initial public offering. Texas Central Partners is moving forward with plans to construct a high-speed rail line between Dallas and Houston, using Japanese technology to reach speeds of 186 mph in 90 minutes. The project may rely on federal loans despite claims of no public funding. Legal issues regarding land acquisition through eminent domain have caused delays, but construction could start in 2019 or 2020. Texas Central Partners plans to construct a high-speed rail line between Dallas and Houston using Japanese technology to reach speeds of 186 mph in 90 minutes. Construction could start in 2019 or 2020, with federal loans possibly involved. Funding for passenger rail differs from highways and transit, with unpredictable funding for projects like this due to the lack of a dedicated revenue source. The lack of a dedicated revenue source for passenger rail programs makes it challenging to secure consistent funding, especially with competition from other programs. Calls for a dedicated funding source have been made by supporters of rail service, but Congress has yet to take action. Rail planning in the U.S. is decentralized, with project sponsors, usually states, responsible for their own plans. Congress and past administrations have identified investment priorities and trip time goals for certain routes, but these have not been consistently supported. The lack of reliable funding for passenger rail projects hinders rail planning in the U.S. States may not invest resources without federal support. FRA has not developed a standalone National Rail Plan but provides guidance for states to create their own plans. Regional rail plans have been created with service goals and cost estimates. Rail studies have been completed in the Southwest, with ongoing studies in the Midwest. The rail study in the Southwest is complete, while studies in the Midwest and Southeast are ongoing. Regional rail plans lack construction funding and are nonbinding. Efforts to foster competition in intercity passenger rail have not been successful, partly due to Amtrak's monopoly status. Startup passenger rail companies face challenges under current laws and regulations. Congress could potentially re-impose obligations on freight railroads to accommodate passenger service, a move that the freight rail industry would likely oppose."
