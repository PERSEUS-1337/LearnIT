Congress acknowledges that a significant number of African-American farmers had their discrimination claims denied without a hearing on the merits in the Pigford v. Glickman case. Section 14012 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 aims to provide a full determination on the merits for these denied claims and authorizes expedited resolutions, with $100,000,000 allocated for this purpose from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The $100,000,000 allocated from the Commodity Credit Corporation is not a cap but a placeholder for Congress to increase funding as needed to address discrimination claims by over 77,000 African-American farmers. Additional funding will be necessary to ensure each Pigford claim is determined on its merits. SEC. 2. FUNDING FOR PIGFORD CLAIMS.
