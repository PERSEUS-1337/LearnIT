    "content": "In 1999, non-profit groups petitioned the EPA to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles, citing the agency's duty under the Clean Air Act. They argued that GHGs are air pollutants that may endanger public health and welfare. The EPA denied a petition in 2003 to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act, citing that GHGs are not considered \"air pollutants\" under the CAA. The new opinion argued that while the CAA addresses global warming, it does not authorize regulation but seeks to understand the issue. The new opinion argues that Congress has shown interest in addressing global atmospheric issues like global warming through tailored solutions rather than relying on the general regulatory structure of the Clean Air Act. It also points out that congressional enactments from 1978 to 1990 indicate a foundation for potential future legislative action on global warming. Additionally, it highlights a 1998 General Counsel memorandum that classified greenhouse gases as \"air pollutants\" under the CAA before a key Supreme Court decision in 2000 emphasized the importance of interpreting broad agency authority in line with statutory purpose, structure, and history. This suggests that the CAA should not delegate authority without considering these factors. The CAA should not delegate authority of profound economic significance like addressing global warming in a cryptic fashion. EPA rejected a petition in 2003, endorsing President Bush's non-regulatory approach to global warming. The denial was challenged in the D.C. Circuit by states, cities, territories, and environmental groups. EPA was supported by state intervenors and automobile-related trade groups in Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. EPA. In Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. EPA, a split panel rejected a challenge regarding EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions. Judge Randolph supported rejection based on EPA's discretion in choosing not to regulate, citing broad interpretation of CAA section 202(a)(1). This allowed EPA to consider scientific uncertainty and policy considerations in its decision-making process. In Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. EPA, a split panel rejected a challenge regarding EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions. EPA relied on factors like efforts to promote fuel cell and hybrid vehicles, and the inefficiency of regulating vehicle GHG emissions alone in addressing global warming. Judge Sentelle supported rejection based on lack of standing, while Judge Tatel dissented, stating that at least one petitioner had standing and EPA has authority to regulate GHG emissions under section 202(a)(1). In Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. EPA, a split panel rejected a challenge regarding EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions under section 202(a)(1). Judge Tatel dissented, stating that at least one petitioner had standing and EPA has authority to regulate GHG emissions. The case was later taken up by the Supreme Court. The standing issue in global warming litigation is a key challenge for plaintiffs, as shown in Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. EPA. EPA argues that petitioners lack standing due to insufficient evidence of causation and redressability regarding GHG emissions from new motor vehicles in the U.S. The petitioners argue that the Clean Air Act empowers the EPA to regulate new motor vehicle emissions based on their global warming effects, as GHGs fall under the definition of \"air pollutant.\" They assert that GHGs causing harm do not exempt them from regulation under the CAA. The EPA General Counsel memorandum's attempt to avoid regulating emissions for global warming under section 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act is challenged by petitioners. EPA argues that the authority question was not addressed by lower courts and should be resolved on standing grounds or the \"in his judgment\" issue. If the authority question is reached, EPA maintains that the act does not grant authority to regulate emissions for reducing global warming. The issue at hand is whether EPA can decline to issue emission standards for policy reasons not listed in CAA section 202(a)(1). Petitioners argue that the phrase \"in his judgment\" in 202(a)(1) only refers to public health or welfare endangerment, not other policy considerations cited by EPA. They claim that allowing EPA to consider policy factors not mentioned in 202(a)(1) would shift power from Congress. The appeals court sanctioned a shift of power from Congress to the EPA, citing uncertainty in the scientific record on global warming. EPA argues that the phrase \"in his judgment\" allows them to consider these factors. The federal brief lacks discussion on policy factors, which is the crux of the issue. The Supreme Court accepted the case Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which lacks key factors for acceptance. The Court could rule on issues like standing and the relationship between environmental interests and global warming. The Supreme Court may rule on standing and jurisdictional issues in the case of Commonwealth of Massachusetts, involving global warming effects and air pollutants. Justice Scalia's stance on narrowing standing may influence the decision. The Supreme Court may address issues related to global warming effects and air pollutants in the case of Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The EPA Administrator's judgment on regulating emissions and potential mandatory duties may be considered, with various possible outcomes including a remand to the D.C. Circuit for resolution. Direct judicial orders for EPA to regulate new-motor-vehicle GHG emissions are unlikely, with potential additional agency determinations required if petitioners succeed. The Supreme Court may address global warming effects and air pollutants in the case of Commonwealth of Massachusetts, potentially leading to increased pressure on EPA to regulate GHG emissions from stationary sources. A decision is expected by June 2007."
