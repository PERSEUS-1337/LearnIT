    "content": "The \"Healthy Relationships Act of 2015\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. It includes provisions for Sexual Risk Avoidance Education. The \"Healthy Relationships Act of 2015\" authorizes grants for qualified sexual risk avoidance education emphasizing postponing sexual activity as optimal behavior for youth. Education must be medically accurate, evidence-based, age-appropriate, and cover specific topics thoroughly. The education shall address the benefits of personal responsibility, success sequencing, self-regulation, goal setting, healthy decision-making, and focusing on the future. It will also cover the advantages of reserving sexual activity for marriage, skills to resist the sex-saturated culture, and components of healthy relationships. The education on sexual risk avoidance emphasizes healthy relationships, avoiding coercion and violence, and the importance of delaying sexual activity. Contraception information should highlight the benefits of delaying sex and not overstate its effectiveness in preventing consequences. Priority for grants is given to programs promoting sexual risk avoidance education. The Act emphasizes providing qualified sexual risk avoidance education for youth in middle and high school grades to promote parent-child communication. Definitions include \"age-appropriate\" and \"evidence-based approach\" criteria for the education programs. The term \"medically accurate\" refers to information supported by reputable sources. \"Sexual risk avoidance\" means choosing not to engage in sexual activity. \"Sexual activity\" is defined as genital contact or stimulation for arousal. \"Success sequencing\" involves completing school, finding a job, and getting married before having children to reduce the risk of poverty. Authorization of Appropriations: $110,000,000 is authorized annually from 2016 to 2020 for this Act, funded by the Prevention and Public Health Fund. Up to $1,000,000 can be used for Federal administrative costs, with at least 40% directed towards such expenses. At least 40 percent of the $1,000,000 authorized annually for Federal administrative costs should be allocated for training and technical assistance by qualified organizations focused on sexual risk avoidance. These organizations must have expertise in curriculum development, evaluation instruments, and offer a wide range of relevant training topics."
