    "content": "The Act may be cited as \"The HAMP Termination Act of 2011\". Congressional findings are also included. The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) was designed to help financially struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure by modifying loans. However, as of February 2011, only 607,600 active permanent mortgage modifications were made under HAMP. Many homeowners whose HAMP modifications were canceled suffered because they made futile payments and some were forced into foreclosure. The Special Inspector General for TARP reported that HAMP benefits only a small portion of distressed homeowners and offers others little more than false hope. Terminating HAMP would save American taxpayers approximately $1.4 billion, as only $840 million has been disbursed out of the $30 billion obligated by the Department of the Treasury. The authority for HAMP is terminated, saving taxpayers $1.4 billion. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 terminates the authority to provide new assistance under the Home Affordable Modification Program, saving taxpayers $1.4 billion. The Home Affordable Modification Program's authority to offer assistance was terminated under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, with unobligated funds being used for deficit reduction.

The Secretary will conduct a study on the usage and impact of the Home Affordable Modification Program for covered homeowners, and submit a report to Congress within 90 days.
