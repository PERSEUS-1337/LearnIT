    "content": "The United States is a net exporter of hazardous waste to Canada, but a larger net importer of non-hazardous solid waste due to landfill capacity and low-cost disposal options. Shipments of hazardous waste between the two countries require notification and consent under a 1986 agreement. The 1986 agreement between the United States and Canada requires notification and consent for shipments of hazardous waste. The notification must include details such as the exporter's identity, waste description, quantity, transport information, treatment method, and shipment date. The receiving country has 30 days to consent or object to the shipment, with consent being revocable for good cause. The 1992 amendment to the bilateral hazardous waste agreement aimed to regulate municipal solid waste shipments, but was never implemented due to lack of legislative authority. Unregulated shipments of non-hazardous waste, mainly municipal solid waste, have sparked controversy. Some state governments require solid waste management facilities to report waste origin after disposal, with Ontario shipping significant quantities of waste to the US. State waste reporting requirements vary, with some states not collecting data at all. In June 2007, a survey by CRS showed that Michigan received 3,781,171 tons of municipal solid waste from Ontario in FY2005. New York received 195,228 tons from Ontario in 2005, and Washington received 101,834 tons from British Columbia. Over 90% of Canadian waste shipped to the US goes to Michigan, with the rest going to New York and Washington. Since late 2002, Canadian waste imports to Michigan have increased significantly, with Canada accounting for a large percentage of waste disposed in Michigan landfills. Despite a decrease in FY2007, Canadian waste still made up a significant portion of waste in Michigan landfills. Michigan has tried to restrict waste imports since the late 1980s. In 1992, waste import restrictions in Michigan were deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the power given to Congress to regulate interstate commerce. Bills like H.R. 2491 and H.R. 518 have been introduced in Congress to obtain consent for such restrictions. H.R. 518, introduced in the 110th Congress by Representative Dingell, aims to implement the U.S.-Canada waste trade agreement regarding municipal solid waste shipments. The bill requires the EPA Administrator to enforce the agreement's notice and consent requirements, giving weight to the views of the states and local governments involved. The bill requires the EPA Administrator to consider various factors when enforcing the U.S.-Canada waste trade agreement, including the impact on recycling programs, landfill capacity, air emissions, road deterioration, homeland security, public health, and the environment. States are also authorized to restrict imports of foreign municipal solid waste before the agreement's implementation, with Michigan already having legislation in place for this scenario. The Governor signed H.B. 5176, prohibiting the disposal of MSW generated outside the US in Michigan once authorized by Congress. H.R. 5441 in the 109th Congress also aimed to discourage Canadian waste imports with provisions for inspections and fees. Senator Stabenow highlighted the need for inspections based on the Department of Homeland Security's information. The Department of Homeland Security estimates that each trash truck inspection will take four Customs agents about 4 hours, costing approximately $420 per truck. A Senate amendment required the Secretary of Homeland Security to certify the effectiveness of detecting weapons in municipal solid waste before entry into the US. Following the Stabenow and Levin amendments, Ontario agreed to stop sending waste to Michigan by 2010. Toronto's City Council approved purchasing a landfill in Ontario. Shipments of waste from Ontario to Michigan decreased in FY2007. The steps taken by Congress and Michigan legislation led to an exchange of letters with Ontario regarding waste shipment. The agreement between Michigan Senators and Ontario's Minister of the Environment only addresses a portion of the waste shipped, not eliminating the majority. Ontario committed to covering only a fraction of the waste exported to the U.S. in 2005. Ontario's commitment covers only one-third of the waste shipped to Michigan, excluding privately managed waste. The province lacks authority to prevent private waste shipments. The agreement only addresses waste sent to Michigan, not other U.S. states. The exchange of letters between Ontario and Michigan addresses only one-third of the waste being shipped, excludes privately managed waste, and does not prevent shipments to other U.S. states. It is a voluntary agreement without enforcement provisions, requiring congressional action to address remaining concerns. H.R. 518 would apply to private contracts in all 50 states, providing enforcement and clarifying that it would not burden interstate commerce. The bill acknowledges the need for consistency with international trade obligations, raising questions about how this would interact with states' authority to restrict waste imports. Opponents of H.R. 518, including the National Solid Wastes Management Association, plan to challenge its provisions in court if enacted, with a focus on reconciling waste imports."
