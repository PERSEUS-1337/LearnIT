Congressional hearings have addressed issues related to indigenous peoples, such as environmental protection and human rights. This report provides statistical information on indigenous peoples in Latin America, including populations, languages, socioeconomic data, land and natural resources, human rights, and international legal conventions. The United Nations relies on self-identification to categorize indigenous populations globally, stating that they are inheritors of unique cultures and have distinct social, cultural, economic, and political characteristics. The U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples acknowledges historic injustices faced by indigenous peoples due to colonization and dispossession. The Organization of American States' (OAS) American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples recognizes indigenous peoples as original, diverse societies with their own identities in the Americas. There are over 50 million people of indigenous descent in the Western hemisphere, with a focus on those in Latin America and the Caribbean. Indigenous peoples have argued for flexibility in defining themselves at the international level. No formal definition of indigenous peoples has been adopted in international law, with a focus on self-definition. A 2019 UN report highlighted the need for disaggregated data and progress in Latin America in including self-identification criteria in censuses. Data limitations are acknowledged, with discussions on country variations in data presentation. Latin America is home to 29-45 million indigenous people according to various studies. Official data on indigenous people in the region is not conclusive due to technical and sociological difficulties in census data collection. Unofficial estimates suggest around 50 million indigenous inhabitants in Latin America, accounting for about 10 percent of the total population. The total number of indigenous people and their share of the population are illustrated in Figure 1 based on data from different sources. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and a 2015 World Bank Report provide census projections showing increases in indigenous populations in many countries. Table 1 breaks down indigenous populations by country, while Figure 2 shows the range of estimates for indigenous population percentages. Bolivia's decrease in indigenous population is attributed to discrepancies in data collection methods between censuses. The World Bank states that discrepancies in data collection, rather than a real trend, explain the negative growth between the last two censuses. Differences in data collection across countries make estimating population increases challenging. The U.N. declared 2019 as the International Year of Indigenous Languages to raise awareness, but figures on indigenous groups and languages vary among sources. Three sources identify different numbers of indigenous groups in Latin America, with about 200 living in voluntary isolation. The World Bank's 2015 report identifies 772 indigenous groups in Latin America, with 558 indigenous languages found across 20 countries. A 2009 UNICEF report identified 551 languages, with 111 vulnerable to extinction. In 2019, SIL International reported 880 indigenous languages spoken in the region. According to sources, indigenous groups and languages vary by country. The U.S. Census Bureau reports 15,000-19,000 indigenous language speakers from Latin America in the United States. The World Bank found high poverty rates among indigenous people in Latin America, with education gaps documented. The World Bank provides statistics on access to services and opportunities for indigenous peoples in Central and South America. Graphs compare indigenous rates of access to amenities compared to the general population by country. Data includes labor and education statistics for indigenous peoples in the region. The World Bank provides statistics on access to services and opportunities for indigenous peoples in Central and South America, including data on labor, education, literacy, school attendance, unemployment, low-skill, and high-skill employment. A 2017 World Resources Institute report highlights that Indigenous Peoples and other communities may hold up to 65 percent of the world's land, with formal legal ownership of 10 percent and government-recognized management rights over an additional 8 percent. The United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean's 2014 report discusses progress and challenges in guaranteeing indigenous people's rights in Latin America. The report on people's rights in Latin America highlights the impact of booming demand for primary goods on economic growth, leading to environmental and social conflicts in indigenous territories. An estimated 350 million people depend on forests for subsistence, with 42-48 million indigenous peoples and 21-26 million forest peoples in Mexico, Central, and South America. In Latin America, deforestation is a major driver of tree cover loss, followed by shifting agriculture and other factors. The IACHR has documented the negative impacts of extraction and development activities on indigenous peoples and Afrodescendent communities. Activities in Latin America impact indigenous and Afro-descendent communities in areas rich in natural resources. International human rights mechanisms protect their rights, with countries ratifying conventions such as the International Labor Organization's Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169). The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (ADRIP) cover various topics such as self-determination, land rights, employment, education, and health. International organizations like the United Nations and the Organization of American States have mechanisms in place to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples globally. The Organization of American States established the Rapporteurship on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 1990 to advocate for indigenous rights in the Western Hemisphere. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) has been actively involved in promoting and protecting the human rights of indigenous peoples, holding hearings and tracking its work in this area. The IACHR also handles cases brought by indigenous peoples to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The curr_chunk discusses publications documenting human rights issues faced by indigenous peoples, including data gathered by UNICEF and FUNPROEIB in Latin American and Caribbean countries. It also mentions the limitations of using national censuses for gathering data on indigenous populations in the region. Additionally, the United Nations' ECLAC gathered population data from 17 Latin American countries in 2014. The ECLAC gathered population data from 17 Latin American countries using national censuses for Guaranteeing Indigenous People's Rights in Latin America. Most countries ask people to self-identify as indigenous, except Peru, which asks about speaking an indigenous language. The World Bank collected data in 16 countries in 2015, noting the controversy around defining indigenous people and the varying conditions of indigeneity. Ethnologue documents language counts for each country. The current edition of Ethnologue documents language counts for each country, distinguishing between indigenous and non-indigenous languages. Indigenous languages are defined as those originating in the country, while non-indigenous languages have been established through longstanding presence or institutional support. Only living languages are included, not extinct ones. The World Bank's Latin America and Caribbean Equity Lab provides data on poverty, access to services, education, and labor, with statistics based on self-reported ethnic identity. The World Bank uses SEDLAC for regional data harmonization efforts to increase cross-country comparability. The Inter-American Commission's Human Rights Rapporteurship provides detailed information on indigenous peoples' rights. Data on drivers of forest loss in Latin America are sourced from various studies using different methodologies. The curr_chunk discusses the organization of sources in the appendix, including those without publication dates and sources specific to Latin America. It also mentions a section on National Agencies of Indigenous Affairs."
