The \"American Dream Assistance Act of 1992\" permits penalty-free withdrawals for first-time homebuyers from individual retirement plans for qualified first-time homebuyer distributions. The \"American Dream Assistance Act of 1992\" allows penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement plans for first-time homebuyers to pay for qualified acquisition costs within 60 days. Qualified acquisition costs include expenses for acquiring, constructing, or reconstructing a residence, along with settlement, financing, and closing costs. The term 'first-time homebuyer' is defined as an individual who has not owned a principal residence in the 3-year period before acquiring the new residence. The term 'principal residence' has the same meaning as in section 1034, and 'date of acquisition' refers to the date of acquiring the residence. The term 'date of acquisition' refers to the date when a binding contract is entered into or construction of a principal residence begins. A special rule applies if there is a delay in acquiring the residence and funds are withdrawn from an individual retirement plan for this purpose. The amendments made by this section allow for funds paid or distributed for the acquisition of a residence to be deposited into an individual retirement plan without certain requirements, and this provision applies to payments and distributions after the enactment of the Act. Parent's guarantee of child's loan is not considered a gift for gift tax purposes. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 states that a parent's guarantee of a loan to their child or child's business is not considered a taxable gift. The amendment applies to guarantees made before, on, or after the enactment date of the Act."
