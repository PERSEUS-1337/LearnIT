    "content": "Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 authorizes federal grants for vocational rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities to help them prepare for and find employment. These grants are administered by the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) under the Department of Education. States and territories can establish agencies to provide customized support for individuals with disabilities, aiming to increase their opportunities for competitive employment and self-sufficiency. In FY2005, states and territories spent over $1.7 billion on vocational rehabilitation (VR) services, assisting nearly 1.4 million clients and helping 206,000 individuals with disabilities secure employment. The authorization for VR grants expired in FY2003, leading to capped appropriations by Congress. Efforts to reauthorize the VR program in the 108th and 109th Congresses did not succeed, with no action taken in the 110th Congress. The report provides an overview of the VR program, including eligibility, services provided, state plans, fund-matching requirements, authorization for grants, legislative attempts to extend authorization, allotment of funds formula, and issues highlighted in a recent GAO study. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 establishes eligibility requirements for individuals with disabilities to receive Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) services from state or territorial agencies. To be eligible, a person must have a disability that impedes employment and requires VR services to become employed, stay employed, or return to previous employment. The 112th Congress may face issues related to populations with disabilities, differences in administering VR services costs, fund-matching requirements, and the use of FY1978 allotments as a baseline. The VR program provides services to individuals with disabilities who face barriers to employment and can benefit from vocational rehabilitation services. The eligibility criteria differ from Social Security disability programs, and individuals receiving SSDI or SSI benefits are presumed eligible for VR services if they intend to pursue employment. State or territorial agencies determine eligibility for VR services based on program rules specified in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Code of Federal Regulations. If a state or territorial VR agency lacks resources to serve all eligible persons with disabilities, it must notify the RSA and implement an \"Order of Selection\" plan. This plan prioritizes individuals with the most significant disabilities for services, while others may be placed on a waiting list without a guarantee of services. Agencies have flexibility in setting up their selection system, with no strict requirements on determining significant disabilities. States and territories may implement order of selection plans to prioritize individuals with the most significant disabilities for VR services. If SSDI or SSI recipients are not deemed to have the most significant disabilities, they may be denied VR benefits and have to seek services from a private sector employment network. In FY2009, 40 out of 80 state and territorial VR agencies are operating under order of selection procedures. Georgia has the longest continuous order of selection since 1979. 18 out of 32 combined VR agencies, 16 out of 24 general VR agencies, and 6 out of 24 agencies serving the blind have orders of selection in place. By the end of FY2007, 41,224 individuals were on waiting lists for VR services due to state and territorial orders of selection. At the end of FY2007, some agencies had no waiting lists, while Tennessee had nearly 10,000 people on its list and Washington had 12,098. VR agencies offer customized services to help clients achieve employment goals through Individualized Plans for Employment (IPE). The VR agency performs an assessment of the client to create an Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) tailored to the client's needs and goals. The client has the final say on their employment goal and services provided, with assistance from the agency in making informed choices. Clients may also develop their own IPEs with external help. The Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) must be approved by the VR agency and reviewed annually. It includes the client's chosen employment outcome, VR services, timeline, service provider, progress evaluation criteria, responsibilities, supported employment needs, and post-employment services. The VR program works with individuals until their employment goals are achieved. A case is closed when the client achieves the employment outcome in their IPE, maintains it for 90 days, agrees with the counselor on its satisfaction, and is informed about post-employment services. Clients in FY2005 received VR services for an average of 26.3 days. In FY2005, clients received VR services for an average of 26.3 months. States must file a plan with the Department of Education to qualify for funding under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, outlining VR service provision and state agency responsibilities. The plan must address program goals, evaluation, cooperation with other agencies, the IPE process, and services for qualified individuals. Amendments reflecting changes in state VR policy are required, and a state plan does not need annual submission. Section 104 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 mandates certain requirements. Section 104 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires states and territories receiving VR grants to match a portion of federal funds. The federal share of VR funding is set at 78.7%, with states providing the remaining 21.3%. Congress is authorized to appropriate funds for VR grants, with a minimum annual increase based on the CPI-U. This authorization expired in FY2003. The October CPI-U report, released in November of each year, determines the appropriation for the federal fiscal year based on the previous year's appropriation adjusted by the CPI-U change. The VR appropriation authorization automatically extends if not amended by Congress, capping grants at the previous year's amount plus a percentage increase. The extension of authorization provision sets a cap on the amount Congress can appropriate to DE for VR state grants until the act is reauthorized. Appropriations are capped at the previous year's level increased by the change in the CPI-U. Funding caps went into effect with the expiration of the VR authorization at the end of FY2003 and continued through FY2010. Appropriations after FY2003 are capped at the rate of the increase in the CPI-U. The funding for the VR program has remained relatively flat over the past decade, with bills in the 108th and 109th Congresses aiming to extend authorization for appropriations for VR state grants. H.R. 1261 in the 108th Congress would have extended authorization until FY2009. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to extend the authorization for the VR program until the end of FY2011. The House and Senate passed different bills related to VR, but no conference committee was formed to resolve the differences. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to extend the VR program until FY2011, but no final version was passed. The 110th and 111th Congress did not introduce bills to extend VR appropriations. The Recovery Act provided $540 million for improving employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities. The President's FY2011 request included provisions to consolidate programs under the Rehabilitation Act to reduce duplication and improve services. Sections 8 and 110 of the Rehabilitation Act provide a formula for determining state allotments for VR. The formula for determining state allotments for Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) funds is based on three factors: the state's VR allotment in FY1978, the state's current per capita income compared to the national average, and the state's current population. This formula is used in a two-step process to calculate each state's final allotment. The allotment percentage for Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) funds is determined based on a state's per capita income compared to the national average. States with higher incomes have smaller allotment percentages. The percentage cannot be less than 33% or greater than 75%. Allotment percentages are recalculated every two years. The formula for determining VR funds allotment considers a state's per capita income compared to the national average. The Excess Amount is calculated using total appropriations for the current fiscal year and FY1978. States cannot receive less than one-third of 1% of the total appropriation or $3 million. If below this, allotments are adjusted. VR allotments in FY1978 and population directly impact current allotments. The VR funding allotment formula is influenced by states' allotments in FY1978 and their populations. States with larger allotments in FY1978 and higher populations receive more funding. There is no year-over-year hold harmless provision, so states could receive less funding in a fiscal year. In FY2008, some states saw a decrease in funding due to population changes or faster per capita income growth. The VR allotments for each state and territory for FY2009 can be found in Table B-3 in Appendix B. Section 110(b) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 mandates the RSA. Table B-3 in Appendix B shows the VR allotments for each state and territory for FY2009. Section 110(b) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires the RSA commissioner to determine if any state or territory will not fully spend its VR allotment, with the money then reallotted to states that can utilize the funds. Reallotments are made to states that did not see their original allotment increase by at least the CPI-U increase first, followed by additional reallotments according to the standard VR allotment formula. States must request a reallotment and provide matching state funds. The federal share for VR matching requirements is 78.7% and the state share is 21.3%. Money not spent can be carried over to the next fiscal year. VR allotments are based on 1978 allotments, per capita income, and population. The formula for allocating funds was found to be inequitable by the Government Accountability Office in 2009. The current formula for allocating VR funds to states and territories is inequitable due to inaccurate population estimates, differences in service costs, lack of consideration for funding ability, and using a 1978 allotment baseline. The current VR formula for distributing grants to states and territories is based on annual population estimates, which inaccurately assumes equal distribution of individuals with disabilities. This results in inequities as some states have a higher proportion of individuals with disabilities than others. For example, West Virginia has a higher percentage of working-aged adults with disabilities compared to New Mexico, despite having a slightly smaller population. Virginia's working-aged adult population has a higher percentage of individuals with disabilities compared to New Mexico. The current allocation of grants for VR services does not consider the specific sub-population of individuals with disabilities, leading to waiting lists for services in many state VR agencies. The current VR formula for vocational services fails to consider cost differences across states, leading to disparities in service provision. Over 41,000 individuals with disabilities are waiting for VR services. GAO shows that states with higher costs struggle to provide the same level of services as states with lower costs. Based on FY2008 allotments, GAO estimates disparities in VR program spending between western coastal states and southeastern coastal states. The current VR formula does not consider state ability to match federal funds, leading to some states returning funding for reallotment. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has recognized disparities in VR program spending between states due to the current formula. States return millions of federal VR funds to the Department of Education as they are unable to match allotted funds with state dollars. Since 2003, states have returned over $184 million in federal VR funds for reallotment, which is just under 1% of total federal funding for VR grants. The current funding formula uses per capita income to determine fund distribution, with states below the national average receiving a greater portion of funds. The VR allotment formula uses a state's 1978 allotment as a baseline for current and future allotments, with per capita income and population affecting a state's share of excess funds. Approximately 74% of the total VR appropriation for FY2009 is based on the excess amount, while 26% is distributed to match each state and territory's FY1978 allotment. States with lower per capita income may struggle to match additional funds allotted to them. The impact of the 1978 baseline on the VR allotment formula is analyzed by estimating each state and territory's FY2009 allotment using a modified formula. The modified allotment is calculated based on a state's share of the excess amount multiplied by the total appropriation for FY2009. States with positive differences between their actual and modified allotments benefit from the current formula, while states with negative differences do not. States with the largest population increases from 1976 to 2007 also had significant changes in their allotments. The analysis shows that states with the largest population growth from 1976 to 2007 had significant differences in their allotments due to the use of the FY1978 baseline. There is a strong negative correlation between population growth and the difference in allotments, indicating that the current VR allotment formula does not adequately account for population changes. The current VR allotment formula does not account for population changes, such as migrations to southern and western states. Advocacy groups are concerned about issues including the lack of funding increase for some states due to inflation and the formula not considering a state's success in rehabilitating clients. Increases in VR grants are meant to keep pace with inflation, but some states do not receive the necessary funding. The VR allotment formula does not guarantee yearly increases for states and territories based on CPI-U changes. In FY2009, some states received lower allotments than the previous year, while others received increases below CPI-U growth. Legislation was proposed to address this issue in the 108th and 109th Congresses. Legislation in the 108th and 109th Congresses aimed to address the issue of VR funding disparities by prioritizing states and territories that did not receive sufficient increases in their allotments. Advocacy groups like the National Rehabilitation Association and CSAVR have called for changes to ensure yearly allotments keep pace with cost of living increases, considering performance in helping clients return to competitive employment. The current allotment formula lacks this consideration, leaving the Department of Education without a solution. The Department of Education lacks a tool to encourage compliance with performance standards in the VR program. Despite the ability to withhold funding from non-compliant agencies, ED has never done so. This inability to reward successful agencies with increased funding hinders proper monitoring and management. The Senate recognized the Department of Education's inability to properly monitor and manage state VR agencies due to lack of funding. Section 421 of S. 1021 in the 109th Congress authorized incentive grants to states showing success in returning disabled individuals to work. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions noted the wide variation in performance among state VR agencies and permanently authorized the Vocational Rehabilitation Incentive Grants Program to encourage improvement. The Committee aims to use grant funds to encourage state vocational rehabilitation agencies to enhance employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost of these grants to be $13 million in 2006 and $137 million from 2006 to 2010. Efforts to reauthorize the VR program in the 108th Congress were unsuccessful. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 27, the Job Training Act of 2005, was introduced but did not pass into law. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 27, the Job Training Act of 2005, aimed to extend the authorization for the VR program through FY2011 but did not pass into law. A subsequent Senate bill, S. 1021, was incorporated into H.R. 27, but no final version was passed. Reauthorization was not considered in the 110th Congress, but possible reforms for the VR program were suggested for future consideration. The RSA lacks the ability to incentivize states to improve VR program success rates for individuals with disabilities. The Senate's reauthorization bill included grants to reward states for successful client workforce reintegration. The current formula does not consider a state's actual disabled population. The current formula for VR funding does not account for a state's disabled population or its success in returning clients to work. States with significant population growth since the 1970s have seen a reduction in VR funding due to outdated funding baselines. These concerns may be addressed in the reauthorization of the VR program in the 112th Congress. The 112th Congress may propose reauthorization of the VR program.
