    "content": "The 111th Congress is considering legislation in H.R. 1 to promote the adoption of health information technology (HIT) with provisions for privacy and security of health records. The bill allows state attorneys general to sue in federal court for HIPAA privacy violations. HIPAA was enacted in 1996 to improve health insurance coverage portability and continuity. HIPAA, enacted in 1996, aims to ensure health insurance availability, limit pre-existing condition restrictions, and establish national standards for electronic health information transmission. Part C focuses on developing a health information system to reduce administrative costs. Administrative Simplification provisions require the adoption of national standards for electronic information exchange and protection of privacy. HIPAA's Part C mandates standardized data elements, privacy protection, security safeguards, unique health identifiers, and electronic signature procedures. Non-compliance can result in civil or criminal penalties, including civil monetary penalties imposed by the Secretary for violations of Administrative Simplification provisions. The maximum civil money penalty for violations of Administrative Simplification provisions under HIPAA is $100 per violation and up to $25,000 for all violations of the same requirement in a calendar year. Procedural requirements for imposing CMPs are referenced from 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a. The Secretary must initiate a CMP action within six years of the violation and provide written notice and a hearing opportunity to the person facing the penalty. The Civil Money Penalty (CMP) process allows for a determination to be made after a hearing where the person can be represented by counsel, present witnesses, and cross-examine witnesses. Judicial review is available in the United States Court of Appeals. CMPs may not be imposed for criminal disclosure of individually identifiable information if the person did not know or could not have known about the violation, or if the failure to comply was due to reasonable cause and corrected within 30 days. The Secretary may offer technical assistance during this period, and CMPs can be reduced or waived in certain circumstances. The Civil Money Penalty (CMP) process allows for penalties to be reduced or waived if excessive relative to the compliance failure. Affirmative defenses include criminal offenses under HIPAA, lack of knowledge of the violation, and correction of non-compliance within 30 days. The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) enforces the Privacy Rule, with penalties only affecting covered entities. HIPAA establishes criminal penalties for violations related to health information, with fines and imprisonment based on the severity of the offense. Penalties only apply to covered entities, not individuals outside this category. HIPAA establishes criminal penalties for violations related to health information, with fines and imprisonment based on the severity of the offense. Penalties apply to covered entities, such as health plans, health care clearinghouses, specified health care providers, and Medicare prescription drug card. The Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel concluded that only covered entities could be criminally liable under HIPAA. The Office of Legal Counsel concluded that only covered entities specified in the statute could be criminally liable under HIPAA. Directors, officers, and employees of these entities may also be liable based on corporate criminal liability principles. Other individuals obtaining protected health information may be liable under aiding and abetting or conspiracy liability principles. Conduct violating HIPAA may also be punishable under other federal laws such as identity theft and fraudulent access of a computer. The Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the \"knowingly\" element of the offense under HIPAA requires proof of knowledge of the facts constituting the offense. The HIPAA Privacy Rule was adopted as the national standard for protecting health information, with enforcement beginning in 2003. The Office of Civil Rights in HHS enforces the Privacy Rule, while CMS enforces non-privacy HIPAA standards. The HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to specific \"covered entities\" such as health plans, clearinghouses, and providers who transmit electronic information. Medicare prescription drug sponsors were added in 2003. Business associates of covered entities are also subject to certain aspects of the Privacy Rule. It governs the use of protected health information related to an individual's health or condition. The HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to covered entities like health plans, providers, and clearinghouses. It requires written authorization for any disclosure of protected health information not for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. Disclosure is required to individuals upon request or to HHS for compliance. Authorization is not needed for 12 national priority purposes. Regulations also govern security standards under HIPAA. The HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities to maintain safeguards for electronic protected health information to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services enforce the HIPAA Security Standard, with authority to interpret, implement, and enforce the provisions, conduct compliance reviews, investigate complaints, and impose penalties for noncompliance. The HIPAA Security Rule mandates safeguards for electronic protected health information to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Covered entities must comply with the Security Rule provisions to protect against threats and ensure workforce compliance. Factors such as cost, entity size, technical infrastructure, and security capabilities are considered in implementing security measures. The HIPAA Security Rule mandates standards for administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect electronic protected health information. Covered entities must have agreements with business associates to ensure safeguards are in place and report any security incidents. The contract must authorize termination if the covered entity determines the business associate violated a material term. Covered entity not liable for violations unless they knew about the business associate's violations and failed to take corrective action. HHS published the Final Enforcement Rule on February 16, 2006, with procedural and substantive provisions applicable to all HIPAA standards. The rule went into effect on March 16, 2006. The Secretary of HHS seeks voluntary cooperation of covered entities for compliance and enforcement of administrative simplification provisions. Enforcement activities for compliance with the Privacy Rule include providing technical assistance, responding to questions, and investigating complaints. Individuals can file administrative complaints for violations with the HHS Office for Civil Rights or the covered entity. The Secretary may investigate alleged violations occurring after April 14, 2003. The Secretary may conduct compliance reviews and investigations for Privacy Rule violations. Covered entities must provide records and cooperate with investigations. If noncompliance is found, the Secretary will attempt to resolve informally, or issue written findings documenting the violation. The Secretary may issue written findings documenting noncompliance if informal resolution fails. Covered entities have 30 days to respond and can provide evidence of mitigating factors. Retaliation against complainants or those assisting in the enforcement process is prohibited. Civil monetary penalties must be imposed within six years of the violation, with three affirmative defenses available. The Enforcement Rule allows for three affirmative defenses for noncompliance: lack of knowledge, reasonable cause, and correction within 30 days. The Secretary may waive penalties if deemed excessive. A civil money penalty may be imposed if a violation of administrative simplification provisions is found, with a right to request a hearing within 90 days. The Enforcement Rule allows for three affirmative defenses for noncompliance: lack of knowledge, reasonable cause, and correction within 30 days. If the respondent fails to request a hearing, the Secretary will impose the proposed penalty or any lesser penalty permitted by law. Once a penalty becomes final, the Secretary must notify various organizations and agencies. The number of violations determines the civil penalty amount, based on the nature of the covered entity's obligation. HHS may consider aggravating or mitigating factors when determining the penalty amount. The Secretary has the authority to settle cases, compromise penalties, and refer cases to the DOJ for criminal investigation. Criminal convictions have been obtained in cases involving the improper disclosure of health information by employees of covered entities. The first case prosecuted under the HIPAA criminal statute involved a phlebotomist sentenced to 16 months in prison. A phlebotomist at a cancer center was sentenced to 16 months in prison for stealing credit card information from a patient and using it for personal gain. The defendant was charged with wrongful disclosure of health information for economic gain. In 2006, a Texas woman working in a doctor's office was convicted of selling an FBI agent's medical records for $500. She pleaded guilty to wrongfully using health information for personal gain and violating federal laws. She was sentenced to jail, home confinement, supervised release, and a criminal money penalty. The court found aggravating factors in her case. The defendant, an employee of a medical clinic, improperly obtained Medicare and patient information for over 1,100 patients, selling it to a medical claims business for profit. This led to a $7 million fraud on Medicare and $2.5 million paid to providers. The defendant was charged with conspiracy, computer fraud, wrongful disclosure of health information, and aggravated identity theft. The defendant, an employee of a medical clinic, sold Medicare and patient information to a medical claims business, resulting in a $7 million fraud on Medicare. Defendant Machado pled guilty to conspiracy, computer fraud, and identity theft charges. She testified against her co-defendant and was sentenced to 3 years probation, 6 months home confinement, and ordered to pay $2,505,883 in restitution. Co-defendant Ferrer, the business owner, was convicted of various charges by a jury. Defendant Ferrer was sentenced to 87 months in prison, 3 years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $2,505,883 in restitution for charges including conspiracy, computer fraud, wrongful disclosure of health information, and aggravated identity theft. This was the first HIPAA violation case to go to trial, with two other cases resulting in guilty pleas. The defendant, a licensed practical nurse, pleaded guilty in April 2008. From April 2003 to December 31, 2008, there were approximately 41,107 health information privacy complaints filed with HHS. Out of these, 7,729 cases were investigated and resolved, resulting in changes to privacy practices. 3,858 cases showed no violation of the Privacy Rule, while 6,054 cases remained unresolved. Compliance issues mainly involved impermissible use or disclosure of protected health information. During the period of 2003-2008, HHS investigated various compliance issues related to protected health information, including impermissible use or disclosure, lack of safeguards, and unauthorized disclosures. Private practices, hospitals, outpatient facilities, health plans, and pharmacies were the entities most commonly required to take corrective action. HHS referred over 448 cases to the DOJ for criminal investigation, with no reported civil penalties during this time. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) investigated violations of the Privacy Rule and referred cases to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for potential HIPAA Security Rule violations. Criminal convictions were obtained in four cases involving employees who improperly accessed protected health information. Concerns have been raised about underenforcement of the HIPAA Privacy Rule by HHS and DOJ, with a focus on voluntary compliance and corrective action. HIPAA Privacy Rule is enforced by HHS through voluntary compliance and corrective action. It applies to covered entities like health plans and providers who transmit electronic transactions. Not all entities maintaining health information are covered. There is no private right of action, enforcement is done publicly by HHS and DOJ. Complaints may not always violate the Privacy Rule. In 2008, HHS required a resolution agreement for the first time since the Rule was implemented in 2003. HHS required a resolution agreement from Providence Health & Services for violations of HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, involving loss of backup tapes and theft of laptops. The agreement included a $100,000 payment and implementation of a corrective action plan to safeguard patient information. CMS enforces the HIPAA Security Rule, and in 2008, the HHS inspector general audited CMS's oversight and enforcement of covered entities' HIPAA implementation. Inspector General Daniel R. Levinson found that CMS had limited oversight and enforcement of covered entities' compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule. Despite being authorized to conduct compliance reviews since 2006, CMS had not done so, relying instead on complaints to identify noncompliant entities. This lack of proactive measures meant that CMS had no effective way to ensure compliance with the Rule or protect ePHI. The inspector general recommended that CMS establish policies and procedures to address these shortcomings. The inspector general recommended that CMS establish policies and procedures for conducting HIPAA Security Rule compliance reviews of covered entities."
