    "content": "The Act titled \"Next Generation Lighting Initiative Act\" aims to encourage the development of white light emitting diodes in the United States by providing financial assistance to firms and research organizations in the lighting sector. In this Act, key terms defined include \"consortium\" as the Next Generation Lighting Initiative Consortium, \"inorganic white light emitting diode\" as a semiconducting package producing white light, \"Lighting Initiative\" as the Next Generation Lighting Initiative, \"organic white light emitting diode\" as an organic compound producing white light, and \"planning board\" as the Next Generation Lighting Initiative Planning Board. The Next Generation Lighting Initiative Planning Board is established under section 5(a) and includes definitions for \"research organization\" and \"Secretary.\" The term \"white light emitting diode\" encompasses both inorganic and organic types. The Next Generation Lighting Initiative is established under section 4. The Next Generation Lighting Initiative in the Department of Energy aims to develop white light emitting diodes by 2011 that are longer lasting, more energy-efficient, and cost-competitive compared to traditional lighting technologies. The objective is to create an inorganic white light emitting diode with an efficiency of 160 lumens per watt and a 10-year lifetime. The Lighting Initiative aims to develop an organic white light emitting diode with 100 lumens per watt efficiency, 5-year lifetime, full color spectrum illumination, coverage over flexible surfaces, and no harmful pollutants like mercury. The Lighting Initiative aims to develop an organic white light emitting diode with specific efficiency and features. SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION. The Secretary will establish a planning board called the \"Next Generation Lighting Initiative Planning Board\" to assist in developing and implementing the Lighting Initiative. The board will consist of 7 members, with 4 appointed by the Secretary and 3 nominated by the consortium. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the board will conduct a study on strategies for white light emitting diodes. The study will develop a strategy to increase energy efficiency using white light emitting diodes and identify barriers to achieve a 25 percent market penetration by 2012. The Secretary will implement the Lighting Initiative based on the planning board's recommendations. A consortium called the \"Next Generation Lighting Initiative Consortium\" will be established to conduct research on white light emitting diodes, funded by membership fees. The Lighting Initiative will be funded by membership fees and grants provided under section 6. The Lighting Initiative will be funded by membership fees and grants provided under section 6, which establishes a grant program. The Secretary will make grants for research on white light emitting diode technologies. Consortiums must meet specific requirements to be eligible for grants, including entering into an agreement and developing an annual program plan. An annual independent review of grant recipients will be conducted. The Secretary appoints committees to review technology advances and commercial applicability of grant recipients. Funds for grants are allocated annually based on clearly defined standards. The fiscal year grants allocation is based on research, development, and demonstration projects within the consortium. Non-federal cost sharing follows specific guidelines. National laboratories and federal agencies provide technical and financial assistance to firms and research organizations. Audits are conducted for accountability. The Lighting Initiative includes demonstration projects funded under the Act. An independent auditor ensures funds are used as intended. Reports are submitted annually to Congress. The Initiative is not subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation. SEC. 7. PROTECTION OF INFORMATION: Information obtained confidentially under this Act is considered trade secrets and privileged under the law.\n\nSEC. 8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: Consortium members have royalty-free rights to use intellectual property from research conducted under this Act.\n\nSEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS: $30,000,000 for 2002 and $50,000,000 annually from 2003 to 2011 are authorized for this Act. Amounts remain available until expended."
