    "content": "ATPA was established to combat the drug trade in Latin America by offering tariff benefits to certain U.S. imports from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. The program aimed to promote economic alternatives to coca production, leading to a decline in drug activity. Total coca cultivation decreased by 13% from 1992 to 2000, indicating some progress in addressing the drug issue. Coca cultivation decreased by 13% from 1992 to 2000, with significant declines in Bolivia (68%) and Peru (74%), but a large increase in Colombia (267%). The role of ATPA tariff preferences in this trend is challenging to determine, as their effects need to be isolated from other counternarcotics and economic development efforts. Studies suggest that the ATPA program had a positive, but small influence on U.S. imports from ATPA countries, with total imports growing 85% from 1990-99, but not meeting expectations and showing no relative growth compared to U.S. imports worldwide. The ATPA program had limited influence on U.S. imports from Andean countries, with only 10% of total imports receiving preferential treatment. The program did not lead to significant growth in trade due to the exclusion of major Andean products and the export sector's reliance on natural-resource based products. The ATPA program had limited impact on U.S. trade with Andean countries, as only a small percentage of imports received preferential treatment. Despite being eligible for duty-free or preferential treatment, the overall effect on trade was minimal. Colombia and Bolivia were the first beneficiaries, followed by Ecuador and Peru. U.S. exports to ATPA countries increased by 84% from 1990 to 2000, but this growth was lower than the total export growth worldwide. U.S. exports to ATPA countries declined slightly to less than 1% of total exports, with a slight increase in the mid-1990s. U.S. imports from ATPA countries rose by 105% in dollar terms from 1990 to 2000 but declined relative to total U.S. imports. The composition of U.S. imports from ATPA countries changed between 1994 and 2000, indicating potential effects of the ATPA program. During the original ATPA program, U.S. imports from eligible countries saw minimal changes in composition, with notable additions like Peru's refined copper cathode imports. Petroleum products, mainly from Colombia, remained a significant portion, while seafood and coffee imports declined. Most imports were natural-resource based or simple manufactures, many of which were not ATPA eligible, indicating a trend likely to continue regardless of ATPA reauthorization. The ATPA program did not significantly impact the composition of U.S. imports from eligible countries, with Colombia being the dominant trade partner. Despite the surge in oil prices, little trade effect was attributed to ATPA provisions. The program did not alter the overall structure of trade but may have affected the composition of ATPA imports at a sectoral level. The ATPA program did not significantly impact the composition of U.S. imports from eligible countries. Only 10% of total U.S. imports from ATPA countries were eligible exclusively for ATPA preferences. The program did not alter the overall structure of trade but may have affected the composition of ATPA imports at a sectoral level. In 1995 and 1999, duty-free imports from ATPA countries increased from 59% to 66%. However, the growth was mainly due to non-ATPA trade arrangements. The 10% of imports under ATPA preferences was a small portion of total trade, and ATPA-eligible imports did not grow faster than U.S. imports from Andean countries as a whole. Legislative action was needed for significant changes. Between 1995 and 1999, duty-free imports from ATPA countries increased from 59% to 66%. The major ATPA imports into the United States included cut flowers from Colombia, copper cathodes from Peru, precious metals from Peru, Colombian pigments, Ecuadoran non-canned tuna, and Peruvian zinc. The composition of ATPA imports changed over time, but not in predictable ways. ATPA preferences accounted for a small portion of total trade, and legislative action was required for significant changes. The composition of ATPA imports changed over time, with cut flowers decreasing from nearly 40% to 25% of total imports. Other ATPA imports like copper cathodes and pigments increased. Colombia and Peru benefitted most in 1999, with 45% and 36% of ATPA imports, respectively. The ATPA trade effects were relatively small, with a slight decrease in percentage since 1995 due to a decline in cut flower imports offset by an increase in U.S. pigment imports. Peru saw growth as the fastest exporter under ATPA, driven by its new copper cathode manufacturing industry. Ecuador accounted for 15% of ATPA imports in 1999, followed by Bolivia at 4%. Ecuador mainly imported tuna and a small amount of cut flowers, while Bolivia exported gold jewelry, its major ATPA item. There was some trade composition change at the product level to take advantage of ATPA's duty-free provisions, reflecting Andean economic diversification. Total imports eligible exclusively under ATPA remained at 10% of total U.S. imports. The evaluation of ATPA indicated marginal effects on the economies of Andean countries and the United States. Two studies assessed the trade patterns and effects on U.S. workers. While the trade effects were small, there were changes in trade composition, suggesting ATPA's contribution to this shift in some products. The ATPA program had marginal effects on the economies of Andean countries and the United States. Changes in trade composition were observed, indicating ATPA's contribution to this shift in some products. However, the program's impact was overshadowed by larger factors such as national macroeconomic policies and external shocks like El Ninos. The USITC used Bolivia and Peru as case studies to explore the effects of ATPA on economic production. Bolivia saw diversification in exports to the US, including jewelry, leather, and wood products, possibly influenced by ATPA tariff reductions. However, other factors like changes in the tax code also impacted production incentives. In Peru, there was a broader export growth, particularly in copper cathodes and agricultural products like asparagus, which benefited from ATPA. The USITC evaluated the impact of ATPA on Colombia and Ecuador. Colombia's exports to the US did not change significantly due to the dominance of petroleum, with only small benefits seen in nontraditional products like asparagus. Ecuador also had little change in export composition but saw increases in cut flowers and seafood production. The ATPA had a small overall effect on export diversification in Colombia and Ecuador, with significant increases in cutflowers and seafood production. However, the impact on coca eradication and crop substitution efforts was marginal at best, as there were many factors contributing to alternative crop production before ATPA was implemented. The ATPA program faced obstacles in implementing alternative development strategies due to the profitability of coca production, lack of infrastructure for alternative crops, and guerrilla pressure. The USITC analyzed consumer welfare gains, tariff revenue losses, and producer welfare losses. The U.S. Department of Labor focused on ATPA's impact on the domestic labor force. The program had minimal effects on U.S. imports. The ATPA program had minimal effects on the U.S. economy as only a small share of imports benefited from it. Copper cathodes, cut flowers, tuna, and gold compounds accounted for 83% of imports under ATPA. Consumer welfare gains varied, with cut flowers dominating the U.S. market. The USITC estimated that consumer welfare effects of the ATPA program were small, with cut flowers accounting for up to 75% of the U.S. market. The net welfare effects for the United States were considered small, with minimal impact on consumer benefits and potential displacement of U.S. producers. The USITC found that only cut flowers and asparagus caused displacement of over 5% of the market. Asparagus imports benefited U.S. consumers as they entered during low domestic crop production periods. Cut flower imports from Colombia had minimal impact due to U.S. growers adjusting their products. U.S. flower growers are no longer concerned with competition from Andean imports. The US Department of Labor report concluded that the overall effects of ATPA on the domestic workforce in 1998 were negligible. Only the cut flower industry showed signs of adjustment issues, with a decrease in production by 11% as ATPA imports rose. The Department of Labor report noted that ATPA imports may have contributed to a decrease in production by 11% in the cut flower industry in 1998. Workers affected by layoffs were mostly seasonal agricultural workers with low wages and living in poverty, with some being of illegal or unknown legal status. The report did not estimate the difficulty of adjustment for these workers, but suggested that the strong U.S. economy could help minimize employment dislocation. Adjustment costs for other industries from increased import competition were considered insignificant. ATPA was a small part of the larger Andean counternarcotics effort, targeting coca production by supporting alternative cash crops. Supporters argued that reduced tariffs provided financial incentives for legal crop cultivation. Testimony expressed the desire to reauthorize ATPA and expand tariff preferences to more products and countries. The ATPA program aimed to promote export diversification and economic development in the Andean region by reducing tariffs on certain products. However, its impact on U.S. imports was minimal, with only 10% of ATPA country imports entering the U.S. exclusively under ATPA provisions. This limited effect on trade was unlikely to increase without changes to the program. The ATPA program's impact on trade and Andean economies has been small, with limited effects unless program parameters are modified. Indirect evidence suggests support for economic diversification into products like copper cathodes and asparagus, but there are limits to what ATPA can achieve in reducing drug-related activity. Supporters argue for intangible policy benefits of ATPA as an expression of direct U.S. support. Supporters of ATPA argued for its policy benefits, including U.S. support for counternarcotics efforts and economic development. They proposed reauthorizing ATPA, extending duty-free treatment to other Andean exports like textiles, apparel products, and including Venezuela as a beneficiary country. ATPA expired on December 4, 2001, leading to the reimposition of U.S. tariffs. The ATPA program expired on December 4, 2001, leading to the reimposition of U.S. tariffs on Andean exports. The ATPA legislation was eventually linked to the larger debate on trade promotion authority, causing Congress to be unable to complete work on the bill before the deferral expired. The program was reauthorized in the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) in 2002. The Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (H.R. 3009) was introduced in the House by Representative Crane and Ways and Means Chairman Thomas. Hearings were held, and the bill was favorably reported and passed by the House. In the Senate, the Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act (S. 525) was introduced by Senator Graham and referred to the Committee on Finance. The Subcommittee on International Trade held hearings on H.R. 3009, which was later amended and sent to the Senate. The Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act passed the Senate as part of the Trade Act of 2002, including provisions on trade promotion authority and trade adjustment assistance. The Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) was passed into law on August 6, 2002 (P.L. 107-210) to extend and expand trade preferences to beneficiary countries in the Andean region until December 31, 2006. This was part of a broader U.S. foreign policy to counter illicit drug trafficking. The ATPDEA extends preferential treatment until December 31, 2006, covering more exports previously excluded. It provides treatment similar to the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Act and incorporates customs procedures like NAFTA. Changes include duty-free entry for selected textile and apparel articles. The ATPDEA extends preferential treatment until December 31, 2006, covering more exports previously excluded. Duty-free entry for selected textile and apparel articles has been expanded. Selected goods like footwear, tuna, petroleum products, watches, leather goods, sugars, rum, and tafia also receive duty-free treatment. The ATPDEA extends preferential treatment until December 31, 2006, covering more exports previously excluded. Duty-free entry for selected textile and apparel articles has been expanded based on various product categories differentiated by origin of fabric, yarn, and components used. Apparel articles imported from an ATPDEA beneficiary country enter duty-free if they qualify under specific categories. The ATPDEA extends preferential treatment for textile and apparel articles until December 31, 2006, based on specific categories of origin for fabric, yarn, and components used. Apparel articles qualify for duty-free entry if all dyeing, printing, and finishing of fabrics are done in the United States, or if fabrics are formed in beneficiary countries from yarns wholly formed there. The President can proclaim additional fabrics and yarns as eligible for preferential treatment. The President can proclaim additional fabrics and yarns as eligible for preferential treatment under specific conditions, including consultation with advisory committees and congressional notification. Preferential treatment for apparel articles sewn in beneficiary countries from fabrics or components knit-to-shape, starting at 2% of imports in 2002 and increasing to 5% over 4 years. Preferential treatment for apparel articles sewn in beneficiary countries from fabrics or components knit-to-shape increases to 5% over the next 4 one-year periods in equal increments. Handloomed, handmade, and folklore articles certified by the ATPDEA country in consultation with the United States are eligible. Certain other apparel articles, such as brassieres, are eligible if cut and sewn in the United States or an ATPDEA country with limitations on foreign origin findings and trimmings. The De Minimis Rule allows articles with yarns not wholly formed in the US or an ATPDEA country to be eligible for preferential treatment if the total weight of such yarns does not exceed 7% of the total weight of the good. The Special Origin Rule states that articles containing nylon filament yarn from a country with a free trade agreement with the US before January 1, 1995, are still eligible for preferential treatment. Textile luggage assembled in an ATPDEA country from fabric formed and cut in the US is also eligible. The 107th Congress reached a compromise on ATPA reauthorization to expand tariff reduction provisions for ATPA, NAFTA, and CBTPA countries. This aims to eliminate competitive disadvantages, enhance trade diversification, economic development, and counterdrug activities in the Andean region. The 107th Congress reached a compromise on ATPA reauthorization to expand tariff reduction provisions for ATPA, NAFTA, and CBTPA countries. This aims to eliminate competitive disadvantages, enhance trade diversification, economic development, and counterdrug activities in the Andean region. The beneficiary countries may not benefit equally from these incentives, with Colombia and Peru likely benefiting the most due to their significant share of U.S. apparel imports. Ecuador and Bolivia, with smaller apparel export industries, may benefit from new tariff reductions on specific products like canned tuna. The ATPA reauthorization aims to expand tariff reductions for Andean countries, benefiting major tuna exporters like Ecuador and Bolivia. U.S. apparel concerns were addressed in the debate, with apparel products accounting for a small percentage of imports. Despite this, the U.S. remains the primary market for Andean apparel, capturing 93% of the region's exports. Expanding duty-free provisions to growth industries may positively impact the program's effectiveness. The original ATPA program had two major facets. Each nation had to be designated a \"beneficiary country\" by meeting legislated standards. Beneficiary status could be denied for various reasons, including unfair nationalization of U.S. property, failure to recognize arbitral awards in favor of U.S. citizens, and not affording internationally recognized workers' rights. The Trade Act of 1974 requires beneficiary countries to meet certain conditions to receive benefits, which can be waived by the President. Eligible articles must be imported directly from a beneficiary country and contain a certain percentage of materials and processing costs from designated regions. The Trade Act of 1974 requires beneficiary countries to meet conditions for duty-free treatment in the United States. Certain products are denied duty-free treatment, and trade regulations like quotas and food-safety requirements apply. The ATPA program operates alongside the Generalized System of Preferences to promote economic development through duty-free treatment for developing country imports. The ATPA program overlaps with the Generalized System of Preferences, but Andean exporters prefer ATPA for its broader coverage, easier qualification, and longer authorization period."
