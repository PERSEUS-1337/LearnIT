    "content": "The area east of Alaska's Prudhoe Bay to the Canadian border is rich in natural resources and wildlife, known as the \"Serengeti of the Arctic.\" The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a vital habitat for various animals and holds significant oil and gas potential, which could benefit the national economy and reduce energy dependence. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) designated 8 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) as wilderness in 1980, but postponed a decision on 1.5 million acres of the coastal plain (1002 area) for oil and gas exploration. The Department of the Interior estimated a 19% chance of recovering economic quantities of oil in this area in 1987. The report recommended leasing the entire area for oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), with a high chance of recovering economic quantities of oil at 19%. Controversy surrounds the recommendation, with varying estimates of oil potential over the years. Strong support for oil development in Alaska contrasts with opposition based on concerns for wilderness values and wildlife. The decision on oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) has significant implications for U.S. energy interests, wilderness preservation, and Alaska's economy. Proponents argue that oil development would enhance national security, create jobs, and generate income for the state and Native groups. However, opponents fear it would compromise the area's wilderness values. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is a controversial area for oil exploration, with proponents arguing for economic benefits while opponents fear it would compromise wilderness values. The area is ecologically significant, protecting arctic ecosystems and remaining closed to development. Developing oil in the harsh, fragile arctic environment is expensive and risky. Oil companies and government agencies have made efforts to reduce environmental impacts, such as minimizing drill pad sizes and improving waste management. With proper investment and monitoring, energy companies could develop the 1002 area in ways that continue to reduce effects on plants and animals. The spectrum of alternatives before Congress includes finding ways to ensure oil development is compatible with the purposes of the wildlife refuge. The spectrum of alternatives before Congress for oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge includes maintaining the status quo, authorizing leasing with current regulations, or allowing leasing with special conditions like limiting surface occupancy and requiring environmental controls. Designate the coastal plain as wilderness to preserve natural values and opportunities, potentially allowing oil exploration but not guaranteeing economic development. Parts of Alaska's North Slope coastal plain hold abundant oil reserves, with potential extending from the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska past Prudhoe Bay. Drilling proponents argue for exploration to estimate the 1002 area's petroleum potential accurately. The Department of the Interior has issued assessments of oil and gas potential in ANWR based on geological data. The projected price of oil and the area open to leasing are key factors in estimating recoverable oil. The 1002 area contains significant oil reserves. The 1002 area in ANWR has promising oil potential, with estimates of 2.0 to 9.4 billion barrels recoverable. This large potential is seen as a way to offset the decline in domestic oil production, which is projected to decrease without ANWR. The potential peak output from USGS's \"low\" and \"high\" ANWR volumes of economically recoverable oil could result in a 5% and 28% rise in U.S. output, respectively. Development and production from ANWR would improve the commercial viability of currently producing North Slope fields. The potential development of ANWR could increase the appeal of oil and gas development to energy companies, especially with the possibility of large natural gas reserves. Natural gas becomes more attractive as demand grows and prices rise. Construction of a pipeline for transporting natural gas and minimizing effects on wildlife and the arctic ecosystem would be crucial considerations. The potential impacts of oil development in the ecosystem include large water and gravel requirements, displacement of land and wildlife by infrastructure like pipelines and roads, concerns for caribou migration routes and effects of pollutants. Challenges arise in establishing and enforcing controls due to mixed ownership in the area. The trend in North Slope energy development focuses on compactness, reduction of roads, centralization of facilities, and concentration of activities in winter. Industry representatives argue that the entire ANWR area can be developed with a 2,000 acre \"footprint,\" but opponents believe this would have significant impacts on the physical environment and resources of the area. The debate over the limitation of the footprint has become a major point of congressional discussion. The physical environment in the ANWR area is currently pristine and unaffected by human activity, except for Kaktovik. Exploration and development activities, such as oil field operations, would lead to air pollution, water usage for drilling, construction impacts, waste generation, and potential harm to the natural environment. The debate over the size of the development footprint is a major point of discussion in Congress. Industry in the Arctic region uses improved technology to reduce environmental impact and minimize waste. Environmental protection requirements are in place to regulate activities. Critics are concerned about routine operations, potential leaks, and lasting changes in the fragile environment. Critics argue that even careful development in the Arctic could have lasting environmental impacts. Alaska Natives own over 100,000 acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, with regulation of development on these lands being a challenge. Wildlife experts are concerned about the threats of development to special areas within the refuge. Wildlife experts are concerned about threats of development to special areas within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, including sensitive areas like Sadlerochit Spring and caribou calving grounds. Spin-off development in Kaktovik and other Native lands could also compromise environmental values. Development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, including areas like Deadhorse, Kuparuk Industrial Center, and Alpine, has led to different approaches in handling support services. Deadhorse's sprawl and contamination issues prompted a more controlled approach at Kuparuk, while Alpine reduced the need for additional support facilities and shifted operations to other sites. In the 1002 area, facility reduction and shifting needs to Native lands nearby may continue. The potential for oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's 1002 area raises questions about protecting wildlife values and the possibility of restoring the area post-development. If major reserves are found, energy companies could operate in the region for decades, leading to significant human activity for a century. There is also the potential for offshore oil fields to be developed with onshore support in ANWR. The debate over opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to energy leasing has been ongoing for decades. If Congress decides to open ANWR, rehabilitation requirements may be included to address the potential long-lasting impacts of industrial activity in the area. The recovery of animal populations and species diversity would depend on viable populations close enough to restock the area, along with explicit controls to limit future presence for the area to recover. The debate over opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to energy leasing has been ongoing for decades, with key periods of controversy in the late 1950s, 1977-1980, 1987, the early 1990s, and the current debate. The purpose of the report is to provide background information and discuss emerging approaches to development in the 1002 area of Alaska's North Slope. It does not focus on specific legislation but aims to analyze proposals for development. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska's North Slope is a diverse ecosystem with abundant wildlife, including caribou, waterfowl, wolves, polar bears, and grizzly bears. The area is also a significant oil prospect, potentially rivaling Prudhoe Bay. Congress recognized the conflicting values of conservation and development in 1980 when it expanded the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The compromise in 1980 designated part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) as wilderness, while the rest, including the coastal plain, was contested for its biological value and oil potential. The DOI was required to evaluate the oil potential and environmental impacts of 1.5 million acres in the coastal plain, known as the \"1002 area.\" Energy development in the Refuge is prohibited until Congress acts. The issue of energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has been debated since 1980, with Congressional interest sparked by fluctuating energy prices and a supportive political environment. Recent complications include fluctuating oil prices, Senate control margins, and terrorism concerns. Congressional options include postponing a decision, designating the area as permanent wilderness, permitting development under current laws, or allowing development with restrictions. Petroleum accumulations in Northern Alaska and Canada are shown in Figure 2. The debate over energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge continues, with uncertainty on whether Congress will present ANWR legislation to the President. The House passed an energy bill with ANWR development in the first session of the 108th Congress, but the Senate is excluding it from a comprehensive energy bill. Chairman Domenici has pledged to keep ANWR development out of the bill due to previous failures to include it. The ongoing debate makes this a crucial time for decision-making. The report provides background information on the debate surrounding energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). It summarizes various perspectives on economic, legal, environmental, and national energy concerns related to the decision. Congress faces challenging questions about the potential oil reserves, economic benefits, costs, and impacts on Native lands if ANWR is opened for energy development. The following chapters provide background and analysis on the questions raised regarding energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), including the role of Native lands, environmental impacts, footprint of development, restoration possibilities, and revenue sharing between federal and Alaska state governments. The curr_chunk discusses the availability of information on energy development in ANWR, including scientific reports, economic analyses, and legislative issues. It covers the geography, history, energy development issues, resources in the 1002 area, and legislative issues. A glossary is included to define key terms and acronyms. The North Slope of Alaska consists of lands north of the Brooks Range draining into the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, covering over 100,000 square miles. The western part is broad, with the Brooks Range crest up to 250 miles from the coast, while the eastern part, including part of the Refuge, is narrow with the range crest as close as 30 miles from the coast. The foothills gradually merge into the coastal plain. The North Slope of Alaska includes the coastal plain of the North Slope, which is flat with small lakes in the west and rolling topography in the east. The area is north of the Arctic Circle, characterized by darkness and extreme cold, with permafrost up to 2,000 feet thick. During summer, the tundra supports various plant life, and flat areas become wetlands. Streams and rivers freeze in winter, flood in spring, and meander in braided channels. The 1002 area has more relief, established drainage, and woody vegetation compared to wetland grasses. The North Slope of Alaska has a diverse landscape, with foothills and hilly areas making up a significant portion of the coastal plain in the ANWR. The climate in the region has been warming, leading to earlier greening of vegetation in spring and later die-back in fall. Arctic Natives have reported changes in weather patterns, increased danger in snow and ice conditions, and the appearance of insects. The history of the Refuge in northeastern Alaska began in 1956 with naturalists Olaus and Margaret Murie's visit, who reported the migrating caribou herd around the Porcupine River. The area was later protected to preserve the arctic ecosystem. The Tanana Valley Sportsmen's Association proposed the area become a national wildlife range. Major events related to energy development in northern Alaska since the 1950s are also described. The North Slope lands were withdrawn in 1943, leading to the creation of the Arctic National Wildlife Range in 1960 after Alaska's statehood. The initial segregation of lands prevented ownership passage of certain submerged lands within the Refuge. In 1980, Congress enacted the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), renaming the Arctic Range to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and expanding it by 9.2 million acres. ANILCA designated much of the original Refuge as a wilderness area but postponed decisions on the development of the coastal plain. The \"coastal plain\" was defined as specified lands on a map, excluding most Alaska Native lands. Key sections of ANILCA include the Section 1002 Study. Section 1002 of ANILCA directed a study of the \"coastal plain\" and its resources to be completed within 5 years and 9 months of enactment. The executive branch was tasked with conducting a comprehensive baseline study of the fish and wildlife resources, developing guidelines for an oil and gas exploration program, and making a recommendation on whether exploration, development, and production should proceed. The resulting \"1002 report\" recommended full development of the area for petroleum exploration. The 1002 report described the area as a significant petroleum exploration target with a 19% chance of finding economically recoverable oil. It estimated 3.2 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil, which could supply 4% of U.S. demand in 2005 and reduce imports by nearly 9%. The report projected national economic benefits of $79.4 billion and federal revenues of $38.0 billion, assuming oil prices at $33/barrel in 2000. The 1002 area is highlighted as the most biologically productive part of the Arctic Refuge for wildlife. The 1002 area in the Arctic Refuge is a significant wildlife habitat and a center for scientific study. The effects of potential development on plants and animals, especially the Porcupine Caribou Herd, were analyzed. Full leasing could lead to habitat loss for birds, fish, and polar bears, with moderate effects on polar and grizzly bears. Buffer zones around polar bear dens were recommended, and the sensitivity of snow geese to aircraft disturbance was noted. Legal Definition of the 1002 Area is defined in Section 1002 of ANILCA. The legal definition of the 1002 area in the Arctic Refuge is defined in Section 1002 of ANILCA, which includes the coastal plain. However, there is no official map from August 1980 depicting the coastal plain. The boundaries of the coastal plain exclude Native lands as of 1983. Section 1003 of ANILCA prohibits further development of energy resources in the area until Congress acts. Development of oil and gas resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is prohibited until authorized by Congress. Despite numerous development bills introduced since 1987, very few have been approved. Opposition to development has led to filibusters in the Senate, making it difficult for bills to progress. Development remains prohibited under ANILCA, with provisions following up on Alaska Native Claims. The Native village corporation of Kaktovik has rights to select and exchange lands within and outside the 1002 area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. However, all Kaktovik lands are subject to restrictions on oil and gas development. If Congress lifts the restrictions, development on Native lands could occur. Congressional interest in the energy potential of the 1002 area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has fluctuated over the years. Bills to open the area for development or designate it as wilderness have been introduced repeatedly in both the House and Senate, but rarely make it past committee review. In 1995, Congress passed a budget reconciliation bill authorizing the opening of ANWR, but it was vetoed by President Clinton. In 1995, Congress passed a budget reconciliation bill authorizing the opening of ANWR, but it was vetoed by President Clinton. Key Senate votes occurred on motions to table amendments related to ANWR development provisions. Bills were introduced in the 106th Congress regarding the designation of the northern portion of the Refuge as wilderness and opening the 1002 area to energy development. The FY2001 budget resolution included assumptions about federal revenues from ANWR leasing. In the 107th Congress, six bills were introduced regarding the future of ANWR. Four bills aimed to open the Refuge to development, while two bills sought to designate the coast as wilderness. H.R. 2436 proposed opening ANWR to exploration and development, with its provisions later incorporated into H.R. 4. A floor amendment was passed to limit some types of surface development. In the 107th Congress, an omnibus energy bill, H.R. 4, passed the House with amendments limiting surface development. Senate hearings were held on related bills, but a comprehensive energy bill lacking Refuge development provisions was offered as an amendment. Attempts to open the Refuge were filibustered, leading to the passage of S. 517 instead of H.R. 4. Conferees were unable to reconcile the two versions of the bill before it lapsed. In 1967, oil was discovered on the North Slope of Alaska at Prudhoe Bay, influencing the economics and development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). New fields have been discovered and developed in the area, but overall North Slope production has been in long term decline. The Prudhoe Bay discovery in 1967 led to the development of new oil fields on the North Slope of Alaska. Despite this, North Slope production has been declining. Various transportation options were considered, with pipeline routes ultimately being seen as the most viable option. The Prudhoe Bay discovery in 1967 led to the development of new oil fields on the North Slope of Alaska. Various transportation options were considered for the oil, including routes to the Midwest and Canada, but the chosen route was south to the port of Valdez. Proponents favored this route for its shorter length and lower cost, while opponents raised concerns about the proximity to Pacific Rim countries. Some were concerned about exporting oil due to proximity to Pacific Rim countries like Japan and Korea, as well as potential oil spills along the West Coast. Opposition to exporting North Slope oil grew in late 1973 due to domestic need during the Arab oil embargo and gasoline shortages. A compromise was reached to exempt North Slope oil from export restrictions on federal lands. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (P.L. 93-153) was signed in 1973, allowing oil exports with restrictions. Subsequent legislation further strengthened export restrictions, leading to a ban on North Slope oil exports. Market forces eventually pressured a change in the law. The grounding of the Exxon Valdez in 1989 halted development debates due to environmental damage. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 led to significant environmental damage, with 645,000 dead seabirds, 4,000 to 6,000 dead marine mammals, and $100 million in losses. Cleanup methods were criticized, and lawsuits were abundant. There is still disagreement over the impact of the spill, with some species showing long-term effects from oil accumulation. Exxon Mobil responded by stating that bird populations may have been affected. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System was completed in 1977, leading to increased oil production on the North Slope. Oil was shipped to West Coast destinations and the Gulf Coast, affecting wellhead prices. In the early and mid-1990s, California was a significant consumer of North Slope oil. In the early and mid-1990s, California was a major oil producer, with significant production onshore and offshore. Despite falling consumption, prices of crude oil in California fell below those in the rest of the US, leading to concerns from producers. Efforts to address the issue were unsuccessful until 1995. The 1994 DOE study found that exporting Alaskan crude oil would increase prices for Californian and Alaskan producers, leading to higher production in California and Alaska. This would result in higher prices for Alaskan oil if sold in Japan, stimulating additional production on the West Coast. However, exporting Alaskan oil would divert cargoes from the U.S. domestic merchant marine fleet and workforce. In 1995, after low oil prices and calm in the Mideast, export restrictions on Alaskan oil were repealed. The Clinton Administration supported this, and ANS oil exports rose to 74,000 bbl/d in 1999, representing 7% of North Slope production. Exports of ANS oil ceased voluntarily in May 2000, coinciding with the decline in North Slope oil production. This decline led to the discovery and development of other North Slope fields, increasing geological information and belief in commercial quantities of oil in the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska (NPR-A). Established in 1923 as Naval Petroleum Reserve Number 4, the 33 million acre Reserve was intended to ensure fuel availability for the Navy, but its rationale faded over time as markets showed capacity to allocate resources efficiently. In 1981, stewardship of the Reserve passed from the Navy to the Department of the Interior (DOI), and its designation was changed to National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska. Public Law 96-514 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct oil and gas leasing and development in the NPR-A. Four lease sales were held between 1981 and 1984, but none of the leases were developed and all have expired. The area has been explored and mapped by various federal government agencies from 1901 through 1998. Total Alaskan oil output fell below 1.4 million barrels per day by 1996, leading to support for exploration of NPR-A to offset the drop in royalty payments from reduced Prudhoe Bay production. In early 1997, the Department of the Interior initiated a study of potential drilling areas in a 4.6 million acre portion of the northeast part of the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska (NPR-A). The discovery of the commercially successful Alpine Field adjacent to the eastern boundary of NPR-A spurred development of a leasing proposal. On August 6, 1998, DOI released its Final Integrated Activity Plan and Environmental Impact Statement, making 4 million acres available for leasing with restrictions on surface pipelines in some areas. The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was prepared to manage the area for leasing in the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska (NPR-A). The preferred option included restrictions to balance exploration and environmental protection. A lease sale in May 1999 drew 174 bids on 3.9 million acres, totaling $105 million. Phillips Alaska Inc. and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation reported oil and gas findings in 2001. The USGS re-assessed oil and gas resources in the NPR-A in 2002, finding significantly more than previously estimated. Field studies and recent discoveries suggest a 95% chance of 5.9 billion barrels or more of recoverable crude oil, with a mean estimate of 9.3 billion barrels. Phillips resumed exploration in 2001-2002, with more lease sales anticipated in late 2002. The USGS re-assessed oil and gas resources in the NPR-A in 2002, finding significantly more than previously estimated. There is a 5% chance of 13.2 billion barrels technically recoverable, with a mean estimate of 9.3 billion barrels. At an oil price of $24 per barrel, 3.1 billion barrels would be economically recoverable. The leasing process, exploration, development, production, and reclamation are the five phases of oil development on federal lands. If economic quantities of oil are not found, only three phases would occur. The five phases of oil development on federal lands include leasing, exploration, development, production, and reclamation. Newer technologies can reduce environmental damage and costs, with legislation possibly required to ensure their use. Federal requirements may not apply to Native lands unless explicitly stated by Congress. Congress has the authority to decide on leasing the coastal plain for oil and gas drilling. The leasing phase under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 involves gathering information about federal land, deciding on specific lands to offer, and offering federal leases competitively or non-competitively. BLM solicits bids on tracts, with each decision or action influencing the next in the leasing process. The leasing process for federal lands involves offering leases competitively or non-competitively, with BLM soliciting bids on tracts. Congress may pass legislation to replace or override some leasing processes. Leasing must comply with relevant land management plans, but ANWR lacks an analogous plan. The leasing process for federal lands involves offering leases competitively or non-competitively, with BLM soliciting bids on tracts. Congress may pass legislation to replace or override some leasing processes. ANWR lacks an analogous land management plan, but public input and information are considered in the development of plans. If ANWR were opened to leasing, Congress might specify planning steps and public participation measures, potentially overriding the NEPA process. The Director of BLM may accept formal or informal nominations of lands to be leased, with companies nominating more land than necessary to conceal their intentions. In the leasing process for federal lands, companies consider factors like operating costs, oil prices, and alternative prospects. Companies with experience on the North Slope may be more interested in participating. BLM uses nominations to determine land offerings and tract sizes. In the leasing process for federal lands, companies consider factors like operating costs, oil prices, and alternative prospects. BLM uses nominations to determine land offerings and tract sizes. The agency may consider geology and previous discoveries when selecting tracts to offer over a number of years. Terms and conditions for offerings may include limits on surface occupancy, wildlife protection measures, and reclamation standards. Congress could also specify additional conditions. Congress could specify terms and conditions in legislation for opening the 1002 area to development, which would be essential for industry to understand before bidding on a lease. Leases under the Mineral Leasing Act last for 10 years and continue as long as oil and gas are being produced commercially. Oral bidding takes place at a specified location on the date of a competitive sale. Bidding for leases under the Mineral Leasing Act involves competition based on bonus bids, which can amount to millions of dollars. Payment is made upfront, even without certainty of oil presence. Leases come with conditions for obtaining approval before any surface-disturbing activities. Congress may impose additional requirements post-lease sale. Under the Mineral Leasing Act, successful bidders pay $1.50/acre in rent for the first 5 years and $2.00/acre thereafter. The initial rental payment, minimum bonus bid, and administrative fee are due at the sale, with the rest of the bonus bid required within 10 workdays. A 12.5% royalty is paid on oil sales once production begins. Leases last for 10 years unless production is ongoing, and lessees can voluntarily surrender the lease with certain conditions. This level of detail in an ANWR leasing program is uncommon in previous Congresses. The Interior Secretary is usually directed to create rules for leasing programs under development bills. In frontier areas, seismic exploration may be allowed before specific tracts are designated for energy leases. Congress may specify exploration requirements, potentially lengthening the time for lease offerings. The NPR-A has its own distinct regulations. In frontier areas like NPR-A, exploration before lease offerings can be lengthy due to distinct regulations. NEPA impact assessments can further delay lease sales, with potential modifications to requirements. Overlapping leasing and exploration phases may help expedite processes in the 1002 area. In the 1002 area, exploration phases may be shortened by reducing environmental review requirements, but there are limits to truncating the process. Current technology restricts arctic exploration to the winter season. Industry views on tract selection could lengthen the leasing process. Leasing in National Wildlife Refuges must be compatible with refuge purposes. Energy leasing in the National Wildlife Refuge System occurs in less than 10% of refuges, with virtually no instances of leasing after a compatibility determination. Congress has the power to override the compatibility test for ANWR development. The exploration phase overlaps with leasing, where industry and the government gather data on leased areas. Preliminary seismic exploration using 2-D imaging technology is common during this phase. Seismic exploration in new areas is conducted using 2-D imaging technology across frozen tundra. Rolligons are used for vibrating the surface and recording results, with a crew of 80 to 120 people. Damage is prevented by waiting for the tundra to freeze, and tractors with heavy rubber treads are used for heavier equipment. 3-D seismic technology is more precise in defining potential structures. Modern arctic exploration on the state-owned lands of the North Slope is carried out in winter, utilizing a combination of ice roads and ice pads. Each mile of ice road requires approximately one million gallons of liquid water, with a limit of transportation up to 10 miles due to the risk of freezing. Solutions to water shortages may involve using chipped ice from lakes or developing new technologies like a desalination plant and a heated pipeline. The development of new technologies for arctic exploration on the North Slope includes using a desalination plant and a heated elevated pipeline. If economic quantities of oil are found, infrastructure is built to transition from exploration to production, with employment peaking during this phase. These methods can significantly reduce the environmental impact compared to technology available in 1987. The Alpine field in the Arctic showcases the newest development technology with gravel drill pads supporting multiple wells. Heavy equipment is transported via gravel roads and winter ice roads. Access to Alpine is by aircraft only, with pipelines connecting it to other fields and TAPS for oil transportation. Significant technological advances have been made since 1987 in the development phase. Since 1987, significant technological advances have been made in the development phase, leading to more efficient drilling processes and reduced environmental impacts. Advanced drilling technologies now allow for directional, extended reach, horizontal, multilateral, and designer wells, improving the production of hydrocarbon reserves and reducing the number of wellheads. Technological advancements in drilling processes have led to reduced environmental impacts and increased efficiency. Improved drill bit technology allows for faster drilling, while less toxic drilling muds and waste management techniques minimize environmental harm. Advanced drilling technologies also enable drill pads to be located up to 7 miles away from the target, reducing the development footprint and protecting surface features. These advancements, developed largely in the 1990s, result in fewer pipelines and wellheads needed for oil extraction. Technological advancements in drilling processes have led to reduced environmental impacts and increased efficiency. Drill pads are now smaller and can accommodate more wellheads, with Alpine's 2 drill pads being 36 acres and 10 acres. If the Prudhoe Bay oilfield had used this technology, only 4,000 acres would be needed instead of the current 12,000 acres. Production facilities are scattered in a network over producing fields, with pipelines carrying oil to a collection line. The development phase at Alpine involves transporting heavy equipment to a staging area near the drill site, utilizing ice roads for equipment movement, and constructing gravel pads. Gravel roads may link pads within the same field, reducing the overall road mileage in the 1002 area compared to previous expectations. Ice roads may lead to high water demands if the staging area is located far from water sources. Heavy reliance on ice roads could lead to high water demands if the staging area is far from water sources. Alternative options include locating staging areas farther east, off-loading barged equipment at Kaktovik, developing new technologies to reduce water demands, or using gravel roads on Native lands for heavy equipment transport. Feasibility of these options depends on Congress regulations on development in Native lands. The footprint of development infrastructure in arctic energy development includes gravel drill pads, runways, roads, elevated pipelines, gravel mines, ports, water impoundments, and water treatment facilities. Arctic Power estimates a maximum footprint of 2,000 acres in the 1.5 million acre 1002 area. Arctic Power estimates a maximum footprint of 2,000 acres in the 1.5 million acre 1002 area for development infrastructure. Full development would require strategic placement of pads, connector roads, and pipeline supports scattered in a network across the area. Arctic Power estimates a 2,000-acre footprint limit for development infrastructure in the 1.5 million acre 1002 area. This limit may not hinder full development, even with additional features like gravel mines, water treatment plants, and causeways. If necessary, facilities could be modified, economic prospects might be missed, or the footprint limitation could be adjusted. In the production phase, drilling equipment would be removed, and small buildings housing oil pumps would be installed and connected to pipelines. Fewer employees are needed during this phase, and production facilities consist of drilling equipment, central processing facilities, access roads, and gravel mines. In the event of discovering commercial quantities of oil in ANWR, advanced production facilities would be used to minimize environmental impact. Permanent drill sites would be constructed using gravel or recycled cuttings, and compact factory-manufactured production facilities would be transported to the site. Multilateral wells might be utilized in restricted spaces, and through-tubing rotary drilled wells could extend the life of reservoirs. The Alpine development on the North Slope uses advanced technologies to extend reservoir life and reduce environmental impact. Unmanned production facilities are utilized in remote areas, minimizing the need for support facilities. The total development is permitted at 98.4 acres, including a large drill pad, satellite pad, airstrip, and connector road. During the reclamation phase, lessees must remove traces of their activities to specified standards. The curr_chunk discusses the potential need for reclamation provisions in the 1002 area if oil production occurs, with suggestions for companies to post bonds for financial resources. It also mentions the long-lasting industrial activity and the slow disappearance of human intrusion in the environment even with the best available technologies. The removal of infrastructure like gravel pads, roads, and pipelines would occur as production declines. New developments in oil and gas field operations have reduced the size of facilities. Reclamation after energy production ceases may be less demanding due to modern technology. Improved information on the biological and geological resources of the 1002 area has been gathered over 40 years of debate. The report will discuss potential effects of development on Alaska Natives, the economy, and the Refuge driven by potential energy resources. The ANWR question revolves around potential energy resources, particularly oil in the 1002 area of Alaska's North Slope. The region has proven abundant in oil reserves, with the potential for further discoveries. This has drawn attention due to the decline in U.S. oil production, increasing petroleum consumption, and growing oil imports. The focus on energy issues was heightened in 2001 by rising gasoline prices and California's electric power problems. The 1002 area of Alaska's North Slope has promising undrilled onshore geologic structures with petroleum potential. Estimates of ANWR oil potential depend on limited data, assumptions about geology, and economics. New geological data and reinterpretation of old information have changed estimates of ANWR's oil potential. The projected price of oil also affects resource and recovery estimates. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in 1987 assumed a steady increase in oil prices for decades, but in reality, prices have not met those assumptions until recently. Falling production costs due to technological advancements have made previously unprofitable structures profitable on the North Slope. Three major studies from 1991 and 1995 reviewed ANWR's recoverable petroleum resources, cautioning about comparisons due to changes in methods and assumptions. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) revised its estimates for the economic success of developing oil fields in ANWR based on seismic data and new technology. The probability of economic success increased from 19% to 46%, with the smallest economically viable field size reduced to 400 million barrels. The US Geological Survey (USGS) also revised estimates in 1995, incorporating new geologic studies and data from the Tenneco Aurora well. The USGS revised estimates of oil reserves in the 1002 area to between 148 million and 5.15 billion barrels in a 1998 study based on new data and seismic data collected in the Refuge in 1984-1985. The study assumes the discovery of at least one commercial-size field. According to the USGS, there is a high probability (95%) of at least 11.6 billion barrels of oil in the 1002 area, with a small chance (5%) of 31.52 billion barrels. In terms of recoverability, there is a 95% chance of 4.25 billion barrels or more being technically recoverable, with a 5% chance of 11.80 billion barrels or more being recoverable. The USGS estimates a high probability of at least 11.6 billion barrels of oil in the 1002 area, with a small chance of 31.52 billion barrels. Natural gas is also likely present. Cost plays a significant role in extraction profitability, with higher crude oil prices increasing economically recoverable amounts. At $24/barrel, there is a 95% chance of 2.03 billion barrels being technically recoverable. The USGS estimated a 95% chance of recovering 2.03 billion barrels or more at $24/barrel in 1996 dollars, with a 5% chance of 9.37 billion barrels or more. Oil prices ranged from $11.35 to $34.34 per barrel in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The decision to bid for a lease considers various factors, including projected oil prices and exploration costs. Each bidder conducts its own analysis of economic and physical factors. Developers may be interested in bidding on ANWR leases due to geological evidence of recoverable oil and gas. Factors like oil prices, geologic characteristics, cash flow, and transportation constraints would impact development rates and production levels. The EIA estimated production schedules associated with different volumes of recoverable resources at two development rates, with a production peak expected 15 to 20 years after development begins. The production peak for ANWR leases is estimated to occur 15 to 20 years after development starts, with maximum daily rates of roughly 0.00015% of the resource. Slower development rates would peak about 25 years after development begins at a daily rate of roughly 0.000105% of the resource. Oil and gas discoveries were made at various locations in the area. Oil and gas discoveries were made at Kuvlum, Badami, and Sourdough, with gas found at Kavik and Kemik, and Point Thomson showing gas condensate and oil. The peak production level in ANWR could range from 200,000 to 1,400,000 barrels per day depending on the size of the discovery. Production levels are based on the assumption that oil prices remain high enough to justify continued development and production. The economically recoverable oil volumes in ANWR are based on market prices of $18, $24, and $30 per barrel. Production rates could range from 550,000 to 775,000 bbl/day. Natural gas potential in the area is also significant. The proven gas reserves in the Prudhoe Bay area may increase the appeal of oil and gas development in ANWR. The Alaska Department of Natural Resources estimated the original recoverable gas reserves of Prudhoe Bay at 30.5 trillion cubic feet, with current overall North Slope reserves at 30.9 tcf. The Energy Information Administration has omitted about 80% of ANS gas volumes as proved reserves since 1988 due to the lack of a market or pipeline for commercial recovery. The Energy Information Administration estimates that Alaska's proved natural gas reserves totaled 9.7 tcf at the beginning of 2000. Most of the gas produced on the North Slope is reinjected into the ground by oil field operators, with only a small portion used for lease operations, power generation, and oil flow through pipelines. Additionally, there is an estimated amount of natural gas in the 1002 area, although not as much as in the rest of the North Slope. The USGS 1998 assessment of ANWR gas resources estimated a 5% chance of 10.02 tcf or more of technically recoverable gas. The USGS estimated a 5% chance of 10.02 tcf or more of technically recoverable gas in the 1002 area, with a mean expected amount of 3.48 tcf. Non-associated gas would not be targeted until after oil field infrastructure was in place. Source: U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Geological Survey. The Oil and Gas Potential of Arctic National Refuge: 1002 Area, Alaska. U.S.G.S. Open File Report 98-34. The USGS estimated natural gas liquids extractable from technically recoverable gas in mean amounts of 143 million barrels from oil fields and 112 million barrels from gas fields. The mean amounts of natural gas liquids economically recoverable at different price points would be 10 million, 70 million, and 100 million barrels. Estimates of economically recoverable natural gas in the 1002 area are not possible due to lack of transportation infrastructure. Significant amounts of oil are believed to be under Native lands and state waters adjacent to ANWR, with estimates of 1.5 to 4.2 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil. The USGS also estimated economically recoverable oil in the non-federal 1002 area, with a mean estimate of 2.4 billion barrels. Access to Federal land is crucial for developing these resources. Alaska Natives have differing opinions on oil drilling in ANWR, which could pose legal challenges for refuge management. The construction of a natural gas pipeline from the North Slope could benefit Prudhoe Bay economically by transporting gas to markets. Recent increases in natural gas prices have made pipeline construction more feasible. Recent increases in natural gas prices have made the construction of a pipeline from the North Slope more feasible. Economic growth, environmental regulations, and advancements in gas-to-liquid technology have increased demand for natural gas. Serious consideration is being given to building a means of transporting gas from the North Slope to markets, with several route options being considered. One potential route is a pipeline that would parallel the existing TAPS from the North Slope to Fairbanks, then veer eastward along the Alaska Highway through the Yukon Territory, northern British Columbia, and into Alberta. The Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS) was approved in the 1970s by the US and Canadian governments. Phase I of the pipeline, completed in the early 1980s, delivers one-third of Canada's gas exports to the US. The TransAlaska Gas System (TAGS) is another proposed pipeline to transport gas to Asian markets. The Northern Gas Pipeline Project would run eastward from Prudhoe. The Northern Gas Pipeline Project would run eastward from Prudhoe Bay buried under the Beaufort Sea and come ashore in the Mackenzie Delta, linking with a pipeline running through the Mackenzie Valley into northern Alberta or the Yukon Territory. The estimated cost for an overland pipeline route is $100,000 per diameter-inch-mile, while an offshore pipeline route would cost $150,000 per diameter-inch-mile. The proposed northern pipeline route would be shorter but may face technical and environmental risks due to its underwater nature. The economic viability of a natural gas pipeline in Alaska is uncertain due to insufficient profit potential and risks. Advances in technology could provide another transportation option through a gas-to-liquids process, converting natural gas into a liquid for easier transportation. This process could eliminate the need for a separate gas pipeline. Alaska has legislation banning a gas pipeline in northern state waters, preferring a southern route for economic benefits and access to new gas supplies. The state sees more advantages in construction within Alaska despite potential higher royalties from a shorter northern route. A Canadian route could serve new Canadian gas fields. The Canadian government supports a natural gas pipeline from Alaska through Canada, with no preference for a specific route. Prime Minister Chr\u00e9tien aims to sell more oil and gas to meet U.S. energy needs, potentially conflicting with Alaska's interests. The Canadian government has concerns about price supports for the development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) potentially affecting Canadian natural gas sales to the United States. Critics fear that price supports could flood western Canada with cheap natural gas, impacting the region's own production. Some also argue that price supports could violate NAFTA and distort the natural gas market. Oil and gas development in ANWR would stimulate mining, construction, manufacturing, and transportation activities, as well as other support services. The economy would be impacted by changes in oil prices and the amount spent on imported oil. The key factor is the amount of economically recoverable oil discovered and produced. The USGS estimates show a wide range of oil field sizes with high degrees of uncertainty. Oil companies would select prospects based on their own interpretation of geologic data, resource assessment, and financial criteria. Smaller fields may become attractive after larger fields are developed. The potential discovery of commercial oil fields in ANWR could vary in size, leading to a wide range of economically recoverable oil quantities. Advances in arctic oil and gas technology have made development more capital-intensive and reduced development costs per barrel. Estimating the cost of developing ANWR is hypothetical, but the roughly $1 billion cost of developing the Alpine field with 430 million barrels of reserves can serve as a benchmark. The cost of developing the Alpine field is around $1 billion, with 430 million barrels of reserves. Alpine is a recently developed field on the North Slope of Alaska using advanced arctic technologies. It can serve as a cost benchmark for potential oil discoveries in ANWR, with hypothetical cases of economically recoverable oil quantities outlined. The potential development costs for economically recoverable oil discoveries in ANWR are estimated to be around $6.5 billion for a 2.40-billion-bbl discovery and $14.0 billion for a 5.24-billion-bbl discovery. These estimates, at roughly $2.70 per barrel discovered, may be lower than recent onshore finding costs of about $5.25 per barrel. The costs of oil production in ANWR have been decreasing over time. An increase in production would lead to a price decline, depending on world oil output and the reaction of other suppliers. Peak production from economically recoverable volumes is estimated to range from 300,000 to 1,400,000 bbl per day. ANWR production would account for about 0.3% to 0.9% of world output around 2013-2015. Opponents argue that ANWR resources could meet U.S. daily oil demand. The potential resources in ANWR are equivalent to U.S. daily oil demand for just months. The impact of ANWR production on world oil prices would depend on market and political factors. Despite oil shocks in the past, the last thirty years have been characterized by price and supply stability, with occasional episodes of volatility. Additional refined product in regional markets during these episodes could have eased prices. The potential impact of ANWR production on world oil prices depends on market and political factors. Additional supply from ANWR could help contain short-term price spikes in certain regional markets. However, in times of stability and balance in supply and demand, the effect on prices would likely be minimal. OPEC and other producers could adjust their output to offset the supply impact of ANWR. OPEC and other producers could cut output to offset the supply effect of ANWR, as seen in the past. This would depend on OPEC's commitment to support oil prices by reducing production. Macroeconomic effects of lower energy prices would boost business inputs, increase household purchasing power, and stimulate economic growth. Additional oil supply from non-OPEC producers complicates OPEC's ability to influence prices. After adjusting to lower prices, growth would return to previous levels at a higher output level. The impact of energy cost changes on the economy has decreased since the 1970s and 1980s oil price spikes. Energy costs as a share of GDP have declined, making the effects of energy price changes on the economy and sectors smaller than before. Significant and sustained price increases would be needed for noticeable macroeconomic effects. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated that a $10 increase in oil prices would lower U.S. GDP by 0.2% one to two years after the shock. The impact of a potential increase in world oil supply from ANWR production would likely be small, with potential harm to oil and gas producers and their local economies if prices decline. Producers could experience revenue declines, leading to cutbacks in employment and purchases of goods and services. Hypothetical outlays for ANWR development are estimated at $6.5 billion to $14.0 billion. Hypothetical outlays for ANWR development are estimated at $6.5 billion to $14.0 billion, with potential impacts on GDP and employment. The economy's full employment status and oil industry capacity would affect the multiplier effect and job creation. The potential impacts of ANWR development on GDP and employment depend on factors like full employment status and oil industry capacity. Rough estimates suggest that $6.5 billion to $14.0 billion in outlays could generate around 60,000 to 130,000 jobs. However, if the economy is at full employment, investment in ANWR may crowd out other spending. Investment in ANWR may crowd out other spending in the economy and draw oil industry resources from other parts of the country, potentially leading to job losses elsewhere. The impact of ANWR oil on world oil prices is uncertain, and any decrease would need to be significant and sustained for noticeable macroeconomic effects on employment. Job gains from lower oil prices may be offset by harm to oil producers in the US reducing operations and workforce. The development of ANWR could potentially result in a gain of over 700,000 jobs in the economy, based on a 1990 report by The WEFA Group. This estimate includes both direct and indirect effects, with a significant portion of the job gain attributed to lower world oil prices resulting from increased oil supply from ANWR. The study's estimates of economic impact and employment gains are considered large compared to actual consequences of oil price changes and the decreasing importance of energy inputs in the economy. The WEFA Group study estimated that the development of ANWR could lead to over 700,000 job gains in the economy, with a significant portion attributed to lower world oil prices. A report by Dean Baker re-evaluated the employment effects, noting that the study tended to select optimistic scenarios and made assumptions about market and OPEC responses to ANWR oil. The CEPR report estimated that oil production in ANWR could create 46,300 jobs. ANWR oil would reduce net imports by one barrel for every barrel produced, leading to a temporary benefit for the economy by cutting the oil import bill. The development and production of oil in ANWR could impact the Alaskan economy significantly. It is estimated that oil production in ANWR could create 46,300 jobs and reduce the oil import bill by $2.4 billion, improving the U.S. merchandise trade balance in the short run. However, the dollar may appreciate due to reduced dollars flowing abroad, potentially leading to a reversal of the initial improvement in trade balance. Additionally, increased economic activity from lower oil prices could result in a greater demand for imports of other goods and services. Ultimately, the trade deficit reflects the borrowing desires of Americans versus the investment desires of foreigners, and the development of ANWR is unlikely to have a permanent effect on the trade balance. The development and production of oil in ANWR could significantly impact the Alaskan economy through direct and indirect effects on various industries. Oil and gas production is already a major industry in Alaska, creating jobs and contributing to the state's gross product. ANWR development would primarily affect the oil and gas industry, as well as construction, telecommunications, manufacturing, transportation, and other mining sectors. Various supply and support services would also benefit from the industry's growth. The impact of the gas industry on Alaska is substantial, with indirect employment impacts being six times greater than direct employment in the industry. The outlays for exploration and production would benefit Alaska more than other states, but equipment would be manufactured in both Alaska and the lower 48 states. Hypothetical outlays for wells and facilities would amount to $3.25 billion and $7.0 billion, with adjustments for price increases since 1992. The impact of the gas industry on Alaska is substantial, with indirect employment impacts being six times greater than direct employment in the industry. Hypothetical outlays for oil and gas development since 1992 could lead to 30,000 and 65,000 jobs in the United States, with higher wages in Alaska potentially resulting in fewer jobs per billion dollars of outlays. Advances in technology and facilities since 1990 may also reduce the number of jobs generated. ANWR energy development could potentially reduce Alaskan unemployment if there is slack in the economy, but job gains could be temporary if the economy is at full employment. The potential job gains from ANWR development may be temporary and could come at the expense of jobs lost in other sectors. Alaskan citizens could benefit financially from ANWR development through revenues from royalties and bonuses, with the state's Permanent Fund distributing annual payments to residents. The interest in oil exploration in ANWR was partly driven by rising retail prices for petroleum products and California's power problems. However, any benefits from oil and gas development in ANWR would not address California's specific power difficulties. The increase in gasoline, diesel, and home heating oil prices was due to limited refining capacity and a fragile petroleum supply infrastructure. Testimony at a House hearing in 1959 highlighted the importance of protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Range for wildlife preservation. The proposed range in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a major habitat for Arctic caribou and migratory waterfowl. It is the only place in the United States where polar bear dens are found. The area is important for wildlife preservation and is the most biologically productive part of the refuge. The 1002 area in the Arctic Refuge is a vital habitat for wildlife, with species like caribou, polar bears, musk oxen, and migratory birds. The area's biological value lies in its intense productivity during the short Arctic summer, attracting many species. Comparisons with developed areas caution that the effects of development on wildlife must be carefully considered. The 1002 area in the Arctic Refuge is a crucial habitat for wildlife, including caribou. Development in this area would be different from other areas due to its narrowness. Changes in climate have already affected vegetation patterns, and animal life is expected to respond accordingly. The Porcupine caribou herd has decreased in numbers, and their habitat is in central Alaska and northwestern Canada. The Porcupine caribou herd winters south of the Brooks Range in central Alaska and northwestern Canada, with their winter range centered on the Porcupine River. In the spring, the males and yearlings migrate north first, followed by the cows, who move north with the retreating snow line to give birth in the 1002 area. Snowfall and cool springs can delay the cows, causing them to drop their calves short of the 1002 area. In some years, caribou cows in the 1002 area fail to calve due to heavy snowfall or cool spring temperatures delaying migration. Newborn calves face risks from river crossings and predators like golden eagles, wolves, and grizzlies. Radio collared cows in 2000 had low calf survival rates. Despite delays, cows continue to forage in the 1002 area where they face health issues from mosquitos, bot flies, and warble flies. Caribou in the 1002 area face health issues from mosquitos, bot flies, and warble flies. Flies deposit eggs in nasal passages or wounds, causing breathing restrictions and weakness in severely infested animals. Herds may panic and seek relief in areas with fewer flies. Mosquitos are deterred by cool, windy, humid conditions, leading caribou to congregate near the coast for relief. Bot and warble flies prefer warmer temperatures and become active later in the summer. After calving, caribou in the 1002 area move to the coast to escape mosquitos. As fly populations increase, they may return inland where conditions are less favorable for flies. Access to insect-relief habitat and forage during this period is crucial for herd productivity. The effects of exploration and development in the area on caribou remain uncertain until such events occur. Debate surrounds the potential displacement of the herd from their preferred calving and coastal areas needed for relief from insects. The primary concerns regarding the effects of development on caribou herds in the Arctic include potential displacement from calving and coastal areas needed for relief from insects. Debate surrounds the comparison of effects on the Central Arctic Herd (CAH) and the Porcupine Caribou Herd (PCH), with considerations for their size, calving areas, and migration patterns. The question of whether caribou would be displaced from calving in the 1002 area is divided into two parts: the likelihood of displacement and the potential harmful effects on calving success. The Central Arctic Herd (CAH) has grown significantly since development began, from 5,000 to about 27,000. While adult males habituate to disturbances and seek out gravel pads and roads to avoid insect attacks, studies show that cows have shifted their calving southward, away from the development area. The greatest impacts are attributed to the initial construction of roads and facilities, leading to avoidance behaviors that exceed the physical footprint of the oilfield. The Central Arctic Herd has grown significantly since development began, with adult males habituating to disturbances. Cows have shifted their calving southward to avoid the development area, with displacement of cows and yearlings likely. Scientists are examining reproductive success in different areas to determine the importance of the preferred calving area. In the 1002 area, cows displaced southward for calving may face more predators like golden eagles, grizzly bears, and wolves. Calving in Canada leads to a diet of mosses and evergreens, impacting calf survival. Displacement from nutritious forage areas is rare but could reduce fecundity if it becomes common. Smaller drill pads and directional drilling could help reduce displacement. USGS scientists used field data on caribou displacement to analyze five possible development scenarios in the 1002 area. They examined hypothetical outcomes of cow distribution from 1980 to 1995 under different levels of development, considering the impact on calf survival. The USGS scientists analyzed caribou displacement data to predict the impact of development on calf survival in the 1002 area. They found that full development would lead to a substantial reduction in calf survival during June. The potential conflict with development is more significant early in the calving season due to the aversion of cows with young calves to developed areas. Blocking access to the coast could exacerbate this conflict. Later in the season, blocking access to breezes along the coast could also impact caribou displacement. The potential conflict with development in the 1002 area is more significant early in the calving season as cows with calves tend to avoid developed areas. Blocking access to the coast could worsen this conflict. Later, when bot and warblefly populations peak and calves are older, cows with calves are likely to move inland. Studies show that gravel drill pads may provide fly relief to caribou, but the benefit is marginal as the herd tends to leave the area before fly populations peak. Polar bears also attract attention in the ANWR debate. The Beaufort Sea polar bear population is estimated at 2000-2500 bears, primarily feeding on seals. Female bears give birth every three years, with one to three cubs. They spend most of their adult lives at sea on the ice. Researchers have found that female polar bears are sensitive to disturbance and will abandon their dens and cubs if disturbed. The Refuge has the highest density of onshore dens along the Alaskan coast. The Beaufort Sea polar bear population is estimated at 2000-2500 bears, primarily feeding on seals. Female bears are sensitive to disturbance and will abandon their dens and cubs if disturbed. Industry activities may disrupt denning bears, especially with the use of 3-D seismic exploration. Recent studies suggest that denning polar bears may not be significantly disturbed by human activities, with certain dens exposed to high levels of activity showing no reduction in productivity. Potential conflicts include bears being inhibited from coming ashore for denning, habituation to human presence, and the resulting risk to human life. Protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, polar bears are hunted relatively infrequently in Alaska for subsistence, but some may lose their fear of humans. Increased human presence in the 1002 area due to development could lead to more conflicts with scavenging bears. Polar bears are currently attracted to the Kaktovik area, especially when whale carcasses are present. The FLEIS recommended buffer zones around polar bear dens to prevent abandonment, with actions like relocating problem bears or humane killing as last resorts. Musk oxen were reintroduced to the area in the 1960s, with a population peak in 1986 surviving harsh winters in riparian habitats. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game permits limited hunting of bulls in the 1002 area, which is a preferred habitat for musk oxen. The high demand for water could lead to conflicts with the needs of musk oxen, especially if riparian areas are heavily mined or altered. The extreme metabolic slowdown of musk oxen during harsh winters could be threatened by frequent disturbances, but this can be mitigated by tracking herds with radio collars. Various bird species nest and forage in the 1002 area, benefiting from the abundance of insect life and rapid plant growth in the short summer. Various bird species, including popular game species like snow geese and Canada geese, breed and fatten for migration in the Refuge. A variety of shorebirds also frequent the area, with population data mainly coming from studies near Prudhoe Bay. Among shorebirds, only dunlin have shown long-term declines, possibly due to losses in their wintering habitat in east Asia. The spectacled eider and Steller's eider are rare bird species in the ANWR, with the former listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Reasons for their decline include lead poisoning, hunting, and increased predation near human development and garbage dumps. The decline of the spectacled eider and Steller's eider in the ANWR is attributed to various factors such as lead poisoning, hunting, and increased predation near human development and garbage dumps. Potential energy development in the 1002 area may lead to more aircraft activity, particularly affecting snow geese due to their sensitivity to overflights. Mitigation measures include careful facility siting and controls on surface activities, air transportation, and hunting. The potential impact of energy development in the ANWR's 1002 area includes increased aircraft activity, which could affect snow geese due to their sensitivity to overflights. Mitigation measures may involve careful facility siting and controls on air traffic, with concerns also raised about the protection of eiders and other species like Arctic fox and brown bears due to increased scavenging. Special Areas in the ANWR, if opened by Congress, could receive special protections. Sadlerochit Spring is a key area with exceptional ecological value, providing wintering habitat for various species. Native allotments in the area may complicate development efforts. The Sadlerochit area contains individual Native allotments that could complicate preservation efforts. The Kongakut River flows through the 1002 area into the Beaufort Lagoon, known for its unique offshore ecosystem and rare trees. The Angun Plains in the eastern part of the 1002 area showcase evidence of Pleistocene glaciation. The Jago River drainage, nominated as an \"Ecological Reserve,\" flows from the Brooks Range into the 1002 area and contains diverse vegetation types. The drainage in the 1002 area contains a variety of tundra and flood-plain vegetation types, providing habitat for Arctic Slope wildlife species. Potential impacts of exploration and development on biological resources have been a focus, but there will also be impacts on the physical environment - land, air, and water - due to construction and human habitation. The area is currently pristine and unaffected by human activity, with permafrost being a dominant physical characteristic. Permafrost is the dominant physical characteristic in the North Slope, starting between 1 and 2 feet below the surface and impeding drainage. Special construction techniques are needed to protect the fragile permafrost. Exploration and development activities will alter the environment, resulting in air pollution emissions, water usage for drilling, gravel mining, and impacts from both mining and gravel use. The mining and use of gravel in the North Slope will generate various waste streams, including industrial and domestic wastes. Companies in the industry believe that the 1002 area can be explored and developed in an environmentally sensitive manner by using improved technology to reduce the environmental footprint and minimize habitat loss and contamination. Environmental protection requirements are also in place to ensure proper waste disposal. Critics are concerned about the effects of routine operations in the fragile 1002 environment, leaks and spills of contaminating substances, and the inclusion of adequate safeguards in legislative proposals. Air quality in ANWR meets National Ambient Air Quality Standards and is regulated under the Clean Air Act. The Prevention of Significant Deterioration program requires review and permitting of major pollution sources. Oil field operations in Alaska generate significant air pollution, with the North Slope complex emitting an estimated 63,786 tons of pollution per year, mainly nitrogen oxides. Despite these emissions, air quality in the region meets National Ambient Air Quality Standards and is regulated under the Clean Air Act. Despite emissions from oil field operations in Alaska, air quality on the North Slope, including ANWR, meets National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Nitrogen dioxide concentrations in Prudhoe Bay were 70-90% below NAAQS from 1996-2000. Potential emissions from ANWR sources were discussed in a 1987 report, predicting minor air quality impacts from full leasing and development. Impacts on the 1002 area are uncertain without further exploratory activity. Facilities in the 1002 area would be subject to the Clean Air Act's Prevention of Significant Deterioration rules to protect air quality. The nitrogen oxide increment is expected to pose a challenge to development in this area. The PSD program determines the amount of air quality degradation allowed based on the type of area affected by emissions. The 1002 area in ANWR is not a Class I wilderness area, so facilities there can increase NOx concentrations by 25 g/m3, posing challenges for development. The EPA established PSD increments for nitrogen oxides in 1988, noting their potential impact. The EPA noted in 1988 the potential impact of increased NOx concentrations in the North Slope, specifically at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Emissions from full development of ANWR may exceed allowed levels without additional pollution control measures. State permitting agencies determine Best Available Control Technology on a case-by-case basis to address environmental impacts. Arctic Haze is a concern related to ANWR development, with persistent haze in late winter and early spring caused by suspended particles originating from Europe and the former Soviet Union. The stable air masses in the arctic allow the particles to spread thousands of miles from their point of origin. Arctic haze has declined by 50% since the 1980s due to the closure of heavily emitting industrial facilities in Eastern Europe and Russia. Water resources and wetlands are a concern for potential oil exploration in the 1002 area due to limited free water availability. The 1002 area in the Arctic refuge has limited free water, with most lakes being shallow and freezing solid in winter. Rivers and streams are also shallow, draining to the coast. 99% of the area is classified as wetlands, with a watertable near the surface or covered by shallow water. Arctic wetlands differ from those in the Lower 48 states. In the Arctic area, wetlands are different from those in the Lower 48 states due to the presence of permafrost, which hinders drainage and prevents typical wetland processes. However, the thin surface layer above the frozen layer supports life processes like freezing and thawing cycles, biological activity, and plant growth. Plant species in the area include sedges, grasses, shrubs, and dwarf trees, with cyclical water availability throughout the year. In the Arctic area, water availability is cyclical throughout the year. In spring, rapid snowmelt causes rivers to run full and leads to extensive flooding. Turbidity impairs water quality. Summer and fall bring rain and potential flooding. By fall freezeup, low water supply conditions prevail, with most rivers drying up or freezing. Water quality in the 1002 area is currently unaffected by human activity, presumed to be pristine like most of Alaska's watersheds due to lack of monitoring. The 1002 area in Alaska is considered to be in relatively pristine condition due to its sparse population and remoteness. The water beneath the permafrost is likely brackish. Oil exploration and development in the area could have major adverse effects, with estimates of significant water usage for various operations. Despite improvements in technology, water requirements remain high for oil and gas operations in the Arctic. In the Arctic, water supply needs for gas operations are met by using ice as construction material for temporary roads, airstrips, and drill pads. This method minimizes damage to the tundra and eliminates the need for permanent gravel roads. Sources of water for these operations need to be located. The need for water supply in the Arctic for gas operations is met by using ice for temporary roads, airstrips, and drill pads. Concerns arise about the impact on aquatic species and tundra vegetation if water is drawn from deep lakes or rivers like the Canning River. Limited water resources in the 1002 area may only support less than 50 miles of ice roads. Alternatives such as creating water reservoirs by excavating deep pools are being considered. Creating water reservoirs by excavating deep pools in conjunction with gravel removal could provide water for construction and habitat for overwintering fish. If economic quantities of oil are not found, the basins might be left in place or filled with clean gravel. Riparian habitat is important for musk oxen in winter, and siting facilities in these areas could be an issue. Other options for water supply include melting ice and snow, desalinating marine water, or transporting water by truck from existing developed areas. Oil companies may also consider building gravel roads for exploration and production. Oil companies on the North Slope have improved technology and practices to prevent and clean up accidental releases that could harm the surface layer and water. Critics are concerned about the possibility of spills of various substances, especially given the relatively few lakes and streams in the 1002 area. Even small spills can affect lakes and streams, impacting oxygen availability and potentially causing toxicity in receiving waters. Critics are concerned about potential environmental impacts of oil exploration in the 1002 area, including reduced oxygen availability in water, toxicity of waste, soil contamination from leaks, and habitat loss. Regulatory standards under federal laws like the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act would apply to protect water quality. Permits for activities in Alaska are issued by federal agencies such as the EPA and U.S. Army Corps. The state of Alaska has limited regulatory authorities and plays a role in establishing water quality standards to protect waters within its jurisdiction as required by the federal Clean Water Act. State standards apply to surface waters and groundwater, including the 1002 area, with permits ensuring compliance with these standards. Oil discharge prevention and contingency plans are required for exploration activities. The state of Alaska requires oil discharge prevention and contingency plans for exploration or production facilities, along with proof of financial responsibility. The Department of Fish and Game reviews proposed projects for impacts on anadromous fish. Limited public information is available on oil industry compliance with water quality standards. Critics point out that data shows hundreds of spills occur each year. The industry believes its environmental performance in the arctic is good due to improved technology and practices. The Clean Water Act requires facilities to obtain permits for wastewater discharge, with specific limitations on pollutants. Oil and gas operations in the Arctic focus on pollution prevention through Best Management Practices plans. EPA issues general permits for operations outside the 1002 area. EPA issues general permits for onshore and offshore oil and gas extraction in Alaska, covering the North Slope Borough. The general permit streamlines the application process for facilities with similar discharges, such as ice roads, wastewater, and construction dewatering. Individual sources do not need a source-specific permit if they meet certain qualifications and file a Notice of Intent. The current general permit, issued in 1997, extends to April 10, 2002. EPA may also issue a general permit for activities in the 1002 area. EPA also issues CWA permits for stormwater discharges of uncontaminated rainwater. Arctic drilling and production pads in Alaska do not have conventional storm drains, so stormwater discharges occur as surface runoff during the spring thaw season. Stormwater permits focus on preventing contaminated runoff into US waters. The Safe Drinking Water Act authorizes a program to protect underground sources of drinking water from contamination through injection wells, regulated by both EPA and the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. EPA issues permits for subsurface injection of non-hazardous industrial wastes, while AOGCC issues permits for injection wells used in oil and gas production. In Alaska, permits are granted for underground injection of fluids from oil and gas production to protect underground sources of drinking water. EPA has waived stringent requirements for underground injection in existing oil production areas on the North Slope due to the lack of fresh aquifers. This could set a precedent for ANWR. Additionally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administers a permit program for discharges from projects under the Clean Water Act separate from EPA's discharge permit program. The Clean Water Act and other regulations require advance approval for discharges from projects involving dredging or filling of waters, including wetlands in the 1002 area. Permits from the Corps are needed for construction in navigable waterways, such as dams or dikes, and for offshore facilities like docks. The Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act may also require permits for certain activities. The Corps evaluates projects through a public interest balancing process, considering factors like conservation, economics, aesthetics, wetlands, cultural values, fish and wildlife values, and navigation. They share jurisdiction with other agencies and use environmental guidelines issued by EPA. The Coastal Zone Management Act requires state certification for projects in coastal zones. The Coastal Zone Management Act requires state certification for projects in coastal zones, ensuring compliance with state water quality standards. In Alaska, there is a frequent waiver of certification for oil exploration activities, leading to potential environmental impacts. Waste disposal from oil exploration is governed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, with hazardous waste management overseen by the U.S. EPA in Alaska. In Alaska, hazardous wastes from maintenance shops, laboratories, and support activities like paint, solvents, chemicals, light bulbs, and rags are regulated by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. Hazardous wastes must be stored securely before being shipped to RCRA-permitted facilities in the lower 48 states. EPA exempts oil and gas exploration wastes from RCRA regulations, with ADEC regulating drilling fluids and produced waters. Today, drilling wastes are ground up and injected into dedicated disposal wells 5,000 - 8,000 feet deep, eliminating the use of surface impoundments. The ADEC regulates underground injection wells to ensure they are only used in areas where there is no underground source of drinking water. Companies on the North Slope employ waste minimization and recycling programs to reduce environmental impact. The companies on the North Slope employ waste minimization and recycling programs to reduce solid waste volume, including drilling muds. These muds are recycled, reducing mud requirements by 50% or more. Cuttings are reused as gravel for construction or injected into disposal wells with other production wastes. Surface discharges of wastewater have been eliminated by injecting them underground. Wastewater disposal methods on the North Slope include injection into disposal wells and use for enhanced oil recovery. Nonhazardous liquids are also utilized for EOR. Used oil is collected, blended into crude oil, and sent to refineries. Cleanup agreements between the State of Alaska, British Petroleum, and Phillips Petroleum involve cleaning up sites, disposing of abandoned barrels, and closing inactive reserve pits. Cleanup activities on the North Slope involve disposing of abandoned barrels, closing inactive reserve pits, and addressing environmental issues. British Petroleum (BP) faced penalties in 2000 for illegally disposing hazardous waste. Technical advances and operator sensitivity aim to prevent accidents, but the risk of violations remains. Gravel is a valuable resource for exploration and development activities in the region. Gravel is a valuable resource for exploration and development activities in the region, but mining it can alter natural river drainage, cause erosion, and harm vegetation. Dust blown from gravel structures may affect nearby vegetation, but it could also lead to earlier snowmelt, stimulating plant growth. Possible contamination of dust with wastes may counter the benefits of earlier snowmelt from gravel structures. Gravel usage in the 1002 area for development is expected to be less than in previous years due to changes in construction practices and waste management. Today, most wastes are recycled, reused, or disposed of underground, reducing the need for reserve pits. Development in the 1002 area may follow a road-reduced pattern similar to Alpine, with less gravel needed for drilling pads. However, it is uncertain if a roadless development like Alpine would be cost-effective in ANWR. Development in the 1002 area may require a permanent road for economic viability, with leaseholders at the Badami oil field seeking state funding for road construction. The cost of building the road is estimated at $50-60 million, and its presence would impact the need for additional gravel roads and ice roads in the area. Three development scenarios in a recent model assume a road parallel to a pipeline and a connector road to Kaktovik in the 1002 area. The absence of a gravel road linked to developed areas could increase development costs in ANWR. Caribou cows with calves avoid human activity areas, and reducing road mileage could lower impacts on calves during sensitive times. In ANWR, impacts on calves during sensitive times could be reduced by avoiding human activity areas. Roads or runways oriented across the path of travel may disrupt cow movement more than those oriented parallel to it. Displacement of calving to foothills could lead to greater predation, while foraging displacement could result in weight loss in cows and reduced survival rates in calves. Interpretations of impacts based on the CAH must be made cautiously due to varying herd concentrations and availability of similar areas for insect relief. The potential impacts of development in ANWR on the Porcupine Caribou Herd (PCH) and other species could be influenced by road mileage restrictions and advancements in technology. Changes in footprint estimates from 1987 to 2001 suggest a reduced environmental impact with modern technologies and potential congressional restrictions. The 1987 FLEIS described assumptions for development in the 1002 area, with placement of facilities based on generalized characteristics. Actual placement depends on site-specific data after drilling and discovery. Features considered in the FLEIS are listed in Table 4. The 1987 FLEIS described assumptions for development in the 1002 area, with placement of facilities based on generalized characteristics. Actual placement depends on site-specific data after drilling and discovery. Features considered in the FLEIS are listed in Table 4, showing potential changes in acreage or mileage due to modern technology advancements. The 1987 FLEIS outlined potential features for development in the 1002 area, with uncertainties regarding the need for certain facilities like marine port facilities and main roads. The estimated total acreage covered would be 5,330 to 5,980 acres in a full development scenario. The estimated total acreage for full development in the 1002 area would be 5,330 to 5,980 acres. Comparisons with modern technology suggest a smaller footprint, but potentially not significantly so. Arctic Power suggests full development could be achieved with 2,000 acres of facilities, raising questions about the definition of \"footprint\" and the need for technological improvements. Development proponents aim to limit surface impacts to 2,000 acres, focusing on pads, airstrips, pad supports, and connector roads. The technologies used for development in the 1002 area could be influenced by economic factors and congressional direction. The table compares estimated numbers and areas of oil-related facilities using modern technologies. Development on Native lands is not included in the table due to potential different standards. Some argue that economics could force eventual construction of main roads for development in the 1002 area, especially if world oil prices do not increase. The Corps of Engineers issued a permit for a 150-acre gravel pit in association with the Alpine development. The permitted pit for the Alpine development could potentially expand to 2 additional satellite pads and connector roads. It is unclear what size gravel mine would be needed for the current facilities. Consolidation of gravel pits by digging fewer, deeper pits is a possibility, but no information was found on this. Sources include U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Geological Survey, and Bureau of Land Management. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Alaska studied the effects of gravel pit operations on tundra surfaces in the Colville River area. They found that vegetation could be damaged by wind and rolligon use in hilly terrain, with slower recovery rates due to the arctic environment. Vegetation under ice roads and pads may also be impacted by compaction and delayed growth. Insulation can help mitigate damage, but little effect is observed where debris is removed and no spills occur. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers studied the effects of gravel pit operations on tundra surfaces in the Colville River area. Damage to vegetation from wind and rolligon use in hilly terrain was observed, with slower recovery rates in the arctic environment. Insulation can help mitigate damage under ice roads and pads, but little effect is seen where debris is removed and no spills occur. In cases where insulation is used to maintain an ice pad over a single summer, damage is confined to areas around the edges of the pad. Recolonization begins to appear in two growing seasons. Port and offshore activity may reduce the need for long ice roads if water for ice roads is scarce. Offshore facilities could be used for staging heavy equipment and water treatment plants. The reduction in surface impacts from water treatment plants could lead to potential offshore impacts. Aircraft use at Alpine is essential for transportation, with effects on bird populations varying. Snow geese are highly sensitive to aircraft disturbance, habituating after several passes. The report highlighted that snow geese are disturbed by human activities like traffic and noise, affecting their feeding time and migration. The village of Kaktovik on Barter Island is the only human settlement in the area, with various features nearby. The Defense Department constructed a system along the arctic coasts of Alaska and Canada in the 1950s to provide early warning of a Soviet attack. Kaktovik was designated as the site of a major installation, resulting in three relocations of the village to accommodate the military facility. The Defense Department constructed a system along the arctic coasts of Alaska and Canada in the 1950s for early warning of a Soviet attack. Kaktovik was chosen for a major installation, leading to three village relocations. Intermediate stations were built along the coast in the ANWR 1002 area, with only Kaktovik station remaining open in 1986. Abandoned materials were found at various sites, with limited recreational visits to the remote Refuge. The peak number of visitors was 886 in 1990. In 2001, visitor numbers to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge were high, with trips starting from Fairbanks costing $2,000-$3,000 and lasting 1-2 weeks. Small groups of visitors are ferried to a river bank where they travel along rivers to the coast, often spotting migrating caribou. The increase in controversy over the Refuge's coastal plain has led to more visitors seeking solitude in the remote area. The remoteness of the Refuge's coastal plain offers solitude as a key attraction for visitors, while migrating caribou and other species also draw people. Birdwatching and hunting are popular activities, with birds being used by Inupiat subsistence hunters. The economic impact of these activities is challenging to assess, but the Refuge is especially important for hunters of snow geese staging in the area. Alaska Natives actively participate in these activities. Alaska Natives, including Eskimos, Aleuts, and American Indians, make up over 15% of Alaska's population and participate in the debate over opening ANWR to oil and gas exploration. They are members of federally-recognized tribes, citizens of the state and boroughs, and shareholders in Native corporations. There is disagreement among Alaska Native groups and organizations regarding the development of the 1002 area in ANWR. Some Alaska Native groups support oil and gas development in the 1002 area of ANWR, including the North Slope Inupiat and organizations like Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation and Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. On the other hand, Gwich'in Indian villages oppose development in the area. The anti-development set in northwestern Canada includes Gwich'in villages Venetie and Arctic Village, along with tribal governments and non-profit organizations. Unlike Kaktovik, these villages are not within an organized borough. The pro- and anti-development sets of Alaska Natives are not monolithic. Borough residents in Alaska support oil and gas development in ANWR and the 1002 area, with differing opinions among Gwich'in and Athabaskans. Various Native and Indian groups at local, regional, statewide, and national levels have conflicting views on the matter. The Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN) favors development, while the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) opposes it. Disagreements often revolve around the impact on subsistence resources, particularly the Porcupine caribou herd. The disagreement over oil and gas development in ANWR and the 1002 area is influenced by the impact on subsistence resources, particularly the Porcupine caribou herd. The complex set of practices and beliefs linking well-being and identity to subsistence in Inupiat and Gwich'in cultures is threatened by potential harm to these animals. ANILCA provisions allowed KIC to acquire surface lands and ASRC to acquire subsurface rights, affecting the dispute. An oil or gas discovery under KIC/ASRC land would greatly increase ASRC revenues and benefit Inupiats. Kaktovik, the only Native village in ANWR, heavily relies on subsistence resources from the 1002 area and other parts of ANWR. Residents of Nuiqsut also use the 1002 area for subsistence, but Kaktovik depends the most on these resources. Studies show that most Kaktovik households rely on hunting, fishing, and gathering in ANWR for food, with caribou, Dall sheep, and bowhead whales being their main sources of meat. The Inupiat of Kaktovik heavily rely on subsistence hunting for meat, including caribou and bowhead whales. They oppose offshore oil and gas exploration due to concerns about its impact on their whaling activities. Recent observations suggest that Kaktovik may be becoming less dependent on subsistence hunting as paid employment becomes more important, limiting time for traditional hunting practices. The residents of Kaktovik are heavily involved in subsistence hunting but are increasingly reliant on paid employment, which limits their traditional hunting practices. They benefit from various programs and activities funded by oil development, and many residents support oil exploration in the 1002 area to maintain their standard of living. Residents of Kaktovik, who heavily rely on subsistence hunting but also seek paid employment, support oil exploration in the 1002 area. They believe that with their experience in wildlife conservation, development can occur without endangering subsistence animals. Additionally, ASRC, exempt from sharing subsurface revenues with other regional corporations, may provide greater dividends to its shareholders, including Kaktovik residents. Alaskan Inupiat and Gwich'in Natives oppose leasing in areas where they depend on resources like bowhead whales and caribou for cultural and subsistence reasons. Gwich'in villages like Arctic Village and Old Crow are involved in caribou harvesting, with some villages trading for caribou meat. Residents of Kaktovik support oil exploration in the 1002 area, believing development can occur without endangering subsistence animals. ASRC may provide greater dividends to its shareholders, including Kaktovik residents. Gwich'in villages like Arctic Village and Venetie harvest caribou as their main food source, with Arctic Village harvesting 200-1,000 caribou per year in the 1970s. Caribou is culturally significant to the Gwich'in people, who also harvest other animals, fish, and birds. Arctic Village and Venetie have benefited from Alaska's oil and gas development, but to a lesser extent than Kaktovik. Under ANCSA, Arctic Village and Venetie residents chose private fee title to their reservation instead of regional corporation shareholdings. They do not receive dividends from Doyon, Ltd., the regional corporation, and rely on state government activities for benefits from North Slope development. Their community facilities are less prosperous compared to North Slope Borough villages, and paid employment is not as widespread. The Gwich'in in Arctic Village and Venetie express concerns about oil and gas development in the 1002 area threatening the Porcupine Caribou Herd (PCH) and their subsistence way of life. Critics point out that the villages previously sold oil development leases, but the Gwich'in argue that those areas were not critical for the herd's survival. Various property interests related to oil drilling in ANWR may present complex legal issues for refuge management if the coastal plain is opened to oil development. In 1971, Congress enacted ANCSA to resolve Native aboriginal land claims, providing monetary payments and creating village and regional corporations with rights to select surface and subsurface estates in lands within the National Wildlife Refuge System. KIC received rights to three townships along the coast of ANWR. Regional corporations could select subsurface rights to some lands, but subsurface rights in National Wildlife Refuges were not available. In 1980, ANILCA granted KIC rights to select certain lands and make exchanges, defining the 1002 area excluding KIC lands. Kaktovik retains surface rights to three townships outside the 1002 area and one inside. Despite their importance to wildlife, KIC lands are subject to restrictions on oil and gas development within the Refuge. Under ANILCA, ASRC has rights in the Refuge through exchanges, authorized by Section 1431(o). The Chandler Lake Agreement in 1983 granted ASRC subsurface rights to KIC lands in exchange for certain lands in Gates of the Arctic National Park. This agreement excluded the 1002 area, where Kaktovik retains surface rights to three townships. Congress ratified the Chandler Lake Agreement granting ASRC rights to drill exploratory wells on KIC lands outside the 1002 area. Results of the test well are confidential. Individual Native allotments on the coastal plain are in various stages of conveyance. BLM is compiling data on these allotments. Preliminary data show clustered allotments and applications along the coast and near Sadlerochit Spring, important wildlife areas. Allotments already conveyed total over 10,000 acres. Use of allotments not subject to ANCSA controls or other restrictions unless Congress enacts them. The 1983 Agreement governs oil exploration and development on KIC/ASRC lands, ensuring compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements to protect wildlife, habitat, and the environment. The Agreement includes provisions to protect wildlife, habitat, and the environment of the coastal plain and ASRC Lands. If Congress repeals the prohibition against oil development in the Refuge, it could affect over 100,000 acres of Native lands. The Canadian government opposes development in the 1002 area due to risks to the Porcupine Caribou Herd and the Gwich'in people. Canada and the United States have an agreement to protect the Porcupine Caribou Herd and its habitat. Canada has created national parks to prevent development in important calving and migration areas. The Canadian government opposes development in the 1002 area of ANWR to ensure the long-term sustainability of the herd. The PCH range in Canada was leased for oil and gas development in the past, but no commercial quantities were found, leading to the leases expiring. Canadian opposition to development in the area arose after it was clear that oil was not found. Canadians argue that the calving area on the U.S. side is crucial for caribou, and Canadian industry officials complain of government hostility towards development in northern areas. If the 1002 area is opened for exploration, environmental protection remains a major concern. The FLEIS raises concerns about the long-term environmental impact of oil and gas development in the 1002 area, questioning the feasibility of complete restoration after depletion. The comments raise questions about the rehabilitation of the 1002 area after development, which will impact decisions on exploration and production in the wildlife refuge. Total rehabilitation of the 1002 area post-development may be impossible due to long-term changes like global warming, sea level fluctuations, and ozone layer alterations. Achieving a substantial level of rehabilitation to restore the area to its original state with pre-development species could be a challenging but achievable goal. The goal of total rehabilitation of the 1002 area post-development may be challenging due to various factors. This includes the removal of structures, pollution control, safe waste disposal, returning to pre-development human population levels, removing gravel roads, and restoring native vegetation. Limited experience exists on permanently shutting down major oil fields, making it difficult to guide the closure of potential 1002 area development. Rehabilitation and restoration could be a significant topic in congressional debates regarding the area. In an oil field, human population levels peak during construction, with an estimated 1,500 workers in 1987. After construction, personnel levels decrease to a few hundred workers for operations or smaller projects. Once energy production stops, it may be challenging to retain workers in the 1002 area, except for Alaska Natives in Kaktovik. There could be pressure to maintain development for alternative local industries like tourism. The North Slope Borough supports 1002 development due to declining Prudhoe Bay revenues. Debate on the post-development status of human populations is lacking. Access to the 1002 area is mainly by aircraft, unlike the North Slope with a road network. Authorization of 1002 development could impact road infrastructure. If Congress authorizes 1002 area development, it could have significant environmental effects on road construction. With current technologies, fewer roads would be built compared to older methods. However, lower oil prices or higher operating costs may make building haul roads more appealing. It is uncertain if restrictions on road construction would apply to Native lands, and if road removal requirements would be enforced. Despite potential limitations, some roads are likely to be constructed, which could have minimal impact if in small, unconnected segments like at Alpine. Reducing human access through limited road construction has shown benefits for sensitive species in national parks and wildlife refuges. Reducing human access in national parks and wildlife refuges can benefit sensitive species by preventing illegal hunting and disturbance of nesting sites. Removing contaminated gravel from roads would be costly, and rehabilitation would involve removing culverts and bridges, grading road surfaces, and seeding grasses. Erosion and sedimentation must be minimized, and only necessary gravel would be removed from abandoned roadbeds. If leasing for gravel production is allowed, options for managing structures like water treatment plants and airfields may vary. Some structures may be retained post-production, while others like drillpads could be removed. Roads could either be maintained with some rehabilitated or all abandoned to restore pre-development conditions. Increased tourism may influence the decision to keep some roads open. Restoration of native vegetation post-production is crucial for animal populations. The 1002 area has different vegetation from developed areas, requiring specific restoration techniques. Research shows that natural recovery of vegetation in the 1002 area may be limited without intervention. Revegetation efforts post-production in the Arctic may result in altered species composition and reduced diversity due to various disturbances. Removal of roads and gravel structures is crucial for successful revegetation, with edges of pads being easier to rehabilitate. Limited experience exists on the effectiveness of site phase-out requirements in the Arctic. The North Slope fields have a relatively small number of abandoned drilling sites, including artificial islands in the Beaufort Sea and onshore sites in the NPR-A. The NPR-A example is relevant to ANWR development, with past drilling activities between 1974 and 1981 involving 28 wells, drill pads, airstrips, and water supply sources. Buildings and equipment were placed on pilings to prevent permafrost thawing. The pad design for abandoned drilling sites on the North Slope included fuel storage, drilling fluid reserve, and flare pits. Cleanup involved removing debris, cutting pilings, and filling pits. Revegetation efforts had mixed success, with coastal sites showing the least progress due to clay silts. By 1986, revegetation was progressing reasonably well. New pad construction techniques involved using ice for exploration pads. Facility removal begins after drilling is finished, with the removal of the drill rig and leaving only necessary equipment on the pad. Wells are plugged with cement, surface facilities are removed, and the pad is graded and revegetated. The return of vegetation may not fully restore the tundra to its previous condition, but a manager may be satisfied with a plant-covered, stable surface. The FLEIS full development scenario estimated that 5,650 acres in the 1.5 million acre 1002 area would be covered with gravel (less than 0.4%). The impacts would remain visible until the affected areas were restored and revegetated, with some structures possibly remaining on Native lands for a longer period. The alternative to removing all facilities would be a judgment that some development may have longer-term or broader benefits than just oil extraction. In remote regions, emergency shelters and recognizable structures can be life-saving and aid in navigation. Reopening closed facilities may be less disruptive to the environment than constructing new ones. There may be tension between those advocating for restoration as a condition of development and those preferring case-by-case decisions later on. Enforcement of cleanup measures not initially specified as regulation could be challenging. The ANWR debate has a long history with opponents arguing that other energy options could replace ANWR oil production. High energy prices would make various energy options more attractive. Opponents suggest increasing fuel economy and ethanol production as alternatives. Opponents of ANWR oil development argue that it poses risks to U.S. energy security due to the vulnerability of the pipeline and lack of alternatives in case of damage. They believe that other options, especially in the transportation sector, are preferable for environmental, economic, and security reasons. Proponents downplay the economic rationale and practicality of alternatives. Proponents of ANWR oil development focus on the security argument of continued reliance on TAPS. Some suggest exploring the 1002 area first to determine energy resources before deciding on full leasing. Those opposed to energy development fear unstoppable support if economic discoveries are made, or environmental damage if exploration yields no significant findings. Supporters of leasing see unacceptable risks in this proposal. Advocates against exploration in ANWR raise concerns about who would carry out exploration, funding, availability of results, potential missed economic discoveries, future economic potential of small discoveries, industry competition, development restrictions on discoveries, and provisions for Alaska Native lands. No bill supporting exploration has been introduced in the 108th Congress. The National Wildlife Refuge System allows for compatible uses of refuges, with a new compatibility policy and regulations published in 2000. \"Compatible use\" is defined as a wildlife-dependent recreational use that does not interfere with the refuge's mission. Mineral leasing laws apply to lands within the System unless withdrawn. The purpose of the national wildlife refuge is to allow for compatible uses, with regulations on mineral leasing. Congress reserved the decision on leasing the coastal plain area, which may require updated environmental impact assessments. A court decision in 1991 required the Department of the Interior to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) or a new EIS for the 1002 area before development. Congress could choose to impose higher or lower environmental protection standards for the national wildlife refuge area to facilitate development. Issues include the use of gravel and water resources for oil exploration. Legislative issues related to oil exploration include regulations on gravel structures, mines, surface occupancy, pollution standards, waste disposal, reclamation, and liability concerns. Few bills mandate specific technologies, focusing instead on using \"best available\" or \"best practicable\" technologies. Recent debates also consider limitations on surface occupancy. Debates on surface occupancy limitations in oil exploration have focused on gravel structures like drill pads and runways. However, other features such as pipelines, culverts, and water treatment plants have been overlooked. Congress may designate special areas for ecological or cultural value, either through legislation or by authorizing the Interior Secretary to set aside areas post-enactment. Bills have proposed limiting surface occupancy to around 45,000 acres in certain areas. The FLEIS identifies special areas totaling over 52,000 acres where surface occupancy could be limited for seismic exploration or ice roads. Leasing proponents advocate for prompt implementation of an ANWR leasing program, suggesting expediting judicial review through procedural changes to streamline the process. In federal projects, the use of union workers has been a contentious issue, with past presidents issuing executive orders both in favor and against their use. Project labor agreements (PLAs) establish terms and conditions for craft workers on specific projects, with Congress getting involved in cases of objection to presidential actions. The issue has recently arisen in the context of proposed oil and gas development in ANWR. Project labor agreements (PLAs) set terms and conditions for craft workers on specific projects, including wage rates, benefits, dispute resolution procedures, and a no-strike clause. Supporters argue they ensure reliable labor and cost efficiency, while opponents claim they inflate costs and reduce competition. The impact of PLAs on project costs remains unclear due to limited independent data. Unions favor PLAs for access to federal projects, while nonunion firms see them as unfair. The ANWR debate involves the disposition of revenues from oil, gravel, and water resources. The Mineral Leasing Act governs revenue splits between the federal government and states, with certain states receiving direct and indirect shares. Alaska did not benefit from these splits before 1976. Before 1976, Alaska received only a 37% share of federal leasing revenues, but after amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act, it received an additional 52% share, putting Alaska on equal footing with other states. Subsequent amendments directed 90% of mineral revenues to Alaska, clarifying that this percentage cannot be changed. Alaska asserts that the 90% share of mineral leasing revenues referenced in the Statehood Act must always be paid to the state, as it is a compact between Alaska and the federal government. The provision was meant to ensure Alaska receives a share comparable to other states under the MLA, but does not prevent Congress from making changes or special provisions. Alaska sued the United States, claiming a breach of contract or \"taking\" of property for withdrawing lands from leasing and deducting administrative costs. The court found that the Statehood Act did not guarantee Alaska a fixed 90% share of mineral leasing revenues and that Congress could amend the MLA. The court also dismissed Alaska's takings claim, stating that the United States retained discretion over leasing decisions. Congress has the flexibility to legislate specially regarding oil and gas leasing in ANWR, including revenue-sharing provisions. The federal share of revenues could be used for conservation purposes or research on renewable energy sources. In each Congress since 1980, bills have been introduced to designate the coastal plain of the Refuge as wilderness, which would preclude energy development. This choice would preserve existing recreational opportunities and jobs, as well as protection of subsistence resources like the Porcupine Caribou Herd. Delaying development in the 1002 area of ANWR preserves subsistence resources like the Porcupine Caribou Herd and prevents energy development. Some argue that more information is needed on the environmental impact and probability of discoveries before allowing development. Key terms include 1002 area, 1002 report, ADEC, ADF&G, and ADNR. The curr_chunk discusses solid wastes, underground injection wells, Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G), Alaska Department of Natural Resources (ADNR), Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN), Alaska Natives, Alpine Corporation Oil Field, and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971.

The curr_chunk discusses the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS), Angun Plains in ANWR, and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980. ANILCA expanded ANWR boundaries, designated the 1002 area, and established federal conservation units in Alaska. The curr_chunk provides information on various entities and regulations in Alaska related to oil and gas extraction, including ANWR, AOGCC, and ARCO Alaska. The curr_chunk discusses key entities and regulations related to oil and gas extraction in Alaska, including Alpine field, Arctic Power, ASRC, BACT, and Barter Island. These entities play a significant role in energy development in ANWR and the Alaskan North Slope. The curr_chunk provides definitions and acronyms related to oil and gas extraction in Alaska, including terms like DEWLine, BEA, Beaufort Sea, BLM, BMP, and Bonus bids. These terms are essential for understanding the regulatory and operational aspects of energy development in the region. BPAlaska, formerly a division of British Petroleum Company, became a major North Slope operator in 1968. It was sold to Standard Oil Co. (Ohio) in 1978, and later acquired by British Petroleum Company, which became BP p.l.c. in May 2001. BP currently operates in the western half of the Prudhoe Bay field and other parts of the North Slope, vested in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The Brooks Range is an east-west trending mountain range in northern Alaska, extending into northwestern Canada. The Brooks Range is a mountain range in northern Alaska, extending into northwestern Canada. It runs from the Chukchi Sea eastward into northwestern Canada, with water draining to the Arctic Ocean to the north and to the Yukon River in Central Alaska to the south. The Central Arctic Herd (CAH) is a caribou herd that partly ranges in developed areas like Prudhoe Bay. The Chandler Lake Agreement is a 1983 land exchange agreement between DOI and ASRC. The 1983 Chandler Lake Agreement between DOI and ASRC involved a land exchange where the U.S. received lands in Gates of the Arctic National Park in return for ASRC receiving subsurface rights to KIC lands in ANWR. The Coastal Plain is a flat area between the Brooks Range and the north coast of Alaska, with wetlands around Prudhoe Bay. COE refers to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which approves permits affecting wetlands. Compatible Use is defined as a proposed or existing wildlife-dependent recreational use that does not interfere with the National Wildlife Refuge System mission. The regulations on compatibility in Alaska refuges are subject to the National Wildlife Refuge System mission. The Clean Water Act requires permits for oil and gas operations in the arctic to protect water resources. The Coastal Zone Management Act requires certification for projects in a state's coastal zone. Deadhorse is a support center for oil exploration in Prudhoe Bay. Deadhorse is the oldest support center for oil exploration in the Prudhoe Bay field, including offices, depots, repair facilities, and housing for employees. Denning refers to wild animals taking shelter in their lair, often associated with hibernation and giving birth. DEWLine is a surveillance system used by the U.S. and Canadian military for national security threats. DOI stands for the U.S. Department of the Interior, and Doyon, Ltd. is a Native corporation for central Alaska Natives. Economically recoverable oil is a key term in oil exploration. Alaska Natives, under ANCSA, have economically recoverable oil in the Endicott oil field. EIA forecasts U.S. energy resources, and EOR is used for enhanced oil recovery from known deposits. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques are used to increase petroleum recovery from known deposits, such as fracturing rocks, using explosives or high-pressure water, injecting carbon dioxide gas, and pumping hot water or steam underground to extract thick, viscous oils more effectively. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is an independent U.S. agency that conducts environmental research, sets national environmental standards, regulates various activities impacting the environment, assists states in environmental programs, funds water infrastructure projects, cleans up hazardous waste, and enforces environmental protection laws. Exxon-Mobil is a major oil company. EPA has commented on the Department of Interior's (DOI) proposed leasing of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and the adequacy of mitigation measures. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is also relevant in this context. Exxon-Mobil is a major oil company with substantial North Slope holdings, including oilfields in Prudhoe Bay. FLEIS is the Final Legislative Environmental Impact Statement published under \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1002 of ANILCA in April 1987 by FWS/DOI on alternatives for preserving, managing, and/or developing the 1002 area. Footprint refers to the area within the outline of structures on the land, with debate over what features should be included in assessing the total size. FWS is the Fish and Wildlife Service in DOI, which manages federal wildlife refuges, including ANWR. GDP is the Gross Domestic Product, a key indicator of total economic output used by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The curr_chunk discusses various terms such as Gross National Product, Gwich'in, infrastructure, INGAA Foundation, and inholdings. These terms are related to economic indicators, indigenous groups, physical facilities, and land ownership within federal areas. The curr_chunk provides information on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, inholdings in ANWR including Native lands owned by corporations like Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, Inupiat people, Jago River, Kaktovik village, Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation (KIC), Kongakut River, and Kuparuk oil field. The curr_chunk provides information on oil fields in Alaska such as Milne Point operated by BP Exploration, Mineral Leasing Act (MLA), National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A). The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) is a reserve of approximately 37,000 square miles on the North Slope, west of Prudhoe Bay. It was originally set aside for federal military use but was recently reopened for leasing. The most recent lease sale in May 1999 saw 130 bids totaling $105 million accepted. The reserve was previously known as \"Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 4.\" The curr_chunk discusses definitions related to Native villages, organizations like NCAI, and environmental regulations like NEPA in Alaska. It also mentions the North Slope region exceeding 100,000 square miles. The North Slope region in Alaska, exceeding 100,000 square miles, includes foothills, a coastal plain draining into the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. It stretches from Point Lisburne on the Chukchi Sea, encompassing oil development areas, the 1002 area, and extending into Canada. The North Slope Borough, established in 1972, has taxing power similar to a county. NOx refers to nitrogen oxides emitted by oil field operations in ANWR. The Ocean Dumping Act requires permits for disposal of dredged material in ocean waters. The curr_chunk discusses various organizations and terms related to oil extraction, such as OECD, OPEC, and oil in place. It also mentions the Porcupine Caribou Herd (PCH) that migrates to ANWR in Alaska for calving and feeding. The PCH herd in Alaska is estimated to be five times larger than the CAH. Phillips Petroleum is a major operator on the North Slope. PLAs are agreements between project owners and unions, while PLOs are administrative actions related to public lands. A prospect in petroleum exploration refers to potential drilling sites. Prudhoe Bay in Alaska is the site of the largest oil field in the U.S., estimated to contain 13 billion barrels of reserves. PSD and RCRA are regulatory programs related to air quality and waste management. The Conservation and Recovery Act governs hazardous waste management in Alaska, overseen by the U.S. EPA. Alaska Native Regional Corporations were established under ANCSA. Reinjection is the process of putting natural gas back into the ground on the North Slope. Rent is the annual payment made by lessees for energy production rights. Riparian areas are alongside streams. The Sadlerochit Spring in the 1002 area is a special habitat with a flow of water year-round, providing wintering habitat for various species. It represents the extreme northern range of some plants and birds, and muskoxen frequent the area. The 1002 area in Alaska is managed under the Safe Drinking Water Act to protect underground sources of drinking water from contamination. The area is home to special habitats and wildlife, including muskoxen, and is subject to regulatory oversight for underground injection wells. A Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement was deemed necessary in 1991 to address new information related to potential development in the area. The 1002 area in Alaska is home to special habitats and wildlife, including muskoxen. Five special areas totaling over 52,000 acres were named in the FLEIS for potential set-asides. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) transports oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. The TransAlaska Gas System (TAGS) is a proposed subsurface pipeline delivery system for natural gas. The area is subject to regulatory oversight for underground injection wells. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act authorized the construction of TAPS. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act authorized the construction of TAPS, granting a right of way over federal lands. An amendment in 1996 allows for the export of oil shipped through the pipeline under restrictive conditions. Tundra is a major ecological community in arctic and alpine areas, characterized by waterlogged soil on permafrost. USDW refers to underground sources of drinking water, and USGS is the U.S. Geological Survey. The curr_chunk discusses energy resource assessments, advises on prospecting and extraction of resources on federal lands, and evaluates national water resources. It also mentions the Village Corporation in Alaska, the WEFA Group, and defines the Wellhead Price as the price paid to a producer in the producing field. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of pipeline length on North Slope oil or gas prices, suggesting that substantial pipeline costs would result in low wellhead prices."
