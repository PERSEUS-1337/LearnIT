    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Heavy Truck, Tractor, and Trailer Retail Federal Excise Tax Repeal Act of 2017\". The Congress finds that the 12-percent Federal retail excise tax on new heavy trucks, tractors, and trailers is the highest percentage rate of any Federal ad valorem excise tax, first levied in 1917 to finance World War I. In 2016, the average manufacturer suggested retail price for heavy trucks was over $175,921, with the tax adding between $12,000 and $22,000 to the cost. The average in-use heavy truck is 9.5 years old, close to the historical all-time high. The EPA's emissions rules from 2002-2010 contribute $20,000 to the price of new heavy-duty trucks. The EPA and Department of Transportation fuel economy rules from 2014-2018 will add around $6,683 to the cost of new heavy-duty trucks. According to the 2016 EPA and NHTSA Final Rule, fuel economy rules for model years 2021-2027 will increase the price of new heavy-duty trucks by approximately $12,500. This results in an average additional $4,700 Federal excise tax per truck. Congress should consider a more reliable revenue mechanism to protect the Highway Trust Fund. SEC. 3. REPEAL OF EXCISE TAX ON HEAVY TRUCKS AND TRAILERS. Chapter 31 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to remove subchapter C and related items. Section 4072(c) is amended to define \"tires of the type used on highway vehicles\" and exclude tires used exclusively on mobile machinery. The text discusses the definition of \"mobile machinery\" as any vehicle with machinery or equipment permanently mounted for specific operations unrelated to transportation on public highways. The definition of \"mobile machinery\" includes vehicles that serve as a mobile carriage and power source for specific machinery or equipment, designed in a way that prevents them from being used for transporting any load other than the machinery or equipment they are intended for. The amendments made by this section involve striking specific sections in the Code related to taxes on certain articles and sales, with an effective date for application specified."
