    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Immigrant Children's Educational Advancement and Dropout Prevention Act of 2001\". Congress finds that undocumented children come to the United States for various reasons, often brought by adults or smugglers. The US government policy allows these children to attend public schools, recognizing their vulnerability and lack of independent decision-making ability. Undocumented children in the United States face challenges in regularizing their immigration status, hindering their educational opportunities and future success. Many of these children have lived in the US for years, consider themselves Americans, and lack ties to their country of birth. Current laws provide limited options for these long-staying alien children, making it difficult for them to continue their education beyond high school. Undocumented alien children in the US face obstacles in accessing education and future success. Current laws prevent them from receiving in-State tuition after high school graduation. The purpose of the Act is to allow certain alien children to adjust their status to lawful permanent residency and contribute to US society. The Act aims to restore flexibility for States to provide in-State tuition to all children, including undocumented alien children, and to support alien children brought to the US at a young age to continue their education through high school and college. The Attorney General has the authority to adjust the status of certain children. The Attorney General has the authority to cancel removal and adjust the status of alien residents brought to the United States as children. An alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States may be eligible for cancellation of removal if they can demonstrate physical presence in the US for a continuous period of at least five years before the application, depending on their age at the time of application. To be eligible for cancellation of removal, an alien must have been physically present in the United States for at least five years before the application, demonstrate good moral character, and be a student in the US. To be eligible for cancellation of removal, an alien must have been attending or applied to attend a two-year or four-year post-secondary educational institution in the United States. The Attorney General can adjust the status of minor children to that of lawful permanent residents if their parent qualifies. Eligible individuals can apply for relief under this provision through a procedure established by the Attorney General. The provision allows relief for certain aliens without removal proceedings, with restrictions for those inadmissible or deportable for certain crimes. Aliens inadmissible or deportable under specific sections are exempt from numerical limitations for relief under the Act. Children applying for relief under a specific immigration law are considered eligible for federal and state higher education assistance. States have control over admissions in their higher education systems. The repeal of Section 505 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 gives states control over admissions in their higher education systems."
