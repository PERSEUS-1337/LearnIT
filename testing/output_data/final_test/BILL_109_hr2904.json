    "content": "The \"Cultural Radio Tax Credit Act of 2005\" allows for a tax credit for the donation of licenses and assets of commercial radio broadcasting stations to nonprofit corporations. This credit is outlined in section 45J of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The radio broadcasting station donation credit allows for a tax credit for the donation of licenses and assets to a qualified recipient, which is a tax-exempt entity under section 501(c)(3). The credit includes 125% of the license's fair market value, 100% of the assets' fair market value, and the amount deposited into an operations escrow fund. The qualified recipient of a radio broadcasting station donation must operate the station as a for-profit venture, with profits supporting non-profit arts organizations in its service area. It must have at least 3 arts organizations from its service area on its board of trustees and agree not to sell the station to a for-profit broadcaster if it ceases operation. A corporation exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) must either continue operating a radio station for nonprofit arts organizations in its service area or surrender the license to the FCC. An operations escrow fund can be established to cover operating expenses for the first year of operation after donating a radio broadcasting commercial license or station assets to a qualified recipient. An operations escrow fund can be established to cover operating expenses for the first year of operation of a radio broadcasting station if revenues are inadequate. Any remaining amount in the fund after the first year will be added to the taxpayer's tax liability. Special rules apply if a license is surrendered to the FCC. If a qualified recipient surrenders a donated radio broadcasting license to the FCC, the donor may post a bond equal to the tax credit received for donating the station within 6 months. The bond can be used to apply for the license, and if approved, will be used in lieu of an auction fee. If the donor does not act within six months, the license will be auctioned. Donations for which a tax credit is received cannot be treated as a charitable contribution. The section allows taxpayers to elect to apply for a radio broadcasting station donation credit under section 45J(a) for a taxable year. Amendments to section 38 of the Code include adding the radio broadcasting station donation credit as a new paragraph. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005."
