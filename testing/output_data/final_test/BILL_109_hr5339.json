    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Access in Fire Emergencies Act of 2006\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The United States Fire Administration promotes fire prevention measures like sprinklers and smoke detectors to prevent casualties in fires. Window bars, common in low-income and high crime areas, can pose a risk to vulnerable groups like children, the elderly, and firefighters. Fatalities have occurred in residential fires due to individuals being trapped by window bars in multiple states. Several states, including Mississippi, California, Texas, and Oklahoma, have set safety standards for window bars. In a tragic incident in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, five children died in a house fire because they were trapped by window bars. National data collection on window bar entrapment during residential fires is crucial for raising public awareness of the risks involved. The term \"window bars\" in this Act refers to metal or other barriers designed to cover escape windows in residential units and deter security threats, excluding those for child safety or nonresidential properties. The Act also establishes safety standards for window bars. The Consumer Products Safety Commission is required to establish a safety standard for window bars within 12 months of initiating a rulemaking proceeding, with the standard taking effect after 6 months. The safety standard for window bars shall take effect after a 6-month period from the date of promulgation. It requires all window bars in the US to have releasing systems meeting minimum standards for interior and exterior bars, allowing manual actuation for egress. The safety standard for window bars in the US requires all bars to have releasing systems meeting minimum standards for interior and exterior bars, allowing manual actuation for egress. The standard must be consulted with experts and enforced under the Consumer Product Safety Act. The Consumer Products Safety Commission mandates labeling for window bars sold in the US, detailing installation and operation instructions. Congress recommends all federally assisted housing units to have window bars with emergency releasing systems. The Commission will establish a National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) for collecting data on casualties related to window bars. This Act does not override state laws unless they are inconsistent with the Act's provisions, particularly regarding window bar releasing systems. The Commission will inform window bar manufacturers about the Act's provisions. Appropriations are authorized for the Commission for fiscal years 2007 through 2011."
