    "content": "On June 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the influenza pandemic alert to phase 6 due to the global spread of a new strain of influenza. The new virus, influenza A(H1N1), has become widespread, with most patients experiencing mild symptoms. This report discusses legal issues related to emergency measures, civil rights, liability, and employment in response to public health threats. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) can provide assistance to states in such situations. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) can assist states through the Secretary's general authorities, providing financial and technical help for outbreak investigations and disease control. The Secretary also has specific powers under the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to address public health emergencies, such as determining disease outbreaks as public health emergencies. The Secretary of HHS can take action in response to public health emergencies, including making grants and conducting investigations into diseases. A public health emergency declaration was issued in 2009 in response to influenza A(H1N1) infections, allowing for special emergency fund access and other actions to address emerging outbreaks. During public health emergencies, the Secretary of HHS can access a special emergency fund and issue Emergency Use Authorizations for unapproved medical treatments. Waivers can be granted for certain administrative requirements under specific conditions to ensure healthcare availability for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP enrollees. During public health emergencies, the Secretary of HHS can access a special emergency fund and issue Emergency Use Authorizations. The National Emergencies Act allows the President to declare a national emergency and activate special powers, relying on other statutes for specific emergency authority. The National Emergencies Act allows the President to declare a national emergency, granting special powers to address urgent public health needs. President Obama declared a national emergency in 2009 during the H1N1 influenza pandemic, authorizing the Secretary of HHS to deploy officers to assist in emergency healthcare operations. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, President Obama declared a national emergency, granting special powers to the Secretary of HHS to waive certain requirements of healthcare programs and the Privacy Rule. No Stafford Act declarations were made for the pandemic at that time. The Stafford Act authorizes the President to direct federal agencies to support state and local emergency assistance activities, coordinate disaster relief, provide technical assistance, remove debris, offer assistance to individuals and households, and assist in the distribution of essential supplies. The total assistance available is limited to $5 million in an emergency declaration, unless the President determines a continuing need. Emergency declarations for infectious diseases are not unprecedented, as seen in the case of the West Nile virus outbreak in New York in 2000. In 2000, West Nile virus detection in New York and New Jersey led to an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act. Uncertainty exists on whether a flu pandemic would qualify for major disaster assistance. A major disaster declaration allows for various forms of assistance without a set limit on the total amount provided. The authority to declare a major disaster under the Stafford Act in response to a flu pandemic is debated. FEMA historically excluded biological incidents from major disaster declarations, but the Bush administration considered flu pandemics eligible for assistance. Declarations under the Stafford Act have not been issued. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 added Section 1135 to the Social Security Act, allowing the HHS Secretary to waive regulatory requirements during a public health emergency. These waivers facilitate healthcare services in emergency areas by providers. Section 1135 defines the area and time period of an emergency declared by the President and the Secretary. Health care facilities can request \"1135 waivers\" to address specific needs during emergencies. These waivers help patients relocate, allow beneficiaries to receive services without eligibility documentation, and enable providers to work in temporary facilities. The Secretary can waive certain conditions to assist in emergency response. The Secretary has the authority to take various actions during emergencies, such as waiving participation conditions, certification requirements, and program pre-approval under Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP. This includes allowing healthcare providers to offer services even without state licensing, waiving EMTALA sanctions for patient transfers, extending deadlines, and waiving limitations on Medicare Advantage payments for out-of-network care. Additionally, sanctions for Stark law violations and HIPAA Privacy Rule violations can be waived. The Secretary has the authority to waive sanctions and penalties for violations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule during emergencies. These waivers and modifications may be retroactively applied and will generally remain in effect until the emergency declarations end or 60 days have passed since the notice was published. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can determine the extent of necessary waivers under Section 1135, covering a period until revoked or the emergency declarations end. HIPAA privacy provisions are waived for hospitals with disaster protocols for 72 hours. The Secretary can declare emergencies for expedited medical countermeasure use based on Homeland Security or Defense determinations. The FDA commissioner may authorize emergency use of drugs, devices, or biological products under Section 564 of the FFDCA for up to a year, based on a public health emergency declaration. An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) may apply to a product not approved for commercial use by the FDA, or for a different use than its current approval. The FDA commissioner must determine if the agent can cause a serious or life-threatening condition to issue an EUA. The FDA commissioner must conclude, based on scientific evidence, that a product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing a disease or condition, with benefits outweighing risks and no alternative available. FDA issued four Emergency Use Authorizations in response to CDC requests on April 27, 2009. In response to CDC requests, FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations for drugs, diagnostic tests, and respiratory protection devices during the H1N1 influenza outbreak. The World Health Assembly revised International Health Regulations in 2005, expanding WHO and member states' roles in protecting international public health beyond just three diseases. The International Health Regulations (IHR) were revised in 2005 to address a wider range of diseases and emergencies, including non-infectious agents. The regulations include provisions for national points of contact, public health capacities, disease control measures like quarantine, and emphasize using control measures that are necessary for health protection. The International Health Regulations (IHR) were revised in 2005 to address a wider range of diseases and emergencies, including non-infectious agents. The IHR(2005) represent a balance between sovereign rights and a commitment to prevent the international spread of disease. While the IHR(2005) contain mechanisms for dispute resolution, they do not provide an enforcement mechanism for compliance with WHO provisions. The United States accepted the IHR(2005) with reservations, including implementing them in line with U.S. federalism principles. State Parties must develop public health infrastructure within five years of the entry into force date. On April 25, 2009, WHO declared the influenza A(H1N1) virus outbreak as a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" under the IHR(2005), marking the first time this declaration was made. This declaration allows for a coordinated international response to a public health risk that poses a threat of international disease spread. Under the IHR(2005), if the WHO Director-General declares a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern,\" temporary recommendations are issued based on the nature of the threat. State Parties can implement measures for greater health protection as long as they are consistent with the IHR(2005) and not more restrictive of international trade and travel. Following the declaration on April 25, 2009, countries were recommended to intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks. The WHO recommended intensifying surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia, without suggesting travel or trade restrictions. The WHO raised the pandemic alert level to 6 for the influenza A(H1N1) virus, advising against travel restrictions due to their limited effectiveness in stopping the virus spread. Despite this, some countries implemented travel bans and interrupted sales of pork products from the United States. The United States disregarded a WHO determination that cooked pork does not transmit the virus. State Parties can apply travel measures as long as they are not more restrictive than necessary for health protection. Additional health measures interfering with international traffic must be justified to the WHO. The IHR(2005) do not have enforcement mechanisms to compel compliance with WHO recommendations. Quarantine and isolation are distinct concepts, with quarantine referring to separating exposed individuals and isolation referring to separating infected individuals. Federal government has jurisdiction over interstate and border quarantine, with authority found in Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. The Public Health Service Act grants the Secretary of HHS the authority to enforce regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. The Secretary can apprehend, detain, or release individuals based on specified diseases listed in an Executive Order. In 2000, interstate quarantine authority was transferred to the CDC. The CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine handles interstate and foreign quarantine measures, working closely with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its agencies. A memorandum of understanding between HHS and DHS in 2005 outlines cooperation mechanisms for enforcing quarantine rules. DHS agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the United States Coast Guard assist CDC in enforcing quarantine regulations. Additionally, CDC may collaborate with other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies for quarantine enforcement. The primary authority for quarantine and isolation is at the state level, with states conducting these activities according to their own laws and policies. CDC defers to state and local health authorities for quarantine powers, only using federal authority in rare situations. Federal-state cooperative activities under Section 311 of the PHS Act allow the federal government to assist states in enforcing quarantines. The federal government may assist with enforcing federal quarantines and managing intrastate incidents if local efforts are inadequate. The Secretary of HHS can request aid from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Coast Guard, and military officers for quarantine execution. Proposed changes to CDC quarantine regulations have not been finalized but are mandated to be promulgated by June 10, 2009, marking the first significant revision in 25 years. The CDC is proposing new regulations to improve contact tracing and medical follow-up for potentially infected passengers arriving from foreign countries. These regulations would expand reporting requirements for ill passengers and require airlines to maintain detailed passenger lists for CDC notification. The proposed regulations aim to improve contact tracing for passengers arriving from foreign countries by requiring airlines to maintain detailed passenger lists for CDC notification in case of suspected exposure to diseases. The regulations also address the due process rights of passengers who may be subjected to quarantine and provide for an appeal process. The Immigration and Nationality Act bars aliens with communicable diseases from entering the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits aliens with communicable diseases, including the influenza A(H1N1) virus, from entering the United States. This law does not apply to American citizens, and diagnosis of the virus is required for inadmissibility. However, there are limitations to effectively prevent individuals infected with the virus from entering the country. The United States does not have legal provisions to exclude American citizens solely for having a communicable disease. Infected citizens can be placed in quarantine at the border to prevent disease spread. The Secretary can create regulations to prevent the entry of communicable diseases from foreign countries. Isolation, quarantine, or surveillance may be implemented for individuals with listed communicable diseases. The United States can quarantine individuals with communicable diseases to prevent disease spread, but there are no laws allowing the exclusion of American citizens. Closing the borders to prevent the introduction of diseases like influenza caused by novel viruses is a drastic measure that could only exclude aliens, not citizens. Congress could potentially enact a law to authorize such action. The President may have the authority to \"close the borders\" to aliens through an Executive Order, but this action would likely face legal and practical challenges leading to extensive litigation. Without Congress granting the President the power to conduct blanket border closings, it seems that such action could only be taken if the exclusion power is shared with Congress. The President has rarely exercised authority in this area without explicit delegation from Congress, and the Immigration and Nationality Act already has a comprehensive regime for inadmissibility. The President may not have the authority to close borders to aliens without congressional authorization. Airlines have the right to deny transportation to passengers who may pose a safety or security risk due to age, condition, or disability. The air carrier has the discretion to deny boarding to passengers showing symptoms of illness. Refusal may result in eligibility for a refund based on the contract of carriage. CDC guidance helps airline crew identify passengers with influenza A(H1N1). Federal agencies have a travel restriction tool to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the CDC developed the Do Not Board (DNB) list in June 2007 to restrict individuals with communicable diseases from boarding commercial flights in the United States. This tool is used when local public health efforts are insufficient to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. The federal government has legal authority to regulate the airspace of the United States. The United States has legal authority over its airspace, delegated to the FAA by Congress. The FAA can restrict airplanes from entering or leaving the U.S. if they come from or are going to countries with communicable diseases. The FAA can prevent aircraft from third countries using US airspace to travel to countries with communicable diseases. School closures can help mitigate the impact of an influenza pandemic, especially since children are more susceptible to infection. CDC included school closures as a tool for pandemic mitigation, with closures lasting up to 12 weeks during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. CDC revised its guidance on school closures in response to new information on the severity of the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. The new guidelines emphasized the importance of balancing the goal of reducing illness and death with minimizing social disruption and safety risks for students. Recommended responses included staying home when sick, separating ill individuals, practicing hand hygiene, cleaning surfaces, and early treatment for high-risk individuals. The CDC and WHO recommend measures like hygiene, cleaning surfaces, early treatment for high-risk individuals, and selective school dismissals to combat the severity of the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. WHO notes the role of schools in spreading the virus and CDC tracks school dismissals to monitor the situation. Secretary Duncan reported that 501 schools had closed for at least one day due to the flu outbreak. Duncan reported that 501 schools closed from August 3 to October 9. The CDC study found that most jurisdictions have legal authority to close schools during emergencies. Legal issues arise regarding who can institute school closures and how to comply with testing and meal programs during closures. The authority for school closure may be vested at different levels of government, creating legal controversies. State emergency management agencies usually have the authority during a state or local emergency declaration. Legal challenges may arise, especially regarding school employees' pay and compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Department of Education ensures that children with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE) even during school closures. Schools must not discriminate based on disability when providing educational services, and students with disabilities should have equal access to opportunities offered to the general student body. Compensatory services may be necessary for students with disabilities in certain situations. Vaccination with a matched strain of influenza virus is the most effective way to prevent severe illness from flu. The production of a vaccine for influenza viruses is time-consuming and will be available in phases. Initially, there may be a greater demand for the H1N1 vaccine than the supply. Challenges in a mass vaccination campaign include safe transport, redistribution, tracking, and monitoring of adverse effects. Mandating vaccines is generally a state, not federal, authority. Federal plans for a pandemic flu vaccination campaign assume a phased approach. Plans for a voluntary pandemic flu vaccination campaign in the fall involve the federal government purchasing the vaccine and providing guidance to states and localities on allocation. CDC encourages adherence to national guidelines on vaccine prioritization, with flexibility for local needs. The federal government examined how to prioritize scarce resources, including vaccines, before the H1N1 pandemic. HHS and DHS were tasked with making recommendations for access to influenza vaccines based on pandemic response goals and national security. Input was gathered through a request for information in 2006, leading to draft guidance issued in 2007. The RFI input led to draft guidance issued in 2007, with final guidance released in 2008. The guidance establishes tiers for vaccine coverage, prioritizing individuals based on pandemic severity. Key groups include deployed forces, critical healthcare workers, and high-risk individuals. The guidance issued in 2008 prioritizes critical health care workers, fire and police, pregnant women, infants, and toddlers for pandemic response. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining homeland and national security, protecting essential personnel, providing care for the ill, maintaining essential community services, and safeguarding at-risk workers. Plans must remain flexible due to unknown factors, such as vaccine technology and pandemic characteristics. CDC recommendations for a pandemic flu vaccination program were issued on July 8, 2009. The CDC recommendations on H1N1 vaccine priorities were discussed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on July 29, 2009. The target groups identified included pregnant women, household contacts of young children, healthcare personnel, individuals aged 6 months to 24 years, and those aged 25 to 64 with medical conditions. The focus was on civilian populations, with no mention of military immunization. The ACIP recommends priority vaccination for pregnant women, caregivers of young children, healthcare personnel, and individuals with medical conditions aged 6 months to 64 years. They suggest that 83% of the population should be vaccinated for seasonal influenza, but only about 40% actually get vaccinated each year. The demand for the H1N1 vaccine is uncertain as not everyone in the priority groups may choose to get vaccinated. The ACIP recommends priority vaccination for specific groups, but not everyone may choose to get the vaccine. CDC notes that a vaccine shortage is not expected, but availability and demand are unpredictable. Local flexibility is allowed based on vaccine supply, and providers should follow state or local guidance. The allocation of scarce pandemic vaccine raises legal issues, including liability concerns addressed by HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius under the PREP Act. Constitutional and civil rights issues, such as ADA compliance, may also arise in vaccine allocation plans. Legal issues may arise in vaccine allocation plans, including concerns about Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance and defining subgroups within priority groups. Questions may arise about how vaccination sites will verify individuals' eligibility within priority groups. Legal issues may arise in vaccine allocation plans, including concerns about Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance and defining subgroups within priority groups. Questions may arise about how vaccination sites will verify individuals' eligibility within priority groups, such as proving medical conditions that increase flu risk and potential liability issues for healthcare providers. The CDC provides guidance for vaccination providers facing requests from individuals not in the initial target group. The CDC emphasizes that the decision on who should get vaccinated should be made between the provider and the patient, considering factors like availability of doses and risk for infection. This guidance does not directly address potential liability issues for providers when priority group individuals suffer adverse consequences due to delayed vaccination. The CDC advises providers to consider factors like availability of doses and infection risk when deciding on vaccination. State laws mandate vaccination for school enrollment, with medical exemptions for compromised immune systems or allergies. Public health preservation is historically a state responsibility, with the authority to enact laws for protection. Various state laws mandate vaccination for school enrollment, with exemptions for medical reasons, religious beliefs, or philosophical reasons. Jacobson v. Massachusetts established the authority of states to enforce mandatory vaccination programs for public health protection. In the context of the current H1N1 pandemic, mandatory vaccination issues are less likely to arise than allocation issues, as there may not be enough vaccine available. Some states have laws requiring certain healthcare employees to be vaccinated against diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella. Some states have laws mandating healthcare workers, including those in nursing homes, to receive annual influenza vaccinations, with exceptions for medical contraindications or religious beliefs. Alabama, for example, requires nursing home employees to be vaccinated unless exempted for medical or religious reasons. In August 2009, the New York State Health Department mandated health care workers to be immunized against influenza viruses, with exceptions only for medical contraindications. Lawsuits were filed challenging the regulation, leading to a temporary restraining order. Governor David A. Paterson later suspended the flu shot mandate due to vaccine shortages. Employers can require health care workers to be vaccinated against communicable diseases as a condition of employment, with exceptions for medical or religious reasons. Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, WA, was the first hospital to implement this policy in 2004, achieving 98% staff coverage. The Department of Defense also issued a policy directive in 2008 for civilian health care personnel to be immunized against seasonal influenza infection. Many states have laws for mandatory vaccinations during public health emergencies or outbreaks of communicable diseases, with the power to order actions resting with the governor or state health officer. Exemptions are provided for medical or religious reasons, but refusal to be vaccinated may result in quarantine during the emergency. During a public health emergency, the legality of mandatory vaccination programs depends on balancing the severity of the situation with the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. Constitutional rights to personal liberties, such as freedom from bodily invasion, are also considered. States have laws allowing for mandatory vaccinations during emergencies, with exemptions for medical or religious reasons. Refusal to be vaccinated may lead to quarantine. The Emergency Health Powers Act (Model Act) grants public health powers to state and local authorities during public health emergencies, including the authority to vaccinate individuals to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The vaccine must be administered by a qualified person authorized by the public health authority. The Model Act grants public health authorities the power to vaccinate individuals during emergencies to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Individuals who are unable or unwilling to be vaccinated for health, religious, or conscience reasons may be subject to quarantine. Federal jurisdiction over public health matters is derived from the Commerce Clause, allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enforce regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. The Secretary has the power to restrict entry of aliens for public health reasons, including issuing vaccination requirements for immigrants. The Public Health Service Act focuses on quarantine measures to stop the spread of communicable diseases, but does not authorize mandatory vaccination programs at the federal level. State and local governments are responsible for implementing mandatory vaccination procedures during public health emergencies. The federal government has limited jurisdiction for mandatory vaccination programs, with states primarily responsible for public health protection. However, federal intervention may be necessary in certain circumstances. The balance between individual liberties and the common good is a key issue during infectious disease outbreaks. The balance between individual rights and public health measures, such as quarantine and isolation, is crucial during infectious disease outbreaks. Constitutional rights to due process and equal protection may be affected by these measures. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect individuals from being deprived of liberty without due process. The Supreme Court has ruled that non-dangerous individuals cannot be confined without justification, considering the least restrictive means to achieve governmental aims. This may apply to individuals highly contagious with a serious illness. The lesson of Donaldson is that individuals highly contagious with a serious illness may be subject to involuntary confinement, which must be carefully examined to ensure due process. The issue of less restrictive programs prior to isolation or quarantine is raised, as well as concerns about unequal treatment of socially disfavored groups in quarantine measures. The court struck down discrimination in inoculation based on race, citing violation of the equal protection clause. While the Constitution does not explicitly grant a right to travel, the Supreme Court recognizes a fundamental right to travel. Restrictions on travel for security reasons, like identification policies for boarding airplanes, have generally been upheld as constitutional. Public safety arguments could justify restrictions for serious public health threats, depending on the threat's severity and the due process procedures followed. The seriousness of the threat and due process procedures are crucial for any constitutional determination regarding discrimination against individuals with infectious diseases. Federal laws such as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) may cover discrimination issues. However, individuals with contagious diseases may not be granted access to public accommodations or employment if it poses a significant risk to others. The Supreme Court has addressed discrimination issues related to contagious diseases in the context of tuberculosis and Section 504. An individualized inquiry is often necessary to protect individuals with disabilities from deprivation. The Supreme Court emphasized the need for an individualized inquiry to protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination based on contagious diseases. Factors to consider include the nature, duration, severity, and probabilities of disease transmission. Courts should defer to reasonable medical judgments of public health officials. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is relevant in these cases. The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Issues raised by the H1N1 pandemic include determining if an infected individual is disabled, employer inquiries, reasonable accommodation requirements, and the ADA's \"direct threat\" language. The ADA Amendments Act defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that limits major life activities. Whether an individual with H1N1 is disabled requires a fact-specific inquiry. The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Employers may inquire about absences during a pandemic but cannot ask about chronic health conditions unless there is evidence of a direct threat. Surveys can be used to identify employees who may not be available for work due to various reasons. The ADA requires accommodation for individuals with disabilities. The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities and requires reasonable accommodations, even during a pandemic. For example, providing a screen reader for an employee with low vision working from home. Employees at high risk can request telework as an accommodation. The ADA also protects individuals with contagious diseases while balancing the health of others. Title I of the ADA prohibits employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities. During an influenza pandemic, the EEOC allows employers to send employees home if they show symptoms, even if the illness is not a disability. Title III of the ADA also permits entities to exclude individuals who pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others in public accommodations. The ADA allows entities to exclude individuals who pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others, defined as a significant risk that cannot be eliminated by modifications. Title II requires individuals to be \"qualified\" and meet essential eligibility requirements. Contagious diseases were discussed in the ADA's legislative history. The ADA allows entities to exclude individuals who pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others, defined as a significant risk that cannot be eliminated by modifications. The Air Carrier Access Act prohibits discrimination based on disability, including communicable diseases. The regulatory definition of \"individual with a disability\" appears to include individuals with communicable diseases. The regulations prohibit carriers from discriminating against individuals with communicable diseases, except when their condition poses a direct threat. The \"Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act\" can limit claims related to public health countermeasures. The \"Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act\" limits claims related to public health countermeasures during specified emergency conditions, granting immunity to certain covered persons. Covered countermeasures include qualified pandemic products, security countermeasures, and drugs authorized for emergency use. The PREP Act provides immunity to covered persons for claims related to public health countermeasures during emergencies, with exceptions for willful misconduct cases. Defendants can avoid liability by following HHS guidance and notifying authorities of any resulting death or injury. Victims may receive payment from the Covered Countermeasure Process Fund as an alternative to litigation. Under the \"Covered Countermeasure Process Fund,\" victims can receive compensation for injuries caused by certain countermeasures, such as medical benefits, lost income, and death benefits. The HHS Secretary issued a declaration for immunity and compensation for H1N1 vaccines and antiviral drugs, contingent upon appropriations. The civil liability of volunteer health professionals (VHPs) providing medical services during disasters, such as the 2009 influenza pandemic, is a concern. Federal and state laws generally protect volunteers, including VHPs, with specific liability protection laws in place. Laws provide liability protection for volunteer health professionals (VHPs) based on control and state of emergency. Protections shield volunteers from civil liability for negligence but not for willful or grossly negligent conduct. Federal and state statutes, like the Volunteer Protection Act (VPA), offer immunity to volunteers in non-emergency and emergency situations. The Volunteer Protection Act (VPA) provides liability protection for volunteers of non-profit organizations or governmental entities for ordinary negligence under certain conditions. It does not prevent these entities from suing their own volunteers or shield them from liability for volunteer actions. The VPA preempts state standards offering less protection, with all states having their own volunteer protection statutes. Additionally, many states have specific provisions granting immunity to volunteer health professionals from civil liability, independent of emergency situations. Federal and state governments have sovereign immunity from lawsuits. The Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign immunity for the federal government, allowing government employees to be held liable for torts. States may have similar provisions. Volunteers can be declared non-paid employees during emergencies to shield them from civil liability. Declarations of emergencies can be made at federal and state levels. Some states have regimes for public health emergencies that provide varying degrees of coverage, including liability protections for medical personnel. Governors can impose liability protections for volunteers during emergencies. Emergency mutual aid agreements can be established among political subdivisions and Indian tribal nations within a state, neighboring political subdivisions, or internationally with Canadian provinces. The Emergency Management Assistance Compact was approved by Congress in 1996. The Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) was approved by Congress in 1996 to provide a structured way for states to request aid from each other during disasters. All 50 states, along with the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam, have agreed to its terms. Under EMAC, individuals with licenses or permits from one state can assist in another state, subject to limitations set by the governor. Reciprocity is not automatically extended to volunteers who do not provide services under an EMAC request. Following September 11, 2001, Congress created the Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals to quickly identify and facilitate the use of VHPs in emergency response. Employment concerns during an influenza pandemic can impact compliance with public health measures. Strategies for controlling an influenza pandemic include vaccination, antiviral treatment, and infection control measures. CDC anticipates shipping H1N1 vaccine starting mid-October, with other infection control measures recommended in the meantime. The Homeland Security Council's Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan discusses measures like quarantine, isolation, and social distancing to limit the spread of influenza. Quarantine separates exposed individuals from others, isolation separates infected individuals, and social distancing reduces social contacts to limit transmission. These measures are crucial, especially for workers without paid sick leave. Social distancing, including face masks and school closures, limits influenza transmission. CDC guidance introduces a Pandemic Severity Index for community interventions like isolation, quarantine, and canceling public gatherings to reduce contact. The guidance emphasized reducing social density in public gatherings and workplaces through strategies like staggered shifts and telework. It also mentioned the importance of workplace leave policies and job security protections under the Family and Medical Leave Act. The National Governors Association conducted workshops on pandemic preparedness, focusing on continuity of government and coordination with the private sector. The NGA Center identified workforce policies as a key area for improving pandemic preparedness. Strategies such as telecommuting, alternative schedules, and distance-learning programs were recommended to ensure personnel can continue their duties during a pandemic. Central disease control strategies include keeping sick individuals isolated to prevent the spread of illness. The NGA Center emphasized the importance of workforce policies in pandemic preparedness, recommending strategies like telecommuting and alternative schedules. Employers should create new policies to allow sick workers to stay home to prevent the spread of infection. Collaboration between states and private sector employers is essential to balance the needs of workers caring for sick family members with continuity of operations plans. The employment-at-will doctrine governs the relationship between employers and employees in the private sector. The employment-at-will doctrine allows for dismissals at any time, but wrongful discharge claims can challenge this. Wrongful discharge in violation of public policy can arise if an employee is terminated for beneficial activities. This claim is based on the belief that employees should not be fired for refusing to commit unlawful acts. The claims for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy encompass four categories of conduct: refusing to commit unlawful acts, exercising statutory rights, fulfilling public obligations, and whistleblowing. States may vary in allowing such claims, with Texas requiring termination for refusing illegal acts or questioning employer instructions. Other actions beneficial to public welfare could also lead to wrongful discharge claims. Some courts broadly define public policy as what is right and just, affecting citizens collectively. Public policy prohibits actions injurious to the public good. Employee isolation during a pandemic could potentially lead to wrongful discharge claims in some states. During a pandemic, employee isolation or quarantine may create a public policy exception to at-will employment. Courts could view termination of isolated individuals as violating public policy. Government-mandated isolation would strengthen this argument, benefiting the public good. The CDC recommends sick individuals stay home during a pandemic to protect public health, potentially supporting a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. The FMLA guarantees employees certain rights. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) guarantees employees 12 workweeks of unpaid leave for various reasons, including caring for a family member with a serious health condition. The FMLA applies to private sector employers with at least 50 employees. The FMLA provides eligibility criteria for family and medical leave benefits, including a minimum of 12 months of employment and 1,250 hours of service in the previous 12-month period. Public agencies are also covered by the FMLA, with different requirements for employee eligibility. The FMLA allows for leave during an influenza pandemic for infected employees and those caring for infected relatives. An employee affected by a pandemic influenza virus may qualify for FMLA leave if eligibility requirements are met. Leave can be granted to care for a relative with a serious health condition. During leave, the employee or caregiver can be isolated or quarantined without fear of termination for at least 12 months. An employee affected by a pandemic influenza virus may qualify for FMLA leave to care for a relative with a serious health condition. The FMLA does not protect employees seeking isolation or quarantine to avoid exposure if they are not infected or responsible for infected family members. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management provides guidance on leave flexibilities for federal employees during a pandemic, including donated leave and leave without pay after sick leave is exhausted. In 2009, OPM proposed new regulations allowing agencies to advance sick leave for employees exposed to communicable diseases. The regulations also included provisions for care of family members. OPM announced a vaccination program for federal employees following ACIP guidelines. Six states have enacted laws to protect employees from termination during isolation or quarantine. Several states have enacted legislation prohibiting the termination of employees under isolation or quarantine orders. Minnesota allows affected employees to seek reinstatement or recover lost wages. New Jersey mandates reinstatement post-quarantine, while Maine requires employers to grant leave, which may be paid or unpaid. Federal law does not provide similar protections. The availability of paid leave under federal law, such as the FMLA and USERRA, provides employee protections for those with serious health conditions or caring for family members with such conditions. Paid leave could help minimize concerns about lost wages during an influenza pandemic. USERRA and FMLA show Congress's understanding of reasons for employee absences, such as military service or health issues."
