    "content": "The U.S. Constitution grants each House of Congress the authority to judge the elections, returns, and qualifications of its members. States have primary control over election procedures, but challenges or recounts can be brought to the House of Representatives as the final arbiter. The House of Representatives is the final arbiter of its members' elections, as stated in the Constitution. The exclusive right to determine membership is essential for the independent existence of the legislative assembly. Justice Joseph Story, in his work Commentaries on the Constitution, emphasized the importance of the power to determine membership within each House of Congress. This power, as highlighted in Roudebush v. Hartke, is non-justiciable and not reviewable by the courts, ensuring the independence and integrity of the legislative body. The case is non-reviewable by the courts as a political question, with each House of Congress having the right to make an unconditional and final judgment on the elections of its Members. The House can accept state counts or conduct its own recount, with a presumption of regularity in state election proceedings. The House has a presumption of regularity in state election proceedings, with election certificates considered prima facie evidence of election results. This presumption creates a substantial burden of proof on challengers, making it difficult to reject certified state returns. The House has two avenues to obtain jurisdiction over challenged elections. The Federal Contested Elections Act of 1969 (FCEA) is the primary method for contesting a congressional election in the House of Representatives. A losing candidate can trigger this process by filing a notice under the FCEA. The House may refer the question of seating a Member-elect to the Committee on House Administration for investigation and resolution. Upon filing a notice of contest, the House acquires jurisdiction over an election contest. The Federal Contested Elections Act (FCEA) governs contests for House seats initiated by defeated candidates. The process involves the Committee on House Administration reviewing the contest and reporting the results to the whole House for resolution by a simple majority vote. In rare cases, a referral to the Committee on House Administration may occur after a challenge to a congressional seat. The Committee can investigate the matter or rely on evidence provided by the parties involved, following procedures similar to the Federal Contested Elections Act. Only losing candidates can contest a House election under the FCEA, with specific criteria for eligibility. A House seat can be contested in Congress by a candidate whose name was on the ballot or a bona fide write-in candidate. The Committee on House Administration can gain jurisdiction over an election contest through challenges by Members-elect or petitions from electors. Deschler's outlines four ways a challenge can be brought before the House. The Federal Contested Elections Act (FCEA) provides procedures for contesting a House seat, primarily used by losing candidates to challenge election results. The Act outlines four ways a challenge can be brought before the House: through an election contest initiated by a defeated candidate, a protest filed by an elector or any other person, or a motion of a Member of the House. The Committee on House Administration prefers following the procedures under the contested election statute. The Federal Contested Elections Act (FCEA) defines \"contestant\" as an individual who challenges a House election and \"contestee\" as the Member of the House being challenged. Only losing candidates in a general election can contest a seat, with a 30-day deadline to file a notice of intention with the Clerk of the House and serve the contestee. The Federal Contested Elections Act (FCEA) allows losing candidates in a general election to contest a seat by filing a notice with the Clerk of the House and serving the contestee. Once filed, the House of Representatives and the Committee on House Administration gain jurisdiction over the matter without needing further action from the House. The Committee may later hear the case, make recommendations, and the House can decide by a simple majority vote. The House of Representatives can determine the right to a contested seat by a simple majority vote, even if the Member-elect has not been sworn in. In cases of election contests, Members-elect may be asked to \"step aside\" until the matter is resolved. The House of Representatives can determine the right to a contested seat by a simple majority vote, even if the Member-elect has not been sworn in. In cases of election contests, Members-elect may be asked to \"step aside\" until the matter is resolved. Another Member-elect has made a parliamentary inquiry to clarify that the swearing in of a contested Member-elect is without prejudice to the House's authority to resolve the election contest. The certification of election returns by the appropriate governor or secretary of state is generally accepted by the House. The FCEA requires the notice of intention to contest an election to specify the grounds for contesting and be served within 30 days. It must be signed and verified by oath or affirmation, and can be delivered in various ways including personal delivery, leaving at the contestee's house, office, or with an authorized agent, or by registered mail. The FCEA mandates that the notice of intention to contest an election must be served within 30 days, specifying the grounds for contesting. Service can be done through various methods, including personal delivery or registered mail. Proof of service must be provided promptly to the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Failure to provide proof does not invalidate the service. Within 30 days of receiving the notice, the contestee must respond in writing admitting or denying the contest. The contestee must serve a written answer to the notice of contest, admitting or denying the averments and setting forth any defenses. The FCEA allows certain defenses to be made by motion before the answer, such as insufficiency of service, lack of standing, or failure to state grounds for contesting. The burden of proof is on the contestant in case of a motion to dismiss. The burden of proof is on the contestant to present evidence in a motion to dismiss regarding their entitlement to the House seat. The purpose is to establish a prima facie case before formal testimony, allowing the committee to decide on further hearings. If the notice of contest is unclear, the contestee can request a more specific statement. Failure to comply within 10 days may result in consequences. The FCEA requires contestants to comply with committee orders within 10 days, failure to do so may result in dismissal of the case. Contestee's failure to respond does not imply admission of truth. The burden of proof lies with the contestant to prove entitlement to contestee's seat. Deposition testimony can be taken for discovery and evidence, with a total time limit of 70 days. Subpoenas can be issued for witness attendance and document production. The FCEA allows for fines or imprisonment for witnesses who fail to appear or testify. Judges and clerks issuing subpoenas are entitled to fees, and witnesses deposed are entitled to fees and travel allowances. Committees may reimburse parties for expenses, including attorneys' fees. All legal documents must be filed with the Clerk of the House. The contested election case record consists of filed papers, depositions, and exhibits with the Clerk of the House. Both the contestant and contestee must submit printed briefs with relevant portions of the record. The contestant serves their brief first, followed by the contestee, and then the contestant can serve a reply within 10 days after receiving the contestee's brief. Under the FCEA, the contestant in a House contested election case has the burden of proving that they are entitled to the contestee's seat. An election certificate is considered prima facie evidence of the election's regularity and results, allowing the Member-elect to be sworn in unless rebutted by the contestant showing voting irregularities or fraud that would have changed the election outcome. Most cases have been dismissed due to contestants failing to meet this burden. Contested election cases have been dismissed when the contestant fails to prove their right to the contestee's seat. The FCEA focuses on determining the duly elected candidate based on the most votes, not on challenging qualifications. The contestant must have a legitimate claim to the office, which is not possible if they did not receive the most votes. The \"American Rule\" in the House states that the second-place finisher cannot claim the office even if the winner is found unqualified. A new election must be called if a Member-elect lacks constitutional qualifications. Challenges under the FCEA may be dismissed if the contestant fails to prove a right to the seat. The Federal Contested Elections Act is the preferred procedure to challenge an election in the House of Representatives. The Committee on House Administration may obtain jurisdiction over an election challenge through a referral by the House or a protest filed by an elector. In the 107 contested election cases since 1933, challenges have come before the committee through various means. A Member-elect to a new Congress must have their proper credentials transmitted to the Clerk of the House before being placed on the role of Representatives-elect. They are not considered a Member of Congress until taking the oath of office and being seated by the House. Any Member-elect can object to another Member-elect taking the oath based on their own responsibility and reliable facts before the swearing-in ceremony. The possession of proper credentials by a Member-elect is considered evidence of their right to the seat, allowing them to take the oath of office even if challenged by another Member-elect. Denying a Member-elect the opportunity to take the oath is rare, only happening in extraordinary circumstances. In rare cases, a Member-elect may be denied the opportunity to take the oath of office on the first day of the new Congress if there are significant irregularities in the state process. There are three possible procedures for handling a challenge to the oath-taking of a Member-elect, including seating the Member provisionally based on their prima facie right to the seat. In rare cases, a Member-elect may be denied the opportunity to take the oath of office on the first day of the new Congress if there are significant irregularities in the state process. The House may resolve to seat the Member-elect but refer the final decision on their entitlement to the appropriate committee. This has only happened twice since 1933. The resolution can also refer both the prima facie right and final right to the seat to the committee without allowing anyone to be sworn in. Refusing to seat a Member-elect is rare, and this option has only been used twice on the first day of a new Congress and once during a Congress. In rare cases, a Member-elect may be denied the opportunity to take the oath of office on the first day of the new Congress due to irregularities in the state process. The House may decide to seat the Member-elect provisionally and refer the final decision to the committee. This has only occurred twice since 1933. If a resolution not to seat anyone is adopted, it nullifies a previously issued certificate of election. The committee is then responsible for investigating the challenged election and reporting back to the House. The committee in the new Congress may investigate election disputes, conduct recounts if necessary, hold hearings in Washington, DC, and the election district, call witnesses to testify, and recommend seating a winning candidate or declare a vacancy. The committee in the new Congress may investigate election disputes, conduct recounts if necessary, and impound records and ballots if needed. They may request state officials to retain and preserve ballots despite state laws requiring destruction after an election. The committee, with its counsel and GAO auditors, may go to the site of an election contest case to take custody of ballots, voting machines, and related materials for investigation. They can direct an examination and recount of disputed ballots, aid state officials in the process, and establish criteria for classifying ballots. The Administration Committee appointed a Task Force to investigate the election, consisting of two Democrats and one Republican. The Task Force secured all ballots and set procedures for canvassing votes. The committee noted that while it aimed to follow state election statutes, the final power of judging elections lies with the House of Representatives. The Committee on House Administration, with the assistance of GAO auditors, examines various election-related documents in contested election cases to determine the will of the electorate. They have broad power under Article I, Section 5, clause 1 of the Constitution to scrutinize election procedures and ballots. The Committee on House Administration, with the assistance of GAO auditors, has the authority to examine election procedures and ballots in contested election cases to determine voters' intentions. The committee can conduct various procedural routes, including preliminary investigations, limited recounts, and full-scale investigations if necessary. The Committee on House Administration, with the assistance of GAO auditors, has the authority to conduct investigations, including recounts, to resolve questions and issues in contested election cases. Recounts may be granted if there is evidence of fraud or irregularity, but not solely based on assertions. The Committee on House Administration, with GAO auditors, can conduct investigations and recounts in contested election cases if there is evidence of fraud or irregularity. The burden of proof lies with the contestant to show substantial fraud, change in election result, and exhaustion of state remedies before requesting a recount from the committee. The committee may reconsider the need for a recount even after initially voting for it. The Committee on House Administration, with GAO auditors, can conduct investigations and recounts in contested election cases if there is evidence of fraud or irregularity. If a recount is deemed necessary, stipulations are agreed upon by counsel for the parties subject to committee approval, including rules governing the recount process. This may involve matters such as House precedents, statutory provisions, voter qualifications, scope of recount, ballot examination procedures, and presence of press during counting. The recount process involves comparing registration and poll books, counting spoiled ballots, determining fraud or irregularities, and ensuring proper ballot marking. States have authority over federal election procedures, but each House of Congress judges its own members' elections. The House committee has the jurisdiction to independently determine the right to a seat in the House, not bound by state laws or court decisions. State laws and court decisions can be considered but are not conclusive on the House. The House committee has the final say over House contested election cases, not bound by state laws or court decisions. While they generally follow state law and court decisions, there have been instances where they have not, particularly regarding the validity of ballots. For example, in a 1902 case, ballots were accepted even if they did not meet technical state law requirements as long as the voter's intention was clear. The Committee on House Administration accepts ballots where the voter's intention is clear, even if not strictly marked within designated spaces. The House historically prioritizes counting votes over penalizing voters for errors, as long as there is no fraud and the voters' honest intent can be determined. The Committee on House Administration prioritizes counting votes and determining voters' honest intent, with remedies available including recommendations for dismissal, seating of candidates, recounts, and investigations into fraud or irregularities. The House of Representatives is hesitant to declare a seat vacant and prefers to correct returns when possible. Setting aside an election and declaring a seat vacant is seen as a drastic action that should be avoided in most cases. Contested election cases are generally resolved through a House resolution after consideration and debate on the House floor. Contested election cases in the House of Representatives are resolved through a privileged resolution that can be called up at any time for consideration. The resolution, along with the committee report, may be agreed to by voice vote without debate. Parties involved in the contest may be present during the debate, and the contestee, if a Member, may participate. Adoption of the resolution by the House ends the contested election case by declaring a party entitled to a seat or declaring a vacancy. Resolution passed by the House of Representatives, administered oath of office to the prevailing party, and seated in the House."
