    "content": "The Inspector General Act, as amended, will reach its 30th anniversary in 2008, with over 60 offices of inspectors general (OIGs) established. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform played a key role in their origination in 1976. There are two types of Inspectors General: federal establishment IGs appointed by the President and designated federal entity (DFE) IGs appointed by agency heads in smaller agencies. The mandates and statutory supports for the IGs offer insight into current proposals for modification. The Inspector General Act, as amended, has led to the establishment of over 60 offices of inspectors general (OIGs) with significant independence, authority, and resources to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. IGs have powers to conduct audits, investigations, recommend policies, access agency information, and receive confidential complaints. The Inspector General Act grants significant independence and authority to over 60 offices of inspectors general (OIGs). They are required to remain confidential, implement cash incentive programs for employee disclosures, have independent law enforcement authority, report violations of federal law to the Attorney General, and operate under the general supervision of the agency head. They must also keep the agency head and Congress fully informed. The Inspector General Act grants independence and authority to over 60 OIGs, who must report violations of federal law to the Attorney General and operate under agency head supervision. OIGs must keep Congress informed through semi-annual and immediate reports, enhancing legislative oversight and potential support for findings and recommendations. H.R. 928 and S. 1723 aim to address congressional concerns by modifying the IG Act. The proposed changes in H.R. 928 and S. 1723 aim to strengthen the authority, tenure, resources, oversight, and independence of inspectors general. This includes additional protections such as \"for cause\" removal, consolidation of councils, budget reporting, program evaluation in reports, and granting law enforcement authority to IGs in federal entities. The House passed H.R. 928 and S. 1723 to strengthen the authority, tenure, resources, oversight, and independence of inspectors general in federal entities. The Bush Administration threatened to veto H.R. 928 due to provisions like removal for cause and an independent IG Council. Presidentially appointed IGs currently have limited protection from removal. The House passed H.R. 928 and S. 1723 to strengthen the authority, tenure, resources, oversight, and independence of inspectors general in federal entities. The removal provision for establishment IGs may be changed to require removal by the President for cause on specified grounds. This includes permanent incapacity, inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or conviction of a felony. S. 1723 aims to limit the President's authority to remove officials appointed with Senate consent by specifying grounds for removal, including neglect of duty, malfeasance, conviction of a felony, and other misconduct. It also requires agency heads to provide written reasons for the removal of inspectors general within 15 days before taking action. The President's authority to remove officials appointed with Senate consent is being limited by S. 1723, which specifies grounds for removal and requires agency heads to provide written reasons for removal of inspectors general. The Bush Administration argues against limiting the President's removal authority, citing constitutional concerns, but the Supreme Court has upheld congressional conditions on the President's removal power in the past. The Supreme Court upheld congressional conditions on the President's power of removal, stating that officials can only be removed for specific causes outlined in the statute to maintain separation of powers. This decision was further expanded in Morrison v. Olson, removing limitations on officers performing executive functions. The Supreme Court upheld congressional conditions on the President's power of removal, stating that officials can only be removed for specific causes outlined in the statute to maintain separation of powers. In Morrison v. Olson, the Court established a two-step balancing test for separation of powers situations, allowing Congress to provide \"for cause\" removal protection to advice and consent officers. The Court held that congressional restrictions on the Attorney General's removal power did not violate the principle of separation of powers. The Supreme Court upheld congressional conditions on the President's removal power, allowing for specific causes outlined in statutes to maintain separation of powers. Congress can provide \"for cause\" removal protection to officers, ensuring independence of the office. Congress has the authority to limit removal of individuals by the President or agency head, granting protection for various reasons. The removal of appointed officials can be for various reasons, ranging from neglect of duty to malfeasance in office. Different positions have different levels of protection from removal, with some requiring specific causes for removal. Congress has the authority to limit the removal of individuals by the President or agency head, ensuring independence of the office. The removal of appointed officials can be for various reasons, such as inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. Different positions have different levels of protection from removal, with specific causes required for removal. Congress has the authority to limit removal by the President or agency head, ensuring independence of the office. The removal of appointed officials can be for various reasons, such as inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. Specific grounds for removal are specified in H.R. 928 and S. 1723 to protect IGs from being removed based on policy reasons or disagreements with their determinations. This ensures independence of the office and limits removal by the President or agency head. The removal for cause provision, such as \"neglect of duty or malfeasance,\" maintains IGs' independence. \"For cause\" removal requires minimal due process, as seen in the case of Humphrey's Executor. President Roosevelt's removal of Commissioner Humphrey was contested in court successfully. No \"for cause\" removal officer has been fired by the President since Humphrey, leaving no mechanism to assess presidential removal appropriateness. The removal for cause requirement aims to protect the independence of Inspectors General (IGs) by preventing their firing without cause. This could hinder the removal of an IG whose investigations are problematic for the agency. However, it may also limit the President's and agency heads' discretion in removing underperforming IGs. An alternative approach in H.R. 928 involves notifying the IG and Congress 30 days in advance of a dismissal or transfer. The proposed legislation requires notifying the IG and Congress 30 days in advance of a dismissal or transfer, allowing time for challenges or inquiries. The Council of the IGs on Integrity and Efficiency would not have enforcement authority to remove an IG after investigating and reporting on allegations. The proposed legislation aims to establish fixed terms of office for all federal IGs to encourage them to stay in office for at least seven years. This change is intended to address concerns about the current system's lack of protection and tenure, which may hinder oversight effectiveness. The USPS IG is the only Inspector General with a fixed seven-year term, while other executive branch positions like the Director of the Office of Personnel Management and the Special Counsel also have fixed terms ranging from four to five years. The Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office serves for fifteen years. Proposed legislation aims to establish a seven-year renewable fixed term for all federal IGs to enhance oversight effectiveness. H.R. 928 and S. 1723 propose a seven-year fixed term for all federal IGs, aiming to enhance oversight effectiveness. Panelists discussed the issue of statutory IG terms of office, with a majority not favoring the idea. The proposal for a seven-year fixed term for federal IGs in H.R. 928 and S. 1723 is being debated. Concerns include the impact on IG independence and continuity of operations. Some suggest a longer single term without reappointment to address these issues. Clarification is needed on the term of office section in the bills. The bills H.R. 928 and S. 1723 propose a seven-year term for federal IGs, with the possibility of serving more than one term. However, there is a need for clarification on whether reappointment and confirmation would be required before serving another full term. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's amendment to H.R. 928 addresses a technical issue with the Peace Corps IG's tenure limit, which ranges from five to eight and a half years. The bill's term limit would apply to IGs appointed after the enactment date, excluding those appointed before. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's amendment to H.R. 928 proposes a two-and-a-half year extension for Peace Corps IGs to promote continuity of functions. H.R. 928 and S. 1723 aim to establish a Council of IGs on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) to merge existing councils and reduce overlap. Concerns include the potential size of the new collective. The proposed Council of IGs on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) would be an interagency council including relevant executive agencies and officials, with membership extending to IGs from the Central Intelligence Agency and the Government Printing Office. There are concerns about the appropriateness of a legislative branch IG being a member of an interagency council chaired by an executive official, but the CIGIE would have a secondary chairperson selected from the council's membership. The proposed CIGIE would require recommendations for appointments to various IG offices, potentially allowing executive branch officials to influence appointments in legislative branch agencies. This could impact the internal composition of the IG office. The proposed legislation would modify the composition of the IG office in a legislative branch agency, institutionalizing the current structure endorsed by past Presidents. It would also enhance congressional oversight and create a separate appropriation account for CIGIE appropriations, along with establishing an Integrity Committee to handle allegations of wrongdoing. The Bush Administration objects to codifying the existing councils PCIE and ECIE as CIGIE, citing concerns about impeding the President's authority. H.R. 928 and S. 1723 propose adding \u00a7 11(d) to the IG Act to establish the Integrity Committee of the CIGIE, which would handle allegations of wrongdoing. The Integrity Committee of the CIGIE would receive and review allegations of wrongdoing against Inspectors General and certain staff members. It is unclear how allegations against an IG would be referred to the committee, but the committee is mandated to review all allegations it receives. The Integrity Committee of the CIGIE is required to review all allegations of wrongdoing, including those from Members of Congress or the general public. If an allegation is deemed meritorious and cannot be referred to an executive branch agency, the Chairperson must investigate according to set standards. The results are then reported to the Integrity Committee for evaluation. The Integrity Committee of the CIGIE reviews allegations of wrongdoing, including those from Members of Congress or the public. If an allegation is meritorious and cannot be referred to an executive branch agency, the Chairperson investigates and reports the results to the Integrity Committee. The Committee evaluates the report, adds recommendations, and forwards it to the Executive Chairperson and the President or agency head within 180 days. Reports must also be submitted to Congress within 30 days. In H.R. 928, the Chairperson reports actions taken by the President or agency head based on the Committee's findings. If the Committee substantiates an allegation, it could be deemed a cause for the President or agency head to consider removing an IG. The IG legislation, H.R. 928 and S. 1723, would require reporting establishment IGs' initial budget estimates directly to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), agency head, and congressional committees for oversight. This change in budget reporting aims to ensure transparency and accountability in projected spending by establishment IG offices, OMB, and agency leadership. The President has objected to H.R. 928's budgetary provisions. The President has objected to H.R. 928's budgetary provisions, claiming they would allow IGs to bypass executive branch budget control by submitting budget requests directly to Congress. Historically, agencies negotiated appropriations with Congress before the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. Congress previously required agencies to submit budget estimates to both the President or OMB and Congress simultaneously. The Bush Administration objects to requiring the President to include each IG's request as a separate line item in the annual budget request. The House-passed version of H.R. 928 and the Senate version would prohibit cash bonuses and awards for both establishment and DFE IGs. The Senate version of the bill would prohibit cash bonuses and awards for establishment and DFE IGs. It would also adjust the pay rates for IGs and require them to include information about program evaluations and inspections in their reports. The IG community conducts short-term evaluations of specific projects to promote better management practices. IGs in federal establishments have law enforcement authority, and proposed bills aim to extend this authority to IGs in smaller federal entities. This expansion would enhance the criminal investigators' capabilities. The proposed bills aim to extend law enforcement authority to IGs in smaller federal entities to enhance criminal investigators' capabilities. This additional authority would require vigilant monitoring to ensure proper use of powers, training, and qualifications. The bills also seek to increase visibility of IG webpages, require online posting of reports and audits, and establish a platform for reporting fraud, waste, and abuse. S. 1723 would require IGs to appoint a Counsel and expand the CIGIE's mission to address integrity, economy, and effectiveness issues across government agencies. The House-passed H.R. 928 aims to enhance governmental efforts to promote integrity, efficiency, and prevent fraud in Federal programs. It addresses concerns about disclosure protections for the Witness Security Program to ensure the safety of witnesses and program personnel. The bill also eliminates the referral of misconduct allegations involving Department attorneys, investigators, or law enforcement personnel to the Counsel, Office of Professional Responsibility. H.R. 928 and S. 1723 aim to enhance the independence and accountability of inspectors general under the Inspector General Act of 1978. The bills propose changes in the removal of IGs, notification of OIG budget requests to Congress, fixing a term of office for IGs, and establishing a Council on Integrity and Efficiency. The House has passed H.R. 928, while the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has discussed similar proposals. The President can only remove certain officials for specific reasons such as inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. This applies to officials of various agencies including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Federal Labor Relations Authority, and Merit Systems Protection Board. Other positions can only be removed for neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or ineligibility, while some can be removed for general cause. The President can remove certain officials for specific reasons like inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. This applies to officials of various agencies including the Postal Rate Commission, Federal Trade Commission, and National Transportation Safety Board. Other positions can be removed for cause, while some require the President to communicate reasons for removal to the Senate or Congress. Officials in various agencies can be removed by the President for reasons like inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. Positions such as Chief Medical Officer, Comptroller of the Currency, and Director of the Mint have specific removal clauses under different statutes."
