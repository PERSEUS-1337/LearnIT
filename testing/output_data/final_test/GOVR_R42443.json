    "content": "Many media reports have focused on differences between the Netanyahu government in Israel and the Obama Administration on potential \"red lines\" for military action. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu tried to persuade President Obama to present Iran with a time-specific ultimatum, but prospects for Israeli military action remain unclear. This information may help U.S. policymakers address relevant questions within the context of regional and global concerns. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu may order a military attack on Iranian nuclear facilities in the coming months, sparking a vigorous public debate in Israel. Various leaders have expressed opposition to an attack without U.S. support. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is considering ordering a military attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, with concerns raised about the potential fallout without U.S. support. Netanyahu emphasized the need for a clear red line to deter Iran and allow for more time for sanctions and diplomacy. Former Israeli officials have been convinced by Netanyahu's remarks. Netanyahu's remarks in 2013 pushed back the timeline for a possible Israeli attack on Iran. Speculation persists despite efforts like diplomacy and sanctions, with concerns that military action might only delay, not destroy, Iran's nuclear program. In August 2012, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon called for international acknowledgment of failed diplomacy regarding Iran's nuclear program. Congress and the President enacted the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, imposing additional sanctions on Iran's oil exports. These sanctions, along with existing ones, are significantly impacting Iran's economy. The August 2012 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report on Iran's nuclear program expressed concerns over continued enrichment and possible military dimensions. Israeli officials may seek additional sanctions due to worries about Iran's nuclear weapons capability and faulty information provided by Iran to international monitors. Israeli officials are concerned about Iran providing faulty information about its nuclear program to international monitors, which may raise doubts about the reliability of current information. Media attention on Israeli security cabinet deliberations regarding military action has increased, with approximately six members in favor of a strike and three or four opposed. Netanyahu's control over the decision-making process is highlighted, but the implications of emphasizing home front safety and streamlined cabinet procedures are unclear. Netanyahu appointed Avi Dichter, a former head of the Israel Security Agency, as Home Front Defense Minister, giving him significant influence over national security decisions. Disbanding security cabinet meetings due to leaks of disagreements over Iran's \"zone of immunity\" raised questions about when Netanyahu might call a vote in the cabinet. Netanyahu's decision to call a vote in the security cabinet and/or the full 29-member cabinet remains uncertain. His approval ratings have dropped from over 50% in March to 31% in August, which could impact his electoral prospects in the upcoming national elections. Polls show that most Israelis oppose a unilateral strike on Iran but would support a joint U.S.-Israel strike. Ehud Olmert, Israel's former prime minister, has hinted at a potential political comeback. Israeli leaders are considering the option of a military operation to defend the country's existence, but are trying to work with the international community first. There is ongoing debate in Israel about the likelihood and advisability of an attack, with some analysts suggesting that preparations are being made for the aftermath. Previous military attacks by Israel were carried out without prior warning. Israeli leaders are considering a military operation to defend the country's existence, with ongoing debate about the likelihood and advisability of an attack. Israeli censorship limits public discussion of operational details, but sources suggest potential military capabilities and outcomes. Netanyahu may risk severe consequences to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb. Israeli leaders are considering a military operation to defend the country's existence, with ongoing debate about the likelihood and advisability of an attack. U.S. and international sources have provided information on the complexity and high risk of an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, with potential devastating regional consequences. Some commentators claim leaked information on possible operational details of Israeli military action. Israeli leaders are considering military action to delay Iran's nuclear program, with Defense Minister Barak stating that a two-year delay would be worth it. The objective is not to eliminate the program but to delay it to potentially bring about the fall of the current regime in Iran. Former Mossad head Meir Dagan opposes an Israeli strike, warning it could lead to a regional war and strengthen the Iranian regime. The internal problems of the Islamic Republic of Iran could be galvanized by a possible Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, creating unity and justifying Iran's nuclear project. U.S. concerns and potential responses could impact Israeli decision-making, with differences between Israel and the Obama Administration over the Iranian nuclear issue. General Martin Dempsey's comments in August 2012 may have been partly motivated by U.S. concerns about regional and international perceptions of U.S. involvement in a potential Israeli attack. General Martin Dempsey's comments in August 2012, President Obama's address at the U.N. General Assembly in September 2012, and the Administration's rejection of Israeli requests for firm deadlines and a meeting with Netanyahu highlighted U.S.-Israel differences on preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. In a September 2012 interview, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions and the need for red lines to be drawn. The U.S. emphasized the importance of sanctions and negotiations with Iran, leading to varying responses from Members of Congress regarding U.S.-Israel security cooperation on the issue. Former Obama White House national security official Dennis Ross suggested that senior American officials should inquire about providing additional military capabilities to Israel, such as bunker-busting bombs, refueling tankers, and targeting information. The United States has scaled back its participation in a joint missile defense exercise with Israel, known as Austere Challenge 12. Joint military maneuvers involving the United States and over 30 other countries took place in the Persian Gulf in late September, potentially in anticipation of Iranian reactions to an Israeli strike. Israeli leaders are considering various factors in their decision-making process. Israeli leaders are considering Iran's potential response to an attack on its nuclear facilities, with Iranian military commanders and Hezbollah's leader indicating robust retaliation. Iran may also target U.S. positions in the Gulf, as evidenced by recent missile tests and planned military maneuvers. There are concerns about a possible preemptive strike by Iran against Israel, and reports of Iran's involvement in cyberattacks against U.S. banks and companies. Several reports allege Hezbollah involvement in the July 2012 bus suicide bombing in Burgas, Bulgaria, targeting an Israeli tourist group. Congress has taken actions in 2012 relevant to the Iranian nuclear issue, including enacting additional sanctions against Iran in August 2012. The broader strategic purpose of these plots, whether to deter or provoke Israeli or international action, is unclear. The U.S.-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 focused on bolstering Israeli capabilities against Iran by expediting arms sales, providing defense articles, enhancing coordination, and supporting missile defense programs. Additionally, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 aimed to further strengthen security cooperation between the U.S. and Israel. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 (H.R. 4310) may authorize up to $680 million in additional funding for Iron Dome from FY2012 to FY2015. Israel has already spent over $200 million on the system's development. The House Armed Services Committee may condition further U.S. funding on co-production or technology sharing. The Senate passed S.J.Res. 41 expressing Congress' rejection of relying on containment for a nuclear weapons-capable Iran. The resolution does not authorize the use of force or declare war. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta suggested Israel may strike Iran in the coming months. Secretary Panetta declined to speculate on a potential Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities in spring 2012, amid ongoing discussions and media reports on the issue. Despite years of scrutiny by experts and the IAEA, the true intentions behind Iran's nuclear activities remain unclear. Definitive proof is needed to confirm Iran's peaceful nuclear intentions under the NPT, amid concerns of Iran's potential nuclear capability and allegations of seeking nuclear weapons. Analysts disagree on Iran's progress towards nuclear weapons, adding to the ambiguity and uncertainty surrounding Iran's nuclear efforts. The ambiguity surrounding Iran's nuclear efforts influences international policies. Israel's threat perception is more affected by a nuclear-armed Iran than the US. Israel has previously conducted airstrikes to prevent regional actors from acquiring nuclear weapons. Israeli leaders have hinted at the possibility of similar action against Iran. Analysts agree that Israeli military action against Iranian nuclear facilities would be more complex than previous attacks. The potential impact of an Israeli decision on Iran is a critical concern for Congress. Israel has deferred to the US in diplomatic efforts to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In recent years, reports suggest that Israel has used covert means to intimidate Iran and delay its nuclear program, with some success. Israeli officials have hinted at the possibility of unilateral action against Iran's nuclear ambitions. The issue came into sharper focus for U.S. policymakers in the first three months of 2012. The report assesses the potential Israeli government decision to strike Iran's nuclear facilities, which could impact U.S. interests and relations with Israel. Israeli officials have hinted at unilateral action against Iran, intensifying global debate on military intervention. The report evaluates the Israeli government's potential decision to strike Iran's nuclear facilities and its implications for U.S. interests and relations with Israel. Key questions include the nature of the debate in Israel over military options, the factors influencing Israeli decision-making, and the potential impact on Iran's nuclear program and regime. The potential nuclear weapons program in Iran raises questions about Israel's potential military action and its impact on international efforts to prevent Iran from weaponizing. The report evaluates the implications of an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities and its potential effects on U.S. interests and relations with Israel. The report discusses the potential consequences of an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, including the likelihood of retaliation against Israeli and U.S. targets, the impact on global energy prices, and the debate within Israeli leadership on the threat posed by a nuclear-capable Iran. The debate within Israeli leadership regarding the threat posed by a nuclear-capable Iran revolves around concerns of potential Iranian aggression towards Israel despite the risk of retaliation. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu highlighted Iran's threats against Israel's existence, while other officials like Defense Minister Barak and Mossad director Pardo downplay the existential nature of the threat. The Mossad intelligence agency and Israeli analysts debate the threat of a nuclear Iran, with some officials expressing concerns about compromising Israeli security doctrine and practices. They worry that a nuclear Iran would lead to national security uncertainty and damage the quality of life for Israelis. The fear of a nuclear Iran among Israelis is based on concerns that even the possession of a nuclear weapon by Iran could lead to a mass exodus of Jews from Israel, weakening the state and compromising the Zionist dream. Additionally, there are worries that Iran's nuclear capability could increase regional influence and pose threats to Israeli security through proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas. Some in Israel argue that Iran's nuclear weapons capability may not deter Israeli military action against regional threats. Concerns include potential proliferation in countries like Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, and pressure on Israel to disclose or give up its nuclear weapons. Debate continues on whether the risks of a nuclear-capable Iran outweigh the uncertainties of a strike to halt Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu faces a challenging decision. Netanyahu faces a difficult choice regarding a potential strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, weighing the risks of regional conflict against the threat of Iran going nuclear. Israeli officials are hesitant to discuss the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran, with some considering the idea of mutual deterrence. The 2008 memorandum from Israel's Institute for National Security Studies discusses the potential of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons and questions the applicability of Cold War-era containment strategies in regional nuclear conflicts. Some Israeli public figures are less hesitant to consider the risks of a nuclear-armed Iran. Israel's national security doctrine emphasizes its right to defend itself against a potential nuclear threat from Iran. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that Israel cannot rely on others for its security and must act independently. Israeli Defense Minister Barak outlined parameters for Israel's ability to take preventive action. Israeli Defense Minister Barak warned that the window for a preventive strike against Iran's nuclear program could close within nine months, as Iran moves towards a \"zone of immunity\" by spreading its nuclear facilities. Barak's concerns are supported by Iran's actions at the Fordow facility. The impact of U.S. military planners' views on Israeli decision-making remains uncertain. According to a February 2012 New York Times article, a senior Obama Administration official discussed various options to slow Iran's progress towards a nuclear weapon, such as cutting off Iran's oil revenues or targeting facilities involved in the nuclear program. The concept suggests that Iran might use IAEA-monitored facilities to produce weapons-grade enriched uranium, which would be unprecedented for an NPT party. If Iran were to enrich uranium at Fordow or Natanz under IAEA safeguards, the international community would likely be informed due to the difficulty of diverting significant amounts of material. The Israeli debate on potential military action against Iran is seen as a way to intimidate and push for tougher international action. The issue of Israeli independent action is closely tied to U.S. attitudes and efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The Israeli leaders are dissatisfied with U.S. responses regarding assurances of using force against Iran if non-military measures fail. Israel has asked Obama for these assurances, but his refusal has influenced Israel's stance on potential military action. The Israeli leaders are dissatisfied with U.S. responses regarding assurances of using force against Iran if non-military measures fail. Amos Yadlin questions if Israel can rely on U.S. promises. Israeli officials may consider giving more time for sanctions before military options. Israeli officials are concerned about the timeline for sanctions against Iran, with American sources suggesting more time is available. Sanctions imposed by the US and EU are affecting Iran's economy, particularly its crude oil exports. The expulsion of Iranian banks from the SWIFT system could further impact the regime. It remains uncertain how these economic pressures will influence Iran's behavior and policies. The economic impact on the Iranian regime and its people could affect their behavior and policy, especially regarding a possible return to international diplomacy. Talks between Iran and the P5+1 in spring 2012 will determine if sanctions are effective or if Iran is advancing towards a military nuclear capability. Israeli officials are unsure if covert actions against Iran's nuclear program could prevent the need for an air strike. Israeli officials, including Mossad leaders Meir Dagan and Ephraim Halevy, believe that sabotage and diplomacy have been effective in delaying Iran's nuclear program. They emphasize the need for international efforts to address the Iranian issue. Despite concerns about potential military action, some Israeli military intelligence officials suggest covert actions may be necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear capabilities. Israeli officials, including Mossad leaders, believe that sabotage and diplomacy have delayed Iran's nuclear program. Factors influencing a possible Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities include Israeli decisionmakers' views, public debate, anticipated responses of various actors, and potential effects of a strike. Public debate in Israel on a possible strike has been intense among political and military leaders. The public debate in Israel over a possible military strike on Iran's nuclear program has divided political and military leaders. While some see military action as a last resort, others believe it could stabilize the Middle East. Israeli officials have considered various factors influencing a potential strike, including the views of decisionmakers and the effectiveness of sabotage and diplomacy in delaying Iran's nuclear program. Defense Minister Barak outlined three key questions that need affirmative responses before deciding to attack Iran: Israel's ability to cause damage to Iran's nuclear sites, international support for the attack, and exhausting all other options for containing Iran's nuclear threat. The debate among U.S. and Israeli analysts revolves around whether Israel's leaders believe the answers to these questions are \"yes\" or \"no.\" The debate among U.S. and Israeli analysts revolves around whether Israel's leaders believe the answers to three key questions are \"yes\" or \"no.\" Israeli security officials suggest that while new sanctions are being demanded, a military attack on Iran remains a real option. Israeli policymakers are focused on the immediate military implications of a strike, but may be overlooking potential longer-term aspects. The debate within Israel's leadership regarding a potential attack on Iran includes considerations of the home front, exit strategy, U.S.-Israel relations, global diplomatic fallout, world energy markets, and outcomes within Iran. There is division among top leaders, with some supporting an attack while others prefer sanctions and covert operations. Concerns exist about Israel's military capability to significantly impact Iran's nuclear program. According to Israeli leaders, there is division on whether to attack Iran, with some opposing it due to fear of backlash. Netanyahu's decision to replace key officials was seen as a strategy to remove opponents of a military strike. Former officials expressed concerns about the lack of checks on Netanyahu's decisions. The current Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Benny Gantz, is hesitant about military action against Iran, preferring sanctions and diplomacy. Former officials express concerns about Netanyahu's unchecked decision-making power. Barak acknowledges differing opinions among military personnel regarding a potential strike on Iran. Reports suggest a slight majority of Israel's security cabinet supports Netanyahu and Barak's position, with eight ministers in favor and six opposed. No decisive meeting has been held on the issue yet. Netanyahu and Minister of Defense, Ehud Barak, may easily pass a decision through the cabinet for an Israeli strike on Iran, with only two ministers expected to object. Some Israeli analysts doubt Netanyahu's willingness to launch such an attack, noting his cautious decision-making approach. Netanyahu confirmed no decision had been made during a meeting with President Obama, but expressed impatience for diplomacy and sanctions to yield results at the AIPAC conference. Netanyahu expressed impatience for diplomacy and sanctions to work in preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. He referenced historical reluctance to take action against threats, emphasizing the need to prevent annihilation. Netanyahu's stance was met with criticism, with some arguing against military confrontation with Iran. The Holocaust talk is pushing Israel towards war with Iran, with Netanyahu feeling pressured to make a decision. He emphasized the need to remove the threat of a nuclear weapon in Iran's hands, warning of the consequences if action is not taken. Netanyahu is determined to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, despite potential political risks. Israeli public opinion polls show reluctance to support an attack on Iran without U.S. cooperation. Israelis would oppose a strike by a 51%-42% margin if carried out independently. Israeli public opinion shows reluctance to support an independent strike on Iran, with 51% opposing it. However, a majority would apparently support an attack with U.S. cooperation by a 69%-26% margin. Israelis are concerned about the ability to effectively carry out a strike and maintain international support, not wanting Israel to be seen as a troublemaker. The debate over the wisdom and feasibility of a strike on Iran is a controversial subject in Israel, with security officials increasingly restricted from discussing the issue publicly. Israeli public opinion shows reluctance to support public discussion of a possible attack on Iran, with concerns about potential damage. Some commentators believe the public is resigned to the possibility of war, trusting national leaders blindly. A poll indicated that Israelis trust Netanyahu and Barak on the Iran issue. Israeli analysts argue that a public discussion would help officials make informed decisions on the issue. The public debate on a possible attack on Iran is crucial for informed decision-making by officials, despite limitations due to classified information. Civilian strategists must contribute to discussing the strategic dimensions to avoid repeating past mistakes or escalating towards a military confrontation with Iran. Minister Barak considers the need for U.S. support before approving an Israel strike. Israeli leaders value U.S. relations, military cooperation, and economic ties, and are concerned about the impact of a strike on U.S. assistance to Israel. The possible effects of a strike on U.S. political and material assistance to Israel, negative security consequences for the United States from potential Iranian retaliation, and the probability of future U.S. military action to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran may influence Israeli decision-making. Israeli unilateralism in preventing nuclear weapons in the past did not draw America into armed conflict, unlike the current situation where the U.S. remains exposed to Iranian retaliation. An Israeli strike on Iran could harm U.S. interests in the region and put American lives at risk. The U.S. defense community may react negatively, viewing it as Israeli insensitivity to U.S. priorities. Speculation suggests Israel may decide to attack before the 2012 U.S. presidential election to avoid pressure from a second-term president. Israeli decisionmakers may consider how the United States would respond to an Israeli strike on Iran, as the U.S. has implied it would act to protect Israel's security. U.S. officials have maintained a credible strike option while also highlighting potential risks to U.S. interests. President Obama emphasized the U.S.'s resolve to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and acknowledged Israel's sovereign right to make its own security decisions. Israeli leaders may find reassurance in the U.S.'s credible strike option, which could impact their calculations on the advisability of an attack on Iran. Israeli leaders' decisions may be influenced by U.S. views on addressing Iran's nuclear program, as seen in past instances where U.S. actions differed from Israeli preferences. This includes former President George W. Bush's reluctance to take military action against Syria's nuclear program, opting for diplomatic measures instead. President Obama's stance on Iran's nuclear program in 2012 also raised questions for Israeli decision-makers. In early 2012, there were differences between Israeli and U.S. officials regarding the timing and necessity of a potential strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. President Obama did not agree with Israel's belief that an attack was necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Netanyahu and Obama did not resolve this issue during their meeting on March 5. General Martin Dempsey also expressed concerns about military action in a CNN interview on February 19, 2012. General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, highlighted differences in Israeli and U.S. positions on attacking Iran. He stated that it's not advisable to attack Iran at this point and emphasized the importance of timing in discussions with Israel. President Obama also mentioned the lack of sympathy for Iran and its ally Syria before a meeting with Netanyahu. The U.S. European Command-Israel joint missile defense exercise Austere Challenge 12 was postponed to avoid perceptions of joint U.S.-Israel planning for a possible Israeli attack on Iran. Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized Israel's prerogative to act independently in his March 2012 visit to Washington, DC. Netanyahu also stressed Israel's need to defend itself against any threat in his AIPAC speech. After Netanyahu's meetings with U.S. congressional leaders in March 2012, Senator Carl Levin suggested that Israel might attack Iran if it does not comply with international demands to stop uranium enrichment. Netanyahu's spokesman stated that no clear signal was given during the meetings. Netanyahu referenced past Israeli decisions made without U.S. knowledge in a speech to the Knesset on March 14. The 1981 strike on Osirak by Israel raised concerns about potential international isolation and damage to political and economic relations with key countries like China and Russia. The United Nations Security Council condemned the strike as a violation of international norms. Some analysts suggest that if an Israeli attack delays Iran's nuclear program without significant costs to other countries, it may be viewed positively in retrospect. However, potential reactions from other Middle Eastern actors and ongoing political changes in the region could impact the situation. Israeli decisionmakers are considering the consequences of further alienating neighboring Arab states, which could lead to increased regional conflict, hinder diplomatic progress on the Palestinian issue, and affect the U.S. regional profile. Israeli deliberations on potential strike against Iran are influenced by operational capability concerns. Despite challenges, military thinkers believe Israel Air Force can overcome difficulties with improvisation and planning. Some analysts question the likelihood of success in such an attack. Israeli analysts question the likelihood of success in an attack on Iranian facilities, citing potential challenges such as planes getting lost or missing targets. A senior Israeli official expressed doubts about the ability to significantly impact Iran's nuclear program. Despite this, a majority of Jewish Israelis believe in the military's capability to damage Iran's nuclear program, but doubt the effectiveness of an Israeli attack without U.S. cooperation. Jewish Israelis doubt that an Israeli attack without U.S. cooperation could effectively halt Iran's nuclear program. Analysts believe the Israel Air Force would face challenges in destroying Iran's nuclear capability due to technical limitations and the need for a large-scale air campaign lasting weeks. Former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden stated that Israel lacks the capacity for airstrikes to significantly impact Iran's nuclear program. An Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities would be challenging due to the distance from Israeli bases and unfriendly airspace. A U.S. defense analyst believes it would likely be a one-time event, as Israeli aircraft would have to cross multiple countries' airspace to reach Iran. Israeli strike aircraft would have limited opportunities to strike, but the quality of munitions and targeting abilities could make a significant impact in one wave. Israel may face challenges in conducting an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities due to the distance and unfriendly airspace. The most direct route over Iraq is considered, as Iraq lacks air defenses and the US no longer has the obligation to defend Iraqi skies. Israel has experience operating in foreign airspace with little detection, but larger support aircraft for a long-range strike on Iran may pose a challenge. Israel may rely on technological and logistical advantages to elude interception during its overflight of third-party countries. Saudi Arabia may have granted advance permission for Israel to overfly its territory, and a humbled Iran would be the overriding interest for countries in the region. Israel's intricate attack plan could be derailed by active resistance from surface-to-air missiles or intercepting aircraft. The distance to targets and size of the strike package would strain Israel's aerial refueling capability. Potential targets for an Israeli strike include enrichment plants at Natanz and Fordow, the facility at Isfahan, and the heavy-water reactor at Arak. The larger Russian-built reactor at Bushehr may not be targeted. The Israeli attack plan may face challenges from resistance and limited aerial refueling capacity. Potential targets include enrichment plants at Natanz and Fordow, the facility at Isfahan, and the heavy-water reactor at Arak. The larger Russian-built reactor at Bushehr is less likely to be targeted due to its lower relevance to weapons work. Israel's tanker fleet may need to refuel twice during missions to Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran has been acquiring old Boeing 707 airliners and converting them into airborne tankers, with the Israeli Air Force having around eight or nine such tankers. Analysts have differing opinions on the effectiveness of Iranian air defenses, with some noting the outdated missile systems but others suggesting a modern, coordinated network. There is speculation that Russia may have supplied Iran with more advanced air defense systems, potentially impacting the attrition rate of Israeli aircraft in a strike. Analysts estimate that Israeli aircraft attrition rate in an air strike could be higher. An attack on Esfahan, Natanz, and Arak may require 20% of Israel's fighters, but striking Fordow and other facilities would need more F-15Is. Israeli aircraft would likely need to carry maximum payloads to damage suspected WMD targets. Israel's aerial combat force is larger than countries like Britain and Germany, with around 350 fighter jets. Facilities at Esfahan and Arak can be attacked with various weaponry, while underground or hardened structures can be targeted with precision-guided bunker-buster weapons. The United States has sold two types of these weapons to Israel, including the Guided Bomb Unit (GBU)-27 2000-lb class weapon. The GBU-28 5000-lb class weapon is capable of penetrating at least 20 feet of concrete and 100 feet of earth. It is considered a key weapon for targeting hard and underground sites like Natanz. Israel also possesses Jericho II medium-range ballistic missiles that could be used against above-ground targets, allowing aircraft to focus on hardened targets. The accuracy and capacity of these ballistic missiles against targets in Iran remain unclear. From a weaponeering perspective, Fordow presents a unique challenge due to its location inside a mountain. Israel's current earth-penetrating munitions may not be effective against the facility, requiring precise strikes on reinforced entrance doors. Missiles are not suitable for this task, and it is uncertain if Israel has acquired more sophisticated systems for such targets. Damaging the facility directly may not be necessary to disrupt its functionality, as seen with centrifuges. Damaging a facility directly can disrupt its functionality, as seen with centrifuges that require precision to work. An explosion strong enough to damage walls at Natanz could ruin centrifuges, with one to two GBU-28s enough to shatter the reinforced dome. At Fordow, the challenge lies in isolating centrifuges from shock and blast effects. A hypothetical U.S. strike on Fordow may have outcomes short of destroying the centrifuge hall. The text discusses the possibility of targeting underground nuclear facilities at Natanz and Fordow using bunker-busting munitions. Former Senator Charles S. Robb and retired Air Force General Charles Wald suggested providing Israel with GBU-31 munitions to effectively knock the plants out of action. The GBU-31s have a more precise guidance kit than Israel's existing GBU-28s, increasing the likelihood of success in damaging the facilities. The Israeli Prime Minister may have requested additional GBU-28s and tanker aircraft from the US during a trip to Washington in March 2012. Israeli officials are considering the impact of a military strike on Iran's nuclear program, with the assessment that a successful strike could delay the program by three to five years. In February 2012, a senior Israeli official stated that Israel's air capabilities could only delay Iran's nuclear program by a few months to a year. However, in March 2012, there was optimism among Israeli officials that a strike within six months could set back Iran's nuclear ambitions by at least five years. Israeli officials have not focused on technical details in open sources. Israeli officials and analysts have not openly discussed technical details that could reveal potential attack plans and influence decision-making. The censor's office in Israel prevents the publication of sensitive information related to state security. Public discussions should avoid operational details of military actions to protect operational plans and Israeli capabilities. The lack of detailed intelligence on the Iranian nuclear program and IDF's operational capabilities hinders public discourse on potential military actions. In the United States, discussions on this issue may offer insights into the considerations Israeli leaders are facing. Israeli leaders are considering a military attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. General Martin Dempsey believes Israel can delay Iran's nuclear weapons program for a couple of years, but some targets may be out of reach. An attack leaving Iran's conversion and centrifuge facilities intact could shorten the reconstitution timeline. The reconstitution timeline for Iran's nuclear program is uncertain due to various factors like centrifuge numbers and remaining usable uranium. Director of National Intelligence Clapper stated that predicting the time needed for Iran to rebuild its program is complex. Reconstitution would involve not just producing nuclear material but also developing warheads and delivery systems. Israeli officials are aware that a military strike may not permanently halt Iran's nuclear ambitions. Israeli officials are considering periodic follow-up attacks on Iran's nuclear program to disrupt operations and increase costs. They hope to slow down the program while international sanctions weaken the economy and reduce political support for the regime. Former military intelligence head Amos Yadlin suggests that tough sanctions and inspections could prevent Iran from fully resuming its nuclear activities. Israeli officials are considering periodic follow-up attacks on Iran's nuclear program to disrupt operations and increase costs. Former IAF commander Eitan Ben-Eliyahu believes the success of any military operation in Iran depends on follow-up diplomatic activity. The effect of an air strike on Iran's regime's popularity and durability is unclear in Israeli decision-making. U.S. officials have cited analyses indicating that military action against Iran's nuclear program may only postpone its nuclear weapons development for a year or two. Analyses suggest that military action against Iran's nuclear program, especially by Israel, could potentially exacerbate internal divisions within Iranian society and government. US officials acknowledge growing rifts among Iranian elites and economic strain from international sanctions, but they do not see these divisions as an immediate threat to the regime. However, ongoing trends and past uprisings indicate a weakening grip on power by the regime. US policymakers are wary of any actions that could further destabilize the regime. The consequences of a military strike on Iran's nuclear program could potentially strengthen the regime and increase domestic support. Israeli leaders believe that the Tehran government is unpopular and a targeted attack on its nuclear facilities might be welcomed by Iranian citizens. However, there is no guarantee that a successor regime would be less inclined to pursue a nuclear program. Israeli leaders may not be concerned about preserving the Iranian regime, as a successor regime might be less likely to pursue a nuclear weapons program. Regime change is seen as a long-term solution to make Iran's nuclear program less dangerous. Iranian Supreme Leader Khamene'i warned of retaliation to threats of war and sanctions. The potential consequences of a strike on Iran's nuclear program are a significant factor in Israel's decision-making. Israeli reporting avoids detailed Iranian response scenarios, but Israeli leaders and public opinion polls suggest confidence in Israel's ability to withstand retaliation. Iran could choose various courses of action beyond a direct response against Israel. Secretary Panetta raised concerns about the potential unintended consequences of an attack on Iran, including retaliation against the United States, economic impacts on Europe and the U.S., and the escalation of conflict in the Middle East. Iran could also choose other courses of action besides a direct response against Israel. Iran could respond to an Israeli strike with a diplomatic reaction to garner international sympathy and portray itself as a victim of aggression. Iran could respond to an Israeli strike by trying to reconstitute its nuclear program in hardened sites, potentially convincing countries to abandon sanctions. Iran could respond to an Israeli strike by reconstituting its nuclear program in hardened sites, potentially leading to a halt in IAEA monitoring and NPT withdrawal. This could impact Israeli decision-making and undermine the international legal basis for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Israeli leaders must consider the possibility of Iran expanding its response beyond Israel-related targets. Iranian officials warned of \"appalling retaliation\" for an Israeli air strike, potentially targeting the United States and its allies. Supreme Leader Khamene'i stated Iran would defend itself against attacks by the U.S. or Israel on the same level. Israeli officials are prepared for potential Iranian retaliation. Israeli officials are prepared for potential Iranian retaliation, expecting up to 200,000 rockets and missiles in enemy hands in Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Gaza. These threats could lead to a regional war involving other states. Israeli officials are concerned about potential Iranian retaliation, with up to 200,000 rockets and missiles in enemy hands in Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Gaza. Reports indicate that Israel's civil defense preparedness is lacking, with 1.7 million Israelis lacking access to bomb shelters and a need for $256 million to provide gas masks for 40% of the population. Israeli officials are worried about potential Iranian retaliation, with concerns over the lack of civil defense preparedness and access to bomb shelters. A poll showed disagreement with Defense Minister Barak's statement on potential casualties in case of an attack on Iran. The majority believes the number of casualties would be higher, with many reports discussing the possibility of an Israeli air strike and Iran's potential missile strikes. Iranian leaders are likely considering missile strikes against Israel to provoke escalation and potentially involve the United States. Pressure from key constituencies like the IRGC may push them to respond to an Israeli strike. Israel is expected to deploy its ballistic missile defense before attacking Iran, who has medium-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching anywhere in Israel. Iran has developed various ballistic missiles, including the liquid-fueled Shahab-3 and solid-fueled Sejil-1 and Sejil-2 MRBMs with ranges exceeding 2,000 kilometers. Estimates suggest Iran has less than 50 Shahab-3 launchers and 25-100+ Shahab-3 missiles. The potential Israeli casualties from an Iranian ballistic missile counter-attack are difficult to predict due to the conventional yields and inaccuracies of the missiles. Casualties could be significant if large population densities are targeted in city cores. If a missile attack hits city cores with large population densities, casualties could be high. Israeli analysts believe Iran may use Hezbollah to retaliate, as they have supplied them with thousands of missiles. However, Hezbollah has become a powerful force in Lebanon and may choose to avoid conflict with Israel. Iran's influence over Hamas in Gaza has weakened due to unrest in Syria. Hamas's ties with Iran have strained, leading to divisions within Hamas. Iran is now focusing on strengthening ties with Hamas's Gaza leadership and providing resources to Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Iran is providing more resources to Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) in Gaza to maintain influence in case of further strain with Hamas. Both groups have rockets capable of hitting Israel, but their ability to carry out major attacks is uncertain. Israel's retaliation capabilities and Iron Dome defense system add to the uncertainty of Iran's support. Israel has deployed its Iron Dome short-range missile defense system and other ballistic missile defense capabilities to counter possible rocket barrages. The United States contributes to cooperative BMD programs with Israel, including David's Sling and Arrow systems. Israel has high confidence in these BMD systems but has not tested them extensively. Israel has high confidence in its deployed BMD systems, including Arrow, Patriot, and Iron Dome. Concerns have been raised about the performance and cost of these systems in wartime, especially in the face of potential retaliation by Iran and its allies. Active missile defense is expensive, with each Arrow missile costing $2.7 million and each Iron Dome projectile around $80,000. The United States also has BMD capabilities in theater that could support Israel. The United States has naval and other BMD capabilities that could support Israel in dealing with an Iranian ballistic missile counter-attack. Iran may target Israeli facilities and diplomats abroad as part of its retaliatory strategy, with involvement from the IRGC Qods Force and Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been implicated in past bombings in Buenos Aires. There are concerns about the cost and performance of Israel's BMD systems in wartime. Iran may be attempting retaliations against Israel for assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists. Israeli leaders believe Iran could target U.S. interests in response to an Israeli strike. Israeli analysts suggest discussing potential Iranian retaliation in public debate. Possible Iranian retaliation against U.S. targets in response to an Israeli strike could lead to American involvement in a military confrontation, impacting public opinion towards Israel. US officials warn of dire consequences across the region if Israel initiates a first strike on Iran. Iranian retaliation could include closing the Strait of Hormuz, as a way to raise the cost of pressure on Iran. Israeli analysis expressed skepticism in Iran's ability to block the Strait for an extended period. Israeli decisionmakers may be concerned about possible Iranian attacks on U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf, including the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). These countries have defense agreements with the United States and have had contentious relations with Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Some GCC members have criticized Iran's nuclear program and there have been implications that Saudi Arabia would pursue nuclear weapons. Saudi Arabia and some GCC leaders support weakening Iran's influence in the region and have hinted at seeking nuclear weapons if Iran acquires them. Iran may hesitate to retaliate against GCC states due to potential support for Israeli actions. GCC states have oil loading terminals within range of Iranian missiles, recalling past attacks during the Iran-Iraq war. Israel is concerned about potential Iranian retaliation against GCC states, as it could negatively impact U.S.-Israel relations and further antagonize GCC governments and populations towards Israel. Israeli decisionmakers are also wary of how an Iranian response against U.S. interests in the region might affect U.S. views on a strike. Panetta and others anticipate Iran targeting U.S. personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. Despite the withdrawal of combat troops in 2011, there are still over 16,000 U.S. personnel in Iraq, including diplomats and security contractors. Iranian influence is present in Iraq through the Qods Force, supporting Iraqi factions and militias. Pro-Iranian Shiite militias in southern Iraq, particularly Basra, are seen as susceptible to Iranian influence, providing ample capability for retaliation. Iran has the capability to retaliate against U.S. personnel in Basra and Afghanistan. The Qods Force is believed to be arming and training anti-U.S. elements in Afghanistan, indicating potential for retaliation there as well. Additionally, the Qods Force operates in some GCC states, with occasional arrests of agents in Kuwait for spying or supporting opposition groups. Iran has the capability to retaliate against U.S. personnel in Basra and Afghanistan, with the Qods Force potentially targeting U.S. military bases, embassies, and multinational corporations in GCC states. Additionally, Iran may consider attacking a U.S. X-Band radar in Turkey as a potential threat. Iran, through the Qods Force, could retaliate against U.S. targets globally, including in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and potentially even within the United States. Concerns have been raised about increased threats to Israeli and Jewish sites in North America from Iran, leading to heightened security measures in major U.S. urban areas. Officials have increased patrols around Jewish sites in major U.S. urban areas due to concerns of possible Iranian infiltration. This is based on an alleged plot involving an Iranian-American citizen working with the Qods Force to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador in Washington, DC. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified that Iranian officials, possibly including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i, are now more willing to conduct attacks in the U.S. in response to perceived threats. U.S. assessments take into account Tehran's calculations regarding the risks of such actions. An Israeli strike on Iran could have significant implications for Members of Congress, both in the short and long term. Factors influencing the Israeli debate on military action against Iranian nuclear facilities are discussed, including the potential transformation of the regional order. Director Clapper highlighted Iran's willingness to sponsor attacks in the U.S. based on Tehran's risk assessment. The potential implications of an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities for U.S. relations, security cooperation, foreign assistance, self-defense considerations, legal and policy implications, sanctions legislation, and congressional oversight."
