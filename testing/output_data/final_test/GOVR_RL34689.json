    "content": "The price of crude oil has been increasing and volatile over the past 13 years, leading to high gasoline prices and negatively impacting the U.S. economy. High oil prices have put pressure on household budgets, especially during times of high unemployment and a weak housing market. Despite the negative effects on the economy, oil industry giants like ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips have seen record profits, raising concerns among policymakers about whether these profits are justified or constitute a \"windfall\" gain. The oil industry's record profits have raised concerns about whether they constitute a \"windfall\" gain. Factors to consider include the source of price increases, industry's role in generating them, and how profits are used. Investments in oil exploration have not prevented declining output since 2006. During the 1st session of the 112th Congress, there were attempts to increase taxes on the oil and gas industry to prevent declining output since 2006. Various bills were introduced to eliminate tax incentives and preferences for major integrated oil companies, but these measures were ultimately rejected. The legislation proposed in the 1st session of the 112th Congress aimed to limit tax incentives for the oil and gas industry, including the ability to partially expense intangible drilling costs and the domestic production activity deduction. Policymakers are considering the industry's tax burden due to high profits, with some arguing that no tax incentives should be available during such times. A windfall or excess profits tax could be imposed on the oil and gas industry to increase taxes during times of high profits. This tax would be in addition to the current corporate and business income tax rates, which can be as high as 35%. The tax policy option is being evaluated based on the major oil companies' profit performance from 2003 to 2010. The text discusses the profit performance of oil companies from 2003 to 2010 and the potential implementation of a windfall profits tax. It also analyzes the viability and role of such a tax in the tax system and economy, considering the volatility of oil prices and the financial trends of major integrated oil producers. Since the late 1990s, crude oil prices have been volatile, trending upward. In July 2008, the spot market price of WTI crude oil reached an all-time high of $147 per barrel. However, with the onset of the financial crisis, the price fell to $39 per barrel in February 2009, before rising to almost $75 per barrel by the end of 2009. In 2010, the price ranged between $73 and $90 per barrel. The price of WTI crude oil was almost $75 per barrel, ranging between $73 and $90 per barrel in 2010. Unrest in the Middle East and North Africa pushed the price over $100 per barrel in April 2011. The 13-year period of increasing oil prices, starting in late 2003, was attributed to factors like a growing world economy, declining production capacity within OPEC, and financial speculation. The rise in oil prices over the past 13 years has significantly boosted the profitability of the oil industry, benefiting companies of all sizes. ExxonMobil emerged as the most profitable corporation in American history as a result. The industry consists of various companies, from major integrated oil companies to independent producers and oil service firms. Financial data indicates that the industry's largest players have seen concentrated profits, reflecting the overall high profitability of the sector. The performance of the oil industry is dominated by the five largest firms: ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips. These firms' net income constituted 90% of the total net income of integrated oil companies in the US. Revenues of the major firms have increased annually since 2003, driven by prices rather than production quantities. For example, ExxonMobil's crude oil production decreased by about 3% from 2003 to 2010. The five major oil firms did not significantly increase crude oil production despite higher prices. Chevron and BP were the only ones to produce more crude, while overall output declined by 4.5% from 2003-2010. Revenue data for the first half of 2011 showed a sharp increase in oil prices, with total revenues of $422 billion and net incomes of $32.3 billion for the five firms. Net income trends have closely followed revenue and crude oil price trends in recent years. The five major oil firms saw a significant increase in revenues and net income from 2003 to 2008, driven by higher crude oil prices. The profit rate, measured by profit margin, also increased due to the rising oil prices. The major integrated oil companies experienced mixed profit rate performance due to increasing oil prices driving up revenues and net incomes. The return on revenue was compared to the manufacturing sector's profit rate of 8.9% in 2007. The oil and gas industry's rate of return on equity (ROE) was higher than the manufacturing sector's average, with a 27% ROE in 2006. In the period of 2000-2008, the oil and gas industry's ROE was 7 percentage points higher than manufacturing, but in 2009 it fell to 4%, below the manufacturing industry average. High oil price volatility is a key factor in explaining profits in the oil industry, with recent high profits suggesting that firms were unable to respond to market signals by increasing output. The data suggests that major oil companies may have earned profits considered a \"windfall\" without expanding output or making improvements. However, their net income relative to the value of their product was not significantly higher than other industries. The industry's net income was earned across three sectors: upstream operations, downstream operations, and marketing of petroleum products. The relative importance of sectors like downstream activities in generating net income can shift over time. This cyclical pattern may not affect general corporate income taxation, but it could be significant for windfall profit taxation, especially for firms earning excess returns from crude oil ownership and production. Reinvestment of these returns can involve expanding business or investing in technological improvements. Firms maximize shareholder value by investing profits in projects with higher returns than current average. Major oil companies' capital expenditures increased by 77% from 2003 to 2007. From 2008 to 2010, expenditures fluctuated but remained significant. Some funding goes towards environmental compliance, not capacity expansion. The five major oil companies in the United States have not built a new refinery since the 1970s, relying on expanding existing facilities instead. Despite investments in exploration and production, there has been no significant increase in oil output. Cash reserves for these companies grew substantially between 2003 and 2010, reaching $63 billion, with a peak of $52.7 billion in 2007. Cash holdings for the five major oil companies increased from almost $65 billion in 2008 to over $63 billion in 2010, providing flexibility for investment opportunities. The rapid increase in oil prices and profits from 2003 to 2010 led to accumulating cash reserves. Despite declining revenues and profits in 2009, cash dividend payouts rose to over $38 billion, falling to about $31 billion in 2010. The five major oil companies saw a decrease in dividends to about $31 billion in 2010, mainly due to a 73% drop in BP's dividend payments after the Macondo oil spill. Cash reserves, dividend payouts, and stock buybacks were key factors in assessing excess profits. As crude oil prices rose in the mid-2000s, Congress considered imposing a windfall profits tax on oil and gas companies due to concerns over industry profits. Legislative proposals were discussed in multiple Congresses, and with the price of crude oil surpassing $100/barrel, the issue may be revisited. A windfall profits tax could allow the government to share in financial gains not directly linked to industry activities. Some proposals suggest using additional tax revenues from a windfall profits tax to fund subsidies for low-income individuals, energy conservation programs, alternative fuels, or deficit reduction. The concept of a windfall profits tax has been used by state and federal governments during times of economic emergencies to tax excess business profits. During economic emergencies, windfall profits taxes have been used to control large profits, such as during World Wars I and II. A windfall profits tax on health insurers was considered in 2009, and a tax on domestic crude oil production was in effect from 1980 to 1988 as part of a compromise between the Carter Administration and Congress. Some have proposed reinstating this tax, but the current situation giving rise to possible windfall profits is different from past conditions. Reinstating the oil windfall profits tax was discussed in the 1990s when crude oil prices spiked due to the crisis in the Middle East. Congressional interest in a windfall profits tax on the oil and gas industry increased after the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Several windfall profits tax bills were introduced in the 109th Congress, aiming to offset higher gasoline prices for consumers. These bills proposed either an excise tax or an income tax on windfall profits based on the price of crude oil. During the 110th Congress, legislation was introduced to impose an income tax on windfall profits, targeting the oil and gas industry. This would involve repealing the IRC \u00a7 199 deduction for domestic manufacturing activities, effectively increasing the tax rate on all profits. Using the corporate income tax system could simplify the process of imposing a windfall profits tax while minimizing adverse economic and energy market effects. During the 111th Congress, there were fewer efforts to impose a windfall profits tax on oil and gas companies. Oil prices declined in late 2008, with WTI spot prices falling to $41 per barrel by the end of the year. Prices averaged $62 per barrel in 2009 and $79 per barrel in 2010. The previous windfall profits tax from 1980 to 1988 was an excise tax based on the difference between market price and a base price. During the 109th and 110th Congress, proposed bills suggested imposing a 50% excise tax on windfall profits of domestically produced crude oil not reinvested in specific areas. The windfall profit was defined as the difference between the market price of oil and an inflation-adjusted base price. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to impose a 50% excise tax on major integrated oil companies based on the market price of oil. Some proposals in the 109th Congress suggested an income tax type windfall profit tax on crude producers and integrated oil companies with sales over $100 million in 2005 or 2006. The tax would be temporary and apply to petroleum products as well as crude oil. Another proposal involved taxing profits above a legislatively determined rate of return. During the 109th and 110th Congress, proposals were made to tax profits from crude oil and natural gas sales above a certain rate of return. The legislation aimed to tax windfall profits of major oil producers with gross revenues exceeding $100 million per year. Different proposals suggested taxing excess profits at rates ranging from 25% to 50%. During the 109th and 110th Congress, proposals were made to tax profits from crude oil and natural gas sales above a certain rate of return. The legislation aimed to tax windfall profits of major oil producers with gross revenues exceeding $100 million per year, proposing a lower rate of 25%. Other proposals in subsequent Congresses suggested taxing excess profits at rates ranging from 50% to 100%, with a Reasonable Profits Board determining reasonable profit levels. The tax on oil industry profits would fund the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. High oil prices contribute to industry profits, which are not all windfall profits. Governments collect income taxes from oil companies, with tax payments increasing between 2005 and 2007 before decreasing. Tax payments by major integrated oil companies were lower in 2009 and 2010 compared to previous years. The implementation of a windfall profits tax could increase tax revenues, but it is important to only tax the true windfall component of oil industry incomes. While the concept of a windfall profit tax seems simple in theory, accurately measuring it can be challenging. The implementation of a Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) involves a compromise between administerability and economic efficiency. Designing a WPT involves defining true windfall gains and excess profits, which are distinct concepts. The challenge lies in accurately measuring and taxing the true windfall component of oil industry incomes. A Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) aims to tax unexpected gains, distinguishing them from excess profits. Determining what constitutes excess profits can be subjective. For example, a firm's above-average profitability may be considered excessive, but not a windfall. The goal of a WPT could be to tax profits driven by prices, rather than additional output or investment. Comparing rates of return in different industries may not be appropriate for defining windfall gains. The text discusses the concept of a Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) in the oil and gas sector, aiming to tax unexpected gains driven by prices. Different types of WPT, such as excise tax and income tax, may elicit varied responses from oil producers. An excise tax on domestically produced crude oil is one option for approximating a WPT. An excise tax on domestically produced crude oil, resembling a windfall profit tax, could impact energy markets and the economy. It may increase dependence on foreign oil and affect domestic oil production by raising the marginal cost. However, other factors in the U.S. oil market could offset this effect. An excise tax on domestically produced crude oil could impact energy markets and the economy by potentially increasing dependence on foreign oil and affecting domestic oil production. However, in the current oil market where prices are typically above marginal costs, profitability could remain high even after the tax, providing an economic incentive for production. Additionally, once an oil well goes into production, operating at maximum capacity tends to maximize economic returns, making marginal production adjustments unlikely. Oil field management is primarily based on physical factors related to output. An excise tax on domestically produced oil could increase reliance on imported oil unless other policies reduce overall petroleum demand. The tax may not significantly impact consumer prices as oil prices are determined globally. Additionally, the tax could lead to reduced profits for oil producers rather than higher prices for consumers. A tax on domestically produced oil would increase production costs for firms, leading to reduced output and potential price increases. However, the tax cannot be shifted forward as higher oil prices due to the global oil market pricing. Instead, the tax would reduce the net selling price paid to producers, impacting their profits. Income tax based windfall profit taxes (WPT) may not distort output decisions of oil producers in the short-run as firms maximize profit based on market prices and production costs. A surtax on corporate income of crude oil producers could approximate a WPT without raising crude oil prices in the short-run. However, in the long-run, all taxes tend to distort resource allocation by raising production costs and reducing capital flow. In the long run, income tax windfall profit taxes may increase production costs and reduce capital flow in the oil industry, potentially leading to higher petroleum imports. However, in the short run, these taxes do not impact production decisions or import demand. Increasing marginal tax rates are unlikely to affect petroleum product prices in the short term as firms base production levels on market prices and costs. President Obama's FY2012 budget proposes to eliminate tax incentives for oil and gas producers to increase taxes paid by the industry. One option is to increase marginal tax rates by repealing the IRC \u00a7 199 deduction for domestic manufacturing activities. This option aims to address the long-term rise in production costs and potential price increases in the oil and gas sector. The IRC \u00a7 199 deduction for domestic manufacturing activities aims to increase the marginal tax rate on domestic oil and gas producers. Enacted in 2004, this deduction allows a specified percentage deduction for qualified production activities' income. It was established as a substitute for export tax benefits and is subject to a limit of 50% of allocated wages for domestic production. The IRC \u00a7 199 deduction for domestic manufacturing activities allows a deduction of up to 9% of wages allocated to domestic production, phased in from 3% in 2005 to 9% in 2010. Oil extraction is limited to a 6% deduction. The deduction applies to oil and gas products manufactured, produced, or extracted in the United States, including extraction activities. Oil-related production activities like refining and processing also qualify for a 6% deduction. Repealing the \u00a7 199 deduction would increase the top effective federal marginal tax rate for affected oil and gas producers from 32.9% to 35%. Other large corporations would maintain a top effective marginal tax rate of 32.9%, except for non-manufacturing enterprises. Repealing the deduction aims to increase the tax burden on the oil industry and recoup potential windfall profits. Raising the corporate tax rate by eliminating the deduction for the oil industry would increase business costs and reduce profitability. This could capture some windfall profits in the short-run, but may only capture a small portion. Market prices for oil, gas, and refined products are not expected to be significantly affected. In the short-run, increasing the corporate tax rate for the oil industry may not significantly impact market prices for oil, gas, or refined products. Income tax increases are also not expected to affect real output in the short-run, but could redirect resources to other industries in the long-run. Researchers have analyzed the economic impact of removing various tax incentives for oil and gas producers. Kruger's testimony suggested that removing tax incentives for oil and gas would have minimal market impacts, with little effect on world oil supply and prices. Eliminating these incentives would unlikely result in significantly higher prices for consumers or a significant reduction in domestic production. A proposal to raise corporate tax rates on domestic oil and gas producers by eliminating the \u00a7 199 deduction or imposing an excise tax on imported and domestic oil. This could target windfall profits and increase marginal tax rates, potentially leading to higher crude oil prices in the United States. A gas tax suspension could be enacted alongside an excise tax type WPT to offset price increases. The federal gas tax falls on refiners, with potential shifts in tax liability to consumers resulting in lower gas prices. Revenue consequences for the highway trust fund could occur if lost revenue is not offset. In the short-run, consumers may not respond to gas price changes, so refiners may not lower prices with a gas tax holiday. However, in the long-run, refiners could use savings from a gas tax holiday to reduce prices for consumers. A WPT on crude oil could generate significant revenues, depending on the tax rate and base. The potential revenue from a Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) depends on the type implemented - excise tax or income tax. The excise tax type has higher revenue potential with high oil prices, as it taxes the difference between market price and a base price set by Congress. On the other hand, the income tax type has lower revenue potential due to a smaller tax base. In an income-tax-type Windfall Profits Tax (WPT), taxable income is used as the tax base, which is generally smaller than book income. The proposal typically uses the average of taxable income over a lagged five-year period, resulting in a base that varies proportionately with prices. Eliminating tax preferences for oil and gas could generate substantial federal revenues, with estimates of $18.3 billion from repealing the IRC \u00a7 199 deduction and $43.6 billion from eliminating oil and gas tax preferences over a 10-year period. High crude oil prices in the late 2000s raised concerns about windfall profits for oil companies. Revenues and net income of major integrated oil companies increased with rising oil prices. Despite the high prices and volatility, oil production remained constant. Some believe that the industry's gains may be considered windfall profits, although profit rates are in line with the broader manufacturing sector. Returns in the oil and gas sector are highly volatile. Returns in the oil and gas sector are highly volatile, with profits fluctuating compared to other sectors. Imposing a Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) could have different economic consequences based on the type of tax. An excise tax WPT may reduce domestic oil production without affecting consumer prices, while an income tax WPT could impact production over time. In the long run, an income tax type Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) could potentially lead to price increases for the oil and gas industry. Another option considered in Congress is scaling back existing tax benefits, such as rescinding the \u00a7 199 domestic production deduction. This would effectively increase the marginal corporate tax rate for domestic oil and gas producers, but is unlikely to reduce output or increase prices in the short run."
