    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pharmaceutical Fiscal Accountability Act of 2002\". The Congress finds that rising prescription drug costs in the United States can be addressed by promoting access to cost-effective generic drugs, which are approved by the FDA as safe alternatives to brand-name drugs. Competition between generic and brand-name drug manufacturers can help reduce prescription drug costs significantly. SEC. 3. 180-DAY GENERIC DRUG EXCLUSIVITY FOR CERTAIN SUBSEQUENT APPLICANTS. Section 505(j)(5)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include provisions regarding drug applications and certifications. If an application contains a specific certification for a drug, the Secretary will consider it the first application submitted under this subsection for that drug if previous applicants fail to market the drug within 60 days of approval. The Secretary can approve, withdraw, or change a previously submitted application. If new patent information is submitted after the application, failure to challenge the patent within 60 days can result in consequences. The Secretary can approve, withdraw, or change a previously submitted application. Failure to challenge new patent information within 60 days can lead to consequences related to antitrust laws. SEC. 4. National Institutes of Health awards for clinical studies on new drug development. The Director of NIH will award grants or contracts to small entities for clinical research on new drugs with potential disease contributions. Designated small entities must have an exemption under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for qualifying research. The Director of NIH will prioritize funding for small entities conducting Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical research on new drugs for diseases with limited NIH funding. The National Institutes of Health allocated significantly less funding for research in the preceding fiscal year compared to clinical research on other diseases. $750 million was authorized for fiscal year 2003, with additional funding for subsequent years. SEC. 5. CONTINGENT PAYMENT FOR NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH SUPPORT FOR DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DRUGS. The Director of NIH may not award a grant for new drug development unless the entity agrees to pay 5% of profits from the new drug to NIH during the patent period. Payments under paragraph (1) for new drug development can be made directly by the entity involved or by an entity that has purchased the rights to the new drug or received a license. Amounts paid to the Director of NIH are available for grants and contracts for new drug development. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the effects of Federal funding for research and development of prescription drugs, focusing on costs and drug pricing. A report will be submitted to Congress within 1 year. Additionally, there will be a study on pharmaceutical patent extensions and market exclusivity periods. SEC. 7. STUDY ON PHARMACEUTICAL PATENT EXTENSIONS AND MARKET EXCLUSIVITY PERIODS. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on pharmaceutical patent extensions and market exclusivity periods under Federal law, including their impact on delays in generic drug availability. A report will be submitted to Congress within 1 year."
