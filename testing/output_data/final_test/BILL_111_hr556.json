    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Southern Sea Otter Recovery and Research Act\". It establishes the Southern Sea Otter Recovery and Research Program. The Secretary of the Interior will implement a recovery and research program for southern sea otter populations in California, based on various research recommendations and plans. The research program for southern sea otter populations includes monitoring demographics, health, mortality causes, and implementing measures to enhance population growth. A recovery implementation team will be appointed within a year, and grants will be provided for research and recovery efforts. The Secretary will establish a peer-reviewed process to award grants for research on southern sea otters and projects aiding their recovery. A peer review panel will prioritize grant proposals based on scientific advice. Research topics may include sea otter mortality causes, demographics, pollutants, and nutrients. The curr_chunk discusses the effects of pollutants, nutrients, toxicants, infectious diseases, parasites, food limitations, interactions with fisheries, and the ecological role of sea otters in California's marine ecosystems. The curr_chunk focuses on the recovery projects for southern sea otters, including protecting and recovering their populations, addressing factors limiting their populations related to human activities, and assessing emergency response and contingency plans. The Secretary shall report to Congress on the status of southern sea otter populations, implementation of recovery programs, and grant programs within 12 months of the enactment of this Act. The focus is on reducing factors affecting otter mortality, habitat quality, and coastal marine ecosystems, as well as implementing emergency response and contingency plans. The Secretary must report to Congress on the status of southern sea otter populations, recovery programs, and grant programs within 12 months of the Act's enactment. Subsequent reports every 5 years will evaluate otter health, mortality causes, and interactions with coastal ecosystems, along with actions taken to improve these aspects.
