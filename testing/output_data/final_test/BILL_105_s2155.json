The Act aims to settle Spanish and Mexican land grant claims in New Mexico under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, defining terms like \"Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo\" and \"community land grant.\" The Act aims to settle Spanish and Mexican land grant claims in New Mexico under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, defining terms like \"land grant claim\" and \"eligible descendant\" for individuals with specific criteria related to Mexican citizenship and community land grants. The Act aims to settle Spanish and Mexican land grant claims in New Mexico under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. It defines terms like \"settlement committee\" and \"reconstituted\" for restoring community land grants to full status as municipalities with rights under State law. Congress acknowledges New Mexico's unique history of land ownership due to Spanish and Mexican land grants. Mexican land grants in New Mexico were recognized as valid property claims under United States law in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. However, studies show that the implementation of these claims was problematic due to various factors such as a lack of knowledge of Spanish land law, inadequate documentation, and legal practices. Following the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, former Mexican citizens who became new citizens of the United States lost land titles due to sharp legal practices. This led to economic dependence on land resources in the Territory of New Mexico, affecting predominantly Hispanic communities in northern New Mexico. The loss of land grants had long-lasting economic consequences, contributing to these communities remaining among the poorest in the United States. The implementation of the treaty has been a source of ongoing controversy. The Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo has caused ongoing controversy and injustice in northern New Mexico communities. The US government has a duty to address the inadequate implementation of the treaty, but reconstructing the 150-year history of land title claims may be lengthy and costly. The Secretary of the Interior has relevant experience in this matter. The Secretary of the Interior's experience in resolving Tribal water rights claims could be valuable in addressing the complex Spanish and Mexican land grant claims in northern New Mexico. Understanding the history of land distribution under Spanish and Mexican law is crucial in determining a fair settlement for these claims. The history of land distribution under Spanish and Mexican law in northern New Mexico deserves formal recognition and interpretation by historical preservation institutions in the United States. The creation of settlement committees is mandated by SEC. 3. The Settlement Committee, mandated by SEC. 3, will develop comprehensive settlements for land grant claims in New Mexico on a county by county basis. Each county subcommittee will consist of seven members, including representatives from the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, State Commissioner of Public Lands, and four residents of the county. The Settlement Committee in New Mexico will consist of seven members, including county representatives appointed by their county commissions. In counties with Native American Indian Tribes, at least one representative must be an enrolled member of a tribe, and one must be an eligible descendent. Members serve for the life of the Committee, with vacancies filled in the same manner as the original appointment. SEC. 4. SUBMISSION OF LAND GRANT CLAIMS.\n\n(a) The settlement committee will establish guidelines for land grant claims submission within 90 days and publish them in local newspapers.\n(b) Land grant claims must be submitted to the county settlement committee within one year of guideline publication.\n\nSEC. 5. REVIEW AND SETTLEMENT PACKAGE. The settlement committee reviews all submitted land grant claims in each county, determining their potential validity based on documentation. They then develop a settlement package considering claim validity, impacts on communities, and available legal entities. The settlement committee reviews land grant claims, considering validity, impacts on communities, and legal entities. Proposed settlement packages may include land restoration, reconstitution, communal land use, trust funds, and land for commercial use. The settlement committee must complete its review and proposed settlement package within three years of the land grant claims deadline. The report will be submitted to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and the House Resources Committee. Any proposal requiring action by the government of New Mexico will be sent to the Governor, Speaker of the State House of Representatives, and President Pro Tem of the State Senate. The administration of the settlement committee is outlined in Section 6. The settlement committee may use various methods to gather information and build community consensus on a proposed settlement package. They can hold town meetings, formal hearings, solicit written comments, and use mediators. The committee can also hire consultants for analysis. Additionally, they are authorized to accept gifts, bequests, or devises to aid their work. The Settlement Committee can receive gifts, bequests, or devises of money and property, which will be deposited in the Treasury for disbursement as needed. The Administrator of General Services will provide administrative support services to the Committee upon request. The Committee is considered an agency of the United States for immunity purposes under the law. Members of the Settlement Committee are entitled to receive compensation at the daily equivalent of level V of the Executive Schedule for each day of duty. The Spanish Land Grant Study Program will be established in conjunction with the University of New Mexico and Highlands University to research and archive the history of land distribution in the southwestern United States under Spanish and Mexican law. The program aims to assist the Settlement Committee and interpret changes to land distribution after the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in 1848. The Settlement Committee will terminate 180 days after submitting its final report to Congress. $1,500,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2003 for the activities of the Settlement Committee and the Spanish Land Grant Study Program."
