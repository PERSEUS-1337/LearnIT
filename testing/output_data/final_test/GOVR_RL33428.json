    "content": "P.L. 109-295 was signed into law on October 4, 2006, providing $41.4 billion in gross total budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security for FY2007. This includes $1.8 billion in emergency funding. The net budget authority is $34.8 billion, with nearly $33.0 billion excluding the emergency funding. The Senate passed H.R. 5441 on July 13, 2006, with $32.8 billion in net budget authority for DHS in FY2007, representing a $900 million increase from the Administration's request. The Senate-passed H.R. 5441 includes a $33.2 billion net budget authority for DHS in FY2007, a $1.2 billion increase from the Administration's request. This amount is mainly due to the denial of the aviation security fee increase requested by the Administration. The Administration requested $42.7 billion in gross budget authority for DHS for FY2007, including $39.8 billion in gross appropriations. The net appropriation was $32.0 billion, with $31.0 billion discretionary and $1 billion mandatory budget authority. Data sources include President's Budget Documents, Congressional Budget Justifications, Budget in Brief, House and Senate Committee Reports, and enacted budget authority for FY2006. The President's FY2007 request for funding for DHS programs and activities was compared to the enacted FY2006 amounts. The report also tracked legislative action and congressional issues related to the FY2007 DHS appropriations bill. The report focuses on action and congressional issues related to the FY2007 DHS appropriations bill, specifically discretionary funding amounts. It does not cover mandatory funding or legislation related to DHS program authorization or amendment. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the new Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are organized into four titles: Departmental Management and Operations, Security, Enforcement, and Investigations, Preparedness and Recovery, and Research and Development, Training, Assessments, and Services. Title II of the FY2007 DHS appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies such as US-VISIT, CBP, ICE, TSA, Coast Guard, and Secret Service. Title III covers appropriations for Preparedness Directorate, FEMA, IPIS, and state/local grants programs. Title IV includes funding for USCIS, S&T, and FLETC. On July 13, 2005, Secretary Michael Chertoff announced these allocations. The Secretary of DHS, Michael Chertoff, announced proposed changes based on the Second Stage Review (2SR) to enhance overall preparedness, transportation security, border security, immigration processes, information sharing, financial management, human resources, procurement, and information technology within the department. The Administration also submitted a revised budget request to reflect these changes on July 22, 2005. The Administration submitted requested amendments to the FY2006 budget for DHS after the House and Senate passed H.R. 2360. Changes were addressed during the conference on H.R. 2360, resulting in restructuring DHS by abolishing the Office of the Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security, splitting the Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection, transferring state and local grants to the Preparedness Directorate, moving the Federal Air Marshals program from ICE to TSA, and expanding the role of the Office of. The DHS Congressional Budget Justifications for FY2007 reflect changes in the Federal Air Marshals program from ICE to TSA and the expanded role of the Office of Policy. The budget authority for annual appropriations is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process, with Congress setting overall spending totals in the first stage and appropriations committees allocating discretionary funds in the second stage. The appropriations committees allocate 302(a) discretionary funds among subcommittees for appropriations bills, known as 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments can be made during the year as bills progress. The Senate and House budget resolutions for FY2007 set discretionary budget authority at $873 billion. The House and Senate passed H.Con.Res. 376 in May 2006, providing $873 billion in discretionary budget authority for FY2007. Deeming resolutions were adopted due to difficulties in reconciling differences, setting spending levels at $873 billion. Federal government spending involves a process starting with budget authority enactment, followed by fund obligation and payment. Budget authority is determined by appropriations acts or direct spending legislation. The Antideficiency Act limits federal agencies from overspending their budget authority enacted by Congress. Budget authority can be one-year, multi-year, or no-year, with different availability for spending. Obligations are incurred when agencies use funds for personnel, contracts, services, etc., while outlays are the actual funds spent. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. Discretionary and mandatory spending make up the gross budget authority, with discretionary spending accounting for 83% of the $42.7 billion requested for DHS in FY2007. Outlays may not always match the budget authority enacted in a given year due to obligations being incurred in one fiscal year but spent in a future fiscal year. In FY2007, 83% of DHS budget is discretionary spending, appropriated yearly by Congress. Mandatory spending, 17% of the budget, is not appropriated annually and includes entitlement programs. Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending within DHS. Offset funds are collected by the government for business-type activities. The federal government collects offset funds from government accounts or the public as part of business-type transactions. These funds are not considered revenue but are counted as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is the total funds appropriated by Congress each year, composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Some fees offset spending at the account level, while others offset spending at the agency level. Fees collected at Ports of Entry by Customs and Border Protection offset agency spending. Some fees offset mandatory spending for entitlement programs like Secret Service and Coast Guard pensions. Secret Service retirement pay is funded by permanent appropriations. The DHS budget includes permanent appropriations for Secret Service retirement pay and annually appropriated funds for Coast Guard retirement pay. Additionally, there are offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds that are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget to calculate gross budget authority. The President's budget request for FY2007 was $42.7 billion, with gross appropriations of $39.8 billion and a net appropriation of $32.0 billion. The DHS budget request for FY2007 includes gross appropriations of $39.8 billion, with $31.0 billion in discretionary budget authority and $1 billion in mandatory budget authority. P.L. 109-295 provides $41.4 billion in gross budget authority for DHS, including emergency funding. House-passed H.R. 5441 would have provided $39.8 billion in gross budget authority and $33.2 billion in net budget authority for DHS in FY2007. Senate-passed H.R. 5441 would have provided $39.7 billion in gross budget authority and $32.7 billion in net budget authority for DHS in FY2007. The DHS budget request for FY2007 includes gross appropriations of $39.8 billion, with $31.0 billion in discretionary budget authority and $1 billion in mandatory budget authority. Title I covers general administrative expenses of DHS, including various offices and entities. FY2007 requests relative to FY2006 enacted appropriations show decreases in funding for certain offices. The FY2007 appropriations for various DHS offices are as follows: OS&EM, $98 million (-22%); OSCO, $4 million; USM, $209 million (24%); OCFO, $44 million (+132%); OCIO, $324 million (+9%); and OIG, $96 million (+16%). The total FY2007 request for Title I was $1,074 million, representing an 18% increase over FY2006. Appropriators generally cut allocations compared to both FY2006 funding and the President's FY2007 requests. OS&EM saw a decrease to $84 million after adjustments. OSCO did not receive separate funding. The FY2007 appropriations for DHS offices saw reductions in funding for OS&EM, USM, and OCFO, while OCIO received an increase. OSCO's activities were funded within the Office of Policy. The House approved recommended funding amounts, with the Senate ultimately approving a lower amount than requested by the President. The FY2007 appropriations for DHS offices saw reductions in funding for OS&EM, USM, and OCFO, while OCIO received an increase. OS&EM activities were funded within the Office of Policy. The Senate approved $969 million for Title I accounts, with $94 million allocated for OS&EM. Conferees made reductions to the President's budget request due to vacancies and unobligated balances. Other OS&EM accounts were trimmed in conference, except for the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman and the Privacy Officer. A separate Office of Counternarcotics Enforcement received a little over $2 million in funding. The FY2007 appropriations for DHS offices saw reductions in funding for various entities like USM, OCFO, and OIG, while OCIO received an increase. Changes were made to information, intelligence analysis, and infrastructure protection functions at DHS as outlined in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) Directorate was established, with an Undersecretary for IAIP overseeing two Assistant Secretaries for Information Analysis (IA) and Infrastructure Protection (IP). The Homeland Security Act of 2002 outlined 19 functions for the IAIP Directorate, including assessing terrorist threats, developing a national plan for securing critical infrastructure, and improving information sharing policies within the federal government. Following organizational changes announced in response to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff's Second Stage Review and the Conference Report to H.R. 2360, Department of Homeland Security Act FY2006, the IAIP Directorate was disbanded. Intelligence Analysis was separated from Infrastructure Protection, and a new Undersecretary for Preparedness was created. Two new offices were established - the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and the Office of Operations Coordination. The Assistant Secretary for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis was appointed as the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer, reporting directly to the Secretary. A new budget account, Analysis and Operations (A&O), was created within Departmental Management and Operations. It supports the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Directorate of Operations. These offices work together to improve intelligence, information sharing, and coordination. The A&O account includes the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, leading the DHS Intelligence Enterprise, and the Directorate of Operations Coordination, which disseminates threat information and ensures operations coordination among DHS components. Table 5 shows appropriations for FY2006 and congressional action for FY2007. In FY2006, a new budget account called Analysis and Operations (A&O) was created within Departmental Management and Operations to support intelligence and operations coordination. The FY2007 budget request for A&O is $299 million and 475 full-time equivalent positions, representing an 18.1% increase from FY2006. The House Appropriations Committee recommended the same funding amount as requested by the President. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $299 million for the Analysis and Operations budget account in FY2007, which is $46 million more than the FY2006 appropriation. The Committee also directed the HSOC and ICE to report on DHS-proposed situational awareness teams by January 16, 2007. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increased funding for the Analysis and Operations budget account in FY2007. It directed the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to provide quarterly threat briefings and report on intelligence fusion centers by January 16, 2007. The Committee supports information sharing between the intelligence community and those responsible for acting on intelligence, and expects IA to focus on recruitment and training efforts. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $299 million for information analysis and operations coordination activities, with a focus on recruitment, training, and threat information sharing. They expect IA to report bi-annually on their efforts and support the activities of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Office of Operations Coordination. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $299 million for information analysis and operations coordination activities. The committee directed the Chief Intelligence Officer to report on efforts to address concerns from the Office of Inspector General Report OIG-05-34. They also instructed the Government Accountability Office to analyze the role of the Homeland Security Operations Center and make recommendations for its operation and coordination. Additionally, S.Amdt. 4569 required a report on data-mining activities within the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security must submit a report to Congress on its data-mining activities. P.L. 109-295 allocates $300 million for counterterrorism intelligence, including a study on creating a new agency. Various federal entities currently handle counterterrorism intelligence functions. The potential creation of a \"counter terrorism intelligence agency\" could alter the current organizational structure of counterterrorism intelligence functions within various federal entities. The Department of Homeland Security aims to achieve awareness and prevention goals through programs like A&O and Intelligence, which focus on identifying threats, assessing vulnerabilities, and sharing timely information to prevent terrorist incidents. The FY2007 budget request for A&O includes an increase of nearly $46 million and 12 FTE, aiming for 100 percent distribution of threat information. Dis-aggregating intelligence analysis from operations is challenging due to classified budgets. Some question if the budget is sufficient for the current stage of development within DHS. The DHS Chief Intelligence Officer outlined five priorities for intelligence analysis goals, including improving analysis quality, integrating the DHS intelligence enterprise, and strengthening support to various authorities. Additional funds may be needed for department-wide information management systems to implement intelligence integration at DHS. At DHS, additional funds may be necessary for department-wide information management systems and analysts stationed at Intelligence Community partner agencies and state, local, and regional intelligence fusion centers. The organization must improve its intelligence information technology architecture to enhance coordination. Integrated information management systems are essential for intelligence organizations to avoid relying on personal relationships and ad hoc arrangements. DHS is also stationing liaison officers for human resource purposes. DHS is stationing liaison officers and intelligence analysts at state and local fusion centers, as well as detailing staff to Intelligence Community partners like the National Counterterrorism Center. This may hinder the development of a permanent cadre of homeland security analysts at DHS headquarters. The Office of Human Capital manages human resources within the department, overseeing policy, procedures, and leadership for HR functions. The Chief Human Capital Officer is responsible for implementing new human capital initiatives. The Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) is responsible for designing and implementing the new human resources management system in the DHS, known as MaxHR. The OHC received funding of nearly $38.511 million for FY2006, with $8.811 million for HR Operations and $29.7 million for MaxHR development. Staffing levels increased to 62 FTEs, with 50 attached to HR Operations and 12 to MaxHR. The President's FY2007 budget proposes funding of $81 million. The President's FY2007 budget proposes funding of $81 million and staffing of 80 FTEs for the OHC, with $10 million requested for HR Operations. The DHS plans to emphasize activities such as refining hiring processes, establishing an Executive Leadership and Learning Center, and improving customer service in FY2007. In FY2007, the DHS plans to improve customer service, enhance training, and expand program evaluation. The appropriation requested for the new HRM system is $71 million, with 27 FTEs allocated. The majority of the funding is for salaries, benefits, and advisory services. Implementation costs for the new pay system, market-based compensation, and funding for the Homeland Security Labor Relations Board are accounted for in the increased budget. The Homeland Security Labor Relations Board (HSLRB) will receive $5 million for the implementation of MaxHR in FY2006. Activities include designing a new market-based pay system, creating a compensation committee, and training supervisors, managers, and HR professionals. Non-bargaining unit employees from various departments will convert to the new performance system. The HSLRB, aimed at resolving labor-management disputes, may be established. Employees converted to the new performance system in FY2006 will transition to the new pay system in FY2007. Janet Hale, Under Secretary for Management at DHS, and K. Gregg Prillaman, the department's CHCO, resigned in early May 2006. In early May 2006, the department's CHCO, K. Gregg Prillaman, resigned. In his testimony before the House Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Management, Integration, and Oversight, he discussed the progress of MaxHR implementation and management challenges. Challenges include retirement eligibility of high-level officials, with 49% of SES level employees and 37% of GS-15 level employees at DHS eligible to retire by 2009. By 2009, 37% of GS-15 level employees at DHS will be eligible to retire. The Secret Service will see 91% of SES members and 75% of GS-15's retirement eligible by 2010. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found issues with the conversion of federal government employees to career positions at DHS, including potential violations of federal law in creating positions for specific individuals. Following the GAO report, the House Homeland Security Committee sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael. The Subcommittee on Management, Integration, and Oversight sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff on June 1, 2006, requesting answers to questions related to GAO findings on the legislative affairs position and implementation of MaxHR. The House passed an appropriation of $38.9 million for the OHC on June 6, 2006, $42.3 million less than requested, with $9.2 million for HR Operations and $29.7 million for MaxHR. MaxHR is funded at the FY2006 enacted level, representing 24.4% of the funding for the Under Secretary for Management. The OHC appropriation, representing 24.4% of the funding for the Under Secretary for Management, fully funds nine of the requested 15 FTEs for MaxHR. The six FTEs not included were for the Labor Relations Board. A general provision allows for unobligated balances to remain available through FY2008. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) opposed reducing funds for MaxHR. An amendment removed $15 million from the Under Secretary for Management to fund grants for firefighters. The Senate passed an appropriation of $44.8 million for the OHC, $36.4 million less than requested, with $9.8 million for HR Operations and $35 million for MaxHR. The MaxHR funding was $36.4 million less than requested, with an increase of $5.3 million compared to previous appropriations. The new personnel system was not fully funded due to ongoing litigation. The Secretary of Homeland Security was directed to submit an updated expenditure plan within 90 days. The recommended appropriation for the OHC is 27.4% of the funding for the Under Secretary for Management. The Senate-passed bill included a provision on unobligated balances and OMB opposed any reduction in funding for MaxHR. An amendment by Senator Barbara Boxer aimed to restrict funds for DHS travel until certain recommendations were implemented. A GAO audit was presented at a Senate hearing on July 19, 2006. The GAO audit presented at a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on July 19, 2006, revealed issues with the use of purchase cards by DHS employees post-Hurricane Katrina. Approximately $435 million was spent in FY2005 using the cards, with 45% of purchases lacking proper authorization and 63% lacking documentation. Weak internal controls, leadership, staffing, monitoring, and training at DHS led to questionable transactions and wasteful spending. GAO will issue a report with recommendations. The GAO will issue a report with recommendations for improved management controls at DHS, including funding allocations for the OHC. The OHC will receive $33.8 million in funding, with $8.8 million for salaries and expenses and $25 million for Max-HR. The Secretary of DHS is directed to submit an updated expenditure plan for Max-HR within 90 days of the act's enactment. The report must include all contract obligations by contractor by year and the purpose of the contract. Background investigations for DHS employees, particularly in key departments, must be processed quickly. General provisions on background investigations and unobligated balances continue as proposed by the House and Senate and were addressed in the President's signing statement on H.R. 5441. The President's signing statement on H.R. 5441 emphasized the executive branch's authority over national security information and personnel policies for FEMA employees. Title VI, Subtitle B includes provisions for FEMA workforce development and bonuses for hard-to-fill positions. Title II funds Security, Enforcement, and Investigations, including appropriations for various agencies such as US-VISIT, CBP, ICE, TSA, US Coast Guard, and US Secret Service. Congress mandated the implementation of the US-VISIT program in 1996 to track the arrival and departure of aliens, with a focus on immigration control. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, there was a shift in priority towards implementing an automated entry and exit data system. Border security became the main concern, with the Administration requesting $399 million for US-VISIT in FY2007, an increase of $62 million from the previous year. The House-passed version of H.R. 5441 allocated $362 million for US-VISIT, falling short of the President's request but still above the FY2006 level. The requested aviation passenger fee increase to fund US-VISIT was not approved by the House. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5441 fully funded the President's request of $399 million for US-VISIT in FY2007, with $200 million conditional upon approval of an expenditure plan. The Senate also included provisions for technical standards needed for the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative and extended legislative deadlines. The act provided $362 million for US-VISIT, with $60 million allocated for fingerprint enrollment capability and interoperability efforts. DHS is required to submit a strategic plan for modifying US-VISIT to allow for 10 fingerprint enrollment and interoperability with IDENT and IAFIS. CBP's primary mission is to prevent the entry of terrorists and the instruments of terrorism, inspect people and goods, interdict terrorists, intercept illegal narcotics, firearms, and contraband, interdict unauthorized travelers and immigrants, and enforce over 400 laws. CBP's primary mission is to prevent the entry of terrorists and the instruments of terrorism, inspect people and goods, interdict terrorists, intercept illegal narcotics, firearms, and contraband, interdict unauthorized travelers and immigrants, and enforce over 400 laws. CBP is comprised of various agencies including the inspection functions of the legacy Customs Service, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS); the Office of Air and Marine Interdiction, now known as CBP Air and Marine (CBPAM); and the Border Patrol (BP). The Administration requested an appropriation of $7,839 million in gross budget authority for CBP for FY2007, with a significant portion allocated to the Secure Border Initiative (SBI). The House-passed H.R. 5441 recommended an appropriation of $7,699 million for CBP, which was $140 million less than requested by the Administration for FY2007. This amount represented a nearly 9% increase over the enacted FY2006 level. The reductions to the request included $10 million. The Appropriations Committee reduced the CBP request by $10 million due to poor responsiveness in submitting reports to Congress. The House denied an increase in aviation passenger fees. The C-TPAT program received $15 million above the Administration's request. The Senate passed H.R. 5441 with a $1.2 billion increase in gross budget authority for CBP in FY2007. The DHS must submit expenditure plans before receiving parts of its appropriation for the Secure Border Initiative and the Automated Commercial Environment. P.L. 109-295 provides $9,302 million in gross budget authority for CBP, with an increase of $2,208 million compared to FY2006. Excluding emergency funding, CBP receives $7,701 million in gross budget authority for FY2007, a 9% increase from FY2006. The FY2007 CBP budget request includes a significant increase for the Secure Border Initiative (SBI), focusing on border control, interior enforcement, and a Temporary Worker Program. Other key issues for Congress are CBP staffing, technology, infrastructure, and the transfer of the Shadow Wolves from CBP to ICE. Staffing levels have been a topic of debate for effectively carrying out CBP's mission. CBP's staffing needs include Border Patrol Agents, officers at ports of entry, import specialists, pilots, and other positions. Issues such as training, infrastructure, hiring, and attrition are important. A resource allocation model is required to address staffing concerns by January 23, 2007. The conferees directed CBP to provide a staffing model with the FY2008 budget request, addressing operational assumptions and aligning staff to threats and workload. The House and Senate committees also required CBP to submit a Resource Allocation Model (RAM) with staffing requirements by specific deadlines. The Senate committee was concerned with CBP's ability to handle increasing passenger volumes at airports. GAO reported in July 2005 that CBP did not assess staffing needs systematically. Legislation required CBP to submit a report with optimal staffing levels at all ports and consult with nonfederal partners on future passenger growth. Funding was allocated for additional CBP officers in FY2007 and the SAFE Port Act authorized more officers for FY2008-FY2012. The SAFE Port Act authorizes an increase in CBP officers and funding for personnel from FY2008 to FY2012. The President's request includes adding 1,500 Border Patrol agents in FY2007, bringing the total new agents hired since FY2005 to 3,000. This aligns with the increase authorized by Congress in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2005. The President's request for an increase in USBP agents aligns with previous authorizations by Congress. The House and Senate have differing recommendations for the number of agents to fund, with the Senate proposing a total increase of 2,000 agents for FY2007. The Senate bill proposed adding 1,236 USBP agents, with a total of 2,236 agents including the supplemental funding in FY2007. The conferees approved funding for 1,500 USBP agents, totaling 2,500 in FY2007. They expressed disappointment in CBP's vehicle fleet planning and directed them to re-submit their Vehicle Fleet Management Plan by January 23, 2007. The President's request includes $100 million for border technologies to enhance surveillance and response capabilities. DHS plans to transition to a comprehensive technology plan, potentially facing issues with the contracting process. In FY2005, the GSA IG criticized USBP's contracting practices for the Remote Video Surveillance system, citing lack of competition and failure to deliver services as contracted. In 2005, deficiencies in contract management led to 169 incomplete Remote Video Surveillance (RVS) sites. The RVS system is part of the Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System (ISIS), now under the America's Shield Initiative (ASI). Integration issues were highlighted by DHS IG Richard Skinner in congressional testimony. The DHS IG noted in a 2005 report that ISIS remote surveillance technology had limited integration and few apprehensions. The FY2006 DHS Appropriations Conferees did not fully fund the department's request for ASI, citing the need for a review of the program's scope and architecture. Major procurement for ASI may be curtailed until fundamental questions are resolved about its relation to nationwide border security. The conferees expressed concerns about DHS' request for the Secure Border Initiative (SBI), emphasizing the need for a strategic plan before implementing the program. The House required a strategic plan to be submitted by November 1, 2006, and reduced funding for SBI technologies by $17 million. The Senate, on the other hand, fully funded the President's request for SBI but made $100 million conditional on certain factors. The Senate fully funded the President's request for the Secure Border Initiative (SBI), with $100 million conditional on approval by House and Senate Appropriations Committees. H.R. 5441 requires DHS IG review for SBI contracts over $20 million. DHS seeks additional funding for border fence construction in San Diego, vehicle barriers in western Arizona, and facilities for new USBP agents in FY2007. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seeks an increase in funding for tactical infrastructure, including using private contractors to accelerate construction of vehicle barriers in Arizona. DHS argues that this approach is necessary to expedite deployment of resources at the border, but Congress may question the cost-effectiveness of using private contractors for this purpose. The DHS is requesting increased funding for tactical infrastructure, including using private contractors for construction in Arizona. Congress may question the cost-effectiveness of this approach, especially considering issues with contracting irregularities and budget justifications for infrastructure projects in San Diego and Arizona. The House withheld $25 million in funding until receiving and approving an expenditure plan for procurement and contracting. The Senate increased the President's request for SBI procurement and contracting by $122 million to $378 million. They fully funded infrastructure projects in Arizona and California, allocated $59 million for Border Patrol agent facilities, and added an unspecified $90 million as a floor amendment. A new account titled Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology was established with $1,188 million for border projects. DHS will have $1,513 million for border infrastructure construction in FY2007. The House bill directed DHS to plan for funding allocation within 60 days of enactment, withholding $950 million until approval. CBP was instructed to consolidate funding for fencing, infrastructure, and technology and oversee contracts to minimize subcontractor use. The House bill also prohibited funds for permanent checkpoints in the Tucson sector and required relocation of checkpoints every seven days. The Senate Appropriations Committee report highlighted the importance of permanent checkpoints in the Tucson sector for safer and more efficient law enforcement. Concerns were raised about tunnels under the land border, with the House directing CBP to work on detecting and addressing this smuggling tactic. The Senate expressed concern over the lack of a clear policy within DHS for securing the border. The Senate directed DHS to address the lack of a clear policy for securing, closing, and filling discovered tunnels by February 8, 2007. An amendment criminalizing the construction, financing, and use of tunnels crossing the U.S. border was accepted. The Dubai Ports World controversy highlighted issues in port and maritime security, including cargo and container security. CBP's cargo security strategy includes the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT). CSI stations CBP officers in foreign sea ports to target marine containers for inspection. The FY2007 request did not contain significant increases in funding for either the Container Security Initiative (CSI) or the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT). Funding for C-TPAT remained flat at $76 million, while the request for CSI increased by $2 million to $139 million for FY2007. P.L. 109-295 provides $139 million for CSI, $55 million for C-TPAT, and $11 million for FAST and NEXUS/SENTRI. The conference agreement also provides an additional $147 million for non-intrusive inspection technology (NII) and fully funds the requests. The conference agreement provides $147 million for additional non-intrusive inspection technology (NII) and fully funds cargo security and trade facilitation programs within CBP. The conferees direct CBP to comply with reporting requirements and withhold $5 million until the port, cargo, and container strategic plan is submitted. Funding allows CBP to meet strategic plan requirements for C-TPAT participants and manifest review at CSI ports. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5441 would have funded both CSI and C-TPAT at the requested level, but concerns have been raised about inadequate staffing levels for both programs. GAO reports have highlighted issues with CBP's ability to conduct inspections overseas and validate C-TPAT members. CBP is also facing challenges with the number of supply chain specialists available for C-TPAT validations. Additional concerns raised by GAO include the scope and rigor of the validation process for C-TPAT. The GAO has reported concerns about the validation process for C-TPAT, including staffing imbalances, lack of technical requirements for NII equipment at foreign ports, and the need for a comprehensive set of performance measures. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of a strategic plan for port, container, and cargo security programs, withholding $10 million until the plan was submitted. The strategic plan outlined in H.Rept. 109-476 includes provisions such as screening all inbound cargo with the Automated Targeting System, doubling the percentage of cargo inspected by CBP, maintaining a 100% manifest review rate for CSI, conducting validations for C-TPAT participants, and doubling the percentage of containerized cargo screened for radiation. The plan also discusses the coordination of the CSI program with the Department of Energy's Megaports. The CSI program is coordinated with the Department of Energy's Megaports program, CBP promotes NII equipment in foreign countries, sets minimum standards for securing cargo containers, evaluates cargo inspection systems at high-volume foreign ports like Hong Kong. P.L. 109-295 mandates CBP to comply with strategic plan directives in H.Rept. 109-699 and conduct a pilot of the integrated screening system. Senate-passed H.R. 5441 includes additional appropriations for port security, but funding was not included in P.L. 109-295. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5441 included provisions for CBP's screening of municipal solid waste (MSW). Sec. 555 required CBP to submit a report to Congress within 90 days on the effectiveness of trash truck inspections for weapons. The Secretary of DHS would deny entry of any truck carrying MSW if corrective actions were not implemented within a specified time-frame. The CBP failed to implement required corrective actions within a specified time-frame. Sec. 557 would have required the Secretary of DHS to provide personnel and equipment to improve inspection of commercial vehicles carrying MSW, and levy a fee approximating inspection costs. These provisions were not included in P.L. 109-295. CBP has deployed non-intrusive inspection technologies at ports of entry, including x-ray and gamma ray systems like VACIS for container inspections. Mobile Sea Container Examination Systems are also used for container inspections, along with nuclear and radiological detection. Recently, concerns have been raised about the deployment of radiation detection equipment at US ports of entry. Delays in the program have been attributed to unrealistic goals, uncertain cost estimates, and difficulties in negotiations with seaport operators. The program's progress has fallen behind schedule, and there is uncertainty regarding the cost and effectiveness of advanced technology portals. The GAO found that uncertainties in cost and effectiveness of advanced technology portals are hindering accurate cost estimates for the radiation detection deployment program. DHS has improved equipment use, but CBP officers lack data to verify NRC licenses and secondary inspection procedures do not always involve opening containers. GAO recommended DHS streamline internal review procedures, update deployment schedule, and analyze benefits and costs of advanced portal technology. The House and Senate expressed concerns about combating nuclear smuggling and recommended using advanced technologies to screen cargo containers. CBP was required to report on improvements to the process by January 16, 2007. The Administration requested $338 for RPM deployment and other security measures. The Administration requested $338 million for CBP Air and Marine Interdictions, Operations, Maintenance, and Procurement account. P.L. 109-295 provides $602 million for CBP Air and Marine, including funding for various equipment and aircraft upgrades. H.Rept. 109-699 also requires funding for a new Northern Border Airwing in Michigan. The Senate-passed H.R. 5441 provided $472 million for the CBP Air and Marine Interdictions account and $173 million for CBP Air and Marine Personnel. Additionally, $105 million was allocated for air asset replacement and upgrades. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about CBP's lack of a capitalization plan and recommended reduced funding for CBP's Headquarters, Management, and Administration. The funding for CBP's Headquarters, Management, and Administration has been reduced by $4 million. Organizational changes have been made to CBP Air and Marine operations, including the consolidation of assets with Border Patrol. Concerns have been raised about the impact of this consolidation on asset deployment. CBP was directed to submit the Air and Marine Capitalization Plan by November 1, 2006, and to report to Congress by January 16, 2007. CBP was directed to report to Congress on requests for support in 2006, consequences of reduced support to ICE, and establish a pilot program for UAVs to surveil the northern border. $20 million was provided for UAV acquisition. CBP was also directed to submit findings of a UAV crash in Arizona and encouraged to work with the FAA on a pilot program for UAV surveillance. The Shadow Wolves, a Native American unit under the U.S. Customs Service, were initially placed in ICE before being moved to CBP. An amendment transferred $2 million from CBP to ICE to move the Shadow Wolves back. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws in the U.S. ICE is responsible for investigating and enforcing violations of immigration laws, locating and removing aliens who have overstayed their visas or entered illegally, combating terrorist financing and money laundering, enforcing export laws, and overseeing building security activities. The Federal Air Marshals Service was returned to TSA, and the Office of Air and Marine Interdiction was transferred to CBP. The Administration requested a 20% increase in gross budget authority for ICE in FY2007, totaling $4,696 million. This represents a 24% increase in net budget authority over the FY2006 level. Program increases included funding for investigations, compliance enforcement agents, and custody management. The House-passed H.R. 5441 would have appropriated $4,644 million for ICE in FY2007, with allocations for various programs including custody management, Fugitive Operations, Alternatives to Detention, transportation, worksite enforcement, and legal proceedings. This represented a 19% increase over the FY2006 level and $52 million less than the President's request. The House-passed H.R. 5441 allocated funds for various ICE programs in FY2007, including custody management, Fugitive Operations, Alternatives to Detention, transportation, worksite enforcement, and legal proceedings. This represented a 19% increase over FY2006 levels. Additionally, $11.2 million was designated for care and repatriation of smuggled aliens, $15.8 million for enforcement against forced child labor, and increased funding for detention bedspace, transportation, removal efforts, fugitive operations teams, financial investigations, Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center, alternatives to detention, and the Criminal Alien Program. The Senate-passed H.R. 5441 would have appropriated $4,717 million for ICE in FY2007, a 20% increase over FY2006 levels. The House-passed H.R. 5441 allocated funds for various ICE programs in FY2007, including custody management, Fugitive Operations, Alternatives to Detention, transportation, worksite enforcement, and legal proceedings. This represented a 19% increase over FY2006 levels. Additionally, $11.2 million was designated for care and repatriation of smuggled aliens, $15.8 million for enforcement against forced child labor, and increased funding for detention bedspace, transportation, removal efforts, fugitive operations teams, financial investigations, Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center, alternatives to detention, and the Criminal Alien Program. The Senate-passed H.R. 5441 would have appropriated $4,717 million for ICE in FY2007, a 20% increase over FY2006 levels. The bill would have appropriated $3,919 million in net budget authority for ICE in FY2007, which would have represented a 23% increase over the FY2006 enacted level of $3,175 million. The Secretary of DHS was directed to adjust fees for noncitizens to generate at least $350 million in additional revenue by September 30, 2007. This included funding for vehicle replacement and automation modernization in ICE. Additionally, there were recommendations for increased funding for compliance investigations, visa overstays, state and local law enforcement assistance, DHS representation in removal proceedings, custody management, transportation and removal operations, fugitive operations, and various ICE office expansions and improvements. The Office of Procurement will receive $16 million to improve, the Office of Professional Responsibility will be expanded with $10 million, and $2 million will go to the Cyber Crime Center. P.L. 109-295 allocates $4,727 million in gross budget authority for ICE in FY2007, a 21% increase from FY2006. The bill appropriates $3,928 million in net budget authority for ICE in FY2007, a 24% increase from FY2006. Funding will be used for various purposes including implementing INA \u00a7287(g), care for smuggled aliens, enforcement against forced child labor, and public awareness of child pornography. The funding allocation for ICE in FY2007 includes $30 million for vehicle replacement, $15 million for automation modernization, and additional funding for various DRO operations such as custody management, transportation, fugitive operations, and worksite enforcement efforts. Additionally, $13 million for automation modernization requires approval from House and Senate Appropriations Committees before being obligated. ICE's funding in FY2007 includes $30 million for expanded worksite enforcement, $10 million for additional vehicles, $6.8 million for the Trade Transparency Unit, $2 million for the Criminal Alien Program, and $1 million for the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center. ICE's Office of Investigations focuses on various criminal and civil violations affecting national security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 abolished the INS and transferred most investigative functions to ICE. ICE's funding in FY2007 includes $30 million for expanded worksite enforcement and $10 million for the Compliance Enforcement Unit. Concerns have been raised about resource allocation towards investigating civil violations of immigration law. The President's budget requested additional funding for worksite enforcement and compliance investigations in ICE. House-passed H.R. 5441 allocated more funds for OI domestic operations than Senate-passed H.R. 5441. Detention and Removal Operations in ICE manage aliens in removal proceedings or ordered to leave the US. The Department of Homeland Security's Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) faces challenges in detaining aliens ordered for removal due to limited space. Concerns have been raised about the decision-making process for releasing aliens based on detention space availability rather than individual case merits, leading to disparities in different geographic areas. Legislation authorized an increase in DRO bed space, but funding constraints remain a concern. The President's budget requested $2,077 million for DRO, with appropriations of $1,984 million in P.L. 109-295. This funding includes allocations for custody operations, transportation, fugitive operations, and the Institutional Removal Program. ICE will maintain a bed space capacity of 27,500 with the new funding. H.R. 5441 proposed $1,915 million for DRO, citing budget constraints and inadequate information on detention management as reasons for the reduction from the President's request. The Senate-passed H.R. 5441 allocated $1,833 million for DHS' detention management plan, with requirements for reports on various aspects of detention. P.L. 109-295 appropriated $11.2 million for costs related to care and repatriation of smuggled aliens. Interest in developing alternatives to detention for certain types of aliens has been sparked due to the high cost of detaining aliens. ICE initiated the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program in 2004 for low-risk, nonviolent individuals. ICE started the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program for low-risk, nonviolent offenders and uses electronic monitoring devices as an alternative to detention. P.L. 109-295 allocated $44 million for detention alternatives, exceeding the President's budget request. The Secure Border Initiative aims to secure borders and reduce illegal migration through various measures, including hiring more agents and increasing detention capabilities. The President's budget includes funds for detention beds, worksite enforcement, and fugitive operations as part of the SBI. House-passed H.R. 5441 and P.L. 109-295 allocated funds for various immigration enforcement activities, including fugitive operations and detention bedspace. State and local immigration enforcement authority is granted through INA \u00a7287(g), allowing officers to perform immigration-related functions. The debate over the role of state and local officials in enforcing federal immigration laws has raised concerns about training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. Some localities provide sanctuary for illegal aliens, while others argue that state and local law enforcement should assist due to limited federal resources. P.L. 109-295 allocates $5.4 million for INA \u00a7287(g) agreements, similar to House-passed H.R. 5441 and Senate-passed H.R. 5441. The Senate-passed H.R. 5441 would have appropriated funds for a new Border Relief Grant Program to provide grants to law enforcement agencies near U.S. borders to address criminal activity related to border security. The Senate-passed H.R. 5441 proposed a Border Relief Grant Program to fund law enforcement agencies near U.S. borders to address border security issues. The TSA, created by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the U.S. against terrorist threats. The TSA is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the U.S. against threats, including terrorism, sabotage, and violence. They deploy screeners, detection systems, and security technologies for this purpose. Additionally, the TSA assesses the risk of terrorist attacks on non-aviation transportation assets, issues regulations to improve security, and enforces these regulations. The agency also serves as the primary liaison for transportation security to law enforcement and intelligence communities. The President requested a budget of $6,299 million for the TSA in FY2007. The TSA requested a budget of $6,299 million for FY2007, with the majority allocated to aviation security functions. Direct funding for aviation security and air marshals make up 89% of the budget, while funding for transportation security threat assessments and credentialing totals $131 million. The Secure Flight system and Registered Traveler program account for over half of the requested amount in this category. The President has requested $37 million for TSA surface transportation security activities, including support personnel and resources to assess terrorist threats, standards and procedures, and compliance with security regulations in non-aviation modes. An increase of about $5 million for rail security was requested, but no specific appropriation for tracking trucks carrying. The TSA requested $10 million for screener benefits to improve retention rates, including retention allowances, performance bonuses, college credit reimbursement, flexible staffing options, and pay-for-performance incentives. They also asked for $20 million to fund worker compensation payments owed to the Department of Labor. The TSA requested funding for on-the-job injury rates, emerging checkpoint technologies, and hiring additional procurement staff members to improve acquisition processes and controls. Congress and the 9/11 Commission prioritize developing and deploying checkpoint technologies for screening passengers and carry-on items for weapons and explosives. The President proposed restructuring passenger security fees to increase revenues and reduce general fund contributions for aviation security functions. The proposal would replace the current fee structure with a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip, doubling fees for passengers on direct flights. The Administration argues that the flat fee better reflects passenger utilization of the aviation security system. The Administration's proposed aviation security fee changes for FY2007 differed significantly from previous proposals. The prior proposal, not widely supported in Congress, would have raised the per-segment fee to $5.50 per trip segment with a maximum of $8.00 per one-way flight. This proposal was opposed due to its perceived negative impact on the airline industry and certain passengers, especially those using smaller airports. The imbalance in the fee structure stems from the original collection authority enacted under ATSA, which requires passengers on connecting flights to pay twice as much in fees. The Administration proposed a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip for aviation security, aiming to increase fee collections by $1,726 million in FY2007. This would cover 70% of core aviation security costs, compared to 38% in FY2005. Critics argue against users paying for security, stating it would free up general funds for other homeland security needs. Critics of the proposal argue that aviation security should be funded through general fund contributions to prevent terrorist attacks like September 11. They believe adding a security fee to passenger tickets will hurt airlines, especially low-cost carriers with more direct flights. The Administration proposed collecting $644 million from security fees paid by air carriers, including $448 million in projected FY2007 collections and $196 million in retroactive fees. House-passed H.R. 5441 would have provided $6,364 million for the TSA in FY2007, with $4,704 allocated for aviation security. This amount was $65 million more than the President's request and $20 million more than FY2006 enacted appropriations. The House-passed bill allocated $50 million more than the President's request for aviation security, including funding for the Federal Air Marshals Service and threat assessment programs like Secure Flight. Additionally, $74 million was designated for the TSA's Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing mission area. The House-passed bill allocated significant funding for various aviation-related functions, including Crew Vetting, TWIC, Registered Traveler, HAZMAT Commercial Driver Credentialing, and Alien Flight School vetting. The total spending package for aviation-related functions would amount to $5,495 million, with additional funding for FAMS and threat assessment programs. Additionally, $37 million was designated for TSA surface transportation security functions. The House bill allocated funding for various aviation-related functions, including Crew Vetting, TWIC, Registered Traveler, HAZMAT Commercial Driver Credentialing, and Alien Flight School vetting. It also directed the TSA to use unobligated funds for rail and mass transit security screening pilot programs. Additionally, the bill included provisions for the TWIC program and HAZMAT commercial driver credentialing fees. The House-passed bill did not consider the Administration's proposal to modify the passenger fee schedule, as it falls under the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Homeland Security. The appropriations committee estimated FY2007 passenger fee collections to total $2,124 million, with $250 million for the Aviation Security Capital Fund and $1,874 million to offset TSA spending. The House projected aviation security infrastructure fee collections from airlines to be $546 million in FY2007, $98 million less than the administration's projection. The House bill assumed collecting less in passenger and airline fees than the administration. The House-passed bill reduced funding for TSA programs, including headquarters administration by $4 million and the FFDO program by $5 million. These cuts were made to offset the shortfall in the President's budget caused by proposed fee increases. The appropriations committee encouraged TSA to find innovative ways to address funding challenges. The committee encouraged TSA to develop innovative approaches and incentives for airports to pursue private screener operations instead of federal TSA-screeners. A provision in the bill would have prohibited TSA from hiring non-screener personnel at airports with redundant duties. The House-passed bill capped TSA screener staffing levels at 45,000 to accelerate technology deployment. The committee directed TSA to report on efforts to decentralize screener hiring and complete a study on the process. The House-passed bill included additional funding for EDS purchase and equipment refurbishment, with a focus on machines under warranty. The committee emphasized reducing the use of ETD equipment for baggage screening and developing standards for increasing EDS use in air cargo screening. The House-passed bill requires TSA to use existing EDS equipment to screen air cargo on passenger aircraft to the greatest extent practicable at each airport. It also mandates quarterly reporting of air cargo inspection statistics and imposes penalties for late reports. Additionally, the bill prohibits full deployment of Secure Flight until specific requirements are met and prohibits the development of algorithms for passenger risk assessment using unofficial means. The Senate-passed bill provides increased budget authority for the TSA, including funding for aviation security and the Aviation Security Capital Fund. It does not support the President's proposed increase in passenger aviation security fees and includes provisions on passenger risk assessment algorithms. The Senate-passed bill includes increased funding for TSA, specifically $181 million for airport checkpoint support functions. The additional funding is intended for the development of an advanced checkpoint portal solution and deploying emerging technologies for passenger screening. The bill also proposes bringing transportation security research and development functions back under TSA. The Senate agreed to $92 million for aviation security research and development activities, including $141 million for EDS and ETD purchase. The Senate committee report expressed concerns over the President's budget request to cut this function by more than 50% and specified that $20 million should be allocated for next-generation EDS machines. The Senate-passed bill allocated $172 million for EDS and ETD installation, exceeding the FY2006 amount by $127 million. The bill emphasized expedited installation but recommended $24 million less for maintenance, citing TSA's cost savings. $25 million of the maintenance funds are subject to a report on contractor fees. The Senate-passed bill did not specify funding for EDS and ETD refurbishing but allocated $23 million for the FFDO program and $15 million for the Secure Flight program. The bill cited unobligated balances as the reason for proposed reductions in funding. The Senate-passed bill allocated $15 million for the Secure Flight program, $25 million less than requested. The committee expressed support for the program but noted uncertainties due to delays and re-scoping efforts. They were hesitant to provide additional resources beyond the proposed amount. The bill also required DHS certification and GAO oversight for system security and privacy protection. The Senate-passed bill allocated $15 million for the Secure Flight program, with provisions to protect privacy and address mistaken identifications. It also required DHS certification and GAO oversight for system security and privacy protection. The Senate passed a bill allocating $15 million for the Secure Flight program, with provisions to protect privacy and address mistaken identifications. They also agreed to amendments related to aviation security, including one that would require the TSA to provide resources at the New Castle Airport in Wilmington, DE. This could potentially restrict the use of private screeners, which may be controversial. The Senate passed amendments related to aviation security, including one requiring TSA to report on screening operations effectiveness. Another amendment would have air carriers develop plans for emergency service personnel to provide services on flights. The Senate passed S.Amdt. 4552 to remove TSA's exemption from federal procurement law and S.Amdt. 4558 to prohibit limitations on the number of TSA employees. P.L 109-295 provides $6,374 billion for TSA, including $4,731 million for aviation security. The TSA budget includes $5,762 billion for aviation security, which makes up 90% of the total budget. Surface transportation security received $37 million, accounting for less than 2% of the total appropriations. Congress debates the need for increased funding for surface and maritime transportation initiatives. The funding distribution for surface and maritime transportation initiatives is roughly in line with prior year allocations. Airport checkpoint explosives screening is a priority, highlighted by the 9/11 Commission recommendations and recent terrorist plots. The conference report funded checkpoint support at $173 million, consistent with the House-passed amount, due to a $56 million unobligated balance from previous years. TSA is directed to develop a strategic plan for checkpoint support initiatives. The conference report prioritizes airport checkpoint explosives screening, directing TSA to develop a strategic plan for screening all types of explosives. It also addresses wait times at airport checkpoints over the past three years and directs TSA to provide screening at 24 commercial airports and heliports that have requested it. Additionally, TSA is directed to consider contracting out screening functions at these locations if deploying TSA personnel is not efficient. The conference report prioritizes airport checkpoint explosives screening and directs TSA to develop a strategic plan for screening all types of explosives. It also addresses wait times at airport checkpoints and directs TSA to provide screening at 24 commercial airports and heliports. The act maintains the cap on full-time equivalent TSA screeners at 45,000 and prohibits funds for the Secure Flight program until certain conditions are met. The TSA is working with the GAO to address unresolved issues related to data security, privacy, and redress. The act provides $141 million for EDS purchase, with $5 million above the House-passed amount. Up to $6 million may be used for refurbishing existing EDS equipment. The conference report specifies that EDS purchase funding is not to be used for ETD equipment unless necessary for secondary baggage screening or at airports primarily dependent on ETD technologies. The act includes $388 million for EDS installations, with $250 million from the Aviation Security Capital Fund and $138 million from a separate appropriation. There is also $222 million allocated for EDS and ETD maintenance, with a directive for TSA to combine maintenance costs for all equipment in FY2008. Performance measures and targets for alternative screening procedures are to be developed. The act includes provisions for developing performance measures and targets for alternative screening procedures at airports, tracking their use, assessing effectiveness, conducting covert tests, and stopping their use in place of EDS and ETD screening. It also allocates funds for EDS equipment procurement and installation, maintenance, and provides increased funding for the Federal Air Marshals Service. The increased funding in the act is designated for travel and training, particularly focusing on protecting aviation assets. It also maintains the Federal Flight Deck Officer program and crew training initiatives at a level of $25 million. Additionally, $55 million is provided for air cargo security, with concerns raised about the slow obligation of these funds by the TSA. The conference report highlighted delays in TSA funding for air cargo security, with a portion of FY2006 funds expected to carry over to FY2007. The TSA is directed to use these funds to hire staff for enhancing air cargo security analytics. Additionally, the act allocates $37 million for surface transportation security and $20 million for the TWIC program, with funds expected to be recouped through credentialing fees. An additional direct appropriation for TWIC in FY2007 was deemed unnecessary due to TSA reprogramming. The TWIC program is a high priority issue for seaport security. The conference report supports its expeditious implementation. The TSA is directed to pilot test an integrated scanning system at three foreign seaports. Congress may address TSA-related security issues in the FY2007 appropriations process, including aviation fee structure, passenger pre-screening, Registered Traveler program, and baggage screening systems. Progress in installing in-line baggage screening systems, initiatives to mitigate workplace injuries among TSA screeners, efforts to improve passenger and carry-on item screening for explosives, status of the TWIC Program, and TSA initiatives in surface transportation modes. The President's proposal to modify aviation security fees was addressed by the Senate, with an amendment prohibiting changes to fee collections agreed upon. Representative Lungren offered an amendment during consideration of the Transportation Security Administration Reorganization Act of 2005. Representative Lungren proposed an alternative aviation security fee structure on March 9, 2006, similar to the President's proposal. The fee includes a $4.00 fee per one-way trip to fund TSA, with an optional $1.00 fee for airport security projects. Passenger security fees would be capped at $5.00 per one-way trip and $10.00 per round-trip, while airline security fees would be eliminated. The House-passed appropriations bill does not address the modification of passenger security fees. The House-passed appropriations bill does not address modifying passenger security fees. The status of the Secure Flight program, which screens airline passengers against the terrorist watch list, may be discussed during the FY2007 appropriations debate. The GAO has reported unresolved issues with the program, and the TSA is reevaluating before operational testing. The House bill would maintain restrictions on full deployment of Secure Flight. The House-passed appropriations bill does not address modifying passenger security fees. Congress may also examine the Registered Traveler program and the integration of checked baggage explosives detection equipment with airport baggage handling systems. The airline industry is no longer backing the Registered Traveler program due to concerns over its implementation. The TSA is looking to deploy in-line baggage screening systems to increase throughput and reduce manpower. This may also help mitigate workplace injuries among baggage screeners. Congress is debating the effectiveness of available technologies for passenger and carry-on item screening. Recent interest in seaport security is also noted. The TSA is working on deploying in-line baggage screening systems to improve efficiency and reduce injuries among baggage screeners. Congress is discussing the effectiveness of screening technologies for passengers and carry-on items. Recent interest in seaport security, particularly regarding the TWIC program and deployment schedule, may prompt further examination during the appropriations process. The Coast Guard, under the DHS since 2003, is responsible for maritime security, including U.S. ports and waterways. It also conducts non-homeland security missions like search and rescue and environmental protection. Congress may review TSA and Coast Guard initiatives in surface transportation security during appropriations. The Coast Guard, under the DHS since 2003, is responsible for maritime security, including U.S. ports and waterways. The President requested $8,181 million in net budget authority for the Coast Guard in FY2007, with slight increases in most accounts, including a new mission to protect the air space over Washington, DC. The Coast Guard's new mission is to protect the air space over Washington, DC, previously the responsibility of CBP. Funding is requested for helicopters and operating expenses for a no-fly zone, as well as $50 million to relocate the Coast Guard's headquarters. The House-passed version of H.R. 5441 provided $8,129 million for the Coast Guard, $52 million less than the President's request. Key differences include the exclusion of funds for headquarters relocation and production of the fast response cutter. The House allocated $17 million for the bridge alteration program, while the Senate provided $8,188 million for the Coast Guard, $7 million more than the President's request. The Senate did not include $50 million for the Coast Guard's headquarters relocation. Additionally, the Senate allocated $15 million for the bridge alteration program and $18 million for research and development, $4 million more than the President's request. P.L. 109-295 ultimately provided $8,316 million for the Coast Guard in FY2007, $136 million more than the President's request. The House and Senate allocated different amounts for the Coast Guard in FY2007. The Senate provided $8,188 million, $7 million more than the President's request, and did not include funds for the Coast Guard's headquarters relocation. P.L. 109-295 ultimately provided $8,316 million for the Coast Guard, $136 million more than the President's request. The legislation also allocated $1,330 million for acquisition, construction, and improvements, which is $160 million more than requested. Additionally, $16 million was provided for the bridge alteration program, and no funds were allocated for the headquarters relocation proposal. The Coast Guard's obligations in homeland security have increased, leading to concerns from Congress about operational responses. The Deepwater program aims to replace or modernize 93 ships and 207 aircraft with a budget of $24 billion over 25 years. Funding for the program in FY2007 varied between the President's request, the House, the Senate, and ultimately P.L. 109-295. The Senate provided funding for the fast response cutter, while the House did not. P.L. 109-295 rescinded $79 million from FY2006 for the fast response cutter and reallocated it for the service life extension program of the current patrol boat fleet. The Coast Guard's Deepwater program aims to replace or modernize ships and aircraft with a budget of $24 billion over 25 years. Funding for the program in FY2007 varied between the President's request, the House, the Senate, and ultimately P.L. 109-295. The program includes a life extension program for the current patrol boat fleet and the acquisition of traditional patrol boats to address design issues with the fast response cutter. Congress is concerned about the Coast Guard's management of the program, overall cost, acquisition timeline, and resources for homeland security missions. The Dubai Ports World issue has intensified debate on U.S. port and maritime security, with some questioning the Coast Guard's presence on port grounds. The Coast Guard's FY2007 budget request includes $17 million for Maritime Domain Awareness, which involves monitoring harbor traffic and developing Joint Harbor Operation Centers. This funding aims to enhance the Coast Guard's ability to identify threats approaching U.S. shores and coordinate response activities with other law enforcement agencies. The FY2007 request includes funding for procurement of a nationwide Automatic Identification System (AIS) for vessel tracking and communication in U.S. harbors. Additionally, there is funding for a Maritime Security and Response Team based in Chesapeake, VA, focused on maritime counter-terrorism response. The House report expresses concerns about DHS' progress in securing ports and inbound commerce, recommending increased funding for Coast Guard port security inspectors. The House report recommended $15 million for AIS deployment and additional port security inspectors. The Senate provided $3,767 million for maritime border security, with increases for Maritime Security Response Teams and Maritime Domain Awareness. Senator Byrd's amendment allocated $184 million for new patrol boats and cutter maintenance for the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard will receive $184 million for new patrol boats, cutter maintenance, patrol aircraft, and arming helicopters. Concerns have been raised about the agency's ability to sustain non-homeland security missions. The Senate rejected the President's proposal to close LORAN stations nationwide, opting to maintain them in specific regions due to concerns about GPS reliability. The House committee noted that the Coast Guard must reach an agreement with the Department of Transportation before terminating the LORAN system. P.L. 109-295 assumes continuation of the LORAN-C program until certain requirements are met. Rescue 21, the Coast Guard's new coastal zone communications network, is crucial for search and rescue missions. The Senate and House agreed to allocate $40 million for the deployment of this system. The House committee expressed concerns about the Coast Guard's management of the Rescue-21 program, citing a tripling of project costs, likely further cost increases, and delays in project completion. The U.S. Secret Service has two main missions related to homeland security - criminal investigations and protection. The Secret Service's protective mission covers high-ranking officials, foreign missions, and National Special Security Events designated by the President. They are responsible for organizing security arrangements involving various law enforcement units for major events in the United States. The Secret Service's FY2007 budget request included $1,265 million for protection and criminal investigation missions, a $60 million increase from FY2006. Specific breakdowns included $722 million for protection, $302 million for field operations, and no specified amount for the National Special Security Event fund due to uncertainty. The FY2007 appropriations for DHS included $236 million for field operations, $22 million for international field offices, and $44 million for electronic crimes program and task forces. The House proposed a total appropriation of $1,293 million, with allocations for protection, administration, training, investigations, special event security, and acquisition. This was an increase of $89 million from the previous year. The Senate proposed a total appropriation of $1,293 million, with slightly different allocations for protection, administration, training, investigations, and acquisition. The proposed appropriation for USS in FY2007 was $1,226 million, an increase of $22 million from FY2006. Congress appropriated $1,277 million for USS in FY2007, with allocations for protection, administration, training, investigations, and field operations. Of the $962 million for protection, administration, and training, funds were allocated for official reception, protective travel, candidate nominee protection, and National Special Security Events. The FY2007 appropriation for USS was $1,277 million, with allocations for protection, administration, training, investigations, and field operations. The $311 million appropriated for investigations and field operations includes funding for technical assistance to foreign law enforcement, forensic support for missing and exploited children investigations, and grant activities related to missing and exploited children. Title III includes appropriations for the Preparedness Directorate and FEMA. The appropriations accounts under Title III include Chief Medical Officer, U.S. Fire Administration, Office for Grants and Training, Infrastructure Protection, and Office of National Capital Region Coordination. These accounts focus on coordinating federal plans for biological terrorist attacks, educating the public on firefighting, providing grant funding for security threats, assessing threats to infrastructure, and administering federal programs for the National Capital Region. The FY2006 enacted and FY2007 requested appropriations for Title III show a decrease in budget authority. G&T is responsible for coordinating state and local homeland security programs and grants. The G&T program administers grants and training for state and local homeland security efforts. The FY2007 budget request proposes reductions in funding for various programs, raising policy issues for Congress to address. The Administration's determination of homeland security needs is reflected in the proposed increase in grant funding to states and localities by $68 million. Congress appropriated $41 million more than FY2006 for these programs, with a proposal to consolidate UASI sub-grants into TIPP with an appropriation of $600 million. Critics argue that the distribution of past funding has been inadequate and unfair. The Administration's budget proposal for FY2007 requested $293 million for fire grants, a 46% cut from the previous year. Priority would be given to grant applications enhancing terrorism capabilities, with funding available for training, vehicles, firefighting equipment, and personal protective equipment. Wellness/fitness activities and fire station modifications would not be funded. The Administration did not request funding for SAFER Act grants in FY2007, stating that local public safety agencies should fund personnel themselves. The House Appropriations Committee directed DHS to administer grant programs similarly to the current year, without limiting eligible activities or refocusing on terrorism priorities. The Senate Appropriations Committee advised DHS to continue direct funding to fire departments and the peer review process. The conference agreement provided $547 million for fire grants and $115 million for SAFER for FY2007. The Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) was funded at $30 million for FY2006 and was slated for elimination in the FY2007 budget proposal. The Administration proposed ongoing municipal emergency planning activities be supported at the discretion of states using funds from the SHSGP and UASI grant programs. The FY2007 budget proposed ongoing municipal emergency planning activities be supported at the discretion of states using funds from the SHSGP and UASI grant programs. H.R. 5441 provided $33 million for the program and established its first explicit authorization through FY2008. The Office of the DHS Chief Medical Officer was created in July 2005 with Dr. Jeffrey Runge appointed to coordinate public health and medical programs, funded at $2 million for FY2006 and $5 million for FY2007. The FY2007 budget allocated $5 million for FEMA, with the first explicit authorization for the CMO position. FEMA faced controversy after Hurricane Katrina, leading to investigations and legislative proposals. The FY2007 DHS appropriations legislation modified FEMA's structure and leadership. Title VI of the FY2007 DHS appropriations legislation modifies FEMA's structure and leadership hierarchy, expands the agency's mission, and requires changes in operational procedures effective January 1, 2007. The President's FY2007 request for FEMA did not propose significant changes, with the House-approved bill funding the agency slightly above the previous year's level. The Senate approved a funding level that was lower than the requested amount, primarily due to reductions in disaster relief and mitigation funding. The Senate approved a funding level $50 million below the House, with differences in urban search and rescue, pre-disaster mitigation, Disaster Relief Fund, and administrative funding. The legislation appropriates approximately $450 million less than requested by the Administration and roughly $100 million less than the amounts approved by the House and Senate. The Senate approved a funding level $50 million below the House, with differences in urban search and rescue, pre-disaster mitigation, Disaster Relief Fund, and administrative funding. The legislation appropriates approximately $450 million less than requested by the Administration. Roughly two-thirds of the FEMA funding is used for disaster relief and recovery activities authorized by the Stafford Act. Funds are used to meet immediate needs of victims, help communities repair or rebuild damaged facilities, and provide loans to local governments. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) provides funding for disaster relief in earthquake-prone areas, helps local governments with lost tax revenues, and supports preparedness plans. Congress appropriates supplemental funding for the DRF when annual appropriations are insufficient. The Administration requested $1,941 million for the DRF for FY2007, but the final agreed amount was $1,500 million. The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) deploys medical response teams during disasters. The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) was transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 2007. NDMS is funded at $34 million annually and deployment costs during disasters are covered by the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). In FY2006, a one-time amount of $100 million was provided for NDMS. In FY2006, $100 million was provided to NDMS for Hurricane Katrina response expenses. $70 million was transferred to CMS to reimburse healthcare providers. Congress addressed policy issues in P.L. 109-295, including FEMA's location and authorities post-Katrina. FEMA remained within DHS as a \"distinct entity\" after debate. Congress agreed to keep FEMA within DHS as a \"distinct entity\" with merged mission and resources from the Preparedness Directorate. Certain offices and authorities will not be integrated with FEMA, including the Chief Medical Officer, National Cybersecurity, National Communications, and Infrastructure Protection. An Office of Emergency Communications will be established in DHS, separate from FEMA, to address communication needs of emergency responders. Title VI addresses personnel and leadership concerns, requiring the FEMA Administrator to meet specific qualifications and establishing an advisory council. This aims to address concerns about retiring federal workforce and depleted personnel in essential areas. The FEMA Administrator has authority to issue incentives to recruit skilled persons or retain those who would otherwise retire. The Homeland Security Act is amended to establish specific requirements for preparedness and operational procedures. FEMA must now consider state emergency plans with catastrophic incident annex and evacuation procedures. National preparedness system elements are now based on statute. Programs from the former Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate are now in the Preparedness Directorate. The Infrastructure Protection and Information Security (IPIS) appropriation, funded through the Preparedness Directorate, includes various program/project activities focused on critical infrastructure information, asset identification, vulnerability assessments, risk assessments, and infrastructure protection planning. The FY2007 request for IPIS activities was $76 million below FY2006 enacted levels. The FY2007 request for IPIS activities was $76 million below FY2006 enacted levels. Most program requests maintained current activity levels with technical adjustments resulting in both increases and decreases in funds for certain programs. For example, the Biosurveillance program saw a 43% reduction in budget request, while the NS/EP Program had a $2 million increase. The NISAC program's budget was reduced by nearly $4 million due to facility construction completion. The budget request for IPIS in FY2007 was $76 million below FY2006 levels. Significant programmatic changes were made in the CIOP and PA areas, with no funds requested for the National Center for Critical Information Processing and Storage. Congress had previously appropriated $50 million for the center, and an increase of $35 million was requested for NIPP activities within the CIOP program. The budget request for the PA program in FY2007 included reductions in funding for various sub-programs, such as the Protective Security Analysis Center and Protective Measures Demonstration Pilots. Additional cuts were made to activities related to Control Systems, National Terrorist Prevention Training Program, Coordinate National Protection Efforts, and General Security Plans. New funding was requested for a Chemical Security Office within the PA program. The House voted to appropriate the full amount of funds requested by the Administration for the PA program, including $35 million for National Infrastructure Protection Plan activities and $10 million for a new Chemical Security Office. However, $20 million for Management and Administration and $10 million from the Management and Administration account were made unavailable for obligation until certain conditions were met. The Senate appropriated $525 million for the IPIS budget activity, with funds allocated between programs. The report called for enhanced national bombing prevention efforts and directed the development of state cybersecurity strategies. Additionally, the Secretary was directed to submit a report on resources needed for mandatory security requirements in the chemical sector. The Senate added amendments to implement mandatory security requirements for the nation's chemical sector and audit compliance. One amendment requires a report on efforts to comply with recommendations from a 2006 Inspector General report on the National Asset Database. Another forbids certain funds for officer travel until recommendations are implemented. The Senate passed a third amendment expanding the role of the National Infrastructure Analysis and Simulation Center for federal agencies with critical infrastructure responsibilities. Both houses approved the recommendations with the passage of P.L. 109-295, allocating $547 million for the IPIS budget activity. $10 million was withheld until the department reports to Congress on resources. The bill mandated mandatory security requirements for the chemical sector and restructured FEMA within the department. Functions of the Preparedness Directorate were transferred to the agency, except for certain offices. The bill also included language related to the National Infrastructure Analysis and Simulation. The conference committee excluded Senate language on travel fund restrictions for department officials related to the National Asset Database. Title IV includes appropriations for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and DNDO. USCIS focuses on immigration petition adjudication and naturalization petitions for legal permanent residents. Table 13 details Title IV appropriations. USCIS is responsible for processing immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, refugee and asylum claims, and citizenship benefits. Funding largely comes from the Examinations Fee Account, with a significant increase in fees in FY2004. In FY2005, USCIS had budget authority for $1,571 million from the Examinations Fee Account, with a direct appropriation of $160 million from Congress. In FY2005, Congress provided a direct appropriation of $160 million for USCIS. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 required a $500 fraud prevention fee on H-1B and L petitioners, with the fee divided among DHS, DOS, and DOL. DHS also receives 5% of H-1B education and training fees in the Nonimmigrant Petitioner Account. In FY2006, Congress provided $1,889 million for USCIS, with 94% from fees and a direct appropriation of $115 million. This included $80 million for backlog reduction and $35 million for IT transformation. The FY2006 appropriations decreased by 29% from FY2005. FY2007 sought an increase of $68 million for USCIS, totaling $1,986 million, with the majority from individual fees. For FY2007, USCIS expected to receive $1,804 million in funding, with the bulk coming from fees paid by individuals and businesses filing petitions. The Examinations Fee Account alone comprised 91% of the total USCIS budget request. Additionally, $13 million was allocated from the H-1B Nonimmigrant Petitioner Account and $31 million from the H-1B and L Fraud Prevention and Detection Account. The Administration proposed using the $31 million for expanding its Fraud Detection and National Security Office. The direct appropriation requested was $182 million, an increase of $67 million from FY2006. The House-passed bill, H.R. 5441, would have appropriated $162 million for USCIS in FY2007, while the Senate proposed $135 million in direct appropriations. An amendment suggested increasing fees to generate an additional $350 million, with $85 million allocated to USCIS for business transformation and fraud detection. The final allocation provided USCIS with $182 million, with $47 million contingent on approval for a business system transformation plan. Additionally, $114 million was allocated for expanding the Employment Eligibility Verification system. The USCIS received $114 million for expanding the Employment Eligibility Verification system and $21 million for the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system. Congress has expressed concern about processing delays and pending caseloads, with USCIS having a total of $1,986 million in resources. There are questions about whether USCIS can handle potential increases in immigration workload as Congress considers comprehensive immigration reform legislation. The USCIS received funding for expanding verification systems. Concerns have been raised about processing delays and pending caseloads, as well as the coordination between USCIS and ICE in fraud investigations. USCIS has established the Office of Fraud Detection and National Security to address these issues. The Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005 (H.R. 4437) would establish an Office of Security and Investigations (OSI) in USCIS to formalize law enforcement duties. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides training for various law enforcement entities, focusing on developing skills and knowledge for safe and effective law enforcement functions. FLETC has four training sites in the US, over 1,000 employees, and trained 47,560 law enforcement students in FY2005. In FY2005, FLETC trained 47,560 law enforcement students. The FY2007 budget request for FLETC was $245 million, with increases for Border Patrol and ICE training, and a Counterterrorism Operational Training Facility. The House and Senate passed bills with varying funding amounts for FLETC, with the final act providing $275 million. The FY2007 budget provides $275 million for FLETC, including $9 million for training resources, $22 million for renovation, and $2 million for the Counter-terrorism Operations Training Facility. The Science and Technology budget saw a 33% reduction, mainly due to funding for the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office being moved to a separate account. The House provided $956 million for S&T. The FY2007 budget for Science and Technology (S&T) saw a 33% reduction, with the House providing $956 million, $46 million less than the request. The Senate provided $818 million, $184 million less than the request, and rescinded $200 million in unobligated balances. The final bill (P.L. 109-295) allocated $973 million for S&T and rescinded $125 million from prior years. Comparing the FY2007 request with previous years was challenging due to accounting factors and changes in funding allocations for R&D portfolios. The FY2007 budget for Science and Technology (S&T) saw a 33% reduction, with the House providing $956 million, $46 million less than the request. The Senate provided $818 million, $184 million less than the request, and rescinded $200 million in unobligated balances. The final bill (P.L. 109-295) allocated $973 million for S&T and rescinded $125 million from prior years. The FY2007 request would have reduced net funding for some portfolios and increased funding for others, offsetting changes made in FY2006. The Senate increased funding for Counter-MANPADS and reduced Management and Administration and Explosives Countermeasures. The final bill decreased Management and Administration and Chemical Countermeasures, while increasing Biological Countermeasures, Counter-MANPADS, and Critical Infrastructure Protection. Both House and Senate committee reports criticized the S&T Directorate, with the House reducing the Management and Administration account by $5 million for lack of responsiveness. The House and Senate committees made significant amounts of funding unavailable for obligation in various accounts until specific conditions are met. The House committee criticized the lack of detail in the budget justification and expressed disappointment in DHS's inability to justify their funding request. The final bill restricted $60 million from the Management and Administration account and $50 million from the Research, Development, Acquisition, and Operations Account. The department's FY2007 budget request marked the end of a consolidation period for its R&D programs, as directed by Congress in the FY2004 appropriations conference report. In FY2007, the Department of Homeland Security proposed no further consolidations in its R&D programs. The Senate approved transferring DNDO funding into a separate account, comprising over one-third of the department's R&D budget. The Senate also reversed the move of the TSA program by appropriating $92 million for R&D in TSA and transferring $99 million from S&T to TSA. The FY2007 request for DNDO was $535 million, a 70% increase from FY2006. In FY2007, DNDO received increased funding to support new R&D initiatives, procurement of detection equipment, and staff salaries. The House provided $500 million, while the Senate provided $442 million, with reductions from the requested amounts. The House expressed dissatisfaction with DNDO's transfer out of S&T but approved it due to the mission's critical importance. The Senate reduced funding for university research and directed S&T to support DNDO's R&D needs. The Senate committee report directed DNDO to work with S&T for university research funding, allocating $481 million in the final bill. The budget resolutions proposed $873 billion in discretionary budget authority for FY2007, with differences between the House and Senate versions leading to challenges in resolution. The House and Senate adopted deeming resolutions to set FY2007 discretionary spending levels at $873 billion. Homeland security budget authority is included in major functional categories, with specific amounts usually detailed in committee reports. Senate-passed H.R. 5441 included $648 million for port security enhancements, but this funding was not included in P.L. 109-295. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006 allocated funds for various DHS agencies, including $23 million for the U.S. Coast Guard for port security assessments and security audits, $184 million for the U.S. Coast Guard for the Integrated Deepwater Systems program, and $190 million for port security grants under the Preparedness Directorate. P.L. 109-234 was signed into law on June 15, 2006. P.L. 109-234, signed into law on June 15, 2006, includes provisions for DHS agencies and an additional $1.9 billion in border security funding focused on personnel. It does not include $648 million in port security grant funding. Title I provides $75 million in transfers and $27 million for the Coast Guard's Operating Expenses account. Title II allocates funds for Hurricane Relief and Recovery for various agencies including CBP and FEMA. The P.L. 109-234, signed into law on June 15, 2006, includes provisions for DHS agencies and an additional $1.9 billion in border security funding. This funding includes allocations for FEMA, CBP, ICE, ODP, and FLETC, as well as deployment of National Guard troops to the border and funding for legal services to the Department of Justice. Sec. 7004 and Sec. 7005 of P.L. 109-148 would rescind unobligated balances and provide funding to the Secret Service and the office of the Secretary and Executive Management. The legislation also includes provisions impacting DHS budget accounts, such as an across-the-board rescission of 1% and transfer of funds to the Coast Guard. The DoD Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-148) includes a provision transferring up to $100 million to the Coast Guard from the Iraq Freedom Fund for operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. Additionally, there is a 1% across-the-board rescission applied to all discretionary FY2006 appropriations. The ATB rescission in FY2006 does not apply to emergency appropriations or discretionary budget authority for the Department of Veterans Affairs. P.L. 109-148 provides emergency supplemental appropriations for DHS accounts to address Hurricane Katrina impacts, including reallocating $17.1 billion to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The Congressional response to Hurricane Katrina included additional funding for DHS accounts to repair and replace equipment and facilities. Funding allocations included $24.1 million for CBP, $13 million for ICE, $132 million for the Coast Guard, $3.6 million for the Secret Service, $10.3 million for ODP, and $17.2 million for FEMA. The Congressional response to Hurricane Katrina included additional funding for DHS accounts to repair and replace equipment and facilities. This section of P.L. 109-148 transfers $1.5 million from FEMA's Disaster Relief Account to the \"Disaster Assistance Direct Loan Program Account\" for the direct loan program. Rescissions affecting DHS accounts include $23.4 billion from FEMA's Disaster Relief account and $260.5 million from the Coast Guard's Operating Expenses account. Additionally, P.L. 109-148 provides an additional $47.3 million for the DHS Office of the Secretary and Executive. P.L. 109-148 allocates $47.3 million for the DHS Office of the Secretary and Executive Management for training and preparation for a potential influenza outbreak. Division D of the bill includes provisions for additional border security funding. The ANWR provisions were removed from the Defense Appropriations Bill by S.Con.Res. 74, not included in P.L. 109-148. There has been increasing interest in homeland security funding since 9/11, with annual reports to Congress on combating terrorism. Homeland security funding analysis has become more refined over the years. Homeland security funding has become more precise over the years, with DHS accounting for 48% of total federal funding. The Department of Defense follows at 29%, with other agencies like Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy also contributing to homeland security spending. The five agencies collectively account for nearly 93% of all federal spending on homeland security. Not all DHS funding is classified as pertaining to homeland security activities, as legacy agencies conduct other activities. The FY2007 requests included a total homeland security budget authority of $27.7 billion for DHS out of a requested total gross budget authority of $39.8 billion."
