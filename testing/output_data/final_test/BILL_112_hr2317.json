    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Promoting Green Transportation Infrastructure through Research and Development Act.\" It establishes the Office of Climate Change and Environment. The Act establishes the Office of Climate Change and Environment and amends Section 102(g) of title 49, United States Code to focus on research activities reducing vehicle miles traveled, congestion, and emissions. The Act establishes the Office of Climate Change and Environment to focus on research activities reducing vehicle miles traveled, congestion, emissions, maintenance-related emissions, energy consumption, assessing consumer acceptance of alternative fuels, and strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve energy in surface transportation infrastructure. Research activities include assessing the impact, cost-effectiveness, and collateral benefits of emissions and energy reduction strategies. The Office of Climate Change and Environment focuses on research activities related to reducing emissions and energy consumption in transportation infrastructure, including congestion reduction, land use impact assessments, alternative fuels and vehicles infrastructure requirements, and traveler behavior analysis. The Office of Climate Change and Environment focuses on research activities related to reducing emissions and energy consumption in transportation infrastructure, including mode-choice, response to transportation pricing scheme, nonmotorized travel, emissions reduction strategies for freight transportation, adaptation to climate change impacts on surface transportation infrastructure, and assessment of current infrastructure. The Office focuses on assessing historical surface transportation infrastructure and fuel demand management strategies at local, State, and national levels for their social, economic, and environmental impacts. Results are made publicly available through the Research and Innovative Technology Administration website. Additionally, the Office supports the development of accurate tools and models for quantifying mobile emissions and evaluating transportation emissions reduction strategies in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies. The models for transportation research shall consider factors like vehicle speed, traffic flow, land use, nonmotorized travel, transit use, traveler behavior, and commercial traffic. The results of this research will be publicly accessible to national, State, and local transportation planners and decision-makers. Establishment of Regional Green Transportation Research Centers under section 5505A of title 49, United States Code. The Administrator of the Research and Innovative Technology Administration of the Department of Transportation will provide grants to higher education institutions to establish university transportation centers for green transportation infrastructure research and technology transfer. The objectives include developing innovative approaches to mitigate environmental impacts in transportation infrastructure, integrating green infrastructure into wastewater management systems, and promoting adoption of green transportation innovations. The Administrator will provide grants to higher education institutions for green transportation infrastructure research and technology transfer. Grant recipients must submit applications and regional centers will be established. The Administrator will select grant recipients based on expertise in transportation research, research capacity, technology transfer resources, and partnerships with government and industry involved in green transportation infrastructure. The Administrator will select grant recipients based on expertise in green transportation infrastructure research, leadership in developing best management practices, expertise in regional climate characteristics, ability to disseminate research results, and proposed strategic plan for grant implementation. The Administrator may support research and development of innovative technologies, construction techniques, and best management processes to mitigate the environmental impact of transportation infrastructure. This includes assessing life-cycle environmental impact, integrating green elements into existing systems, and testing new technologies. The Administrator supports research on new technologies and best practices for green transportation infrastructure. This includes a regional technology transfer program, studying the impact of regulations, and public education efforts to raise awareness. The Administrator convenes an annual meeting of Centers to promote collaboration and share best practices for green transportation infrastructure, including natural design techniques for stormwater management and aquifer recharge. The text chunk discusses the utilization of natural design techniques for stormwater management, minimizing impervious surfaces, reducing energy consumption, and minimizing air pollution in green transportation infrastructure. SEC. 4. PAVEMENT RESEARCH, TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, AND EDUCATION PROGRAM. The Administrator of the Research and Innovative Technology Administration shall establish a pavement research, deployment, and education program to advance pavement research and coordinate technology transfer efforts related to paving materials. Funding will be provided to university transportation centers and other institutions of higher education for research, development, and technology transfer activities on paving materials and practices. The Program will conduct research and development on innovative technologies and techniques to reduce costs and environmental impact of paving materials and practices, including durability, energy efficiency, environmental impact, life-cycle cost reduction, safety, construction time, traffic disruption, and pavement evaluation technologies. The Program focuses on researching and developing innovative paving materials and practices to reduce costs and environmental impact. This includes evaluating pavement technologies, utilizing recycled materials, addressing barriers to implementation, and conducting independent studies on durability, emissions, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impact. The Administrator will submit a report on the results of the long-term pavement performance program and plans for organizing and utilizing the database to relevant committees within 6 months of the Act's enactment."
