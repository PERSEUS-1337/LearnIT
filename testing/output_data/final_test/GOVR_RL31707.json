Sinhalese Buddhist kingdoms were established in the central part of the island by Indo-Aryans, while Tamil Hindus settled in the northeastern coastal areas. The island was colonized by the Portuguese, Dutch, and English, becoming a British crown colony in 1815. Tamil laborers from India were brought to work on plantations in the southern highlands in the late 19th century, forming a 4% population cluster in the \"tea country.\" Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, has a diverse population including Sinhalese Buddhists, Tamil Hindus, Moorish and Malay Muslims. The country faced ethnic conflict between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority after gaining independence from Britain in 1948. The Sinhalese-dominated government discriminated against Tamils, leading to a civil war lasting 26 years. The conflict ended in 2009 with the defeat of Tamil separatist groups. An estimated 30,000-40,000 people were killed. Sri Lanka denies war crimes accusations and resists international pressure for reform. Since 2009, U.S.-Sri Lanka relations have focused on addressing human rights abuses at the end of the civil war. The U.S. supports a transparent reconciliation process in Sri Lanka, including accountability for violations by all parties. Susan Rice welcomed the U.N. Panel of Experts Report on Sri Lanka in April 2011, emphasizing the need for an independent investigation to address allegations of abuse and ensure accountability. The U.S. has been pushing for accountability for human rights violations in Sri Lanka since 2009. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Blake emphasized the importance of addressing these issues and stated that international mechanisms may be necessary if governments fail to act. In 2012, the U.S. sponsored a UN resolution calling on Sri Lanka to address human rights violations and inequalities between ethnic groups. In 2013, another resolution was adopted urging Sri Lanka to address human rights concerns. The 113th Congress has expressed its views on the situation in Sri Lanka through H.Res. 247, which calls for transparency, reconciliation, media freedom, investigation into war crimes, access for humanitarian workers, demilitarization, and equal distribution of political power. USAID has been present in Sri Lanka since 1948, aiming to address inequitable growth and development between Sinhalese and Tamil provinces. USAID has been active in Sri Lanka since 1948, focusing on economic assistance programs for marginalized communities. Projects aim for sustainable development and include initiatives to improve democratic institutions. USAID has supported the agricultural sector, infrastructure upgrades for schools and hospitals, and defense cooperation through the International Broadcast Bureau. The U.S. also provides technical and training opportunities in various fields. The Republic of Sri Lanka has a multi-party democratic structure with high levels of political conflict and violence. President Mahinda Rajapaksa's Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP) are the main political parties. The SLFP, led by President Rajapaksa, gained popularity for ending the war and is seen as more Sinhala nationalist. Political divisions between the Sinhalese and Tamil populations persist. The government in Sri Lanka has made constitutional amendments to prevent provinces from merging, limiting Tamil influence in regions where they have large populations. The SLFP is strengthening the central government to maintain power under President Rajapaksa's leadership. Sri Lanka operates under a strong executive presidential system, with the president having significant authority over parliament and government appointments. President Rajapaksa was reelected in 2011 for a second term, with his family playing a prominent role in governance. The 2011 parliamentary election in Sri Lanka was influenced by violations of election laws and the ruling UPFA now holds a significant majority. The government, led by President Rajapaksa, is accused of human rights violations, including restrictions on free speech and appointments of family members to high-ranking positions. The next presidential election is scheduled for 2015 and the next parliamentary election by 2016. Human rights groups criticize the government for human rights violations and lack of transparency. Sri Lanka's economy relies on services, tourism, agriculture, and industry, with major exports including garments, tea, and gems. The country faces trade deficits and aims to improve the investment climate. The US is a significant trading partner for Sri Lanka. The United States is a major market for Sri Lanka's garment exports, accounting for nearly 40% of total exports. India is the largest foreign investor in Sri Lanka, with over $1 billion in direct investments in the past decade. Colombo has been criticized for alleged human rights violations and favoring the Sinhalese population over the Tamil population. The Sri Lankan government has been accused of human rights abuses against its Tamil population, including media control, harassment of journalists, disappearances of Tamil sympathizers, and monitoring of Tamil populations. Despite some actions taken by the government, they are viewed as ineffective. The United Nations Human Rights Council passed a critical resolution in 2013 with support from the United States and India. The Council passed a resolution criticizing Sri Lanka for human rights violations during the civil war. Despite opposition from the Sri Lankan government, 25 countries supported the resolution. It encourages action but lacks international investigations. Colombo rejects international actions as unfair. Sri Lanka strongly opposes the U.S. resolution, emphasizing its efforts in rebuilding Tamil areas and promoting reconciliation. The country's envoy criticizes the international community's indifference and highlights Sri Lanka's strategic importance in the Indian Ocean. India shares historical ties with Sri Lanka, especially with the Tamil populations. India has been an active voice for reconciliation and fair elections in Sri Lanka, due to the kinship felt with Sri Lanka's Tamils. The relationship between the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka and native Tamil populations in India has influenced relations between ethnic groups. India has hosted a large number of Tamil refugees, with over 100,000 estimated to reside in Tamil Nadu. Recent contentions have risen over the Palk Strait, a strait between the southern tip of India's state of Tamil Nadu, and the northern tip of Sri Lanka, where fishermen from both nations compete for limited resources. Sri Lankans accuse Indian fishermen of encroaching into their waters, while Indian fishermen accuse Sri Lankan naval vessels of threatening behavior. This dispute is part of a larger grudge between native Tamil Indians who sympathize with the defeated Tamil minorities in Sri Lanka and their mistrust of the Sinhalese dominant government. India and Sri Lanka have a close relationship through commercial interests, tourism, education, and migrant workers. China has invested heavily in Sri Lanka's defense and security, as part of its strategic \"string of pearls\" approach to gain access to ports for securing its interests. China's economic and trade centers on the east coast have received significant investment from China, enabling Sri Lanka to win its civil war against the LTTE. Chinese aid provided military superiority to defeat the LTTE, in exchange for development rights for port facilities and other investments. China has also assisted with large infrastructure projects, including a second international airport, a telecommunications tower in Colombo, and the reconstruction of highway A9 between Kandy and Jaffna. Additionally, China is involved in railway projects and a $1.3 billion coal power plant in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka's disapproval of the West's and India's focus on human rights within the country has led some to conclude that foreign influences are waning in Sri Lanka relative to Chinese influence. India and China have unresolved border disputes dating back to their 1962 border war. China remains a large trading partner of Sri Lanka with $3.2 billion in bilateral trade in 2011. Sri Lanka holds the status as the only. Sri Lanka, with a high Human Development Index score, focuses on health and education. The Ministry of Health targets various health issues and provides universal healthcare. The country has diverse ecosystems, with concerns about the environment and natural disasters. Sri Lanka is a biodiversity hotspot with a high number of endemic species of amphibians, Asian elephants, Indian tigers, and the endangered lion-tailed macaque. The region also has a high freshwater fish endemism. It is known for important medical plants, grain sources, spices, and genetic resources of plants and animals. The biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka is home to a high number of endemic species and faces a real threat of destruction due to lack of conservation efforts. The nation's remaining forests have been reduced by 20.9% between 1990 and 2010, mainly due to illegal activities such as farming, logging, and poaching. Illegal activities continue to degrade Sri Lanka's forests and biodiversity, altering the terrain of the disaster-prone nation. Natural disasters, including cyclones, tsunamis, landslides, droughts, and floods, have caused over 37,000 deaths in the last 34 years. The 2004 tsunami, triggered by a 9.0 scale earthquake, claimed over 31,000 lives in Sri Lanka. The Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reports that displacement due to natural disasters like tsunamis and floods is common in Sri Lanka, with a recent example in November 2010 affecting close to 1.2 million people."
