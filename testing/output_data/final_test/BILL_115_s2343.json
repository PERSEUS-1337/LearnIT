    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Precision Agriculture Connectivity Act of 2018\". Precision agriculture technologies increase crop yields, reduce input costs, and improve resource management. Studies show these technologies can lower operation costs by $25 per acre and boost farm yields by 70% by 2050. Reliable broadband Internet access is crucial for realizing these benefits. The Federal Communications Commission plays a crucial role in deploying broadband Internet access to unserved agricultural land in the United States, essential for the economy and global food production. Despite increasing demand, reliable broadband access is not consistently available for agricultural operations. The Federal Communications Commission is crucial in deploying broadband Internet access to unserved agricultural land in the United States. Despite increasing demand, reliable broadband access is not consistently available for agricultural operations. SEC. 3. TASK FORCE. The Task Force for Reviewing the Connectivity and Technology Needs of Precision Agriculture in the United States is established by the Commission, with defined terms such as broadband Internet access service, Commission, Department, Secretary, and Task Force. The Task Force must be established within 1 year of the Act's enactment and will review the connectivity and technology needs of precision agriculture in the country. The Task Force for Reviewing the Connectivity and Technology Needs of Precision Agriculture in the United States will collaborate with stakeholders to identify gaps in broadband access on agricultural land and develop policy recommendations for expanded deployment by 2025. The Task Force will recommend new rules and steps for obtaining reliable data on broadband access to support unserved agricultural land. The Task Force will recommend specific steps to ensure the expertise of the Secretary and farm data are reflected in future Commission programs for broadband infrastructure deployment to unserved agricultural land. No duplicate data reporting requirements for broadband providers to the Commission. The Task Force will consult with the Secretary to utilize Department resources for identifying agricultural areas in developing recommendations for future Commission programs. The Task Force and Commission will not include universal service programs in their interpretation of future Commission programs. The Task Force, in consultation with the Secretary, will identify agricultural areas to develop recommendations for expanding broadband Internet access on unserved agricultural land. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, a list of federal programs for this purpose will be submitted to the Task Force. The Task Force will consist of up to 15 voting members, including agricultural producers selected by the Commission Chairman. The Task Force, in consultation with the Secretary, will identify agricultural areas to develop recommendations for expanding broadband Internet access on unserved agricultural land. The Task Force will consist of up to 15 voting members, including agricultural producers, tribal agriculture representatives, Internet service providers, and representatives from the electric cooperative industry. The Task Force will include representatives from the electric cooperative industry, satellite industry, precision agriculture equipment manufacturers, State and local governments, and will be balanced in terms of technologies and fields represented. The Task Force, including various industry representatives, will have members appointed for a 2-year term, with vacancies filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Secretary will serve as an ex-officio, nonvoting member. The Task Force is required to submit annual reports to the Chairman of the Commission. The Task Force will submit annual reports detailing broadband Internet access coverage on agricultural land, future connectivity needs, and measurement processes. The Task Force will be renewed every 2 years until it terminates on January 1, 2025. The Senate passed S. 2343 on December 6, 2018, requiring the FCC to establish a task force to address connectivity and technology needs in precision agriculture in the United States."
