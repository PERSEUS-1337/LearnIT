The Appalachian Regional Commission Reform Act aims to relocate the Commission's headquarters from Washington, DC, to a more affordable location within Appalachia to reduce administrative costs and increase accountability to the region. The Appalachian Regional Commission Reform Act aims to relocate the Commission's headquarters to the Appalachian region to be closer to the people it serves and increase accountability. Congress recognizes the Commission's role in fostering economic opportunity and addressing disparities in the region. The Commission has faced criticism for its shortcomings in fulfilling its mission, as highlighted in various studies and reports over the years. This includes concerns about duplicative programming and calls for budget reductions. The Office of Management and Budget has emphasized the importance of targeting assistance to distressed areas. The Commission has faced criticism for its shortcomings and calls for reform due to long-standing issues. Congress acknowledges the need for reform based on past data and current challenges in addressing persistent poverty in distressed areas. The Commission is urged to focus on the most persistent poverty areas in the Appalachian region, with findings showing that a significant portion of funding did not reach distressed counties. According to author Ronald D. Eller in 2014, the Commission's policies focused resources on 'growth centers' in the Appalachian region, benefiting the poor and middle class but neglecting the most rural distressed counties and systemic inequalities. The Commission increased allocation for distressed counties to 30% in 1995 as per instructions from the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations. Section 7.5(c) of the Commission's Code reflects this change. The Commission increased allocation for distressed counties to 30% in 1995, reflecting a policy change. Despite economic conditions not greatly improving since the 1960s, more funding should be devoted to these areas. Congress finds that at least 50% of grant expenditures should be allocated. The Commission increased allocation for distressed counties to 30% in 1995, reflecting a policy change. Congress now proposes increasing the 50% threshold to 60% for grant expenditures to benefit severely distressed areas in the Appalachian region. The Appalachian Regional Commission's mission is focused on poverty reduction and economic development in the region's most persistently impoverished areas. The Commission's headquarters location is also addressed in the legislation. The legislation amends the Appalachian Regional Commission's headquarters location to be in the Appalachian region. Grant expenditures are also adjusted from 50 percent to 60 percent, and area development funds are allocated for distressed counties. Section 14526(b) of title 40, United States Code is amended to allocate at least 60 percent of funds for projects in distressed counties under the Area Development Program of the Commission. The methodology for determining distressed counties remains unchanged. The Appalachian Regional Commission Reform Act requires the Commission to submit an annual report detailing the allocation of funds for the Area Development Program to specific counties and committees. The Appalachian Regional Commission Reform Act mandates annual reporting on fund allocation to specific counties and committees, including the Senate, House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works."
