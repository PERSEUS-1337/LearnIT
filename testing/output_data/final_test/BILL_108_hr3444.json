The Congress finds a strong link between diet and health, with increased caloric intake contributing to obesity in the United States. Obesity rates have doubled in children and tripled in teens since 1980, leading to health problems and significant costs. Excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the country. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, affecting women and younger individuals as well. Increased sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, which can lead to heart disease and stroke. The economic impact of heart disease is significant, costing $298 billion in health care and lost productivity in 2001. The rise in meals consumed outside the home is significant, with a third of calories and nearly half of total food spending going towards restaurant and food-service establishments. Nutrition labeling is mandatory for processed foods but only required for restaurant foods with nutrient content or health claims. Using food labels is linked to healthier diets, with many individuals changing their food choices based on label information. Consumers struggle to control calorie intake at restaurants due to limited nutrition information and oversized portions, leading to overeating. SEC. 3. NUTRITION LABELING OF RESTAURANT FOODS. Nutrition labeling requirements for foods served in restaurants and similar establishments with 20 or more outlets in a chain are amended to include listing calories, saturated plus trans fat, and sodium content per menu item. This also applies to foods prepared in these establishments but not for immediate consumption. The nutrition labeling requirements for foods served in chain restaurants with 20 or more outlets are amended to include listing calories, saturated plus trans fat, and sodium content per menu item. This also applies to foods prepared in these establishments but not for immediate consumption. Additionally, vending machines and restaurant menu boards may limit nutrition labeling to total calories for foods, beverages, and meals offered for sale. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to issue regulations within 12 months to implement the new nutrition labeling requirements for chain restaurants. Final regulations must be issued within 24 months of the enactment of the Act. Final regulations under paragraph (1) must be promulgated within 24 months of the Act's enactment. Proposed regulations will automatically become final after this period, with notice published in the Federal Register. SEC. 4 of the Act allows retail food establishments to voluntarily provide additional nutrition information that complies with federal requirements. States can also impose additional nutrition information regulations on restaurants beyond the Act's requirements."
