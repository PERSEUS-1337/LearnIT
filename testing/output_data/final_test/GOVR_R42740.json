    "content": "Section 706 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7606, authorizes the President to address national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications issues. President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13618 to assign NS/EP communications functions to the federal government, emphasizing the need for continuous communication during national security and emergency situations. Various NS/EP communications systems and programs are utilized by the federal government for effective communication during incidents and emergencies. Various systems and programs, such as GETS and WPS, are used for communication during emergencies. These systems are essential for national leadership, state and local governments, NGOs, and the private sector. The 2010 National Security Strategy emphasizes the importance of reliable telecommunications for managing crises and preventing disruptions. Following the enactment of the Communications Act of 1934, several Presidents have issued executive orders regarding NS/EP communications. For instance, President Kennedy issued EO 10995 in 1962, President Carter issued EO 12046 in 1978, President Reagan issued EO 12382 in 1982, and President Clinton issued EO 12919 in 1994. EO 13618 dissolved the National Communications System (NCS) and established an executive committee to oversee federal NS/EP communications functions. EO 13618 dissolved the National Communications System (NCS) and established an executive committee within the Department of Homeland Security to oversee federal NS/EP communications functions. This executive order assigns specific responsibilities to federal government entities, including creating a new committee, the NS/EP Communications Executive Committee, and establishing the Executive Committee Joint Program Office. DHS is assigned increased NS/EP communications functions and is responsible for co-chairing the committee with the Department of Defense. EO 13618 dissolved the National Communications System (NCS) and established the NS/EP Communications Executive Committee within the Department of Homeland Security to oversee federal NS/EP communications functions. The Committee, co-chaired by DHS and the Department of Defense, replaces NCS's Committee of Principles and is responsible for coordinating federal NS/EP communications activities. The NS/EP Communications Executive Committee, established by EO 13618, oversees federal NS/EP communications functions. It is co-chaired by DHS and DOD, responsible for advising the President on enhancing communications survivability and resilience. The Committee develops strategy, funding requirements, and plans for NS/EP communications policy discussions. The National Communications System (NCS) was established in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy following the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was later transferred to DHS in 2005 and dissolved by EO 13618. DHS now oversees NS/EP communications programs previously managed by NCS. The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Cybersecurity and Communications now oversees NS/EP communications programs previously managed by the National Communications System. The Executive Committee Joint Program Office supports the activities and responsibilities of the Committee, coordinating programs that support NS/EP missions and convening governmental and non-governmental groups. JPO is responsible for day-to-day activities and is supported by DHS in terms of resources and funding. The Executive Committee Joint Program Office (JPO) coordinates activities and develops policies for senior official review and approval related to NS/EP communications functions. The JPO is expected to be managed similarly to the Homeland Security Operations Center, with responsibilities assigned to various federal departments and agencies including DOD, DHS, Department of Commerce, General Services Administration, Director of National Intelligence, and the Federal Communications Commission. DHS and DOD have significant roles in NS/EP communications responsibilities. DOD and DHS are tasked with overseeing the development, testing, implementation, and sustainment of NS/EP communications. DOD is responsible for the security and survivability of these communications, as well as providing technical support and maintaining communication services for the Intelligence Community. DHS oversees non-DOD communications systems and Continuity of Government (COG) responsibilities. DHS is responsible for non-DOD communications systems, Continuity of Government (COG), and critical infrastructure protection networks. They provide technical support to ensure the security and survivability of NS/EP communications and disseminate information to other government levels for situational awareness. DHS also establishes the Joint Program Office (JPO) and prioritizes the restoration of NS/EP communications. Within 60 days of EO 13618 issuance, DHS must submit a detailed plan to the President outlining their organization and management structure for NS/EP communications functions. The Commerce Secretary, GSA Administrator, DNI, and FCC have specific responsibilities in managing NS/EP communications following NCS's dissolution. EO 13618 emphasizes the federal government's need for constant communication capability. The federal government ensures constant communication capability through Presidential Policy Directive 1 (PPD 1) and Executive Order (EO) 13618. EO 13618 modifies previous executive orders and establishes committees to oversee national security and emergency preparedness communications functions. It dissolves the National Communications System and assigns specific responsibilities to federal departments and agencies. The executive order establishes a programs office within the Department of Homeland Security to assist the executive committee and assigns specific responsibilities to federal government entities for managing and administering NS/EP communications systems and programs."
