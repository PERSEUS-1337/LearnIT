    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fallen Heroes of 9/11 Act\". Congressional findings are included in the Act. Since September 11, 2001, the United States has been in a unique war against terrorists who view everyone as the enemy. The attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon were direct terrorist acts on civilians, including the brave responders who perished on that tragic day. The tragic events of September 11, 2001 led to heroic actions by the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93, who prevented the aircraft from being used as a weapon. Their sacrifice deserves recognition with an appropriate medal. SEC. 3. Fallen heroes of 9/11 to receive Congressional Medals. The President may present \"Fallen Heroes of 9/11 Congressional Medals\" to individuals who died on and after September 11, 2001. The Secretary of the Treasury will strike 3 medals with suitable emblems to honor the victims of the World Trade Center attack. Individuals eligible for the \"Fallen Heroes of 9/11 Congressional Medals\" include victims of the World Trade Center attack, United Airlines Flight 93, and the Pentagon hijack victims. The Secretary must consult with the Secretary of Defense before finalizing the medal design. Any individual who died as a direct result of the 9/11 terrorism within the United States is eligible for the medal. The Secretary, in consultation with other government officials, determines eligibility for the \"Fallen Heroes of 9/11 Congressional Medals.\" The term \"act of terrorism\" is defined as premeditated violence against the United States on September 11, 2001. SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\nThe Secretary will create duplicate medals for recipients of the medals from section 3, to be displayed in precinct houses, firehouses, and other duty stations where individuals assigned on September 11, 2001, worked.

Before the end of the 120-day period after the enactment of this Act, the Secretary will establish lists of eligible recipients for medals under section 3 and duplicate medals under section 4. If any new individuals become eligible, their names will be promptly added to the appropriate list. Additionally, sales to the public will help defray costs. SEC. 6. SALES TO THE PUBLIC TO DEFRAY COSTS.\n\nThe Secretary may sell duplicates of the medals struck under this Act to cover costs. \n\nSEC. 7.
