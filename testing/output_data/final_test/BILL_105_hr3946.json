The ICCVAM Authorization Act of 1998 establishes ICCVAM as a permanent committee under the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. ICCVAM aims to improve federal agency test method review, reduce duplication, utilize external scientific expertise, ensure new test methods meet agency needs, and decrease animal testing. ICCVAM is composed of representatives from various agencies and organizations. The ICCVAM Authorization Act of 1998 establishes a Scientific Advisory Committee consisting of representatives from various agencies and organizations involved in toxicity testing using animals. The ICCVAM Authorization Act of 1998 establishes a Scientific Advisory Committee to assist in the use of animals in toxicity testing, composed of representatives from different industries and animal protection organizations. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences invites members from various stakeholder organizations to be part of the Scientific Advisory Committee. ICCVAM is tasked with reviewing and evaluating alternative test methods to reduce the use of animals in toxicological tests. The Scientific Advisory Committee of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences reviews and evaluates alternative test methods to reduce animal use in toxicological tests. They aim to harmonize test protocols, develop validation criteria, and promote acceptance of new methods among Federal agencies and stakeholders. The ICCVAM reviews and recommends alternative tests to reduce animal testing required by Federal agencies. They consider petitions from the public suggesting alternatives with scientific evidence. Final recommendations and agency responses are made public. The ICCVAM makes an annual report on its progress in promoting the regulatory acceptance of new toxicological tests. This Act excludes regulations related to medical research, which includes research on physical and mental impairments using biotechnology. It does not cover toxicity testing for products required by Federal regulatory agencies. Within 180 days of enactment, Federal agencies must identify regulations or guidelines requiring animal toxicological tests and submit them to ICCVAM. Agencies must also promote alternatives to animal testing to comply with regulations effectively. Federal agencies must ensure that new toxicity tests are validated for their intended use before being required. They must review ICCVAM recommendations for new regulations and adopt them unless the alternative is deemed biologically inadequate. The agency must ensure that new toxicity tests are validated for their intended use before being required. The alternative must meet specific criteria to be considered adequate for regulatory purposes. Each government agency has the authority to decide if a new test method is acceptable for fulfilling their specific testing needs."
