    "content": "PILOT PROGRAM IN CERTAIN DISTRICT COURTS. Establishment of a program in designated United States district courts where district judges can hear cases related to patents or plant variety protection. Cases are randomly assigned to judges regardless of designation, allowing for efficient handling of issues arising under Acts of Congress. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall designate senior judges in district courts to hear cases related to patents or plant variety protection. Judges assigned under this program can decline a case, which will then be randomly reassigned to another designated judge. Senior judges can be designated if at least one judge in regular active service is also designated. The right to transfer cases is preserved, allowing judges to request reassignment or transfer according to court rules. The United States Courts must designate 5 district courts within 6 months of this Act, in at least 3 different circuits, for a program related to patent and plant variety protection cases. Criteria for designation include a minimum number of authorized district judges and requests from at least 3 judges in the court. The program established under subsection (a) will terminate 10 years after the 6-month period described in subsection (b) and will only apply to cases commenced after the designated date in district courts. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts will report to Congress on the pilot program at specified times. The pilot program established under subsection (a) will be evaluated by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. The report will analyze the success of developing expertise in patent and plant variety protection cases among designated district judges, the efficiency improvement of the courts, and compare the rate of reversal by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit between designated and non-designated judges in patent cases. The evaluation of the pilot program established under subsection (a) will include an analysis of the success in developing expertise in patent and plant variety protection cases among designated district judges, efficiency improvements in the courts, and a comparison of the rate of reversal by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit between designated and non-designated judges in patent cases. Additionally, the evaluation will cover issues such as the period of time from case filing to trial or summary judgment, evidence of litigants selecting specific judicial districts for desired outcomes, and a discussion on extending the pilot program to other district courts or making it permanent for all district courts. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, along with the chief judge of designated district courts and the Director of the Federal Judicial Center, will provide periodic reports to relevant committees during the pilot program. The reports will cover specific matters outlined in the legislation. Authorization for Training and Clerkships: Not less than $5,000,000 annually is authorized for educational and professional development of district judges in patents and plant variety protection, as well as compensation for law clerks with technical expertise in related cases. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 28, 2006. Karen L. Haas attested as the Clerk."
