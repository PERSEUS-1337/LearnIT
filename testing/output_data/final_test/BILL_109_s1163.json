    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sectoral Market Assessment for Regional Training Enhancement and Revitalization Act\". Congress finds that a significant portion of the workforce lacks essential skills for today's labor market, globalization is causing job losses and competitiveness challenges, and investing in job creation and skilled workforce training is crucial for economic vitality. Strategic planning linking workforce and economic development, and prioritizing resources for industries that can boost regional economies and provide living wage jobs, are key for the workforce investment system. States and local workforce investment boards can lead a strategic process for achieving economic growth through workforce development within the workforce investment system. SEC. 137. SKILLS GAP CAPACITY ENHANCEMENT GRANTS. This section amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to include grants for enhancing skills gap capacity. The purposes of this section are to assist States and local boards in focusing funds on addressing labor shortages, enhancing the efficiency of training providers, establishing partnerships between various entities, and strengthening integration of workforce development. The section aims to integrate workforce and economic development strategies, retain vital industries, avoid worker displacement, and promote career advancement in local industries. Definitions include 'consortium' as a group of local boards, 'region' as multiple local areas sharing a labor market, and 'training services' as services outlined in section 134(d)(4). The Secretary will provide grants to States to support local boards and consortia in implementing activities outlined in subsection (e) using a formula based on grants under section 132(b)(1)(B), with a minimum allotment for small states. Additionally, grants will be given to local boards. The State receiving a grant must use the funds to make grants to local boards for specific activities, with the option to use a portion for skills gap assessments or technical assistance. The State may consider the workforce size in each local area when making grants. States should encourage local boards to form consortia representing regions for activities described in subsection (e). Local boards or consortia must submit an application identifying partnership members to be eligible for a grant under this section. The local board or consortium receiving a grant must ensure funds are used for activities in subsection (e), including preparing a strategic sectoral skills gap assessment and developing strategic skills gap solutions. The local board or consortium receiving a grant must develop a strategic skills gap action plan and provide training capacity enhancement grants to training providers, one-stop operators, and intermediaries. Funds from the grant can be used to ensure activities align with the strategic skills gap action plan. The local board or consortium must prepare a strategic sectoral skills gap assessment to identify labor and skills demand in specific industry sectors producing high-quality jobs, developing emerging jobs, or facing chronic worker shortages. The strategic sectoral skills gap assessment aims to identify labor and skills demand in specific industry sectors, including high-quality job opportunities, desired skills, difficult-to-fill occupations, and gaps between current and expected supply and demand in the local area or region. The assessment will include specific skills desired for occupations, areas of industry growth and decline, and inventories of skills of unemployed individuals in the local area. The assessment will involve surveys and focus group interviews with employers, labor organizations, and relevant individuals to gather updated information on local needs. States are not obligated to use grant funds for this assessment. Local boards or consortia are not required to use grant funds for assessments if a qualifying assessment has been conducted within the past 2 years. Local boards and consortia must form partnerships as part of implementing this section. The representatives involved in the partnership must include local boards, employers from specific industry sectors, economic development agencies, and training service providers in the local area or region. The partnership, including local boards, employers, economic development agencies, and training providers, will develop a strategic skills gap action plan to address barriers to labor supply in high-quality job sectors. The curr_chunk discusses the provision of supportive services by one-stop operators and training providers to address barriers in workforce development strategies and integrate them with economic development strategies. It also mentions identifying resources and strategies to address skill gaps for unemployed and incumbent workers. The local board or consortium provides grants to training service providers, one-stop operators, and intermediaries to develop curricula and modify training programs to meet identified needs and overcome barriers. The local board or consortium provides grants to training service providers, one-stop operators, and intermediaries to develop curricula and modify training programs to meet identified needs and overcome barriers, including operating pilot training efforts, expanding capacity of training service providers, reorganizing service delivery systems, and developing business services for retention and competitiveness. The Federal share of the cost for training programs shall be 75 percent, while the non-Federal share may be provided in cash or in kind. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
