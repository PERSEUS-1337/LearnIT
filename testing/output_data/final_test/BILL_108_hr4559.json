Congress finds that it is important to promote stable growth and development in countries emerging from political instability, civil strife, or armed conflict. Democratization and economic progress in these countries are crucial for addressing terrorism and instability. Preferential trade arrangements are seen as a complement to necessary political and economic reforms. Developing countries, especially those recovering from conflict, face deepening poverty and slow job growth. Countries emerging from conflict face deepening poverty, slow job creation, and barriers to trade and investment. Offering enhanced trade preferences can encourage higher levels of trade and investment, helping these countries integrate into the global trading system. Encouraging higher levels of trade and investment can lead to increased economic development and more jobs in countries emerging from conflict. Reducing trade and investment barriers will benefit all participating countries and strengthen commercial and political ties with the United States. The statement of policy in Section 3 emphasizes the importance of reducing trade and investment barriers to promote economic development and create more jobs in post-conflict countries. Congress supports encouraging increased trade and investment, reducing barriers to trade, strengthening the private sector, promoting economic reform and political liberalization, and developing civil societies in countries emerging from conflict.
