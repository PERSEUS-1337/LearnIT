    "content": "The Act titled \"Co-Prescribing to Reduce Overdoses Act of 2016\" establishes a grant program for prescribing opioid overdose reversal drugs. The Act establishes a 5-year grant program for prescribing opioid overdose reversal drugs, with a maximum grant amount of $200,000 per year for eligible entities like federally qualified health centers and opioid treatment programs. The Act allows for prescribing opioid overdose reversal drugs like naloxone in various circumstances, including with opioid prescriptions for high-risk patients, with approved opioid agonists, to caregivers or close relatives of high-risk patients, and in other identified circumstances. To be eligible for a grant under this section, an entity must submit an application describing the extent of opioid abuse in the area, criteria for identifying eligible patients, and how the program will work to identify State. An eligible entity receiving a grant under this section may use the funds for activities such as establishing a program for prescribing opioid overdose reversal drugs, training healthcare providers on prescribing naloxone, tracking patient outcomes, and purchasing opioid overdose reversal drugs. The grant funds can be used to purchase opioid overdose reversal drugs like naloxone, offset co-pays, conduct community outreach, and connect patients with appropriate treatment. As a condition of receiving a grant, eligible entities must submit information on outcome measures specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including the number of prescribers trained, co-prescriptions of naloxone, total prescriptions for naloxone, percentage of at-risk patients receiving naloxone prescriptions, and number of patients using naloxone. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will evaluate the outcomes of grant-funded programs annually and report to Congress. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide information to prescribers in federal health care facilities on best practices for prescribing opioid overdose reversal drugs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide information to prescribers in federally qualified health centers and Indian Health Service facilities on best practices for prescribing opioid overdose reversal drugs like naloxone, without establishing a medical standard of care. In this section, the term \"elevated risk of overdose\" is defined by the Secretary based on criteria from the Opioid Overdose Toolkit. This includes patients on first course opioid treatment, using extended-release opioids, and those with respiratory diseases or other co-morbidities. Authorization of $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2017-2021 for this Act. Amendment to reduce dollar amount by $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2018. Passed by the House of Representatives on May 11, 2016."
