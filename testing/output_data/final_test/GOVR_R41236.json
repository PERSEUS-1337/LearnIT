    "content": "Retiring Justice John Paul Stevens has written opinions on intellectual property law, focusing on balancing protection of rights with public access to creative works. His opinions align with the Copyright and Patent Clause of the Constitution, aiming to reward creators while promoting progress in science and the arts. Stevens' opinions cover copyright law, patent law, state sovereign immunity, and patent infringement lawsuits. Copyright is a federal grant of legal protection for original works of creative expression, allowing the author to transfer ownership. The copyright holder has exclusive rights to reproduce the work and create derivative works. The copyright holder has exclusive rights to reproduce, create derivative works, distribute, publicly display, and perform the copyrighted work. Permission is usually required through a license agreement or statutory licenses, but the \"fair use\" doctrine allows for reasonable use of copyrighted material by the public. The \"fair use\" doctrine allows the public to use copyrighted material under certain circumstances without the copyright holder's consent. Factors considered in determining fair use include the purpose of use, nature of the work, amount used, and effect on the market value of the work. The fair use doctrine allows the public to use copyrighted material under certain circumstances without the copyright holder's consent. Determining fair use can be difficult as it requires a case-by-case analysis by federal courts. Violation of a copyright holder's exclusive rights constitutes infringement, leading to potential civil lawsuits for monetary damages or injunctions. Secondary copyright infringement liability includes contributory and vicarious infringement, with contributory infringement holding those accountable for directly contributing to infringement. Contributory infringement liability requires knowledge and contribution to infringing conduct. Vicarious infringement liability involves the right to supervise and financial interest in infringing activities. The Sony decision in 1984 set a precedent for product innovation by ruling that the sale of VCRs did not constitute contributory infringement due to their noninfringing uses like time-shifting. Sony's embrace of time-shifting as a \"fair use\" of copyrighted works created a safe harbor for electronic devices like DVRs, iPods, and personal computers. The Sony decision in 1984 set a legal foundation for the Digital Age, allowing companies to develop new digital technologies without fear of liability for potential misuse by consumers. The Sony Corporation was sued for contributory copyright infringement over the Betamax VCR, but the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Sony, stating that home recording of broadcasts was fair use. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, but the Supreme Court reversed their decision, allowing Sony to continue manufacturing the Betamax VCR. Justice Stevens expressed concern about the Ninth Circuit's ruling, stating that it could expand copyright monopolies beyond what Congress authorized. He emphasized the need for a balance between authors' control over their work and society's interest in the free flow of ideas and information. Stevens highlighted Congress's role in amending copyright law in response to technological changes, cautioning against judicially expanding copyright protections without explicit legislative guidance. The lack of legislative guidance on copyright protections is a recurring theme. Justice Stevens emphasized the need for Congress to address technological changes to maintain a balance between authors' control and society's interest in free flow of ideas. He noted that while the Copyright Act doesn't explicitly hold parties liable for infringement by others, vicarious liability can still be imposed. Sony's sale of Betamax video recorders was highlighted as a point of contact with customers, with the equipment capable of both infringing and noninfringing uses. The video recorder sold by Sony had the capability to copy a wide range of televised programs, both copyrighted and uncopyrighted. Justice Stevens sought guidance from patent law due to the lack of precedent in copyright law for imposing vicarious liability on Sony. The Patent Act prohibits contributory infringement liability for the sale of a staple article suitable for commerce. Justice Stevens applied the \"staple article of commerce doctrine\" from patent law to copyright law, balancing a copyright holder's protection with the rights of others. The Betamax was found to have commercially significant noninfringing uses, such as private, noncommercial time-shifting in the home, which was deemed not infringing by Justice Stevens. The Betamax's noninfringing uses, including time-shifting at home, were deemed not infringing by Justice Stevens, who argued that even unauthorized time-shifting falls under the fair use doctrine of the Copyright Act. Sony's sale of Betamax machines did not constitute contributory copyright infringement due to their substantial noninfringing uses. Justice Stevens concluded that Congress may need to revisit laws regarding new technology, but it is not the Court's role to apply unwritten laws. The Court of Appeals judgment must be reversed as it is not the Court's role to apply laws that have not yet been written. The Copyright Clause of the Constitution limits copyright holders to exclusive rights for a limited time before the work enters the public domain. Initially, the copyright term was set at 14 years, extendable to 28 years by 1909. The Copyright Act has seen several extensions over the years, with the current term lasting the life of the author plus 70 years. Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), arguing it violated the \"limited Times\" requirement of the Copyright Clause. The lower court and the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the CTEA, with Justice Ginsburg writing the majority opinion in Eldred v. Ashcroft, supporting the CTEA by a 7-2 vote. She emphasized Congress's consistent practice of granting term extensions to authors. The Court upheld the Copyright Term Extension Act, rejecting the argument that it violated the \"limited Times\" requirement of the Copyright Clause. Justice Stevens dissented, arguing that extending copyright terms beyond expiration date exceeds Congress's authority. He emphasized the importance of the \"limited Times\" requirement in promoting the progress of science. Justice Stevens criticized the majority opinion's reliance on Congress's history of applying copyright extensions retroactively, arguing that ex post facto extensions result in a transfer of wealth from the public to authors. He emphasized the importance of protecting the public interest in free access to creative works and stated that the Court had neglected the central purpose of the Copyright Clause. The Court has stated that Congress' actions under the Copyright Clause are judicially unreviewable, which goes against the constitutional structure. The Patent Act allows for patent protection of processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. The scope of patentable subject matter is expansive according to \u00a7 101 of the Patent Act. The U.S. Supreme Court has set limits on patentable subject matter, excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. Process patents involve a series of steps to achieve a result, as defined by the Patent Act. The Patent Act defines a \"process\" as a series of steps to achieve a result, with courts interpreting the scope of patentable processes. Software-related inventions can be patented if they meet statutory requirements, leading to over 20,000 software patents granted annually. In the 1970s, computer software inventions were initially ineligible for patent protection. In the 1970s, computer software inventions were initially ineligible for patent protection due to the Supreme Court case, Gottschalk v. Benson. The Court ruled that mathematical algorithms could not be patented as they are basic tools of scientific and technological work. This decision led to patent applicants trying to obtain patents on software-related inventions. In the 1970s, after the Benson case, patent applicants attempted to patent mechanical devices and processes involving computer programs. In the 1978 case of Parker v. Flook, the Court rejected a patent application for a method to compute an \"alarm limit\" during catalytic conversion processes. Justice Stevens criticized the lack of disclosure on selecting safety margins or process variables. The patent application in the Parker v. Flook case was rejected by the Court for a method to compute an \"alarm limit\" during catalytic conversion processes. Justice Stevens criticized the lack of disclosure on selecting safety margins or process variables, stating that post-solution activity cannot transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process. The Court rejected the patent application in the Parker v. Flook case for a method involving the Pythagorean theorem, stating that post-solution activity cannot make an unpatentable principle patentable. Justice Stevens concluded that the application only offered an improved method for calculating alarm limit values, which is not patentable subject matter. He noted that the reasoning was based on opinions predating the development of computer programs. The modern business of developing computer programs lacks precedent supporting patentability. The decision does not reflect a judgment against patent protection for novel and useful computer programs. Policy questions on appropriate programs for patent protection should be addressed by Congress based on current data. The court must interpret patent statutes cautiously and not extend patent rights into unforeseen areas. The Supreme Court's decision in Diamond v. Diehr upheld the patentability of a computer program-controlled process for producing cured synthetic rubber products, despite a previous conflicting decision in Flook. Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion, stating that the transformation of raw, uncured synthetic rubber into a different state through a step-by-step method qualifies as patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court's decision in Diamond v. Diehr upheld the patentability of a computer program-controlled process for producing cured synthetic rubber products. The process involved the use of a mathematical formula and a programmed digital computer, but the Court ruled that this did not make it ineligible for patent protection. The Court emphasized that the patent sought was for a process of curing synthetic rubber, not for the mathematical formula itself. The use of a mathematical formula, computer program, or digital computer does not make a claim nonstatutory if the subject matter is otherwise statutory. Justice Stevens dissented in Diehr, arguing that new mathematical procedures conducted on old computers are not patentable processes. He believed Diehr's patent claim was similar to the unpatentable method in Flook. Stevens raised concerns about patent protection for computer programs, stating it involves policy considerations beyond the Court's authority. Justice Stevens dissented in Diehr, arguing against patenting software inventions unless they contribute to the art independently of computer utilization. He criticized the \"magic words\" doctrine that allowed patents on software by pretending they were something else. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that a computer operating with software can be considered patentable subject matter. Patent holders have the right to exclude others from using their invention, and infringement can lead to legal action against individuals, companies, and even the federal government. However, when state governments or institutions infringe patents, the legal recourse for the patent holder is limited. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that software-operated computers can be patented. Patent holders can take legal action against infringement, but when state entities infringe patents, legal recourse is limited due to the Eleventh Amendment. Congress passed the Patent Remedy Act in 1992 to allow suits against states for monetary damages for violating federal patent law. The Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank case involved a challenge to the validity of a statute regarding patent infringement. College Savings Bank held a patent for a financing methodology for college expenses, which was adopted by the state of Florida. The issue was whether the Patent Remedy Act had abrogated state sovereign immunity from patent infringement suits. College Savings Bank argued that Congress had lawfully done so to provide a remedy for property deprivation by the state. The Supreme Court overturned the Federal Circuit decision in the Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank case, ruling that the Patent Remedy Act did not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity in patent infringement cases. Justice Stevens dissented, emphasizing Congress's authority over patents and the need for uniform interpretation of patent statutes to protect patentees. Justice Stevens believed that Congress had the authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity in patent infringement cases to protect patent holders. He argued that the Patent Remedy Act was necessary to prevent potential due process violations and ensure inventors were adequately compensated for patent infringements. This legislation aimed to place states on equal footing with the federal government in patent protection. The Patent Remedy Act aims to place states on equal footing with the federal government and private users regarding patent infringement accountability. Justice Stevens criticized the majority opinion for its aggressive sovereign immunity jurisprudence, championing States' rights."
