It excludes appointments to executive departments and regulatory boards. The Millennium Challenge Corporation was established in 2003 during the 108th Congress. It tracks agency nominations, Senate confirmations, and presidential appointments. The President and Senate share the power to appoint principal officers of the United States. The appointment process for principal officers of the United States involves three stages: selection and nomination, confirmation, and appointment. The White House selects and clears a nominee before sending the formal nomination to the Senate. Interested parties, including Members of Congress, may have input during the selection process. The candidate undergoes a clearance process overseen by the Office of the Counsel to the President, which includes submitting various forms. The Office of the Counsel to the President oversees the clearance process for nominees, which includes background investigations by various agencies. Conflicts found during the background check are mitigated by OGE and the agency ethics officer. Once cleared, the nomination is submitted to the Senate, with higher-level positions often given priority. Delays can occur, especially at the beginning of an Administration or when conflicts need resolution. Recent amendments to the Presidential Transitions Act of 1963 prioritize the appointment of national security team members after a new President's inauguration. For federal positions within a state, the President typically nominates individuals recommended by Senators from the same party, or party leaders if Senators are from the opposition party. Occasionally, recommendations are sought from Senators of the opposition party. Before making a nomination to a federal position, the President considers the confirmation process. A nominee has no legal authority until Senate confirmation and presidential appointment. A nominee may serve in an advisory capacity if hired as a consultant while awaiting confirmation. The President may give a recess appointment if conditions permit. Recess appointments may have political consequences if seen as circumventing the Senate's role. Some Senate-confirmed positions can be temporarily filled under the Vacancies Act. In the confirmation stage, the Senate alone determines the nominee's fate. The Senate confirmation process for federal positions is crucial and depends on various factors such as the position's importance, political circumstances, and policy implications. The Senate focuses on nominees' views and their potential impact on public policy. The process is committee-centered and includes investigation, hearings, and reporting stages. The President's party control and involvement can also influence the scrutiny of a nominee's qualities. The Senate confirmation process involves hearings where nominees discuss their qualifications and policy perspectives. Committees may hold hearings for some nominations, and they can choose to report a nomination favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation to the full Senate. The Senate confirmation process involves committees reporting nominations favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. Rejections mostly occur in committee due to various reasons, and if a nomination is not acted upon by the Senate, it is returned to the President. The Senate confirmation process involves committees reporting nominations favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. Once the confirmed nominee is given a commission signed by the President, with the seal of the United States affixed, and sworn into office, they have full authority to carry out their responsibilities. The President may make appointments without Senate confirmation during recesses, which expire at the end of the following session of Congress. Presidents have occasionally used this power for recess appointments. During recess appointments, Presidents can bypass the confirmation process, but Congress has imposed restrictions. If a recess appointee's position becomes vacant while the Senate is in session, they cannot be paid until confirmed by the Senate, unless certain exceptions apply. These exceptions include the vacancy occurring within 30 days before the session ends, a pending nomination, or a rejected nomination followed by a new appointment. When a recess appointment is made, the President typically submits a new nomination within 40 days of the Senate's next session. If a recess appointee's nomination for a full term is rejected, they may continue to serve but may not be paid. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows for temporary filling of vacant positions requiring Senate confirmation in three ways. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows for temporary filling of vacant positions requiring Senate confirmation in three ways: automatic assumption of duties by the first assistant, direction by the President to an officer in the agency, or selection of an officer or employee meeting specific criteria. The temporary appointment is for 210 days, with exceptions during a presidential transition period. During the 108th Congress, President George W. Bush submitted 40 nominations for full-time positions in independent agencies. 31 were confirmed, nine were returned, and four recess appointments were made to positions in organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Agency for International Development. These appointments would have expired at the end of the first session of the 109th Congress. During the 108th Congress, President George W. Bush submitted 40 nominations for full-time positions in independent agencies. 31 were confirmed, nine were returned, and four recess appointments were made.
