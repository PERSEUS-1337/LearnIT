The Congress established the \"Harry Wu Principles\" for US nationals conducting industrial cooperation projects in China or Tibet, including suspending the use of goods produced by forced labor and ensuring non-discrimination in hiring practices. The \"Harry Wu Principles\" for US nationals conducting industrial cooperation projects in China or Tibet include non-discrimination in employment, ensuring worker safety, and consulting with community leaders on environmental protection. The \"Harry Wu Principles\" for US nationals conducting industrial cooperation projects in China or Tibet include using business enterprises not controlled by China, prohibiting military presence, promoting freedom of association, and communicating with Chinese government to uphold these principles. The \"Harry Wu Principles\" urge the Chinese government to disclose a list of arrested individuals, end torture and incommunicado detention, allow international observers access to detention facilities, and promote freedom of expression. The United States national should raise concerns about restrictions on importation of foreign publications with the Government of the People's Republic of China. Additionally, workers should be protected from harassment and have the freedom to decide the number and spacing of their children without compulsory population control activities. The Secretary of State will share principles with other nations and urge them to promote similar ones. US nationals working on projects in China or Tibet must register with the Secretary of State and indicate if they will implement the principles. No fee is required for registration. The registration requirement will be effective 6 months after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5.
