    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Cuba Normalization Act of 2017\". Congress finds that Cuba is no longer a threat to the United States or the Western Hemisphere, the trade embargo declared in 1962 is not effective, and extending normal trade relations to Cuba would help its economy grow based on free market principles. The United States can support democratic change and human rights in Cuba by promoting trade, travel, communications, and cultural exchanges. Expanding bilateral trade relations can further progress in Cuba on human rights and democratic rule. Cuba's membership in international trade organizations warrants unconditional normal trade relations treatment from the US. SEC. 3.

EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TRADE TREATMENT. The Congress believes that the US should support democratic change and economic reform in Cuba by normalizing trade relations. Upon the enactment of this Act, the US will no longer need to use article XXI of the GATT 1994 with respect to Cuba. The President still has the authority to invoke article XXI of the GATT 1994 in the future. The Uruguay Round Agreements Act extends nondiscriminatory treatment to Cuban products by amending the Harmonized Tariff Schedule and repealing section 401 of the Tariff Classification Act of 1962. This Act terminates the application of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 to Cuba, ensuring normal trade relations treatment for Cuban products. The Trade Act of 1974 will no longer apply to Cuban products, ensuring normal trade relations treatment. The effective date for these changes will be 15 days after the Act's enactment.
