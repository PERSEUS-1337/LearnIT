    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Solar Utilization Now Demonstration Act of 2006\" or the \"SUN Act of 2006\". Congress finds that the United States is falling behind in renewable energy investment compared to other countries, with a significant decline in market share in the solar industry since 1996. Japan and Germany have been investing heavily in solar research and development, while the US government's spending in this area has been comparatively low. In 2003, Germany and Japan had thriving domestic photovoltaic industries employing over 10,000 people each, while the US industry only employed 2,000. The US is increasingly reliant on imported energy, and high fossil fuel costs are impacting the economy. Despite having small oil and gas reserves, the US has vast untapped renewable energy resources that can reduce imported energy demand, costs, and price variability. Renewable energy can reduce costs, decrease energy price variability, and lessen environmental impacts. By utilizing domestic renewable resources, the US can keep money within the country, support research and development, create an export industry, and improve the balance of trade. The Photovoltaic Demonstration Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Energy will establish a grant program for States to demonstrate advanced photovoltaic technology. States must submit proposals meeting requirements to receive funding, and demonstrate compliance with program requirements to receive further funding. The grant program for States to demonstrate advanced photovoltaic technology will allocate funding based on the State's population proportion according to the 2000 census. If more than $80,000,000 is available, 75 percent of funds will be allocated based on population proportion, with the remaining 25 percent awarded competitively. The Secretary will allocate 75 percent of funds based on State population proportion and award the remaining 25 percent competitively to encourage widespread adoption of photovoltaic technologies. Proposals must be solicited from States within 6 months of the Act's enactment, with criteria including the demonstration of advanced photovoltaic technologies and maximizing photovoltaic deployment while minimizing non-Federal costs. State programs funded under this section must provide competitive awards for advanced photovoltaic technologies, with a requirement of at least 60% non-Federal funding per award. Awards are capped at $1,000,000 per project, with a limit of $1,000,000 per year for nongovernmental recipients. Funding aims to support various sectors including commercial, industrial, institutional, governmental, and residential.

Funding aims to support various sectors including commercial, industrial, institutional, governmental, and residential. The State must limit administrative costs to no more than 10% of the grant, report annually on funds disbursed and photovoltaics purchased, provide for measurement and verification of photovoltaic systems, and require energy efficiency audits for applicant buildings. The Secretary must report to Congress on the amount of photovoltaics demonstrated, number of projects undertaken, administrative costs, unexpended funds returned to the Treasury, results of monitoring, and total funds distributed by State. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out this section. The Secretary is allocated funds for carrying out this section, with specific amounts for fiscal years 2007 to 2011: $50 million, $100 million, $150 million, $200 million, and $300 million respectively."
