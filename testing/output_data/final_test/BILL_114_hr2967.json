The Social Security Act is amended to develop a database called the 'What Works Clearinghouse of Proven and Promising Projects to Move Welfare Recipients into Work'. This database will list projects that used effective approaches in moving welfare recipients into work, based on rigorous evaluations. The Secretary will add projects to the What Works Clearinghouse based on well-conducted evaluations showing effectiveness in moving welfare recipients into work. The Secretary will establish criteria for evidence of effectiveness in moving welfare recipients into work, ensuring transparency, consistency, public comment, and consideration of efforts by Federal agencies. The Secretary will establish criteria for evidence of effectiveness in moving welfare recipients into work, ensuring transparency, consistency, public comment, and consideration of efforts by Federal agencies. Definitions for \"approach\" and \"proven approach\" are provided, emphasizing research-based strategies with proven positive outcomes. The term 'promising approach' refers to an approach used in a demonstration project that has been evaluated using well-designed research designs and has shown significant positive outcomes. The term 'developmental approach' in a demonstration project is research-based, grounded in relevant knowledge, and linked to program outcomes, evaluated rigorously. The developmental approach in a demonstration project is research-based and evaluated rigorously, yet it has not shown a significant positive outcome in terms of increasing work and earnings of participants in a cost-effective way. Funding for this subsection will be reserved from the amounts available for fiscal year 2016 and beyond. The amendment made by this Act will be effective on October 1, 2015."
