    "content": "The congressional budget process begins with the Administration submitting its budget to Congress. As Congress deliberates, the Administration revises its proposals based on interactions with Members of Congress and changing economic conditions. The FY2011 federal budget faces challenges due to the severe economic recession, with significant impacts on budget estimates. The U.S. economy experienced a sharp decline in 2008 and 2009, but showed signs of recovery in 2010. Despite a slight growth in the first quarter of 2010, the economy remains slow with a national unemployment rate of 9.5% in July 2010. The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has expressed uncertainty about the state of the economy, and there are concerns about a possible \"double-dip\" recession. Federal spending on social programs has increased due to high unemployment levels. Federal spending on means-tested social programs has risen due to high unemployment levels, while federal revenues are projected to decrease as incomes and corporate profits decline. Total federal revenues fell 17% between FY2007 and FY2009, with corporate income tax receipts dropping even more sharply. Despite an expected stabilization in federal revenues in FY2010 and a projected rebound in FY2011, federal deficits are anticipated to remain high relative to historic norms. OMB and CBO projections suggest that federal deficits will decrease to 2.5% of GDP in FY2014, but some experts believe these projections are overly optimistic. In response to the economic slowdown, the federal government implemented unprecedented policy responses including fiscal stimulus through new spending and tax cuts, as well as major loan programs. As the economy recovers, plans are in place to shrink or discontinue these programs. Some interventions, like the Troubled Assets Relief Program, are expected to cost less than previously estimated, but credit risks remain from takeovers of AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. The Obama Administration faced substantial credit risks from takeovers of AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and automobile manufacturers. The federal government could encounter new fiscal challenges if economic recovery stalls. Policy initiatives aimed at economic recovery, reducing unemployment, health insurance reform, financial regulation overhaul, and stabilizing housing and automobile industries were featured in the FY2011 budget submission. President Obama established the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform to improve the fiscal situation in the medium and long term. The commission is set to issue a report on December 1. The House and Senate have not agreed on a budget resolution for FY2011. The House adopted a \"deeming\" resolution which serves some purposes of a budget resolution. Budget estimates for FY2011 vary due to different economic and policy assumptions. Budget estimates for FY2011 vary due to differences in assumptions and techniques. Minor discrepancies in assumptions can lead to significant differences in long-term budget projections. Federal responses to financial turmoil and recession have complicated scoring issues. Projections by the President, CBO, or others are expected to change with new data or economic conditions. CBO baseline projections are not predictions but tools to assess legislative impact on the federal deficit. The CBO baseline projections for FY2011 indicate changes in revenue growth and discretionary spending. The projections assume expiration of tax cuts, lapse of AMT patch, end of emergency unemployment benefits, and cuts to Medicare physician services. After FY2010, the expiration of tax cuts would increase federal receipts. The expiration of tax cuts and zero growth in discretionary spending contribute to declining deficits over the 10-year forecast period. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates costs for indexing the AMT to inflation and extending tax cuts. Beyond the forecast window, deficits are expected to rise due to healthcare costs and the retirement of baby boomers unless policy changes are implemented. CBO's budget report for FY2011 projects a total deficit of $980 billion. The FY2011 CBO report projected a baseline total deficit of $980 billion, smaller than FY2009 and FY2010 deficits but larger than FY2008. The report included estimated budgetary effects of policies on revenues and outlays, highlighting the interaction of alternative policy proposals. CBO also analyzed the President's FY2011 proposals in detail. The CBO issued a detailed analysis on FY2011 proposals in March, projecting larger federal deficits over the 10-year budget window compared to the Obama Administration's projections. The projections do not include the enactment of the HIRE Act or the Affordable Care Act. CBO forecasts slower economic growth than OMB, leading to differences in GDP projections. Technical challenges of budget forecasting are discussed, along with future federal receipts projections. Forecasts of federal receipts beyond the short term are imprecise due to economic conditions. Federal revenues fell sharply in FY2008 and FY2009 but are expected to rebound in FY2010 and FY2011. Corporate tax and capital gains receipts are sensitive to economic conditions, with asset values and profits recovering quickly after downturns. Legislative initiatives in the past two years have had significant effects on federal revenues, such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 introduced temporary tax credits and altered business depreciation rules. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 raised tobacco taxes to fund the expansion of CHIP. Updated estimates predict federal revenues as a share of GDP to decrease slightly in FY2010 but increase in FY2011. By FY2020, federal revenues are projected to be 21.0% of GDP. Budget documents also report spending in terms of budget authority. Budget authority is like funds in a checking account for federal agencies to spend on specific purposes. Congress sets time limits on availability, but some funds do not expire. Outlays only occur when funds are disbursed for purchases. Unobligated budget authority, except for \"no-year\" funds, expires when the availability period ends. Outlay data is useful for assessing macroeconomic effects of federal budgets. The report focuses on federal outlays, which are disbursed funds, to highlight the broader effects of the federal budget on the economy. Federal spending is projected to make up about a quarter of the U.S. economy in FY2011, compared to just over one-fifth in FY2008. The Administration's budget submission for FY2011 calls for outlays of $3,834 billion, which is 25.1% of GDP and $166 billion above the CBO baseline. CBO estimates outlays under the President's budget plans would total $3,802 billion in FY2011 and $3,722 billion in FY2012, including future disaster costs as budgetary \"plugs.\" Future disaster costs would need to be added to discretionary outlays, mandatory outlays, and net interest to equal total outlays. Discretionary spending is controlled through appropriations acts and funds federal government functions. While discretionary spending was the largest category until the mid-1970s, mandatory spending in FY2010 accounted for more of GDP. Discretionary spending is projected to decline to 7.0% of GDP in FY2020 according to CBO baseline projections. The Obama Administration plans to freeze non-security discretionary spending for three years, defining \"security\" spending as funding for specific departments. They also propose moving some Pell Grants from discretionary to mandatory spending. Mandatory spending includes federal government spending on entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, as well as other programs such as SNAP and unemployment insurance. In FY2011, mandatory outlays are projected to be $2,085 billion (13.8% of GDP) and $1,971 billion (12.5% of GDP) in FY2012. The costs of federal interventions during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008 also contributed to the increase in mandatory spending. In 2008, mandatory spending reached $2,112 billion (14.8% of GDP) and is expected to decrease due to financial market stabilization. However, rising entitlement program costs will lead to significant increases in mandatory spending in the future. Deficits occur when federal spending exceeds receipts, increasing government debt. Surpluses happen when receipts exceed outlays, reducing debt and interest payments. Governments run deficits to avoid raising taxes during economic downturns and stimulate aggregate demand. Deficits can stimulate aggregate demand in the economy and support macroeconomic stability. They allow transfers of economic resources between generations but can also harm national economies by causing inflation or reducing capital investment. Governments that fail to repay debt risk default. The government's deficit projections show a growing gap between spending and revenue, driven by healthcare costs and demographic changes. The last surplus was in FY2001, with deficits projected to increase after FY2020. The on-budget deficit is expected to decline to $1,154 billion (7.6% of GDP). The CBO projects a decline in the on-budget deficit to $1,154 billion in FY2011, with no on-budget surplus expected in the next 5 or 10 years. Social Security surpluses have historically contributed to off-budget surpluses, reducing the total deficit. However, high unemployment rates and economic recession have impacted payroll tax inflows, leading to lower off-budget surpluses than previously anticipated. The gross federal debt includes debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt, with the Social Security and Medicare trust funds being the largest components of intragovernmental debt. The largest components of IG debt are funds invested in federal securities. Debt held by the public is the total amount borrowed from the public. Congress sets a ceiling on federal debt, which was raised multiple times in 2009 and 2010. The FY2010 budget resolution recommended policies leading to a debt subject to limit of $13,233 billion. The House adopted the FY2010 budget resolution triggering the automatic passage of H.J.Res. 45 to raise the debt limit to $13.029 trillion. H.R. 4314 raised the debt limit to $12.394 trillion, and later H.J.Res. 45 raised it to $14.294 trillion. Federal debt held by the public increased from 40.8% to 53.0% of GDP from FY2008 to FY2010. The federal debt held by the public increased from 40.8% to 53.0% of GDP from FY2008 to FY2010. Projections suggest it will rise to 66.1% by FY2011 and reach 84.3% by FY2020. Budget projections are influenced by the future health of the U.S. economy, with the economic recovery playing a significant role in shaping future budget estimates. The current economic recession has led to deeper-than-expected contractions in the U.S. economy. Projections for federal deficits are influenced by the pace of the economic recovery, with faster recovery leading to higher revenues and lower deficits, while a slower recovery would increase deficits. The economic recession has led to slow and uncertain economic recovery, with GDP growth rates of 3.7% in the first quarter of 2010 and 1.6% in the second quarter. Unemployment rates are expected to remain high, with the national rate at 9.5% in July 2010 and not projected to reach 5% until 2014. The unemployment rate is not expected to decrease to 5% until 2014. Economic forecasters are concerned about the medium-term strength of the economy due to fiscal problems faced by state and local governments, high debt loads of households, and challenges in interest-sensitive industries like housing and automobile manufacturing. Foreclosure rates are expected to remain high, and there are worries about the solvency of banks with exposure to the commercial real estate sector. Many economists expect a gradual recovery from the recession due to challenges in the financial services sector and uncertainties in forecasting economic trends. Budget projections are influenced by economic conditions and assumptions about tax and program changes. Technical components of budget models may also change. Budget forecasts are constructed to estimate the incremental costs of policy changes in a consistent manner, with actual outcomes differing from baseline estimates if policy changes occur. Technical factors and changes in economic conditions also impact budget forecasts. OMB and CBO have analyzed past forecast variations from actual results, with CBO routinely including information on its forecast record in budget publications. The CBO provides detailed explanations for forecast variations from actual outcomes in its budget publications. Accurate budget projections are challenging due to factors like predictable trends in demographics and unpredictable factors like future productivity growth. Budget estimates also rely on volatile factors such as financial market trends. Forecasting budget estimates for the FY2011 budget cycle is challenging due to the economy recovering from a unique recession, ongoing financial market turmoil, and proposed major program initiatives by the Obama Administration. Small changes in economic growth projections can have significant budgetary consequences. Economic growth trajectories can have significant budgetary consequences over time. Small changes in GDP growth can lead to large changes in budget estimates. According to CBO estimates, a 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth rate could increase deficits by $61 billion over five years and $273 billion over 10 years. Budget projections are uncertain, with the quality of economic forecasts measured by statistical unbiasedness and accuracy. Sacrificing unbiasedness for greater accuracy may be necessary in forecasting methods. Presidential budget requests include measures to assess accuracy and bias of forecasts. Forecasts can diverge from actual results due to legislative changes and unforeseen economic factors. OMB February deficit projections since FY1982 underestimated the total deficit by $55 billion, mainly due to changes in legislation. Legislation played a significant role in the divergence of deficit/surplus estimates. The standard deviation for deficit/surplus estimates was $233 billion for FY1982-FY2009, with a four-years-ahead forecast standard deviation of $343 billion. OMB used this standard deviation to calculate upper and lower bounds for deficit projections in the FY2011 budget submission. The spread between the upper and lower bounds indicated the range within which the actual FY2015 deficit was expected to fall with a 90% probability. The spread between upper and lower bounds in the deficit forecast indicates estimated precision for a five-years-ahead projection with a 90% probability."
