    "content": "This paper introduces FusionNet, a new neural structure that extends attention approaches by introducing the concept of \"History of Word\" to capture information from word-level embedding to semantic-level representation. FusionNet achieves top position on the SQuAD leaderboard for both single and ensemble models, and sets a new state-of-the-art on adversarial SQuAD datasets. FusionNet achieves state-of-the-art results on adversarial SQuAD datasets, increasing F1 metrics on AddSent from 46.6% to 51.4% and on AddOneSent from 56.0% to 60.7%. Teaching machines to comprehend text and answer questions is a key challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring high capabilities in comprehension, inference, and reasoning. Teaching machines to comprehend text and answer questions is a challenging task in artificial intelligence, requiring high capabilities in comprehension, inference, and reasoning. Numerous research efforts have been made in the neural network and natural language processing communities to address this challenge, with models framing the problem as a machine reading comprehension task. Recent models focus on how to ingest and characterize information from the question in the context to provide accurate answers, often using attention mechanisms in neural networks. Recent research in neural networks and natural language processing has focused on machine reading comprehension tasks. Existing approaches have not fully captured all information in the context or question, hindering complete comprehension. Utilizing information from word embedding to high-level representation is crucial for accurate answers, similar to image recognition. However, model complexity limits the ability to consider all layers of representation effectively. To address the challenge of model complexity in neural networks for machine reading comprehension, a new attention scoring function is proposed to capture complete information between the question and context. This leads to a multi-level attention mechanism called FusionNet, which ranked first in the SQuAD dataset for both single and ensemble models as of October 4th, 2017. In 2017, FusionNet ranked first in single and ensemble model categories on the SQuAD dataset with an EM score of 78.8% and F1 score of 85.9%. It outperformed existing architectures on adversarial SQuAD datasets, increasing F1 metrics significantly. FusionNet also showed improvement in natural language inference tasks and has an open-source implementation available. The model introduces a novel concept called history-of-word. In machine reading comprehension, a novel concept called history-of-word is introduced to capture contextual information. A light-weight implementation, Fully-Aware Attention, is proposed. The context is described as a sequence of word tokens, and the question is presented. The answer in the SQuAD dataset is a contiguous span in the context. In machine reading comprehension, state-of-the-art architectures involve a fusion process where information from set B enhances every vector in set A. Fusion processes, often based on attention, have seen major improvements in recent work. The architecture includes input vectors, integration components implemented with RNNs, and fusion processes illustrated in FIG2. In machine reading comprehension, state-of-the-art architectures involve fusion processes to enhance information. Recent advanced architectures use different fusion processes like word-level and high-level fusion to improve model performance. Word-level fusion provides direct word information to the context, while high-level fusion informs the context about semantic information in the question. These fusion processes help in finding the correct answer efficiently. In machine reading comprehension, fusion processes like word-level and high-level fusion are used to enhance model performance. Self-boosted fusion techniques have been proposed to improve understanding of distant parts of text and question relevance. Different fusion mechanisms exist, but none utilize all levels of representation. Utilizing all levels of representation is crucial for better text understanding. Each input word transforms into abstract representations, forming the history of each word in our mental flow. Neglecting the importance of history-of-word can lead to confusion in answering questions. The entire history-of-word is essential for full context understanding. Utilizing the entire history-of-word is crucial for understanding the context fully. In neural architectures, the history of each word is defined as the concatenation of all its representations. A lightweight implementation called Fully-Aware Attention is presented to incorporate history-of-word into various neural models. This attention mechanism can be applied to fuse information from one body to another, considering sets of hidden vectors for words in different text bodies. The curr_chunk discusses the utilization of history-of-word in attention mechanisms, proposing a symmetric matrix constraint to improve training efficiency. The ablation study shows a performance improvement with this lightweight enhancement. The curr_chunk introduces a new formulation for attention score, incorporating nonlinearity and symmetric form for richer interaction in history-of-word. It includes an activation function and a special case where text A is context C and text B is question Q. FusionNet components are illustrated with input vectors transformed using GloVe embedding and contextualized vector. Additional embeddings and term frequency are included for the SQuAD task. The curr_chunk introduces 12-dim POS embedding, 8-dim NER embedding, and normalized term frequency for context C. It discusses fully-aware multi-level fusion, focusing on word-level fusion and attention-based fusion on GloVe embedding. The reading component utilizes a bidirectional LSTM to create low-level and high-level concepts for context C and question Q. The curr_chunk discusses the creation of low-level and high-level concepts for each word in the Question Understanding component. It also explains the fusion of higher-level information from the question to the context through fully-aware attention. The attention scoring function is constrained to be symmetric, identifying common history-of-word for both context and question. Different sets of attention weights are calculated for low, high, and understanding-level information fusion. The curr_chunk introduces attention weights calculated through different functions to combine low, high, and understanding-level concepts. It also discusses multi-level attention mechanism and fully-aware self-boosted fusion using BiLSTM for information fusion. The chunk emphasizes the importance of fully-aware attention on the history-of-word for considering distant parts in the context. The curr_chunk focuses on the FusionNet model's attention mechanism for understanding vectors in the context of SQuAD. It discusses obtaining understanding vectors for both context and question, and using them to find the answer span in the context. The chunk also mentions obtaining a summarized question understanding vector and using it to attend for the span start. The FusionNet model utilizes attention mechanisms to obtain understanding vectors for context and question in the SQuAD dataset. It combines the context understanding vector for the span start with u Q through a GRU BID5, and attends for the end of the span using v Q. During training, it maximizes log probabilities of ground truth span start and end, while during prediction, it predicts the answer span with the maximum P. The model is evaluated against existing machine reading models and its components are validated through experiments. The proposed components are evaluated on the SQuAD dataset, which consists of questions created from Wikipedia articles. The understanding of language by systems is tested using adversarial datasets like AddOneSent and AddSent. These datasets include confusing sentences appended to the context for evaluation. The model is evaluated on the SQuAD dataset with two adversarial datasets, AddOneSent and AddSent. Evaluation criteria include Exact Match (EM) and F1 score. Results are compared with other models in the literature. Models are trained only on the original SQuAD, never seeing the adversarial datasets. FusionNet outperforms previous models by more than 5% in EM score on adversarial datasets, showing better language understanding. Different attention scoring functions are compared for fully-aware attention in the end-to-end architecture. The study compares various attention formulations for fully-aware attention in an end-to-end architecture. The symmetric form consistently outperforms other alternatives, attributed to its single large parametric matrix compared to others with two large matrices that interfere with optimization. In FusionNet, the symmetric matrix constraint allows for better optimization and the ability for x to attend to dissimilar y. The nonlinearity in FusionNet significantly boosts performance, especially in multi-level fusion and self-boosted fusion. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed symmetric form with nonlinearity, showing good performance in various configurations. In FusionNet, different fusion processes are compared, including High-Level, FA High-Level, FA All-Level, and FA Multi-Level. Self-boosted fusion variations are also explored, with results showing that High-Level performs poorly compared to other models. From Table 6, High-Level performs poorly as expected, but fully-aware attention significantly boosts performance by over 8%. FA High-Level outperforms many MRC models, showcasing the power of fully-aware attention. FA All-Level is a weaker extension of FA High-Level, while FA Multi-Level improves performance by independently fusing different parts of history-of-word in Q. Comparing self-boosted fusion options, normal fusion is less effective than fully-aware fusion. In Table 6, normal self-boosted fusion is not effective under the improved C, Q Fusion. Fully-aware attention enhances self-boosted fusion, showing considerable improvement. FusionNet, a new deep learning model, emphasizes the importance of understanding text at all levels. It introduces a novel attention mechanism with three key contributions. FusionNet is a deep learning model that introduces a novel attention mechanism with three key contributions. It outperforms existing machine reading models on the SQuAD dataset and the adversarial SQuAD dataset. The future work involves studying its capability in other NLP problems. The appendix presents details for the configurations used in the ablation study. The FA High-Level model enhances fully-aware attention by changing the history-of-word representation. This simple modification leads to significant performance improvements, outperforming many state-of-the-art models. The FA Multi-Level configuration utilizes fully-aware attention and generates understanding vectors for both context and question. The FA Multi-Level configuration utilizes fully-aware attention to generate understanding vectors for both context and question. Different layers in the history-of-word use different attention weights, while being fully aware of the entire history-of-word. Three self-boosted fusion settings are considered, including the Fully-Aware setting and the None setting which uses two layers of BiLSTM for mixing attended information. The final understanding vectors for the context are obtained through standard attention. The Fully-Aware Multi-Level configuration utilizes fully-aware attention to generate understanding vectors for the context and question. FusionNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art by +2% in EM with and without CoVe embedding, showing that fine-tuning top-1000 GloVe embeddings is slightly helpful in performance. The ablation study on adversarial datasets AddSent and AddOneSent shows that FusionNet, with or without CoVe, outperforms previous best performance significantly. Removing CoVe is slightly better on adversarial datasets targeting the over-stability of machine comprehension models. FusionNet, an improved attention mechanism, addresses the over-stability issue in machine comprehension models. It can be easily integrated into any attention-based neural architecture. The text discusses the task of natural language inference, focusing on the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) corpus, which covers various genres of spoken and written text. The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) corpus covers ten genres of spoken and written text, but the training set only includes five genres. Evaluation shows in-domain and cross-domain accuracy. The Enhanced Sequential Inference Model (ESIM) achieves 88.0% accuracy on SNLI and 72.3% (in-domain) and 72.1% (cross-domain) on MultiNLI. ESIM is implemented in PyTorch using a two-layer BiLSTM with shortcut connection to encode input words for premise and hypothesis. The ESIM model fuses information from premise to hypothesis and vice versa using attention mechanisms and BiLSTMs. The final hidden vectors are passed through a multi-layer perceptron classifier with tanh activation. Dropout rate is set to 0.3, and an attention mechanism is proposed to enhance ESIM. The ESIM model incorporates an attention mechanism to improve performance, with fully-aware attention and multi-level fusion. The dropout rate is set to 0.3, and the output hidden size in BiLSTM is reduced to 250 for fair comparison. Results show that augmenting with fully-aware attention yields the biggest improvement in ESIM. The ESIM model utilizes fully-aware attention and multi-level fusion to enhance performance. Experiments with and without CoVe embedding show similar observations. The ability to consider all levels of understanding is crucial for machines to better comprehend text. Tokenization, POS tagging, and NER are done using spaCy. GloVe embeddings of the top 1000 frequent question words are fine-tuned. A dropout rate of 0.4 is applied during training. The batch size is set to 32, and the optimizer is used. The ensemble model uses a standard voting scheme with 31 models. Prediction results on examples from the adversarial dataset AddOneSent are compared with the BiDAF architecture. FusionNet and BiDAF are compared based on the percentage of questions answered correctly. The comparison between FusionNet and BiDAF shows that FusionNet is not confused by most questions that BiDAF correctly answers. Among the questions answered correctly by BiDAF but not by FusionNet, some are confused by added sentences, some differ slightly from the ground truth answer, and some are completely incorrect. Sample examples are provided where FusionNet answers correctly while BiDAF is confused, and vice versa. Effective planning is crucial for the success of a construction project, considering factors such as zoning requirements, environmental impact, scheduling, budgeting, safety, logistics, and public inconvenience. Megaprojects are the largest construction endeavors. Confusion can lead to the failure of a project. The Black Death theory has been challenged by various authors, including Graham Twigg, Samuel K. Cohn, Jr., David Herlihy, Susan Scott, and Christopher Duncan. They question the identity of the Black Death and suggest that contemporary accounts may have been exaggerated. The church must have a board of trustees with 3-9 members, with gender balance recommended. Committees like nominations, finance, and church council are required. Other committees like missions, evangelism, or worship are suggested. The church conference sets pastors' salaries and elects officers to committees. The hamster committee does not have salary-setting power. Prediction: Both FusionNet and BiDAF struggle with the additional sentence in the context about imperialism. Understanding the theme of the context, which is about various empires, is crucial for answering the question. The curr_chunk discusses various empires that existed before the European colonial era, including the Ethiopian Empire, Oyo Empire, Asante Union, Luba Empire, Lunda Empire, and Mutapa Empire. It also mentions the Aztec Empire and the Incan Empire in the Americas. The question of whether the British Empire or the Ethiopian Empire is older is addressed, with the answer being the Ethiopian Empire. The context highlights the confusion caused by an additional sentence about imperialism in the text. In response to controversies in the Fourth Assessment Report, climate scientists suggested changes to the IPCC, including removing government oversight to avoid political interference. They proposed new organizational options like a small permanent body or a \"living\" Wikipedia-IPCC. The panel employ a full-time staff and remove government oversight from its processes to avoid political interference. Common knowledge is required to understand that employing a full-time staff will not prevent political problems. The Huguenots quickly assimilated into American society, marrying outside their French communities. Their descendants continued to use French names well into the nineteenth century. They made significant contributions to the US economy as merchants and artisans. E.I. du Pont, a Huguenot descendant, established gunpowder mills, while Westinghouse was a prominent arms manufacturer. E.I. du Pont, a Huguenot descendant, established gunpowder mills, serving as an example of a person involved in arms manufacturing. The attention weight visualization shows clear variation between low-level and high-level attention weights, with an added adversarial sentence tricking the machine comprehension system. The attention map in FIG19 shows how high-level and low-level attention affect the machine comprehension system. High-level attention can lead to incorrect answers, while low-level attention helps the system be more observant. This visualization supports the superior performance of the system. The attention map in FIG19 illustrates how high-level and low-level attention impact machine comprehension. High-level attention can result in incorrect answers, while low-level attention enhances the system's observance. This visualization reinforces the system's superior performance and emphasizes the importance of considering all levels of understanding for machines to comprehend text effectively."
