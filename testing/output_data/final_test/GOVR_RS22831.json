He endorsed Dmitriy Medvedev as his successor, reassuring Russians that the \"Putin plan\" would continue. Putin later accepted Medvedev's request to serve as prime minister under a Medvedev presidency. In late 2005, Medvedev was appointed by Putin to implement high-budget \"national projects\" for social service reforms. Medvedev, who had served under Putin since 2000 and chaired Gazprom, had never run for elective office. Four candidates, including Medvedev, Zyuganov, and Zhirinovskiy, registered for the March 2, 2008, presidential election. Kasyanov, an oppositionist, was denied registration for allegedly invalid signatures. Opposition candidates faced challenges in the 2008 Russian presidential election, with allegations of invalid signatures and difficulties in renting meeting halls. Boris Nemtsov withdrew from the race, citing government interference, while a little-known candidate, Andrey Bogdanov, managed to gather two million signatures. Medvedev refused to debate other candidates, dismissing their chances of implementing their programs. Debates were often aired late at night or early morning, and the NGO Golos raised concerns about the election process. During the 2008 Russian presidential election, Medvedev received overwhelming television coverage in many regions, prompting complaints from Zyuganov and Zhirinovskiy about unequal coverage. Putin and Medvedev outlined long-term development programs, emphasizing stability and prosperity compared to the 1990s, with Medvedev's speech seen as more liberal in tone. Medvedev's speech during the 2008 Russian presidential election was viewed as more liberal than Putin's, focusing on judicial reforms, media independence, private property rights, equal access to healthcare and education, and creating a large middle class through home and land ownership. According to the final report of the Central Electoral Commission (CEC), Medvedev won 70.28% of almost 75 million votes cast in the 2008 Russian presidential election. Zyuganov and Zhirinovskiy also benefitted from their results, while Bogdanov conceded defeat quickly. Zhirinovskiy's representative on the CEC stated that the election was conducted properly. Zyuganov claimed election \"rigging\" cost him 5%-10% of the vote. OSCE ODIHR declined to monitor due to Russian government restrictions. PACE monitoring group said the election resembled a plebiscite on Putin's rule. Medvedev was given a solid mandate by the majority of Russians. The monitors raised concerns about the electoral process in Russia, citing an onerous registration process for independent candidates and uneven media coverage. PACE criticized Medvedev for not engaging in debates, and U.S. analyst Michael McFaul called it the least competitive election in Russia's post-communist history. Amendments in 2005 banned electoral observers from NGOs, allowing only candidates' representatives and media to observe voting. Golos sent \"press correspondents\" as observers to many precincts, but some were blocked from monitoring. Zyuganov also made monitoring efforts, sending representatives to 58% of polling stations according to Golos. Putin congratulated Medvedev on his election win and stated they would restructure the government before Medvedev's inauguration on May 7. Medvedev acknowledged the election results as an endorsement of Putin's policies and a mandate to continue them. Putin directed ministries to work on implementing 2020 development goals and national project goals in urban policy, agricultural lands, and social sector reforms. Putin directed ministries to work on implementing 2020 development goals in various sectors, including finished goods processing of natural resources, strengthening the home mortgage and banking systems, and simplifying rules for small businesses. He emphasized the need to find revenues to cover increased social benefits and asserted his substantial constitutional powers as prime minister, including budget formulation, monetary policy, and foreign economic policies. Observers speculate on Putin retaining power while Medvedev may serve as a \"ceremonial\" president. Observers speculate that Medvedev was chosen with the expectation that he would not reverse policies benefiting Putin's associates with ties to security agencies. Some analysts predict that Medvedev may assert himself slowly against these associates, similar to how Putin moved against oligarchs in his first term. Russian analyst Dmitriy Trenin suggests that a power-sharing arrangement with Putin could potentially lead to democratization if other institutions also gain autonomy. Some observers predict potential clashes between Putin and Medvedev due to their different institutional roles, which could lead to government paralysis. Concerns have been raised about a power struggle similar to the one in 1993, potentially affecting the balance of powers between the presidency, legislature, and judiciary. Medvedev faces domestic challenges including economic concerns, terrorism, and civil disorder in the North Caucasus. There are worries about sustaining the economic growth seen during Putin's presidency, with rising inflation being a major issue. Opposition marches have been met with force in Moscow, while pro-Putin groups protest alleged Western interference. Medvedev, the new Russian president, is focusing on foreign policy and has accepted invitations to visit several countries. Recent international issues include Russia's vote in favor of new sanctions against Iran and possibly improved relations with Georgia. He urged Ukrainian President Yushchenko to pay the country's gas debt. President Bush emphasized the importance of a personal relationship with the new Russian president. President Bush emphasized the importance of a personal relationship with the new Russian president, focusing on areas of common interest such as non-proliferation and Iranian nuclear issues. He called Medvedev to urge cooperation on various issues and acknowledged Medvedev's campaign commitments on human rights and combating corruption. Disagreements between the United States and Russia include missile defenses, Kosovo's independence, and NATO enlargement. Putin threatened to target Poland, Czech Republic, and Ukraine over hosting U.S. missile defenses and NATO membership. Medvedev supported Serbia's opposition to Kosovo independence and focused on economic ties with Europe through Gazprom. Gazprom's use of energy as a political weapon is likely to continue under Medvedev. Merkel met with Medvedev and Putin in Moscow, hinting at ongoing tensions. Merkel met with Medvedev and Putin in Moscow on March 8, suggesting continuity in Russia's relations with the West. Observers speculate on Medvedev's potential as a reformist president and improved U.S.-Russia ties. Analysts debate Russia's economic stability and Medvedev's role in reversing democratization. Recent Russian actions, such as cyber attacks on Estonia, the radiation poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in England, and the closure of British Council offices in Russia, are seen as typical of a regime reversing democratization."
