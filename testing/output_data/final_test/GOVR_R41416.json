    "content": "This report analyzes homegrown violent jihadist plots and attacks since 9/11, discussing radicalization, law enforcement efforts, and challenges. It briefly touches on building trust between community groups and government agencies, and does not address terrorist activity by foreigners radicalized abroad. The report focuses on homegrown violent jihadist plots and attacks since 9/11, describing specific cases to support analytical findings. It defines \"homegrown\" as terrorist activity by American citizens or residents radicalized within the U.S. The term \"violent jihadist\" refers to individuals using Islam to justify establishing a global caliphate through violence. The report does not cover terrorism from non-jihadist causes like environmentalism or anti-abortion movements. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) estimates 74 homegrown violent jihadist plots or attacks in the US since 9/11, with 53 arrests made from May 2009 to January 2014. Most of these plots reflect a trend away from core terrorist group direction, suggesting sustained influence of violent jihad ideologies on a minority of Americans. Homegrown violent jihadists in the US may lack the resources and expertise of international terrorist networks, leading them to resort to less complex attacks like using firearms. This poses challenges for law enforcement in detecting and preventing smaller, quickly developing conspiracies. Individuals can become jihadist terrorists through radicalization and adopting violence as a tactic. Individuals can become jihadist terrorists by radicalizing and adopting violence as a tactic, moving from belief to illegal pursuit through violent methods. Intermediaries, social networks, the Internet, and prisons play key roles in the radicalization process, with charismatic individuals often persuading law-abiding citizens to become violent jihadists. The influence of social networks and online materials on radicalizing individuals to become violent jihadists is significant. Despite debates on the impact of online jihadist material, there is no consensus on the role of the Web in terrorism. Prisons are not major sources of homegrown jihadists. Since 9/11, domestic violent jihadist activity has varied with no clear general profile. Analysis shows that the 74 plots post-9/11 have diverse endgames, little inclination towards suicide, successful lone wolf attacks, and varying capabilities. Since 9/11, there have been 74 homegrown plots with diverse endgames, including individuals interested in becoming foreign fighters, using explosives or firearms, and funding jihadist activities. Some plots involved suicide or martyrdom, while lone wolves were responsible for successful attacks. Participants in these plots had varying operational capabilities. Counterterrorism efforts face challenges in disrupting homegrown terrorist plots, with varying levels of operational capabilities among participants. Law enforcement addresses radicalization in the open marketplace of ideas, while also focusing on dismantling violent jihadist plots through secretive illegal activities. Government efforts straddle both arenas to combat domestic violent jihad. Government efforts to combat domestic violent jihad involve proactive law enforcement strategies to disrupt terrorist plots before they occur. Intelligence on homegrown plots mainly comes from domestic sources, requiring a preventive policing approach to gather information. A key challenge is determining when individuals transition from radical beliefs to violence to detect and disrupt terrorist plots. The Department of Justice and the FBI play a crucial role at the federal level in these efforts. The Department of Justice and FBI have implemented proactive measures to combat domestic violent jihad, including revising guidelines for FBI operations and utilizing tools like \"assessments\" to investigate without factual predication. Controversy surrounds these revised guidelines, particularly among civil libertarians. Law enforcement also monitors Internet and social networking sites, authorized by the USA PATRIOT Act, to gather information using National Security Letters. U.S. law enforcement effectively leverages the Internet for radicalization purposes. Law enforcement has effectively used the Internet to build cases against terrorists, with at least 36 post-9/11 cases involving online communications. The Internet is not always a permissive environment for terrorists, and state and local law enforcement play a crucial role in detecting terrorist plots. Integration of state, local, and tribal law enforcement into the national counterterrorism effort remains a key concern. Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) and intelligence fusion centers have been established to coordinate investigative activities and share intelligence. The Nationwide Suspicious Activity Report Initiative (NSI) facilitates the exchange of terrorism-related information between federal, state, local, and tribal levels. U.S. law enforcement employs tactics such as the \"Al Capone\" approach and the use of \"agent provocateurs\" to counter violent jihadist plots. The \"Al Capone\" approach and the use of agent provocateurs have been utilized in counterterrorism investigations, targeting individuals linked to terrorist plots through non-terrorism-related offenses. These tactics have sparked controversy due to their preemptive nature, raising concerns among community members and civil libertarians. Law enforcement agencies realized the importance of cooperation with American Muslim, Arab, and Sikh communities to prevent terrorist attacks. Community policing models are used to build trust through engagement and partnership. U.S. government agencies engage with Muslim American communities, facing challenges in developing programs for substantive relationships. Balancing security and liberty is crucial, relying on local communities for critical information. Balancing security and liberty is challenging in law enforcement activities, especially in building trust with local communities. The recruitment and management of informants can hinder successful community engagement efforts, with concerns about coercion and targeting of vulnerable individuals. The use of informants in post-9/11 homegrown jihadist terrorism cases has raised concerns about their trustworthiness, especially when they have criminal backgrounds. Policy makers must weigh the tradeoff between security and liberty when using investigative tactics that may alienate certain communities. From May 2009 to January 2014, there were 53 arrests for \"homegrown,\" jihadist-inspired terrorist plots in the United States. Three jihadist-inspired terrorist plots by American citizens or lawful permanent residents resulted in attacks, including the Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013 and the Fort Hood assault in November 2009. In comparison to the period after 9/11, there were 21 plots from September 2001 to April 2009, with two resulting in attacks. In April 2009, a naturalized American citizen from Iran drove his SUV into a crowd at the University of North Carolina, injuring several people. This incident, along with others like the 2003 attack by U.S. Army Sergeant Hasan Akbar in Kuwait, raises concerns about homegrown violent jihadists in the United States. Estimates suggest that between 1,000 and 2,000 American Muslims engaged in violent jihad during the 1990s. American Muslims engaged in violent jihad during the 1990s in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Chechnya. Domestic terrorists committed numerous bombings on U.S. soil during the 1970s. Attacks by violent jihadists radicalized in the United States remain a security concern, with a trend away from schemes directed by core leaders of terrorist groups. A global shift in terrorism towards decentralized, autonomously radicalized violent jihadists has occurred, making it harder for international terrorist networks to carry out attacks far from their bases. This report focuses on homegrown terrorism, defined as jihadist activity by American citizens, residents, or visitors radicalized within the United States. These groups may target foreign locations and have ties to foreign terrorist groups, but most plots since April 2009 do not. Homegrown violent jihadists in the United States may come from Muslim immigrant communities or be converts to Islam. They have been involved in various terrorism-related incidents, including plotting attacks, providing support to terrorist groups, and recruiting individuals for jihadist activities abroad. Unlike international terrorist networks like Al Qaeda, some homegrown terrorists may lack specialized tradecraft skills. Homegrown violent jihadists in the United States may lack deep understanding of specialized tradecraft and support networks, making them less capable of planning large-scale attacks like 9/11. They may resort to less planned violence using firearms instead. The possibility of homegrown violent jihadists committing large strikes with firearms is not out of the question, as seen in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing by the Tsarnaev brothers. Al Qaeda has embraced such plots, as shown in a video featuring American-born spokesperson Adam Gadahn praising Nidal Hasan as a \"trailblazer\" for selecting familiar and symbolic targets for attacks. In a 2011 video message, Al Qaeda spokesperson Adam Gadahn encourages lone wolf operations, highlighting the ease of obtaining firearms in America. He suggests targeting major institutions and influential public figures. Users of jihadist websites began posting potential targets and developing hit lists around the same time. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has released a propaganda magazine called Inspire, promoting homegrown violent jihadist activities in the West. The magazine features articles by prominent figures like Gadahn, Anwar al-Awlaki, and Samir Khan. Despite the deaths of the latter two in a U.S. strike in Yemen, homegrown terrorists can still engage in sophisticated actions and collaborate with international groups, as seen in the case of Najibullah Zazi receiving explosives training from Al Qaeda in Pakistan for a foiled New York City subway bombing plot in 2008. Najibullah Zazi received explosives training from Al Qaeda in Pakistan for a foiled New York City subway bombing plot in 2008. U.S. authorities suspect Adnan el-Shukrijumah of recruiting Zazi and his co-conspirators. The plot's complexity, involving individuals in the U.S. and abroad, attracted increased scrutiny from law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Homegrown terrorists present challenges for detecting and disrupting plots due to their smaller, harder-to-detect cells. Former Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair highlighted the difficulty in detecting small groups of homegrown terrorists who rely on short-term planning. These individuals, as U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, can easily travel between the United States and foreign countries to receive training from terrorist organizations and plan attacks. This nimbleness makes them harder to identify and disrupt compared to more traditional, highly organized international terrorist conspiracies. Homegrown terrorists with English language skills and ability to navigate Western culture can easily blend in and plan attacks. Cases like \"Jihad Jane\" and David Headley illustrate how these factors facilitate terrorist plotting. In 2010, David Headley, with American and Pakistani heritage, pleaded guilty to aiding in the 2008 Mumbai attacks and planning an attack in Copenhagen. He used his citizenship to travel between the US and abroad for terrorist activities. Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan immigrant in the US, was involved in a 2009 plot to trigger explosives in NYC subways. The perception of success in challenging the U.S. through failed attacks suggests that Al Qaeda and associated groups will increase operations in the United States. American citizens and lawful permanent residents radicalized within the country will continue to pose a violent jihadist threat. Radicalization involves exposure to extremist ideologies and a shift towards violent beliefs and actions. The process of radicalization involves adopting extremist beliefs, including a willingness to use violence for societal change. While individuals have the right to express extreme ideas, law enforcement becomes involved when radicalized individuals take action towards terrorism. \"Radicalization involves acquiring radical beliefs, while violent extremism refers to taking violent actions based on these beliefs. Understanding radicalization is crucial to prevent it from turning into violent extremism. The NYPD released a study on domestic jihadist radicalization, outlining a four-step process leading to violent extremism.\" The process of radicalization leading to violent extremism involves self-identification, indoctrination by charismatic figures, adoption of jihadist ideals, and ultimately, jihadization. This process is outlined in a four-step model by the NYPD and the FBI, but caution should be taken when interpreting it. The radicalization process leading to terrorism is complex and not easily defined. It does not follow a linear path and individuals may not go through all stages. Transition from radical to terrorist is influenced by chance encounters and timing in one's life. It is cautioned against viewing radicalization as a conveyor belt that inevitably leads to violence. The radicalization process leading to terrorism is complex and varies across different spectrums, regions, and socio-economic conditions. Factors such as poverty, alienation, and failed multiculturalism may not play significant roles in driving radicalization. Participants in the radicalization process may be motivated by intangible spiritual incentives such as salvation and paradise in the afterlife. The radicalization process leading to terrorism is complex and varies across different spectrums, regions, and socio-economic conditions. Factors such as family ties, socialization, moral outrage, perceptions of harm by the West, travel to regions with terrorist activity, and religious conversion play key roles in radicalization. Pre-radicalization indicators are subtle and may not be detectable, with jihadists connecting larger grievances to their own experiences. A study of 2,032 foreign fighters who joined Al Qaeda and its affiliated organizations suggests that they can be categorized as revenge seekers, status seekers, identity seekers, or thrill seekers with an unfulfilled need to define themselves. Terrorists see the world in black-and-white terms, identify with others, and desire revenge. Scholars have noted various forces impacting radicalization, including intermediaries, social networks, the Internet, and prisons. Intermediaries play a critical role in the development of terrorist plots and radicalization. Intermediaries like terrorist recruiters or extremist clerics are crucial in the radicalization process, interacting with individuals interested in terrorism through face-to-face discussions or online forums. Some post-9/11 terrorist plots involved intermediaries, including government informants. Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical imam, was a key figure in jihadist circles before being killed in a U.S. counterterrorism operation in Yemen in 2011. Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen born in New Mexico in 1971, was a leader in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and linked to domestic jihadist plots. He directed Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's failed bombing attempt in 2009. Awlaki had connections to homegrown violent jihadists, including exchanging emails with Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan. His teachings influenced individuals in other jihadist plots, like Jose Pimentel who was building explosive devices before his arrest by the NYPD. Antonio Martinez, a Muslim convert, was arrested by the FBI in a sting operation for plotting to bomb an Armed Forces recruiting station in Maryland. He praised Awlaki and planned to use a vehicle loaded with a bomb. Farooque Ahmed, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested for attempting to assist terrorists in planning the bombing of Washington, DC, Metrorail stations. Ahmed possessed a biography of Awlaki and listened to his online sermons. Several individuals, including Abdel Hameed Shehadeh, Zachary Chesser, and Paul Rockwood Jr., were influenced by Awlaki's teachings and attempted to join extremist groups or carry out violent acts. Shehadeh managed a jihadist website inspired by Awlaki, Chesser corresponded with Awlaki and tried to join al-Shabaab, and Rockwood developed a hit list based on Awlaki's pronouncements. Shaker Masri, Mohamed Alessa, Carlos Almonte, Faisal Shahzad, and others were influenced by Anwar al-Awlaki's teachings. They watched his videos, listened to his sermons, and cited him as a key influence in their extremist activities. U.S. officials believe Awlaki also had contact with Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to detonate an explosive device on a flight to Detroit. Abdulmutallab attempted to detonate a bomb on a flight in 2009 and cited Anwar al-Awlaki as his inspiration for jihad. Awlaki was the first U.S. citizen targeted for assassination by the CIA and his teachings influenced other terrorists like the Tsarnaev brothers who bombed the Boston Marathon in 2013. Samir Khan, editor of Inspire magazine, radicalized after 9/11 and joined AQAP in Yemen. Khan, a Saudi-born jihadist blogger, aimed to attract Western jihadists through the magazine. Samir Khan, editor of Inspire magazine, radicalized after 9/11 and joined AQAP in Yemen. Khan aimed to attract Western jihadists through the magazine. His online publications may have influenced homegrown jihadists, as seen in cases like Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales, Naser Abdo, and Mohamed Osman Mohamud. They were arrested for plotting terrorist activities after reading articles from Inspire about bomb making and weapons training. In 2010, Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a Somali-born U.S. citizen, was arrested for attempting to detonate a van with explosives in Portland. He wrote for Jihad Recollections magazine, edited by Samir Khan, who also contributed to Inspire magazine. Adam Gadahn, an American Al Qaeda propagandist, served as a translator and propagandist for Al Qaeda, charged with treason by the U.S. Born in California, Gadahn converted to Islam as a teenager and moved to Pakistan in 1999. In 2004, Adam Gadahn appeared in a video threatening attacks on the United States and urged Americans to convert to Islam. In 2010, he criticized President Barack Obama. Omar Hammami, also known as \"Abu Mansour al-Amriki,\" was an intermediary for al-Shabaab but later renounced ties to the group and Al Qaeda before reportedly being killed by assassins. He spent years trying to recruit jihadists for al-Shabaab. Omar Hammami, also known as \"Abu Mansour al-Amriki,\" was a key figure in recruiting jihadists for al-Shabaab. He was featured in propagandist videos, led battlefield skirmishes, and was tied to recruitment and financial management for the group. He converted to Islam in high school, adopted Salafi doctrine, and called Western Muslims to violent jihad in a 2011 video. Omar Hammami, also known as \"Abu Mansour al-Amriki,\" was a key figure in recruiting jihadists for al-Shabaab. He converted to Islam in high school, adopted Salafi doctrine, and began pursuing violent jihad in Somalia after moving from Canada with his Somali wife. Social networks play a significant role in the radicalization process, forming group loyalties around jihadist messages. Loyalties can form around jihadist messages, with networks helping to contextualize these messages in individuals' personal experiences. Affective ties with like-minded individuals play a role in terrorist group formation. Examples include Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's influence by his brother in the Boston Marathon bombing plot and Faisal Shahzad's radicalization in the US and reestablishing ties with a fellow Pakistani before his attempted Times Square bombing. Shahzad reconnected with Hussain after his failed Times Square bombing. The two became more militant after the 2007 Lal Masjid raid in Pakistan. They socialized with Mughal, who trained with the Pakistani Taliban and introduced them to jihadist ideology. Kabir allegedly influenced individuals to convert to Islam and embrace violent doctrines online. The DOJ alleges that Kabir, Santana, and Deleon used social media to highlight links related to Al Qaeda. They, along with Arifeen David Gojali, planned to join Al Qaeda or the Taliban. In a separate case, Daniel Boyd and others were indicted for terrorism charges from 2006 to 2009, involving recruitment and support for terrorist groups. Boyd recruited and trained individuals using his past violent jihadist experiences in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Boyd recruited and trained individuals for violent terrorist activity based on his past experiences in Pakistan and Afghanistan. In 2011, the Boyds pled guilty to charges related to the case. Terrorist recruiters also promote \"jihadi cool\" through rap videos advocating terrorism. In 2007, Cabdulaahi Ahmed Faarax, a recruiter for al-Shabaab, enticed young Somali men in Minnesota with a jihadi cool message emphasizing jihad, brotherhood, and guerilla combat experiences. He reassured them that fighting was fun and recruits would get to use firearms. This \"jihadi cool\" influence also led five young Northern Virginia Muslim men to travel to Pakistan in 2009 to join jihadist organizations, resulting in their conviction on terrorism charges and 10 years in prison. Muslim leaders in Virginia were unaware of their radicalization. The Web plays a significant role in the radicalization of individuals, blurring the lines between readership and authorship. This can lead people to see themselves as part of jihadist movements and engage in activities such as propagandizing, financial support, or joining terrorist networks. The Web's impact on individuals involved in jihadist movements varies, with online rhetoric potentially pushing some towards violence. A study found that a significant number of online discussions included calls for terrorist attacks, contributing to a \"self-starter\" phenomenon among violent jihadists. These self-starters lack ties to major terrorist networks and undergo a de-formalized radicalization experience through online activity. Instances of virtual radicalization are rare, as most radicalization requires real-world social networks. Online activity can serve as a substitute for direct violence and face-to-face contact with terrorists. It allows individuals interested in violent jihad to be part of the global jihad without engaging in direct violence, channeling them away from expressing their radical beliefs violently. The Internet facilitates radicalization by allowing jihadists to spread messages with audio and video, connect with like-minded individuals globally, and normalize unacceptable behaviors. This online activity can lead to legal repercussions for supporters aiding terrorist organizations. Since 2005, online platforms have made radicalizing material easily accessible, including jihadi videos, texts, and bomb-making guides. Social networking plays a significant role in connecting radicalized individuals and recruiting them into violent jihadist groups. Anwar al-Awlaki used online platforms to spread jihadist lectures, while Virginia men convicted on terrorism charges in Pakistan allegedly contacted an Al Qaeda operative through social networking websites. The trial in Sarghoda revealed individuals operating through social networking websites. Tarek Mehanna, arrested on terrorism charges in 2009, translated documents advocating terrorism and posted them online. The case highlights the shift towards homegrown radicalization and self-starting terrorists, diminishing the need for foreign recruiters. Mehanna attempted but failed to join terrorist training camps abroad. The Internet has become a key recruitment venue for terrorists, replacing mosques, especially in drawing Westerners. Tarek Mehanna was convicted of supporting al-Qaeda and other terrorist activities. The decentralized nature of the Internet mirrors terrorist organizational structures, aiding in intelligence gathering and communication. The Internet is used by terrorists for various activities such as collecting intelligence, communicating, recruiting, propagandizing, and providing training. The Tsarnaevs used bomb-making instructions from Inspire magazine for the Boston Marathon bombing. There is interest in jihadist prison radicalization, but research on the threat posed by radicalization in prisons is unclear. Prison can accelerate the radicalization process for individuals by bringing together disaffected people receptive to anti-social messages. Experts have warned about the threat of radicalization and terrorist recruitment in U.S. jails, but the jump to terrorist plotting is rare. Prison officials are working to counter jailhouse jihadism, with the Federal Bureau of Prisons acknowledging the possibility of inmate radicalization but not widespread terrorist-inspired recruiting. Only one out of 74 violent jihadist plots since 9/11 clearly involved radicalization in prison. Since 9/11, only one out of 74 violent jihadist plots involved radicalization in prison. A study of 117 homegrown jihadists found seven cases where prison had a significant impact on radicalization. The threat from prison radicalization in jihadist terrorism plots seems less substantial than feared. The Newburgh Four plot included individuals who converted to Islam in prison, but it's unclear if they radicalized there. The group Jamiyyat Ul-Islam Is-Saheeh was involved in post-9/11 domestic violent jihadist activity inspired in prison. In August 2005, Washington, Gregory Patterson, and Hammad Samana were arrested for plotting attacks on Jewish institutions and other targets in Los Angeles. James, the founder of JIS, supported establishing an Islamic Caliphate in the US and advocated for Jihad as a defensive battle against Zionism. James introduced Washington to JIS beliefs in prison in 2004. After meeting in prison in 2004, Washington introduced Patterson and Samana to JIS beliefs. They all worshipped at the Jamaat-E-Masijudal mosque in Inglewood, California. Patterson and Samana pledged allegiance to Washington as \"mujahideen.\" James' radicalization in prison may not have been solely influenced by his experiences behind bars, as his \"JIS Protocol\" and his father's Black Panther Party membership suggest external factors played a role. Scholars and law enforcement officials have noted the lack of a general profile for domestic violent jihadists. According to the NYPD's Intelligence Division, predicting who will radicalize is difficult. Domestic jihadist terrorists are mostly male and under 30. Generalizing about individuals involved is problematic, as there is no common thread connecting various cases. The text discusses domestic jihadist terrorists, including individuals from various backgrounds involved in plots and attacks. Some acted alone, while others had co-conspirators. The cases varied in seriousness and involvement of government informants. Table B-1 provides profiles of individuals, and Table B-2 details specific plots and attacks. Homegrown violent jihadist activity post-9/11 is complex, with plots having international dimensions. Plotters may train abroad or receive cues from foreign propagandists. Targets can be domestic, foreign, or both. 42 plots targeted domestic entities, 29 focused on foreign targets, and three had elements of both. 44 plots involved travel abroad for training or planning. The 74 homegrown jihadist attacks and plots since 9/11 show various endgames, limited interest in suicide, successful lone wolf attacks, and diverse capabilities. Plotters aim for involvement in foreign conflicts, bombings, or material support. Some seek to become foreign fighters, like in Al-Shabaab-related cases. The United States has seen cases of individuals attempting to join terrorist organizations in foreign conflicts, such as Syria and Somalia. Examples include Abdella Ahmad Tounisi arrested at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport trying to join the Nusra Front in Syria, Eric Harroun from Phoenix arrested for fighting with the al Nusrah Front, and the Northern Virginia Five arrested in Pakistan for attempting to join jihadist groups in Afghanistan. Five men convicted of terrorism charges in Pakistan for planning attacks against a nuclear plant, air base, and U.S. territories. Three individuals from Toledo, Ohio convicted of conspiring to commit terrorist acts against Americans overseas. Nineteen out of 74 homegrown jihadist plots targeting the United States since 9/11 exclusively involved U.S. Armed Forces personnel serving in Iraq. Since 9/11, 74 homegrown jihadist plots in the United States involved explosives or incendiary devices. Most terrorist incidents in the U.S. have included bombs or fires, with 83% of incidents between 1970 and 2007 involving explosives. Notable cases include the Boston Marathon bombing and plots in New York City. The DOJ claims that the Tsarnaev brothers assembled bombs using pressure cookers, explosive powder, shrapnel, and adhesive. They planted the bombs at the Boston Marathon in 2013, triggering them to devastating effect. Shahzad had explosives rigged in his vehicle in 2010 with the help of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan. The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan assisted Shahzad in a failed attack by providing training and $12,000 in funding. Zazi planned to bomb New York City subway trains in 2009. Hasan carried out a shooting at Fort Hood in 2009, killing 13 and injuring over 30. Muhammad was arrested in connection with a shooting at a U.S. Army-Navy Career Center in 2009. In 2009, Muhammad was arrested for a shooting at the U.S. Army-Navy Career Center in Little Rock, Arkansas, resulting in one soldier's death and another's injury. He pled guilty to charges of capital murder, attempted capital murder, and unlawful discharge of a firearm. In a separate case, six men were arrested in 2007 for plotting against Fort Dix in New Jersey, focusing on firearms and targeting soldiers. Five of them were found guilty of conspiring to kill military personnel in 2008. Multiple attacks and plots involving various tactics were recorded, including an attack on U.S. Armed Forces members at a base in 2003. In 2003, U.S. Army Sergeant Hasan Akbar used grenades and a rifle to attack fellow servicemen at Camp Pennsylvania in Kuwait. Other plots involved individuals planning to engage in jihad abroad and attack domestic sites, such as the U.S. Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia. Bryant Vinas plotted to blow up the Long Island railroad and took part in a rocket attack on a U.S. military base in Afghanistan. In 2005, individuals tied to JIS used firearms in robberies to fund their scheme. Ehsanul Islam Sadequee and Syed Haris Ahmed scouted targets in Washington, DC. Mohammed Reza Taheri-Azar crashed his SUV into a crowd near the University of North Carolina in 2006. He pled guilty to attempted murder, seeking revenge for Muslim deaths caused by the United States. Since 9/11, individuals have illegally provided material support to terrorist organizations through radicalization, separate from violent jihadist plots. The DOJ has reported at least six cases of homegrown jihadists supporting groups like Al Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. One example is Rahmat Abdhir, a U.S. citizen indicted in 2007. Rahmat Abdhir, a U.S. citizen living in San Jose, California, was indicted in 2007 for providing material support to his brother, a member of Jemaah Islamiyah in the Philippines. He sent over $10,000 in supplies including chocolates, underwear, knives, guns, and radios. Ahmed Abdellatif Sherif Mohamed was found with explosive materials during a routine traffic stop in Goose Creek, South Carolina in 2007. He had a video on his laptop showing how to make a detonator for an explosive device using components from a remote controlled toy car, which he uploaded to YouTube. Mohamed uploaded a recording to YouTube, intended as instruction for \"suiciders.\" He entered the US on a student visa. Tarik Shah, Rafiq Abdus Sabir, Mahmud Faruq Brent were involved in supporting terrorist organizations. Shah pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda and offered to train fighters. In hand-to-hand combat, individuals like Sabir, Shah, Brent, Grecula, Ali, Carpenter, and Ranson were involved in supporting terrorist organizations by offering medical skills, attending training camps, negotiating to build explosive devices, supplying arms, and pleading guilty to various charges. In February 2005, Cedric Carpenter and Lamont Ranson from New Orleans pled guilty to selling false documents to undercover informants they believed were terrorists. Other material support cases include Joseph J. Brice pleading guilty to attempting to provide support to terrorists and manufacturing an explosive device in September 2012. In May 2011, FBI agents arrested Hafiz Khan and his sons for allegedly providing support to the Pakistani Taliban. Charges were dropped against two of them, but Hafiz Khan was found guilty of material support in March 2013. Nima Ali Yusuf, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, was arrested in November 2010 for conspiracy to support al-Shabaab. In December 2011, Yusuf pled guilty to providing material support to the terrorist organization. Mohamud Abdi Yusuf, Abdi Mahdi Hussein, and Duwayne Mohamed Diriye were also involved in sending funds to al-Shabaab. Yusuf worked with Hussein to structure financial transactions, with Hussein being an employee of a money-remitting business. In November 2011, Nima Ali Yusuf, a U.S. resident, pleaded guilty to supporting al-Shabaab. San Diego residents conspired to provide financial support to the terrorist group. Ahmed Nasir Taalil Mohamud from Anaheim was also involved. Barry Bujol from Texas attempted to provide support to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Several individuals, including Khalid Quazzani, Syed Hashmi, and Raja Lahrasib, were involved in providing material support to Al Qaeda. Quazzani, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Morocco, participated in a scheme that gave over $23,000 to Al Qaeda. Hashmi, a Pakistan-born U.S. citizen, allowed a roommate to store goods for Al Qaeda in his apartment and provided financial assistance for travel to Pakistan. Lahrasib was involved in providing support to the terrorist organization. Raja Lahrasib Khan, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Pakistan, provided material support to Al Qaeda by accepting money to purchase weapons. He pled guilty to material support charges in February 2012. Wesam El-Hanafi and Sabirhan Hasanoff also supported Al Qaeda by providing computer expertise and purchasing watches. They pled guilty to providing material support to Al Qaeda associates in Yemen and conspiring to support Al Qaeda in June 2012. Two terrorist plots involved suicide missions. Najibullah Zazi planned an attack on New York's subways as a suicide mission. Americans recruited into al-Shabaab committed suicide attacks, including Shirwa Ahmed who became the first known American suicide bomber in Somalia. Farah Mohamed Beledi and Abdisalan Hussein Ali were also identified as suicide bombers in attacks in Mogadishu. Several individuals in various plots expressed willingness to engage in suicide missions, including Daniel Maldonado, Bryant Neal Vinas, Colleen LaRose, and Shaker Masri. Lone wolves have conducted successful homegrown attacks since 9/11. Since 9/11, lone wolves have carried out four successful homegrown attacks, with three other plotters acting alone. Most plots involved two or more participants in a group or network. Law enforcement faces challenges in identifying and stopping solo actors in uncomplicated plots, but has been successful in disrupting terrorist groups. Undercover agents monitored 37 of the plots among the 74 homegrown plots, showing varying operational capabilities of participants. The operational capabilities of participants in homegrown jihadist terrorist plots vary greatly. Some showed terrorist tradecraft like bomb-making skills, while others did not. The Tsarnaev brothers were able to assemble explosive devices from online instructions. Two notable plots in 2009 involved homegrown jihadists with ties to foreign terrorist organizations, including Najibullah Zazi's plan to bomb the New York City subway. Attorney General Eric Holder described it as one of the most serious threats since 9/11. Najibullah Zazi's attempted attack on the New York City subway was thwarted due to intelligence analysis and law enforcement actions. Zazi received Al Qaeda training in Pakistan in 2008, learned about explosives, and discussed specific targets. He pled guilty to terrorism charges in 2010. Najibullah Zazi returned to the United States in January 2009 and moved to Denver. He gathered materials for bomb components and brought explosive TATP into New York in September 2009. David Headley admitted to planning terrorist plots for LeT, including the 2008 Mumbai attack and a conspiracy targeting a Danish newspaper. He received training from LeT and attended their camps multiple times between 2002 and 2005. Between 2002 and 2005, David Headley attended LeT training camps in Pakistan, receiving weapons training, indoctrination in jihad, close combat instruction, survival skills, and counter-surveillance. From 2005 to 2008, he received extensive direction from LeT members, conducted reconnaissance for the Mumbai attack, and surveilled potential targets in Mumbai and the Danish newspaper Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten. Derrick Shareef, a Muslim convert, plotted to set off hand grenades at a shopping mall in Rockford, Illinois with the help of an undercover FBI informant named William \"Jamaal\" Chrisman. Shareef lacked the capability to commit terrorist acts on his own until approached by Chrisman in 2006. Derrick Shareef, a Muslim convert, plotted with an undercover FBI informant named William \"Jamaal\" Chrisman to attack a shopping mall in Rockford, Illinois. Chrisman secretly recorded their conversations about violent jihad and a plan to obtain weapons. Shareef was arrested in December 2006 while attempting to trade stereo speakers for hand grenades. He pled guilty to attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and was sentenced to 35 years in prison in September 2008. The Obama Administration recognized the homegrown jihadist threat in its June 2011 National Strategy for Counterterrorism. The National Strategy for Counterterrorism focuses on Al Qaeda, its affiliates, and adherents. The strategy emphasizes the homeland as a primary area of concern for counterterrorism efforts. It acknowledges the ongoing threat of operatives overseas and individuals inspired by Al Qaeda engaging in terrorism within the U.S. Vigilance is necessary to prevent future attacks. Counterterrorism efforts face challenges in disrupting homegrown terrorist plotting, with legal radicalization behaviors in the open marketplace of ideas and illegal operational aspects of violent jihadist plots. Law enforcement pursues terrorists in a secretive realm of criminality, impacting the marketplace of ideas. The success of terrorist plots can spur radicalization, highlighting the interconnected nature of these contexts. The success of terrorist plots may lead to radicalization, expanding the pool of potential recruits. Intelligence and terrorism experts emphasize the importance of human intelligence to infiltrate terrorist conspiracies and prevent future attacks. The DOJ and FBI operate over 100 Joint Terrorism Task Forces in the U.S., focusing on tactical investigations related to terrorism. The Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) focus on tactical investigations, developing human sources, and gathering intelligence to thwart terrorist plots. They facilitate information sharing between FBI-led counterterrorism investigations and outside agencies, connecting state and local law enforcement with the U.S. Intelligence Community. The number of top-secret security clearances issued to local police working on JTTFs increased significantly from 125 to 878 between 2007 and 2009. Law enforcement and intelligence officials face the dilemma of distinguishing between law-abiding radicals and potential terrorists attracted to jihadist rhetoric. The vast amount of terrorist-related material available online attracts homegrown individuals open to radicalization. Some individuals may show interest in radical content without becoming terrorists, making it challenging for police to identify actual threats. Law enforcement has adopted a proactive, intelligence-driven approach since 9/11, with the Department of Justice emphasizing the importance of prevention in countering terrorism. The Department of Justice is focused on identifying security risks early and using preventative prosecutions to prevent attacks. The FBI and DOJ have a forward-leaning approach to intelligence gathering and operations, as seen in the \"Mukasey Guidelines\" for Domestic FBI Operations. The Mukasey Guidelines, implemented in 2008, aim to make the FBI more proactive in identifying and preventing criminal, counterintelligence, and terrorist threats. These guidelines allow the FBI to assess risks and vulnerabilities more efficiently to enhance their ability to preemptively address security concerns. The 2008 revision to the guidelines consolidated several documents governing FBI investigations into the Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide (DIOG). Changes allow for the use of assessments outside of traditional investigations, with different levels of factual predication required. The 2008 revision to the guidelines consolidated FBI investigations into the Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide (DIOG), allowing for the use of assessments with different levels of factual predication. Assessments do not require specific factual predication but serve five articulated purposes related to seeking information on criminal activities or national security threats. Assessments under the 2008 FBI guidelines allow for seeking information on criminal activities or national security threats, using various techniques like public surveillance and informants. Civil libertarians and Muslim organizations have raised concerns about the invasive nature of the guidelines. The FBI's guidelines for assessments have been criticized by the ACLU for being invasive and based on generalized suspicion and fear rather than individualized evidence of criminal activity. The guidelines allow for the collection of racial and ethnic data for proactive purposes, which has been described as racial profiling of entire communities. Additionally, assessments, like the FBI-led JTTF in Boston's assessment of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are not perfect. The FBI conducted an assessment of Tamerlan Tsarnaev at the request of the Russian government, interviewing him and family members, checking databases for terrorist links, and conducting surveillance. No ties were found, and the assessment was closed in June 2011. The FBI shared the results with Russia in August 2011 but received no further information. Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis claimed that the FBI did not inform Boston police about the investigation. The FBI conducted an assessment of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011, sharing the results with Boston police. The JTTF in Washington assessed Nidal Hasan before the Fort Hood attack, with concerns raised about the limited probing into Hasan's background. The FBI established a procedure to notify the Department of Defense of any FBI counterterrorism assessment or investigation involving military personnel or individuals with access to military facilities. Law enforcement faces challenges in determining when radicalized individuals transition to becoming real threats, as seen in past incidents like the Boston Marathon bombing and the Fort Hood shooting. The FBI assessed individuals like Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Nidal Hasan, and Abdulhakim Muhammad before their attacks, but struggled to determine their true intentions. Hasan's email exchange with Awlaki was initially seen as protected speech, while Muhammad spent time in Yemen before his attack on a U.S. Army-Navy Career Center. In 2007, a man married a woman in Yemen, where he taught English and learned Arabic. He was imprisoned for a visa overstay and deported to the US in 2009. The FBI conducted interviews but found insufficient evidence to link him to extremist groups. The USA PATRIOT Act authorizes the FBI to use National Security Letters to obtain information, including data on email and Internet use. Law enforcement agents may also use undercover tactics on social networking sites to gather information on suspects. FBI has used Internet activity and email communications to build cases in terrorism investigations. The FBI has used Internet activity and email communications to build cases in terrorism investigations. In at least 36 post-9/11 cases studied, terrorists and aspiring terrorists did not always find the Internet a permissive environment. The case of Mohamed Alessa and Carlos Almonte illustrates the challenges in detecting radicalization to violent extremism. They were arrested at JFK Airport in 2010 while trying to fly to Egypt to join al-Shabaab. The case began with an FBI tip in 2006 about their online activities focused on terrorist videos and anti-American sentiments. In 2006, two young men engaged in radical behavior, perusing jihadist websites and discussing terrorist activity. Investigators monitored their actions as their beliefs potentially turned more dangerous. By 2009, an undercover investigator from the NYPD was involved in the case. In 2009, the U.S. government's criminal complaint detailed Alessa and Almonte's transition from radicals to terrorist suspects. They trained for jihad in New Jersey, saved money for violent activities, and downloaded jihadist rhetoric. Alessa viewed a video with Al-Qaeda spokesperson Adam Gadahn praising Nidal Hasan. The U.S. government's criminal complaint detailed Alessa and Almonte's transition to terrorist suspects, including possession of jihadist documents and booking flights to Egypt. Preventing domestic terrorist attacks is a shared responsibility among federal, state, local, and tribal authorities. Preventing domestic terrorist attacks is a shared responsibility among federal, state, local, and tribal authorities. Law enforcement agencies at various levels collect and document information on suspicious activities to prevent crimes, including terrorism. Noteworthy cases like the arrest of Eric Robert Rudolph and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh highlight the importance of vigilant officers in detecting and thwarting potential threats. The role of state, local, and tribal law enforcement in detecting terrorist threats is crucial. Homegrown jihadist attacks post-9/11 were carried out by lone wolves, emphasizing the need for effective domestic prevention measures. Preventing future terrorist attacks requires effective domestic intelligence collection by local authorities. Integrating state, local, and tribal law enforcement into the national counterterrorism effort remains a top priority. Efforts have been made to improve information sharing between federal, state, local, and tribal agencies through the establishment of intelligence fusion centers. In 2004, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act mandated the creation of Information Sharing Environment (ISE) to facilitate sharing terrorism information among federal, state, local, and tribal entities. Fusion centers were established to combine resources for detecting, preventing, and responding to criminal or terrorist activity. The Federal government, State, and local agencies, and private sector entities work together to prevent terrorist attacks in the United States. DHS supports fusion centers through various initiatives, including the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Report Initiative (NSI) to share terrorism-related information among different levels of government. The Nationwide Suspicious Activity Report Initiative (NSI) is a framework to support the reporting of suspicious activity related to terrorism. It involves gathering, processing, analyzing, and sharing information while protecting privacy and civil liberties. U.S. law enforcement uses tactics like the \"Al Capone\" approach to apprehend individuals linked to terrorist plots on non-terrorism-related offenses. The \"Al Capone\" approach involves apprehending individuals linked to terrorist plots on lesser, non-terrorism-related offenses such as immigration violations. This tactic, often used in sting operations, has raised concerns within U.S. Muslim communities. The Department of Justice has shifted towards trying suspected terrorists as terrorists instead of using lesser charges. In 2001 and 2002, only 8% of defendants labeled as terrorists were charged under terrorism statutes, but by 2006 and 2007, this figure rose to 47%. The \"Capone approach\" is still used in terrorism cases, where individuals may be charged with lesser offenses like lying to an FBI Special Agent. An example is Paul Rockwood, Jr., a U.S. citizen and Muslim convert, who pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI in 2010. In 2010, Paul Rockwood planned to kill 15 people he believed desecrated Islam. He researched explosives and discussed using mail bombs or firearms. Prosecutors used the \"Capone approach\" to neutralize the threat. The FBI's case against Najibullah Zazi, who planned to detonate bombs in New York's subway system, demonstrated the effectiveness of this preventative technique. Between September 10 and 19, the FBI monitored Zazi's activities in New York and Denver, bolstering their case with searches. Zazi was arrested in Aurora, Colorado, for lying to the FBI, and later indicted on weapons of mass destruction charges. An imam from Queens, Ahmad Wais Afzali, was also arrested for tipping off Zazi to the FBI's investigation. Afzali pled guilty to lying to federal officials and warned Zazi not to \"get involved in Afghanistan garbage.\" Ahmad Wais Afzali cautioned Zazi not to \"get involved in Afghanistan garbage\" and admitted to misleading the FBI to protect himself. Tarek Mehanna was charged for lying to FBI agents about his relationship to a convicted terrorist. Mehanna's arrest occurred at Boston's Logan International Airport as he was preparing to leave the country. His defense attorney claimed the FBI wanted Mehanna to become an informant, leading to his indictment on terrorism charges. The FBI uses agent provocateur cases to catch suspects engaging in violent jihad. Mohamed Osman Mohamud was arrested for attempting to set off a bomb at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon, but the device was a dud assembled by FBI undercover operatives. On September 24, 2009, Hosam Smadi, a Jordanian immigrant, was arrested for attempting to detonate a car bomb in Dallas, Texas. He believed he was working with Al Qaeda operatives but was actually caught in an FBI sting operation. Smadi drove a truck with a fake bomb into a skyscraper's garage and tried to trigger it with a cell phone. Michael C. Finton in Springfield, IL, faced charges related to a bomb plot involving undercover FBI personnel. He was supplied with a van he believed contained explosives, which he tried to detonate near a federal building using a cell phone. Finton had converted to Islam while in prison and was re-arrested in 2007. The FBI's operations, including those involving Finton and Smadi, likely led to more proactive sting operations. In 2007, Michael C. Finton was re-arrested for a parole violation and had radical beliefs. The FBI used an informant to monitor him, and in 2009, he planned to travel to Gaza to fight Israelis. The FBI then initiated an agent provocateur strategy to catch him. The investigation into Hosam Smadi, another individual, was also ongoing. The FBI identified Smadi as a potential threat due to his jihadist sentiments and devotion to Al Qaeda. After multiple exchanges with an undercover employee, Smadi expressed his desire to conduct violent jihad. The FBI then introduced him to another undercover employee posing as a senior member of an Al Qaeda sleeper cell. The tipping point in the investigation of Mohamud, a Somali-born individual, is unclear due to limited publicly available information. The FBI was alerted to Mohamud, a Somali-born U.S. citizen, by the local Muslim community. Mohamud communicated with a suspected terrorist in Pakistan about violent jihad. After being stopped from boarding a flight to Alaska, he told the FBI he planned to work there for the summer. An undercover FBI employee posing as a terrorist associate contacted Mohamud. The FBI evaluated Mohamud's intent to do harm through undercover operations, including discussions about staging an attack at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony where children attend. Mohamud expressed a desire for a large crowd to be attacked at a holiday event. In previous cases, suspects were reassured they would face no consequences if they backed out of violent plots. Despite efforts to dissuade him, Smadi remained committed to his jihadist beliefs. An undercover operative offered him an exit strategy, emphasizing different forms of jihad and the option to remain part of the group if he withdrew. However, Smadi persisted in his plot. Smadi and Finton were given opportunities to abandon their terrorist plots but remained committed. Some cases raise controversy about government informants potentially entrapping suspects. The FBI faces criticism for its techniques in preventing terrorism while being charged to stop it. The 2008 Attorney General's Guidelines for Domestic FBI Operations address these conflicting pressures. The FBI's Guidelines for Domestic Operations have sparked concerns among civil liberties groups. Investigations into the Newburgh Four and Liberty City Seven plots have faced criticism for the use of undercover informants. Officials stress the importance of prevention in neutralizing threats posed by these groups. Mayor Bloomberg highlighted the preemptive nature of the Newburgh plot, emphasizing the police department's role as \"first preventers.\" Former Attorney General Gonzalez faced criticisms regarding the competency and viability of the Liberty City men's plotting. Former Attorney General Gonzalez emphasized the importance of identifying terrorist plots early on. The Newburgh Four case raised concerns about the use of an agent provocateur offering inducements to trigger explosives and shoot down military aircraft. The trial was delayed due to prosecutors potentially withholding relevant case information from defense attorneys. The defense attorneys may have not received relevant case information, with concerns raised about the FBI informant influencing the Newburgh Four plot. The quartet, allegedly manipulated by informant Shahed Hussain, were arrested for attempting to detonate explosives near a synagogue and shoot down military airplanes. The trial was delayed due to potential withholding of information by prosecutors. Shahed Hussain, an FBI informant, posed as a member of a Pakistani terrorist group and provided inert explosives to the Newburgh Four. The group was found guilty of a plot involving explosives and a surface-to-air missile. Hussain had a history of legal issues and had previously assisted in other FBI sting operations. The Liberty City Seven case involved seven Miami-area men arrested for plotting to blow up government buildings. Defense attorneys claimed government entrapment due to FBI informant offering money and resources for the plot. The FBI informants in the Liberty City Seven case had questionable backgrounds, with one jailed for extortion and domestic violence charges, and the other failing a polygraph test. Despite objections from a veteran FBI agent, the informants' credibility issues were not allowed to be presented in court. Ultimately, six of the seven defendants were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms. The Obama Administration released a strategy for combating violent extremism (CVE) in August 2011, focusing on government agencies cooperating with local groups to discourage terrorist ideologies. The federal government acts as a facilitator, convener, and source of information, fostering trust and partnership with communities. This approach is rooted in the community policing model developed in the 1990s. In the 1990s, community policing was mentioned in the Administration's CVE strategy post-9/11 attacks. Law enforcement agencies realized the need for cooperation with American Muslim, Arab, and Sikh communities to prevent terrorist attacks. Building bridges for effective communication with these groups was recognized as essential. Muslim, Arab, and Sikh Americans also saw the importance of defining themselves as American communities willing to help prevent terrorism. The Homeland Security Institute study found that community policing has been successful in cities like New York City, Chicago, Boston, and San Diego. The effectiveness of Community-Oriented Policing was highlighted by a Homeland Advisory Council working group chaired by Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley. Building trust and partnerships in law enforcement activities can be challenging, especially in cases where investigative tactics may be perceived as targeting law-abiding citizens or infringing on rights. The HSAC Countering Violent Extremism Working Group found tension between law enforcement investigations and local partnerships in community policing efforts. Muslim Americans fear FBI informants target youth and coerce community members to become informants. Community leaders report FBI attempts to recruit Muslims as informers, often targeting individuals with legal issues or seeking green cards. The FBI allegedly offers to resolve problems in exchange for cooperation, with reports of retaliation against those who refuse. Cases of Foad Farahi and Yassine Ouassif are cited as examples. In 2002, Kuwaiti Sunni Muslim Foad Farahi sought political asylum in the US due to fear of persecution in Iran. He refused FBI requests to be a secret informant, leading to consequences in his asylum case in 2007. Foad Farahi faced threats from ICE agents during his asylum case, alleging ties to terrorist groups. He was coerced into withdrawing his application without evidence of terrorism involvement. Farahi has appealed the withdrawal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Farahi alleges government coercion to become an informant, FBI policy prevents confirmation. Another case involves a Moroccan questioned at the border. The FBI agent offered Ouassif the opportunity to become an informant on his Muslim friends in exchange for his permanent resident card. If he refused, the agent threatened to deport him to Morocco. This account is based on interviews with Ouassif and his lawyer. The FBI employed a convicted con man, Craig Monteilh, as an informant in \"Operation Flex,\" causing controversy in the Muslim American community in Southern California. Monteilh claimed to have recorded conversations with Muslims using hidden audio and video equipment. He signed a non-disclosure agreement with the FBI for $25,000. FBI and immigration officials declined to comment on the investigation. The ACLU and CAIR filed a lawsuit against the FBI over Monteilh's activities, claiming they violated religious freedom. Monteilh, posing as a convert, monitored the Irvine Islamic Center in 2006. Despite concerns about his talk of jihad, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in August 2012. Monteilh had a criminal record and served time in prison for theft charges. Monteilh, an FBI informant, alarmed residents of Irvine with talk of jihad and a terrorist attack. He was reported to the police and a restraining order was obtained. Monteilh's role was revealed in a case against Ahmadullah Niazi, but the case was dismissed due to evidentiary issues and Monteilh's potential testimony for the defense. The Orange County Register criticized the use of informants, especially those with criminal records, in undercover activities within the Muslim community post-9/11. Muslims fear discussing politics or civil liberties due to fear of drawing attention from undercover agents. The editorial argued against fishing expeditions and entrapment, emphasizing the need to avoid presuming guilt among the entire community. The use of informants in post-9/11 homegrown jihadist cases poses risks such as creating confusion, discrediting leaders, and pushing informants to become aggressive actors. This can have serious consequences for free speech and lead to the loss of government legitimacy and support. The use of informants in post-9/11 homegrown jihadist cases can lead to government losing legitimacy and support in targeted communities if they feel manipulated. FBI Director Robert Mueller emphasized the importance of building trust in these communities. The FBI values its relationships with Muslims and conducts outreach efforts to address concerns about infiltration and surveillance. Former FBI agents and prosecutors highlight informants as a crucial tool for investigations. Federal prosecutors emphasize the importance of informants in thwarting terrorists, stating that national security benefits outweigh any potential embarrassment. The FBI takes sending informants into mosques seriously to prevent attacks. However, the Muslim Public Affairs Council criticizes the FBI's approach, stating that people cannot be both suspects and partners simultaneously. The FBI's partnership with the Muslim community may not be fruitful if suspects and partners cannot be the same. Challenges exist in developing programs that foster substantive relationships rather than token discussions. Balancing security and liberty is crucial in addressing terrorism publicly and secretly. In counterterrorism investigations, building trust with local communities while preserving freedoms is challenging. Law enforcement tactics, like using informants, can hinder community engagement, especially when perceived as targeting law-abiding citizens or infringing on rights. Muslim community activists fear coercion of immigrants into becoming informants, creating obstacles for police agencies. In counterterrorism investigations, building trust with local communities while preserving freedoms is challenging. Law enforcement tactics, like using informants, can hinder community engagement. There are concerns about informants targeting individuals with legal problems or applying for green cards, as well as potentially enticing youth into fictitious terrorist plots. The trustworthiness of informants with criminal backgrounds is also questioned. Policy makers must weigh the tradeoff between security and liberty, especially when investigative tactics may inflame certain communities. The controversy surrounding investigative tactics raises questions about their effectiveness in bringing terrorists to justice. Terry Lee Loewen was arrested in December 2013 for attempting to detonate a car bomb at Wichita Mid-Continent Airport. In 2013, Terry Lee Loewen was arrested for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction at Wichita Mid-Continent Airport. The FBI conducted a sting operation, leading to Loewen's failed attempt to detonate a car bomb at the airport. In 2013, Terry Lee Loewen was arrested for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction at Wichita Mid-Continent Airport. He communicated online with an FBI undercover employee about violent jihad, believing the person was tied to Al Qaeda. Loewen shared photos of airport access details and expressed admiration for Osama Bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki. Plans for an attack were discussed, including concerns about killing children. Loewen met with another FBI undercover employee posing as a member of AQAP. In November 2013, Basit Javed Sheikh was arrested at Raleigh-Durham International Airport for attempting to join the Nusra Front in Syria to fight against the Bashar al Asad regime. Sheikh, a Pakistani immigrant and lawful permanent resident of the US, used Facebook for jihadist activities and was in contact with an FBI informant. Sheikh, arrested for attempting to join Nusra Front, was in contact with an FBI informant online. He tried to travel to Syria in 2012 but grew disillusioned and returned home. In 2013, he booked a flight to Turkey but didn't go, feeling unable to leave his parents. He wanted to provide logistical support to Nusra Front. Sheikh wanted to support Nusra Front and was willing to fight or become a martyr. Sinh Vinh Ngo Nguyen confessed to trying to join Al Qaeda in Pakistan, pled guilty to supporting a terrorist organization, and was apprehended in California while preparing to travel to Pakistan to train terrorists. He also admitted involvement in the conflict in Syria in 2012. Nguyen was nabbed by the FBI for his involvement in the conflict in Syria and his attempt to join Al Qaeda in Pakistan. Bell traveled abroad to join Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and was charged with providing material support to terrorists. Bell was arrested in January 2013 on charges of grand theft and organized fraud. The FBI started its case on Bell after a Jacksonville mosque reported his discussions about violent jihad. Bell, who converted to Islam, prepared to become a foreign fighter, recruited individuals, trained with firearms, and damaged religious statues at a cemetery in 2012. The duo dressed in dark clothing, wore masks and gloves, and recorded the incident as a recruitment tool. They purchased supplies for a planned trip to wage violent jihad in Yemen and left the United States in late September. Abdella Ahmad Tounisi, 18 years old at the time of his arrest in April 2013, was apprehended at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport while trying to board a flight for Istanbul, Turkey to join the Nusra Front in Syria. In January and April 2013, Abdella Ahmad Tounisi researched violent jihadist activity and the Nusra front online. The FBI used a sting operation, creating a fake website and having an undercover employee pose as a recruiter to lure Tounisi. He shared his plan to travel to Syria through Turkey and was given a bus ticket by the undercover operative. Tounisi was charged with attempting to support a foreign terrorist organization. He was also friends with Adel Daoud, who was arrested for plotting terrorist activities. Tounisi, friends with Adel Daoud, was not involved in Daoud's bomb plot near a Chicago bar. Concerned about a third plotter being a law enforcement officer, Tounisi decided to end his role in the scheme. He attended a mosque where religious leaders partly dissuaded him. Tounisi's worries about the third individual were justified as the person turned out to be an undercover agent. The Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013 was carried out by Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, resulting in three deaths and over 200 injuries. The Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013 was carried out by Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Tamerlan died after a confrontation with law enforcement, while Dzhokhar was arrested and charged with multiple offenses related to the bombing. The DOJ has identified Tamerlan and Dzhokhar as the Boston Marathon bombers. The brothers may have initially planned to attack Independence Day festivities but targeted the Marathon instead. Dzhokhar indicated they chose the Marathon as a target only one or two days prior to the event. The FBI released images of the suspects after the bombing. The Tsarnaev brothers armed themselves with weapons and explosive devices, allegedly killing a police officer and carjacking an SUV in Boston. They planned to travel to New York City's Times Square to detonate the remaining explosives they had made. The Tsarnaev brothers armed themselves with weapons and explosive devices, allegedly killing a police officer and carjacking an SUV in Boston. They planned to travel to New York City's Times Square to detonate the remaining explosives they had made. The brothers discussed going to New York City, used a victim's ATM card, and engaged in a gunfight with law enforcement in Watertown, Massachusetts. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died during the confrontation, while Dzhokhar escaped in a stolen SUV but later abandoned it and fled on foot. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev escaped in a stolen SUV, abandoned it, and was found hiding in a boat in Watertown. He was apprehended with gunshot wounds. Explosive devices were found in the Cambridge apartment shared by Tamerlan Tsarnaev, including bombs made from pressure cookers. Jihadist material was reportedly found on a computer belonging to Tamerlan's wife, Katherine Russell. Dzhokhar admitted to law enforcement that he and his brother were involved in the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev admitted to using Inspire magazine for bomb-making instructions, including a pressure cooker bomb. The FBI and DHS noted the use of such devices in other countries. Two additional men were charged in connection with the case. Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, both from New Bedford, Massachusetts, were charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice by hiding items belonging to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Robel Phillipos from Cambridge was charged with making false statements to law enforcement. They were friends with Dzhokhar at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and removed his backpack and laptop from his dorm room. The backpack belonging to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, which contained emptied fireworks and a jar of Vaseline, was disposed of by his friends after suspecting his involvement in the Boston Marathon bombing. Dzhokhar had previously mentioned knowing how to make explosives to his friends. The backpack was found in a landfill, but his laptop remains missing. Additionally, Ibragim Todashev, another person linked to the investigation, was killed during an interview with law enforcement officials in Orlando. The FBI claims Todashev initiated a violent confrontation. In the early hours of May 22, 2013, Ibragim Todashev, a Chechen immigrant granted political asylum in the US, was killed by the FBI after allegedly initiating a violent confrontation. Todashev was speculated to be tied to a drug-related triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts in 2011, and may have implicated Tamerlan Tsarnaev before his death. Prior to 2011, the Tsarnaev brothers had not come to law enforcement attention. The FBI and CIA examined Tamerlan's background in 2011 at the request of the Russian government, indicating he was a follower of radical Islam. The FBI assessed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother in response to a Russian request before his international travel. Tamerlan's identity was added to the TECS and Guardian threat tracking system. The FBI interviewed Tamerlan and family members, checked databases, but found no ties to terrorists. The FBI investigated Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother for ties to terrorists but found no evidence. The Bureau shared their assessment with the Russian government and added them to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) in October 2011. Boston Police were not informed of the investigation, and it is unclear how this lack of communication may have affected subsequent events. Tamerlan and his mother were added to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) and the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) by the FBI. Tamerlan traveled to Russia in January 2012, allegedly visiting Dagestan. The TECS system notified the FBI of Tamerlan's travel plans to Russia, but a follow-up notification failed due to a misspelling of his name. Upon his return to the US, the Boston JTTF received a notification, but it was not widely shared. It is unclear when or how the Tsarnaev brothers radicalized, with the possibility of ties to foreign terrorists. However, officials suggest they radicalized on their own, with Dzhokhar radicalizing in the US. Unlike Tamerlan, Dzhokhar did not travel abroad in 2012. Dzhokhar radicalized in the United States and did not travel abroad in 2012. The brothers may have been motivated by U.S. military activity in Iraq and Afghanistan, as suggested by a note allegedly left by Dzhokhar in the boat where he was captured. The note also indicates that the alleged bombers viewed the civilians they killed as \"collateral damage.\" In March 2013, Eric Harroun from Phoenix, Arizona, was arrested for conspiring to use a rocket propelled grenade while fighting with the al Nusrah Front in Syria. Eric Harroun, a 30-year-old U.S. citizen and former U.S. Army soldier, was taken into custody by the FBI for conspiracy to support a foreign terrorist organization. He admitted to being part of a Nusra RPG team and engaging in combat in Syria. Harroun also claimed to have initially fought with the Free Syrian Army before joining Nusra. In March 2013, Reaz Qadir Khan, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested for supporting a terrorist attack near ISI headquarters in Lahore, Pakistan in 2009. The FBI found photos of Eric Harroun holding weapons on his Facebook account before his arrest for supporting the Nusra Front in Syria. Harroun had initially fought with the Free Syrian Army before joining Nusra. Reaz Qadir Khan, a U.S. citizen, was arrested for supporting a terrorist attack in Lahore, Pakistan in 2009. He provided advice and money to one of the attackers, Ali Jaleel, to participate in violent jihad. Khan sent $2,450 for terrorist training and $750 to Jaleel's family. The attack killed over 30 people, with Jaleel claiming responsibility in an Al Qaeda video. In February 2013, Matthew Aaron Llaneza of Oakland, California, was charged by the DOJ for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction against a Bank of America branch. Llaneza, a former Marine and convert to Islam, conspired to detonate a car bomb with an FBI undercover agent posing as a Taliban associate. His goal was to incite a governmental crackdown by framing anti-government militias. Matthew Llaneza's stated goal was to trigger a governmental crackdown by detonating a car bomb at a Bank of America branch. He hoped this would lead to a right-wing counter-response and ultimately civil war. Llaneza was apprehended after attempting to trigger the bomb. Reports indicate he had a troubled past, including a prior conviction for illegally transporting weapons and concerns about suicidal tendencies. Probation officers noted that Matthew Llaneza had suicidal tendencies, believed drug cartels were hunting him, and had received mental health treatment. In February 2013, Erwin Antonio Rios, a believer in Radical Islamic Extremism, pleaded guilty to possession of a stolen firearm and plotted violent robberies in North Carolina. He also considered attacking law enforcement officials. In February 2013, Marcos Alonso Zea and Justin Kaliebe conspired to join Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Zea, a U.S. citizen from New York, attempted to fly to Yemen but was intercepted in the UK. He then encouraged Kaliebe to join AQAP. Zea was later charged with terrorism-related offenses in October 2013. Marcos Alonso Zea encouraged Justin Kaliebe to join AQAP by advising him, giving him money, and providing extremist materials. Kaliebe, a U.S. citizen and convert to Islam, attempted to travel to Yemen to join AQAP but was arrested in June 2013. Kaliebe's attorney suggested that he may not have fully understood his actions due to autism. In January 2013, Justin Kaliebe was arrested at JFK Airport for attempting to support AQAP and terrorists. He was in high school during the investigation, expressing interest in violent jihad and pledging loyalty to AQAP leaders.

In July 2010, four additional men were indicted for a plot directed by senior al-Qaeda leadership in Pakistan, related to a scheme to use Western operatives to attack a target in the UK. The indictment charged Adnan El Shukrijumah, Abid Naseer, Tariq Ur Rehman, and another defendant. The indictment charged Adnan El Shukrijumah, Abid Naseer, Tariq Ur Rehman, and a defendant known as \"Ahmad\" with terrorism offenses. El-Shukrijumah, a naturalized U.S. citizen, is alleged to have recruited Zazi and his co-conspirators. Al-Somali and Rauf, leaders of Al Qaeda's \"external operations\" program, were killed in U.S. drone attacks. Abid Naseer, a British citizen, exchanged coded emails with \"Ahmad\" linked to the Zazi cell. In August 2009, Betim Kaziu, a U.S. citizen from Brooklyn, was convicted for attempting to join Al Qaeda-linked groups. He traveled to Cairo with a friend to join terrorist organizations but was apprehended in Kosovo. In July 2009, Daniel Boyd and others were charged with plotting to attack the Quantico Marine Base and conspiring to commit murder abroad. Boyd, along with seven others, were indicted for providing material support to terrorists and conspiring to murder persons abroad. The indictment alleges that Daniel Boyd, a U.S. citizen from North Carolina, is a veteran of terrorist training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan. He conspired with others to recruit and help young men travel overseas to engage in violent jihad. Boyd and other defendants provided material support to terrorists from 2006 to 2009. The indictment alleges that Daniel Boyd conspired to provide material support to terrorists and plotted to attack the Marine Corps Base at Quantico, Virginia. Charges included conspiracy to murder U.S. military personnel and possession of weapons in furtherance of a crime of violence. The superseding indictment alleges that Daniel Boyd conspired to provide material support to terrorists and plotted to attack the Marine Corps Base in Quantico. Boyd undertook reconnaissance of the base and possessed armor-piercing ammunition to \"attack the Americans.\" Bajram Asilani was also charged as a member of the conspiracy but was denied extradition to the United States. In 2011, several individuals including Daniel Boyd, Zakariya Boyd, Dylan Boyd, Hassan, Yaghi, Sherifi, Shkumbin, Nevine Aly Elshiekh, and Subasic were found guilty or pled guilty to various charges related to providing material support to terrorists and conspiring to murder, kidnap, maim, and injure persons abroad. Kosovo does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. Sherifi was also found guilty of conspiring to kill witnesses in his case. Abdulhakim Muhammad was arrested for a shooting at a military recruiting center in Little Rock, Arkansas, killing one soldier and wounding another. He was found with multiple firearms in his possession and later pled guilty to charges to avoid the death penalty. Muhammad referred to the shooting as a \"Jihadi Attack.\" Abdulhakim Muhammad, who carried out a shooting at a military recruiting center in Little Rock, Arkansas, claimed ties to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and considered himself a soldier for them. His family described him as a \"happy-go-lucky\" teen who became a \"deeply observant Muslim in college.\" In letters to the press, Muhammad stated that the shooting was his way of supporting Muslims in a war against Islam. Abdulhakim Muhammad carried out a shooting in June 2009, claiming it was in support of Muslims in a war against Islam. He spent time in Yemen, where he married and taught English before being deported to the US. The FBI had interviewed him before the shooting. In May 2009, the FBI and NYPD arrested four men for plotting to bomb a Bronx synagogue and Jewish Center while also targeting Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, New York. The explosives they intended to use were fake, supplied by undercover agents. The FBI's investigation into Abdulhakim Muhammad's ties to extremist groups in Yemen was inconclusive, leading to insufficient evidence for surveillance. The four suspects arrested for plotting to bomb a Bronx synagogue and Jewish Center and targeting Stewart Air National Guard Base were supplied fake explosives by undercover agents. They were described as petty criminals acting alone, not linked to any terrorist organization. Three were U.S.-born citizens and one was a Haitian immigrant, with at least three being jailhouse converts to Islam. An FBI cooperating witness played a key role in helping them obtain explosives and missile components for the planned attacks. The Newburgh Four, a group of petty criminals, planned to attack a synagogue, Jewish community center, and Air National Guard base with fake explosives provided by an FBI informant. They purchased weapons and explosives with the informant's help, raising doubts about their capability to carry out the terrorist plot without his involvement. The Newburgh Four, a group of struggling petty criminals, bonded at a mosque and were influenced by a Pakistani immigrant seeking leniency. They demonstrated intent to commit terror but were portrayed more as aimless individuals than serious terrorists. The informant, Hussain, had a history of assisting the government in similar cases. The informant, Hussain, played a key role in two cases involving persuading individuals to participate in fake terror plots. He recruited Muslim contacts, spun elaborate tales, and provided resources and cash incentives. The trial of the four individuals began on August 24, 2010 after delays due to prosecutors failing to turn over information. In June 2010, prosecutors failed to turn over a 2008 FBI memorandum to defense attorneys in the case of the Newburgh Four. The memorandum stated that the alleged leader, James Cromitie, would pose no danger without the assistance of an informant. Despite arguments of entrapment, the jury convicted the four on October 18, 2010. In 2008, Bryant Vinas, an American Muslim convert, was indicted for conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals, supporting Al Qaeda, and receiving training from them. He admitted to meeting Al Qaeda leaders, attending training courses, and firing rockets at a U.S. military base in Afghanistan. Vinas cooperated with counterterrorism officials after being extradited to the U.S. Bryant Vinas, an American Muslim convert, participated in firing rockets at a U.S. military base in Afghanistan. Despite intending to hit the base and kill American soldiers, the rockets missed. He also provided detailed information about the Long Island Railroad system to Al Qaeda leaders for a potential bomb attack. Vinas' cooperation led to a security alert in November 2008 and enhanced security on the New York commuter rail system. His arrest was kept secret until his indictment was unsealed in July 2009 due to the valuable information he provided to U.S. counterterrorism authorities. Bryant Vinas, a Muslim convert, assisted U.S. forces in targeting Al Qaeda camps with drone attacks and provided information on Al Qaeda training in various illegal activities. Raised as a Catholic, he joined the Army post-9/11 but was discharged before completing training. Vinas converted to Islam after meeting a Muslim convert and became influenced by extremist ideologies, eventually joining the Islamic Thinkers Society in New York. Bryant Vinas, a Muslim convert, joined the Islamic Thinkers Society in New York, reportedly supportive of Al Qaeda. He became involved in a plot to bomb a jet fuel artery at JFK Airport in 2007, led by Russell Defreitas and involving Abdul Kadir, Kareem Ibrahim, and Abdel Nur. Four individuals, including Abdel Nur, were arrested for a conspiracy to attack a 40-mile pipeline in the United States. The FBI stated that the plot was in the planning stages and there was debate over its seriousness. The pipeline runs from Linden, New Jersey, to Brooklyn, with safety measures making it difficult to damage. Despite this, officials described the plot as chilling and potentially catastrophic if carried out. Safety experts criticized the government's description of the plot as a \"fantasy,\" stating that causing the intended explosion was virtually impossible. The alleged conspirators were detected through CIA information, leading to a 16-month sting operation focused on Defreitas' activities at the airport. Defreitas conducted surveillance of fuel tanks and security measures, unaware of an accomplice's presence. Defreitas was part of a terror plot to attack JFK airport, unaware that a law enforcement informant was recording his conversations. The informant gathered critical information on the alleged plot through recordings, documents, and videos. NYPD detectives arrested a man in the Bronx for possession of $2 million in cocaine. The man had prior drug convictions and cooperated with authorities for leniency. Two defendants were convicted of conspiring to commit acts of terrorism, while another pled guilty to supporting terrorism. Defreitas and Kadir were convicted for their involvement in the terror plot. In August 2010, Defreitas, Kadir, and Kareem Ibrahim were convicted for their involvement in a terrorism plot. In May 2011, Ibrahim was convicted separately. Six men were arrested in May 2007 for a plot against Fort Dix in New Jersey. Five were found guilty of conspiring to kill military personnel, receiving life sentences, while one received a 33-year sentence. Another man pled guilty to a lesser charge. The group had no known connection to foreign terrorist organizations and were arrested after a 16-month FBI operation. Two men in Mount Laurel, Pennsylvania dropped off an 8-millimeter tape showing them firing rifles and shouting Islamic battle cries to be converted to a DVD by a store clerk. The clerk alerted police, leading to a 15-month investigation involving FBI agents and informants. The suspects were recorded in hundreds of conversations, resulting in guilty verdicts for Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer and Dritan \"Tony\" Duka for conspiracy to kill military personnel. Shnewer was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Eljvir and Shain Duka, illegal immigrants from Yugoslavia, were found guilty of conspiracy to kill military personnel and possession of firearms. They were sentenced to life in prison without parole.

In December 2006, Derrick Shareef, an American Muslim convert, was arrested in Rockford, Illinois, for attempting to acquire hand grenades and a handgun to attack a shopping mall. Derrick Shareef, an American Muslim convert, attempted to swap stereo speakers for hand grenades, a handgun, and ammunition with an undercover FBI agent. He planned to set off hand grenades at a shopping mall near Rockford in December 2006. Shareef was charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and maliciously damage property. The FBI began the case in September 2006 with a cooperating witness who had converted to Islam in prison. Derrick Shareef, a Muslim convert, confided in an acquaintance about his plans to commit violent acts of jihad, including shooting a judge and attacking buildings in Illinois. Unbeknownst to Shareef, the acquaintance was secretly recording their conversations. Shareef expressed a desire to obtain weapons for his plans, and the acquaintance introduced him to an undercover FBI agent posing as a weapons supplier. Derrick Shareef, a Muslim convert, plotted a grenade attack at the CherryVale mall with an undercover FBI agent. Shareef made video tapes expressing his willingness to give his life for jihad. He was arrested after exchanging speakers for dud grenades and a handgun. Shareef believed his arrest was a blessing from Allah as it stopped him from carrying out the attack. Derrick Shareef, a Muslim convert, viewed his arrest by the FBI as a blessing from Allah because it prevented him from carrying out a grenade attack at the CherryVale mall. He pled guilty to attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and was sentenced to 35 years in prison. In November 2006, four men conspired to support the Taliban and engage in battlefield jihad. Four men were accused of preparing to join the Taliban for battlefield jihad by engaging in firearms and paramilitary training in Texas.

One of the men, Kobie Diallo Williams, pled guilty to conspiring to possess firearms unlawfully and supporting the Taliban. Several Pakistani nationals studying in the US were convicted on firearms charges, including Syed Maaz Shah, Shiraz Syed Qazi, and Adnan Baber Mirza. The Liberty City Seven were arrested for plotting to bomb the Sears Tower in Chicago in June 2006. The Liberty City Seven, including U.S. citizens and individuals from Haiti, were charged with conspiracy to support Al Qaeda, plot to bomb the Sears Tower in Chicago, and wage war against the U.S. Batiste intended to recruit and train individuals for this mission, seeking support from Al Qaeda. Batiste detailed his mission to wage a 'full ground war' against the United States to 'kill all the devils we can,' with a plan to surpass 9/11 by targeting the Sears Tower. The arrests stemmed from an investigation involving FBI informants providing support and resources to the conspirators, including money, meeting places, surveillance equipment, and cell phones. Defense attorneys for the Liberty City Seven men are involved in the case. Defense attorneys for the Liberty City Seven men claimed government entrapment in the case of alleged terrorism plot. Multiple trials were held, resulting in convictions for some defendants and acquittals for others. Narseal Batiste, the alleged ringleader, was sentenced to 13-1/2 years in prison. In November 2011, a federal appeals court upheld the convictions of five men involved in a terrorism plot. Ehsanul Islam Sadequee and Syed Haris Ahmed, residents of Atlanta, were charged in April 2006 for conspiracy to support a terrorist organization and lying to the FBI. They discussed violent jihad online and planned terrorist acts, leading to their arrest. Sadequee and Ahmed were accused of traveling to Canada to discuss potential terrorist targets with the \"Toronto 18,\" a group alleged to be an Islamic terrorist cell. They also videotaped targets in Washington, DC, and sent the videos to individuals associated with Al Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba. In August 2009, two men were convicted in Great Britain for terrorism-related offenses. Sadequee received a 17-year sentence, while Ahmed received 13 years. In March 2006, Mohammed Reza Taheri-Azar attempted vehicular murder at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, citing revenge for Muslim deaths caused by the United States.

The FBI credited the Muslim and Arab American community for alerting them to the suspects' radical views. Three Toledo men were sentenced for conspiring to commit terrorist acts and providing material support to terrorists. Two cousins from Illinois, connected to the Toledo men, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to support terrorists. The cousins discussed terror tactics and were willing to travel abroad for attacks. One cousin was sentenced to 10 years in prison. On July 12, 2010, Zubair Ahmed was sentenced to 10 years in prison, while Khaleel Ahmed received an 8-year, 4-month sentence for their involvement in a plot to attack targets in Southern California. In August 2005, Kevin James, Levar Haley Washington, Gregory Vernon Patterson, and Hammad Riaz Samana were arrested for planning to attack Jewish institutions and other targets in Los Angeles. Kevin James, the leader, was sentenced to 16 years in prison, while Levar Washington received a 22-year sentence. Kevin James, the leader of a group planning attacks in Los Angeles, was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Gregory Patterson received an additional 22-year sentence for related charges. Hammad Samana, a U.S. resident from Pakistan, was sentenced to 70 months for his involvement. James founded a group called Jam'iyyat Ul-Islam Is-Saheeh based on his interpretation of Islam. James, the leader of a group planning attacks in Los Angeles, supported the establishment of an Islamic Caliphate in the U.S. and advocated for Jihad as a defensive battle against theological imposters. He recruited Washington in prison, who then recruited Patterson and Samana at a mosque in California. The men engaged in firearms and physical training in preparation for attacks. The defendants engaged in firearms training and physical training in preparation for attacks in Los Angeles. They attempted to acquire weapons for their terrorist conspiracy and raised money by robbing gas stations. The indictment states that they robbed gas stations armed with shotguns in various cities in Southern California. The FBI linked funds from the robberies to the purchase of a .223 caliber rifle by one of the defendants. The men were arrested after one of them dropped his cell phone at the scene of a robbery. Police connected the robberies to a larger terror plot after searching the defendants' belongings. In Lodi, California, Umer Hayat and Hamid Hayat were arrested for lying to the FBI about the son's attendance at a terrorist training camp in Pakistan. Hamid Hayat was found guilty of providing material support to terrorists and making false statements to the FBI. Prosecutors alleged that he attended a jihadi training camp in Pakistan and returned to the US with the intent to wage violent jihad. Umer Hayat confessed to attending a terrorist training camp but later claimed his admissions were fabricated to appease FBI agents. The trial relied on his contested confession and conversations taped by an FBI informant. Evidence showed that Hayat pledged his belief in violent jihad and planned to attend a jihadi training camp after Ramadan in 2003. In 2006, Hamid Hayat was sentenced to 24 years in prison for planning to attend a jihadi training camp. His father, Umer Hayat, faced trial for making false statements about terrorist training camps in Pakistan. In August 2004, two Albany, New York residents, Yassin M. Aref and Mohammed Mosharref Hossain, were convicted of conspiring to aid a terrorist group and provide support for a weapon of mass destruction. They were sentenced to 15 years in prison after a sting operation by the FBI. Aref is a refugee from Iraqi Kurdistan and Hossain is an immigrant from Bangladesh. The informant befriended Hossain, who had financial troubles with his pizza business. The informant, facing legal issues, proposed a scheme to launder money through Hossain's businesses by selling a missile for a fictitious assassination plot. The Kurdish Imam, Yassin Aref, was involved in witnessing the transactions, although he was the ultimate target of the sting operation. The sting operation targeted Yassin Aref, who was initially believed to be connected to a terrorist group based on a notebook found in Iraq. However, a translation error was later admitted by federal prosecutors, changing the significance of the evidence. The heart of the case focused on Aref and Hossain's involvement in the fake plot despite knowing its illegitimacy. Aref and Hossain were arrested on August 5, 2004, on a 19-count indictment charging them with money laundering and providing material support to a Pakistani terrorist group. Despite maintaining their innocence and claims of entrapment, the case sparked controversy with Pakistan protesting the FBI sting operation. Local newspapers and columnists criticized the prosecution, and there were calls for leniency at the time of sentencing. After their arrest in 2004, Aref and Hossain faced a 19-count indictment for money laundering and supporting a terrorist group. The case drew criticism, with inmates vouching for their character and claims of illegal surveillance. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court's ruling. Days before the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, James Elshafay and Shahawar Matin Siraj were arrested for plotting to bomb the Herald Square subway station. The investigation was led by the NYPD's Intelligence Division with the help of a paid informant, Osama Eldawoody, who recorded Siraj discussing the plot. Elshafay cooperated with the government and pled guilty. Elshafay cooperated with the government, pled guilty, and testified against Siraj in the trial. He revealed his struggles with mental health issues and was sentenced to five years in prison. Siraj rejected a plea agreement, claiming entrapment by the police informant. Prosecutors presented evidence of Siraj's approval of suicide bombings and ties to Osama bin Laden. The jury ultimately rejected the entrapment defense. The jury convicted Siraj on four counts of conspiracy, including plotting to bomb a public transportation system. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Iyman Faris, a U.S. citizen, pled guilty to casing the Brooklyn Bridge for Al Qaeda and providing information for possible attacks on U.S. targets. He researched \"gas cutters\" and sent coded messages indicating his unsuccessful attempts to obtain necessary equipment. Iyman Faris, a U.S. citizen, traveled to New York City in late 2002 to examine the Brooklyn Bridge for Al Qaeda. He concluded that the plot to destroy the bridge was unlikely to succeed due to security measures. In early 2003, he sent a coded message indicating the plot's failure. Faris was sentenced to 20 years in prison after being linked to Al Qaeda by Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Mohammed's capture in Pakistan led to the discovery of Faris' involvement through coded emails. Faris was linked to Al Qaeda by Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who revealed his name during interrogations by U.S. authorities. Faris acknowledged his involvement in a failed plot to bring down the Brooklyn Bridge. In March 2003, FBI agents convinced Faris to cooperate with the government, leading to his secret detention. He later assisted law enforcement by sending messages to his superiors while in a safe house in Virginia. Abu Ali was convicted on nine terrorism charges in 2005, including conspiracy to assassinate President George W. Bush and providing support to Al Qaeda. He was arrested in Saudi Arabia in 2003 and held for 20 months without charges. FBI agents participated in his interrogations, and he was later indicted in the United States. Abu Ali was convicted on terrorism charges in 2005, including conspiracy to assassinate President George W. Bush. The case was based on evidence from Saudi authorities, including a videotaped confession. Discussions with co-conspirators included options for assassinating President Bush. Abu Ali's attorneys claimed he confessed under duress. Abu Ali was convicted on terrorism charges in 2005, including conspiracy to assassinate President George W. Bush based on a videotaped confession. Despite claims of coercion, the judge, jury, and appellate court upheld the conviction. Abu Ali's sentence was increased to life in prison, which he is serving at the federal \"Supermax\" prison in Florence, Colorado. In a separate incident, eleven men from Northern Virginia were charged with various offenses related to a jihadist network in June 2003. In June 2003, eleven men from Northern Virginia were accused of being part of a jihadist network planning holy war. Four pled guilty, while seven faced additional charges, including supporting terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba. Additional charges were brought against two more residents in 2004 and 2005. Ali al-Timimi, the alleged spiritual leader, was also indicted. Ali al-Timimi, the alleged spiritual leader of a jihadist group in Virginia, was found guilty in 2005 on 10 counts, including conspiring to levy war against the United States. The key evidence was a meeting he attended in Fairfax, Virginia, where he encouraged followers to join violent jihad in Afghanistan. Despite claims of free speech, the jury rejected this argument, and the judge stated that the case did not violate al-Timimi's First Amendment rights. Ali Asad Chandia, a former teacher at a Muslim school in Maryland, was charged as part of the Virginia Jihad Network conspiracy for assisting a LeT operative in procuring military equipment. Chandia allied with the operative during a trip to Pakistan and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

Hasan Akbar, born Mark Fidel Kools, killed two U.S. Army officers and wounded 14 others at Camp Pennsylvania in Kuwait. He shut off the camp's generator, threw grenades into tents, and opened fire with an M-4 rifle. Akbar, a University of California, Davis graduate, joined the Army in 1998. The attack's motivations have been linked to recent reprimands for insubordination. Criminal investigators reported that Hasan Akbar, previously reprimanded for insubordination, attacked his unit in Kuwait. His attorney argued that Akbar's actions were driven by concerns about the invasion of Iraq and mental illness. Akbar expressed feeling humiliated by his fellow soldiers in a diary entry. On April 22, 2005, Hasan Akbar was convicted of premeditated murder and attempted murder by a military jury at Fort Bragg. He was sentenced to death one week later, becoming the first American since the Vietnam era to be prosecuted for murdering a fellow soldier during wartime. Additionally, six American citizens of Yemeni descent, known as the Lackawanna Six, were arrested in September 2002 for providing material support to a terrorist organization. The \"Lackawanna Six\" were American citizens arrested for providing support to a terrorist organization. They traveled to Afghanistan for training at Al Farooq camp, where they learned to use automatic weapons. The Lackawanna Six were trained in the use of weapons at Al Farooq camp, met Osama bin Laden, and came to authorities' attention in 2001 after a letter mentioned their travel to meet bin Laden. Sahim Alwan claimed he went to Pakistan for religious training, while Mukhtar Al-Bakri's email raised suspicions of a potential terrorist attack. The Lackawanna Six were suspected of being a sleeper cell after intelligence suggested they were targets of an Al Qaeda recruitment operation. Al-Bakri's admission during an FBI interview led to the arrest of the group on September 13, 2002. Sahim Alwan, one of the members, was described as a college-educated, married man with three children. Alwan, a member of the Lackawanna Six, begged to return home after meeting with bin Laden at Al Farooq camp. He delivered a videotape of the USS Cole bombing to Pakistan and confessed to the FBI, pleading guilty to terrorism support. Goba, another member, trained with firearms and rocket-propelled grenades. In December 2003, Goba, Mosed, Taher, and Galab were sentenced to prison for providing material support to Al Qaeda. Goba admitted to training with firearms and explosives, while Galab acknowledged receiving weapons training at a camp where Osama bin Laden spoke. Mukhtar al-Bakri was arrested in Bahrain on his wedding night. Mukhtar al-Bakri was arrested on his wedding night in a hotel room in Manama, Bahrain. He confessed to training in weapons and explosives at an Al Qaeda camp, leading to charges against the Lackawanna men. He pled guilty to material support and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Kemal Derwish, implicated in the Lackawanna Six case, was deported from Saudi Arabia for alleged extremist activities. Kemal Derwish, deported in 1997 for alleged extremist activities, returned to Lackawanna in 1998 and influenced a group to train for jihad. He was killed in 2002 by a CIA Predator drone. Juma Al Dosari, a Muslim fighter from Saudi Arabia, also fought with Derwish in Bosnia and gave a sermon criticizing Arab governments. Juma Al Dosari, a Saudi Arabian fighter, left Lackawanna after 9/11 to join the Taliban in Afghanistan. He was captured, declared an enemy combatant, and sent to Guantanamo Bay. His interrogation revealed information about the Lackawanna Six being targeted by Al Qaeda. After five years in detention, he was released to Saudi Arabia with no charges. Jaber A. Elbaneh, a Yemeni American, also trained at Al Farooq camp and expressed willingness to fight with the Taliban. Jose Padilla, a former Chicago gang member and convert to Islam, was arrested in May 2002 for suspicion of planning a \"dirty bomb\" attack in the U.S. He was declared an \"enemy combatant\" and charged with providing support to Al Qaeda. Padilla never returned to the U.S. after a trip to Afghanistan and fled to Yemen, where he is currently in custody. Extradition to the U.S. is uncertain due to the lack of a treaty with Yemen. Jose Padilla, a former Chicago gang member and convert to Islam, was the first American citizen arrested on U.S. soil to be declared an \"enemy combatant.\" He was held indefinitely without trial, leading to a legal battle between the Bush Administration, Padilla's attorneys, and civil liberties groups. The constitutional issues revolved around the President's authority to take extraordinary security measures that could infringe on a citizen's legal rights. Initial suspicions about Padilla were based on information from Abu Zubaydah, a senior Al Qaeda official in American custody. Intelligence agents linked the name given by Abu Zubaydah to Jose Padilla, a Latin American man with a Muslim name. Padilla was confirmed by Abu Zubaydah and remained in custody for one month before being released due to laws protecting U.S. citizens from indefinite detention. President George W. Bush approved Padilla's situation on June 9, 2002. President George W. Bush reclassified Jose Padilla as an \"enemy combatant\" on June 9, 2002, preventing him from facing trial in civilian courts. Padilla was then held incommunicado at a South Carolina naval base for over 3-1/2 years, mostly in solitary confinement. Attorney General John Ashcroft initially claimed Padilla was involved in a terrorist plot to detonate a dirty bomb in the U.S., but later reports suggested otherwise. The FBI's investigation found no evidence that Jose Padilla had begun preparations for a \"dirty bomb\" attack in the United States, and there was little reason to believe he had support from Al Qaeda. The case was considered weak and needed more investigative work. DOJ responded to a request for information on American citizens held as enemy combatants. The government's case against Jose Padilla was largely based on his own statements made during interrogation in military custody, which Deputy Attorney General James Comey claimed were corroborated by other sources. Comey detailed Padilla's travels and meetings with Al Qaeda officials, as well as terrorist plots discussed, including attacks using natural gas and a dirty bomb. The government could not prosecute Padilla through the criminal justice system initially. The government could not prosecute Padilla through the criminal justice system initially due to concerns about intelligence sources. Padilla's interrogation was focused on gathering information about Al Qaeda and threats to the United States. After being declared an enemy combatant, Padilla's habeas corpus petition was initially dismissed by the Supreme Court. However, a new petition filed in the U.S. District Court for South Carolina led to a ruling that his detention was unlawful. The government appealed to the Fourth Circuit, which ultimately reversed the decision in September 2005. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision, allowing the president to detain enemy combatants under the Authorization of Use of Military Force. Padilla filed a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court, but criminal charges were suddenly filed against him in Miami. The new indictment charged Padilla with being part of a \"North American support cell\" for violent jihad campaigns. The government asked the Fourth Circuit to vacate its decision upholding Padilla's confinement, but the court refused. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to vacate its decision upholding Padilla's confinement and transfer from military to civilian custody. Judge Luttig criticized the government for using different facts to justify holding Padilla without charges and persuading a grand jury to indict him. Padilla's attorneys argued that his psychological damage from abuse and isolation made him incompetent to stand trial, but the judge denied the motion. Padilla was convicted in September 2006. Padilla was convicted in September 2006 along with two co-defendants of conspiracy to murder, kidnap, and maim people in a foreign country. He was sentenced to 17 years and four months in prison, which was later deemed too lenient by the United States Court of Appeals. In October 2001, the Portland Seven group planned to travel to Afghanistan to fight against the US Armed Forces and conducted weapons training in Washington. In Washington, October Martinique Lewis admitted to transferring funds to assist her ex-husband, a member of the \"Portland Seven\" group known as Katibat al Mawt. The group, led by Habis Abdulla Al Saoub, planned to fight against the US Armed Forces in Afghanistan. Other members included Patrice Lumumba Ford, Ahmed Ibrahim Bilal, Muhammad Ibrahim Bilal, and Jeffrey Leon Battle. Ford, a US citizen who converted to Islam, had previously expressed anti-Semitic views. The \"Portland Seven\" group consisted of American-born brothers of Saudi descent, a former cosmetics salesman, a software engineer, and others. They were first noticed by law enforcement during shooting practice in Washington. The FBI later linked a confidential informant, Khalid Mustafa, with one of the group members, Jeffrey Battle. Khalid Mustafa, a former criminal turned FBI informant, befriended Jeffrey Battle at a mosque and recorded conversations about the group's trip to China. Battle discussed retaliating against Jews in Portland. Email exchanges among the Portland Seven members further confirmed the conspiracy, with evidence obtained through the USA PATRIOT Act. Prosecutors taped 271 conversations and obtained 31 orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance. In October 2002, five men were indicted on charges related to aiding Al Qaeda. Maher Hawash was arrested in March 2003 and charged with conspiring to join the Taliban. Hawash pled guilty in 2003 and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Muhammad and Ahmed Bilal also pled guilty in 2003. In early 2009, Muhammad and Ahmed Bilal pled guilty to conspiracy to support the Taliban and federal weapons charges, receiving 8- and 10-year sentences. Martinique Lewis pled guilty to money laundering for aiding her ex-husband in supporting the Taliban, receiving a three-year sentence. Jeffrey Battle and Patrice Lumumba Ford admitted to a conspiracy to wage war against the US by attempting to travel to Afghanistan to fight alongside the Taliban. The conspiracy involved individuals planning to travel to Afghanistan to fight alongside Al Qaeda and the Taliban against American and allied forces. They received 18-year prison terms. Habis al Saoub, who joined an Al Qaeda cell, was killed by Pakistani forces in Afghanistan in October 2003."
