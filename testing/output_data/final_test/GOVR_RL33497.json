They are discussing governance, power-sharing, property, EU, economy, security, and guarantees. Aides meet to record agreements. Christofias accuses Talat of pushing for a confederation instead of a federation, which Talat denies. They also disagree on how a united Cyprus will be formed. The Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots differ on the formation of a united Cyprus, with disagreements on governance, power-sharing, and executive powers. Greek Cypriots propose a rotating presidency between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, while Turkish Cypriots advocate for a new state. The executive council will consist of six Greek Cypriots and three Turkish Cypriots, with decisions made by a simple majority including at least one member from each community. A conflict resolution committee will involve the president, vice president, and one minister from each side, aiming to reach unanimous solutions. If consensus is not reached, decisions will be made by majority vote, with the president having the final say. Talat suggests having two alternating presidents elected by the Senate, opposing a single list of candidates elected by all. Christofias emphasizes the right of the legal owner to decide on property issues, especially for Greek Cypriots who lost properties in the north. Talat prioritizes current inhabitants in property disputes, suggesting compensation, exchange, and restitution. Cypriot Foreign Minister believes EU can provide security guarantees, while Turkish Cypriots insist on reaffirming 1960 Treaties of Guarantee and Alliance for security. Greek Cypriots question Talat's negotiation freedom. The Greek Cypriots claim Talat is not free to negotiate, while Talat insists he is not controlled by Turkey. Confidence-building measures have been agreed upon, including ambulances crossing in emergencies and a U.N. Development Program project on water-saving. Dervis Eroglu made a political comeback in 2008. Dervis Eroglu, chairman of the opposition National Unity Party in northern Cyprus, emphasized the need for negotiations based on the reality of two equal sovereign states. He criticized Talat for accepting a single sovereignty and citizenship for Cyprus. In the 2009 parliamentary elections, UBP won 26 out of 50 seats, securing a significant victory. The 2009 parliamentary elections in northern Cyprus resulted in the United Forces placing second with 15 seats, the Democratic Party third with 5 seats, the Communal Democracy Party fourth with two seats, and the Freedom and Reform Party fifth with two seats. The outcome was influenced by disenchantment with the settlement process, economic issues, and the government's failure to end international isolation. A new government is expected by mid-May, with Dervis Eroglu expressing support for negotiations but wanting to name someone to accompany the president at talks. Talat retains negotiation authority until April 2010, but the Turkish Cypriot parliament may face challenges in referring an agreement to a referendum. Turkey is likely to exert influence on Eroglu, as indicated by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's statement on the new government. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Turkish President Abdullah Gul expressed support for Talat in the negotiations process in northern Cyprus. The Democratic Party (DIKO) in Cyprus faced internal challenges after hard-line candidates won key positions, potentially leading to withdrawal from the coalition. President Christofias may encounter difficulties in gaining approval for his policies. In November 2008, incidents occurred in an exclusive economic zone declared by Cyprus with Egypt. Turkish warships confronted Panamanian-flagged ships conducting a survey for oil and gas reserves, leading to a dispute over sovereignty rights. Cyprus complained to the U.N. about Turkey's actions, while Turkey argued the research was within its continental shelf. In fall 2008, military exercises on Cyprus were cancelled by both Cypriot National Guard and Turks during ongoing talks for a settlement. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed support for U.N.-sponsored talks for reunification of Cyprus as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. Turkish Cypriots' isolation was linked to Turkish occupation by Greek Cypriot officials. President Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton expressed support for reunification efforts in Cyprus during their meetings with President Christofias, Turkish Grand National Assembly, Cypriot Foreign Minister Marcos Kyprianou, and Talat. They discussed the need for a more active U.N. role and lifting the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community. Clinton expressed support for reunification efforts in Cyprus and met with Kyprianou at the State Department. Some were dismayed by Gordon's comments on the Turkish presence in northern Cyprus. The Committee approved Gordon's appointment, but a Senate vote has been delayed. Cyprus gained independence from Great Britain in 1960. The Republic of Cyprus gained independence from Great Britain in 1960. The population consists of 77% Greek Cypriots, 18% Turkish Cypriots, and other ethnic groups. The constitution established power-sharing arrangements between the two main groups, with a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice president. Different aspirations for the future of Cyprus led to tensions between the Greek and Turkish communities. After gaining independence in 1960, tensions arose between Greek and Turkish Cypriots over differing aspirations for the future of Cyprus. President Makarios III's proposed constitutional changes in 1963 led to Turkish Cypriots withdrawing from national institutions and forming enclaves for safety. Intercommunal violence occurred in 1963-64 and 1967, prompting the establishment of the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus in 1964 to maintain peace between the two communities. In 1974, a military junta in Athens supported a coup against President Makarios in Cyprus, leading to Turkey's military intervention citing the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee. This resulted in widespread dislocation of the Cypriot population, political changes in Athens and Nicosia, Greece's withdrawal from NATO's military command, and Turkey's civilian government facing instability. After 1974, Turkish Cypriots sought a solution to keep the two communities separate in two sovereign states or a loose confederation. In 1983, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash declared the \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\" (TRNC), recognized only by Turkey. Denktash argued for independence as a prerequisite for federation with Greek Cypriots, ruling out merger with Turkey. U.N. negotiations aimed to reconcile interests and restore a central government but faced challenges. The Turkish Cypriots emphasized bizonality and political equality, while Greek Cypriots focused on freedoms of movement and settlement. They differed on achieving a federation, with Greek Cypriots wanting devolution of power and Turkish Cypriots preferring two entities joining in a new federation. These views impact property, citizenship, and legal issues. Numerous U.N.-sponsored negotiations since 1974 have failed to reach a settlement. Agreed on Cyprus as an independent, nonaligned, bicommunal, federal republic with discussions on territory control, freedom of movement, and central government powers. Talks between Cypriot President Spyros Kyprianou and Rauf Denktash focused on 1977 guidelines, territorial and constitutional issues, Varosha, and demilitarization. U.N. conducted indirect talks after the 1983 \"TRNC\" declaration. In 1983, the \"TRNC\" declaration led to U.N. proximity talks on constitutional arrangements, foreign troop withdrawal, and international treaties. President George Vassiliou and Denktash submitted papers hardening positions. U.N. Secretary-General proposed separate meetings in 1989, leading to draft ideas for an agreement in June. Turkish Cypriots argued against U.N. suggestions, preferring a document drafted by the parties. U.N. Security Council Resolution 649 in 1990 reaffirmed the Secretary-General's right to make suggestions for a bicommunal, bizonal federal solution. In June 1991, Perez de Cuellar called for an international meeting on Cyprus. President George H.W. Bush announced a U.N. conference, but it was not possible due to the Greek and Turkish Prime Ministers' inability to find common ground. Denktash's assertion of sovereignty for each side was blamed for the failure. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali presented a framework for a settlement in April 1992, suggesting a bizonal federation. The Secretary-General proposed a bizonal federation for Cyprus with two politically equal communities, each with a majority of the population and land in their area. The bicameral legislature would have a 70:30 ratio of Greek Cypriots to Turkish Cypriots in the lower house and a 50:50 ratio in the upper house. A 7:3 ratio would prevail in the federal executive. Turkish troops not foreseen in the 1960 Treaty of Alliance would withdraw, and a revised U.N. draft included separate referenda in each community, an 18-month transitional period, and guarantees consistent with CSCE principles. The Secretary-General proposed a bizonal federation for Cyprus with two politically equal communities, each with a majority of the population and land in their area. The proposal included various elements such as free movement, a time-table for the return of Greek Cypriot refugees and their property, vice-presidential veto power for Turkish Cypriots, and an island-wide referendum on European Community membership. Denktash and Vassiliou had differing estimates on the impact of the territorial proposal, with Denktash claiming it would displace 40,000 Turkish Cypriots and Vassiliou stating that 82,000 Greek Cypriots would be able to return home. Boutros-Ghali noted that Denktash's territorial ideas were not close to his \"non-map,\" but Vassiliou was willing to negotiate based on it. The Secretary-General proposed a bizonal federation for Cyprus with two politically equal communities. Denktash rejected territorial adjustment in line with the map, leading to a lack of progress. U.N. Security Council Resolution 774 endorsed the Set of Ideas. Glafcos Clerides accepted the Set of Ideas \"in principle\" and was elected president. Confidence-building measures were called for, including a reduction of Turkish troops and U.N. control of Varosha. Denktash and Clerides discussed bicommunal projects, a U.N.-supervised census, and cooperation in feasibility studies. They debated opening Varosha and Nicosia Airport, with disagreements over handing over Varosha. Denktash eventually agreed to confidence-building measures, but later criticized the draft as unbalanced. The Secretary-General's report supported the draft as balanced. Boutros-Ghali blamed Turkish Cypriots' lack of political will for the lack of agreement on the March draft. Denktash initially agreed to CBMs with improvements, but Clerides refused to negotiate beyond the March 21 document. Boutros-Ghali planned to implement CBMs based on the March paper and requested Security Council endorsement, but neither side accepted. In January 1997, Cyprus contracted to purchase S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia, prompting a joint defense declaration by Turkey and Denktash. In response to Cyprus contracting to purchase S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Denktash signed a joint defense declaration, with Turkey conducting exercises in northern Cyprus. The air base at Paphos became operational for Greek fighters, leading to tensions as Turkey sent its planes to northern Cyprus. Cypriot troops completed S-300 training in Russia, but ultimately decided not to deploy the missiles after international pressure and U.N. Security Council Resolution 1218. In December 2007, Cyprus transferred S-300 missiles to Greece in exchange for TOR M1 and SUZANA missile systems. Secretary-General Annan called for talks between Clerides and Denktash. Turkish and Greek Cypriots exchanged visits and held bicommunal events. Joint military exercises were conducted without overflying Cyprus. Military exercises are usually held when settlement progress stalls. Clerides and Denktash met at Troutbeck under U.N. auspices. Denktash refused to sign documents until the EU suspended accession negotiations with the Cypriot government. After the EU's decision to begin talks with Cyprus, Denktash ended intercommunal talks and called for negotiations between sovereign, equal states. The TRNC suspended bicommunal activities except religious pilgrimages. Denktash and Demirel called for talks only between states with equal status and emphasized the special relationship between Turkey and the TRNC. On June 20, 1999, the G-8 summit urged the Secretary-General to invite Cypriot leaders to negotiate without preconditions. The Security Council called for comprehensive negotiations with all issues on the table and good faith negotiations until a settlement is reached. Proximity talks began in December 1999, aiming for a bicommunal, bizonal federation in Cyprus. The Turkish Cypriots interpreted a UN resolution as a step towards recognition of their state, causing tension with the Greek Cypriots. Denktash linked his attendance at talks to proving UNFICYP needed Turkish Cypriot cooperation, leading to Turkish forces setting up a checkpoint outside Strovilia. In a Cypriot village in the no-man's land, UNFICYP forces were blocked by a Turkish checkpoint. Annan emphasized the equal status of parties in a comprehensive settlement, with Denktash pleased but Clerides boycotting talks until U.N. resolutions were considered. Annan proposed a common state with self-governed component states and the return of territory to Greek. The curr_chunk discusses the rejection of proposed views by Denktash regarding the Cyprus issue, leading to his withdrawal from talks. Despite an invitation for a meeting with the Secretary-General, Denktash did not agree due to the lack of established foundation. Clerides accepted the invitation, and a face-to-face meeting between Clerides and Denktash took place on December 4. On December 4, Clerides and Denktash met for the first time since 1997, agreeing to direct talks with no preconditions. Clerides visited Denktash's residence, the first Cypriot president to do so since 1974. They agreed to intensive peace talks starting on January 21 at Nicosia Airport. Annan's report noted the potential for a comprehensive settlement, but differences remained on sovereignty and the future state of Cyprus. On September 16, Denktash proposed Belgium and Switzerland as models for foreign and domestic affairs in a new state or continuation of the Republic of Cyprus. The Annan Plan, presented on November 11, 2002, suggested a \"common state\" government with relations modeled on the Swiss federal example, single international legal personality, and participation in foreign and EU relations like Belgium. It included a Parliament with two 48-seat houses, equal representation in the Senate for each state, and allocation of seats in the Chamber of Deputies based on population. The Annan Plan proposed a \"common state\" government with a Presidential Council, rotating presidency, limits on Greek and Turkish troops, UN peacekeepers, demilitarization, co-presidents during transition, single Cypriot citizenship, property return or compensation provisions, and reduction of Turkish Cypriot territory to 28.5% of the island. Greek Cypriot concerns included power-sharing, transition period length, repatriation, and Turkish settler population. Turkish Cypriots criticized sovereignty, water resources, territory loss, displacement, and Greek Cypriot return. Annan's revised Plan reduced foreign troops, settlers, increased returning Greek Cypriots, but decreased their movement into Turkish Cypriot territory. Clerides and National Council were in Copenhagen, while Denktash was in Ankara for medical care. Founding Agreement was not signed by December 12. Turkish Cypriots demonstrated for EU membership and a reunified island based on the U.N. Plan between November 2002 and February 2003. Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for heeding the people's wishes and criticized the policies of the past. Talks between Denktash and Clerides took place from January 15 to mid-February 2003. Greece and Turkey began security talks related to Cyprus on February 21. Annan presented his third revised plan on February 26, which included a British offer to transfer land to both Greek and Turkish Cypriots if they agreed to the plan. The Annan Plan proposed revisions to the territorial division in Cyprus, with Turkish Cypriots retaining the Karpass Peninsula and Greek Cypriots settling there as well. The plan also included provisions for the return of Greek Cypriots to the north and an increase in the number of Turkish settlers allowed on the island. Despite efforts by Annan to facilitate separate referenda on the Plan, the negotiations ultimately failed due to concerns about gaps in legislation, security provisions, and the need for a referendum campaign. The negotiations on the Annan Plan failed due to disagreements on key points, with Denktash objecting to the Plan and refusing to put it to a referendum. Despite efforts to continue negotiations until March 28 and hold referenda on April 6, an agreement could not be reached before Cyprus signed the EU accession treaty on April 16. Denktash was blamed for the failure by Annan and the UN Security Council, leading to discussions on amending the Plan as a basis for further negotiations. On April 23, the Turkish Cypriot administration opened border checkpoints, leading to millions of border crossings with few incidents. Papadopoulos expressed readiness to negotiate based on the Annan Plan with improvements. Denktash, however, refused to discuss. Annan reiterated the need for finalizing negotiations based on his 2003 Plan. Denktash later acknowledged the Annan Plan was still on the table. On January 23, the Turkish National Security Council reiterated its determination to reach a solution with the Plan as a reference. Prime Minister Erdogan expressed Turkey's desire to resume talks and hold referenda before Cyprus joined the EU on May 1. Talks between Papadopoulos and Denktash failed to revise the Plan, leading to disagreements. Denktash refused to attend follow-on talks in Switzerland and declared his opposition to an accord. Mehmet Ali Talat represented northern Cyprus in negotiations. On March 29, Annan presented a final revised Plan for Cyprus, including a Presidential Council with rotating leadership, limits on Greek Cypriot population in the north, and reductions in Turkish military forces. The Plan was set for referenda on April 24, but Papadopoulos rejected it on April 7 citing various concerns. Papadopoulos expressed doubts about the Turkish parliament ratifying the settlement plan for Cyprus. He believed Turkish Cypriots would benefit immediately, while Greek Cypriots would only see gains in the future. Concerns included restrictions on Greek Cypriot property acquisition in northern Cyprus, denial of political rights for Greek Cypriot returnees, and insecurity due to Turkish troop presence. Economic viability, impact on Greek Cypriot standard of living, and doubts about true reunification were also raised. Papadopoulos preferred a solution for Cyprus after its EU accession to gain leverage over Turkey. The U.N., EU, and U.S. criticized his speech as propaganda against the Plan. Greek PM Karamanlis endorsed the Plan with reservations. Denktash rejected it, while Talat called for a \"yes\" vote. The Turkish government supported the Plan. The U.S. and Britain proposed a U.N. Security Council resolution to address security concerns, but Russia vetoed it on April 21. On April 21, Russia vetoed a draft related to the Annan Plan for Cyprus, citing the need for further discussion before the referenda. Greek Cypriot voters rejected the Plan, while Turkish Cypriot voters accepted it. Turkish Cypriot leader Talat called for an end to northern Cyprus's isolation to attract foreign investment, emphasizing reunification over seeking international recognition for the TRNC. Greek Cypriot officials opposed direct flights and exports from the north, arguing it would not contribute to reunification. In his May 28, 2004 Report, Annan emphasized the need for Greek Cypriots to show willingness for reunification through a bicommunal federation. He called for the elimination of restrictions isolating Turkish Cypriots and stressed the importance of bold political leadership on both sides of the island, as well as in Greece and Turkey, to negotiate and compromise for a solution. Annan criticized Papadopoulos for inaccuracies in his Report and the Security Council did not endorse it due to Russian objections on behalf of the Greek Cypriots. Annan stated in his September 24 Report that there was no basis for resuming his mission, as Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders had ceased contacts. Erdogan indicated readiness to resume talks, and Annan urged Papadopoulos to outline changes he wanted in the Plan. Papadopoulos emphasized the need for the Greek Cypriot side to detail changes in the U.N. settlement plan to show political will for a resolution. He rejected further mediation by the U.N. Secretary-General and stressed the importance of well-prepared talks with a reasonable expectation of success. Annan expressed concern over lack of progress and criticized Greek Cypriot litigation against property buyers in the north. The European Court of Human Rights case against Turkey poses a threat to relationships and reconciliation. Annan disputed the idea of Turkish troop reinforcement. Prendergast reported lack of mutual confidence and compromise in Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey. Papadopoulos wanted to reopen issues in the Annan Plan. Talat criticized the EU's bias towards the Greek Cypriot side. The Greek Cypriot side is in the EU, leading to concerns about bias. Annan concluded it's not the right time for a full-time mediator. Turkey proposed a 10-point Action Plan, including opening ports and airports, but it was rejected by the Greek Cypriot government. On February 5, 2006, Papadopoulos reiterated conditions for resuming talks with no mediation, timetables, and a referendum on a solution. Talat responded on February 23 that resolution required a deadline and arbitration. Annan and Papadopoulos met on February 28 in Paris to discuss bicommunal discussions at the technical level on various issues to restore trust and prepare for negotiations. They also discussed progress on disengagement of forces, demilitarization, demining of Cyprus, and Famagusta. On April 26, Talat expressed readiness to start settlement talks from scratch or with the Annan Plan. However, Papadopoulos rejected the reintroduction of the Annan Plan even with minor changes on May 10. Annan reported on May 23 that there was no progress in the positions of the two sides. Papadopoulos and Talat met on July 3 for the first time since 2004, and a joint statement known as the July 8 agreement was presented by U.N. Under Secretary-General Gambari after his visits to Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus. The July 8 agreement presented by Talat and Gambari aimed to begin discussions on issues affecting daily life and substantive matters for a comprehensive settlement. They emphasized the need to end the 'blame game' for a successful process. Technical committees were to address day-to-day issues while expert working groups studied substantive issues. Despite exchanging lists of topics on July 31, differences arose on the agenda and procedures, with Talat focusing on environmental protections, missing persons, policing, and the presence of Turkish troops. The Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots had differing priorities in the discussions for a (re)united Cyprus. The Turkish Cypriots wanted to address essential issues like Turkish troops and property rights, while the Greek Cypriots focused on technical matters such as checkpoints and drug trafficking. The dismantling of a footbridge at the Ledra Street crossing in Nicosia by the Turkish Cypriots signaled progress towards reopening the crossing. The reopening of the Ledra Street crossing in Nicosia was contingent on various conditions set by Greek Cypriots, including the removal of a defense wall, demilitarization of the area, and the removal of border symbols. Despite the removal of the wall, preconditions still needed to be met for the crossing to open, with concerns about security and the presence of police instead of soldiers being raised by Turkish Cypriots. The Ledra Street crossing in Nicosia was reopened with conditions set by Greek Cypriots, including demilitarization and removal of border symbols. Turkish Cypriots raised concerns about security and presence of police instead of soldiers. Turkish Foreign Ministry rejected preconditions, arguing for a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem. Turkish Cypriots and Turkey disputed agreements on oil and gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean, citing Greek Cypriots' exclusion of Turkish Cypriots' rights. Turkey vowed to protect its interests in the region. The Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) planned to start oil exploration in the Mediterranean with seismic studies. Greek Cyprus began granting exploration licenses to international companies, despite Turkey's objections. Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders failed to agree on launching working groups and technical committees. The two sides continued to differ on day-to-day matters and mechanisms for resolving disagreements. In an interview, Cypriot Foreign Minister Erato Kozakou-Markoullis discussed internal issues to be addressed by the leaders of the two communities. She emphasized the importance of discussing the international aspect, including the presence of Turkish troops and the security of Turkish Cypriots. Papadopoulos accused Talat of lacking political will and trying to change the parameters of the agreement during their meeting on September 5. Talat proposed five committees on Cyprus issue and EU affairs, aiming to resume negotiations in two and a half months for a solution by end of 2008. Greek Cypriots were not ready for talks according to Talat, while new Cypriot President Christofias expressed hope for a federal, bizonal, bicommunal Republic with demilitarization. Christofias emphasized the need for the withdrawal of Turkish troops and demilitarization of the island, reaffirming the nullity of the 2004 Annan Plan. Turkish Cypriot leader Talat expressed optimism for a solution by the end of 2008, aiming for a new partnership state in Cyprus based on political equality. Christofias and Talat agreed to establish working groups and technical committees to move forward with negotiations. Nami and Iakovou agreed to establish working groups and technical committees to address various issues related to a comprehensive settlement in Cyprus. They also decided to meet in three months to review the progress and start negotiations under U.N. auspices. Additionally, they agreed to reopen the Ledra Street crossing between the northern and southern parts of Nicosia. Taye-Brook Zerihoun of Ethiopia was appointed as the Special Representative to Cyprus by Christofias and Talat, who reaffirmed their commitment to a bizonal, bicommunal federation with political equality. They agreed on a single national sovereignty and citizenship, starting negotiations on September 3. Confidence-building measures were approved in various areas. On September 3, substantive negotiations on governance and power-sharing began after ceremonial talks. U.N. Secretary-General appointed Alexander Downer as his Special Advisor on Cyprus. Tassos Papadopoulos was elected President of Cyprus in 2003 with support from various parties. The 1960 Constitution reserves the vice presidency. In the 2006 elections for the Cypriot House of Representatives, AKEL placed first with 31.16% of the vote, followed by DISY with 30.33% and Papadopoulos's DIKO with 17.91%. The three-party coalition dissolved after AKEL nominated Christofias as a presidential candidate in 2008. Christofias was nominated as a presidential candidate in 2008 by AKEL due to disagreements with the government's handling of the Cyprus issue. He won the election on February 24, 2008, with 53.36% of the vote, campaigning against Papadopoulos's policies towards Turkish Cypriots. Christofias appointed ministers from AKEL, DIKO, and EDEK, reviving Papadopoulos's coalition. Markos Kyprianou of DIKO was named foreign minister. Marios Garoyian of DIKO became Speaker of the House. Rauf Denktash led northern Cyprus from 1975 to 2005. The December 14, 2003, parliamentary elections resulted in a tie between supporters and opponents of the Annan Plan. A coalition government with Mehmet Ali Talat was formed instead of ousting Denktash as negotiator. In 2005, Mehmet Ali Talat became Prime Minister of a coalition government in northern Cyprus. Early parliamentary elections in February 2005 saw the CTP win 44.45% of the vote. Talat was elected \"President\" of the TRNC in April 2005. Ferdi Sabit Soyer of the CTP became Prime Minister. Mid-term elections in June 2006 changed the distribution of seats in parliament. In parliament, CTP had 25 seats, UBP had 17, DP had 7, and BDH had 1. UBP and DP deputies resigned, forming the Free Party. The new coalition of CTP and the Free Party was formed, with UBP and DP boycotting parliament. Relations between Greece and Turkey were strained over Cyprus. In 1993, Greek Prime Minister and Cypriot President agreed on a joint defense doctrine for Cyprus. Greece would provide air cover, refuel planes, set up a naval base, and send elite troops. In 1999, Greece and Turkey started a dialogue leading to bilateral accords. In 2004, Greek PM stated Cyprus issue shouldn't hinder Turkey's EU membership or Greek-Turkish relations. Analysts suggest Athens advised Nicosia not to harm Greece's national interest. Athens has advised Nicosia to not harm Greece's national interest by diminishing the Turkish threat and keeping Turkey on the path to EU membership. Turkish governments argue that the Cyprus problem is not acute and that dialogue is the appropriate channel for resolution. In 2004, Turkey shifted its policy to seek U.N. action for a solution. Turkey has promised $1.8 billion in aid to the TRNC from 2007 to 2009. Some powerful circles in Ankara may create difficulties for Turkish Cypriot leader Talat's efforts to achieve a settlement. Turkish military officials have emphasized the importance of security for Turkish Cypriots and the need to maintain a military presence in Cyprus. Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan has expressed full support for Talat in seeking a comprehensive solution. Erdogan supports Talat in achieving a comprehensive solution for Cyprus, emphasizing a new partnership with equal representation for Turkish Cypriots and the TRNC. Greek Cypriots oppose TRNC as a founder state and Turkey's guarantorship. Cypriot President Christofias seeks Ban Ki-moon's help in engaging Turkey for logical discussions on governance. Cyprus applied for EC membership in 1990. In 1990, Cyprus applied for EC membership, leading to objections from Turkish Cypriots due to concerns about recognition of the Republic's government. The EU scheduled accession talks with Cyprus in 1995, despite Greece's veto on an EU-Turkey customs union. The Greek Cypriot government was the EU's interlocutor, excluding Turkish Cypriots from the accession process. In 1990, Cyprus applied for EC membership, leading to objections from Turkish Cypriots. The EU scheduled accession talks with Cyprus in 1995, excluding Turkish Cypriots. On July 10, 1997, the European Commission confirmed membership talks with Cyprus would open in 1998. Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Turkish Cypriot leader called for partial integration between Turkey and TRNC. Greece threatened to block EU expansion if Cyprus was not accepted. EU began accession negotiations with Cyprus in 1998. Greece stated it would not object to Turkey's EU membership candidacy if Cyprus's accession proceeded. The EU Helsinki summit in December 1999 confirmed Cyprus's EU accession even without a solution to the conflict. Turkey's EU candidacy was also affirmed. In 2002, EU concluded accession talks with Cyprus. The Berlin Plus agreement stipulated that Cyprus would not participate in EU military operations using NATO assets. However, after becoming an EU member in 2004, Cyprus was allowed to join EU operations cooperating with NATO. Turkey's veto prevented Cyprus from participating in EU discussions with NATO on terrorism and EU police missions in Kosovo. This stance also impacted NATO-EU cooperation in Afghanistan. Cyprus became an EU member in 2004, with an attached Protocol suspending EU rules in areas not under the control of the Republic of Cyprus. The Cypriot parliament ratified the Treaty on behalf of the entire island, and the European Commission proposed measures to integrate northern Cyprus into the EU. The Turkish Cypriot Chamber of Commerce was suggested to certify the movement of goods between Cyprus and the EU to bypass an EU embargo on Turkish Cypriot goods. The Cypriot government authorized the Chamber to issue certificates of origin, but exports required further certification at legal ports to meet EU specifications. Denktash accepted \u20ac12 million in aid but rejected the trade measures. The Commission's report warned that the absence of a settlement on Cyprus could hinder Turkey's EU aspirations. The EU expressed regret over the Greek Cypriots' rejection of the Annan Plan and praised the Turkish Cypriots for their \"yes\" vote in the referenda. They were determined to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and facilitate the reunification of Cyprus. The Green Line Regulations aimed to ease travel restrictions and boost economic development for Turkish Cypriots. Cyprus officially joined the EU on May 1, 2004, with EU laws suspended in the north. The EU proposed measures to end Turkish Cypriots' isolation and economic disparities, including \u20ac259 million in aid and preferences for direct trade with EU countries. The Greek Cypriot government accepted the aid but rejected the trade measure, arguing it could lead to the TRNC acquiring state-like characteristics. Turkish Cypriots believed aid and trade were inseparable for economic growth, opposing the use of southern ports for trade with Europe. In June 2005, the EU held unsuccessful talks to break the stalemate between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots over the opening of ports and airports in Cyprus. The Greek Cypriots proposed joint operation of the port at Famagusta and a moratorium on property sales in the north, fearing the development of separate economies. The Turkish Cypriots offered Varosha in return for open ports and airports in the north. The EU decided to begin accession talks with Turkey in December 2004. Turkey signed the Protocol of the Ankara Agreement but issued a unilateral declaration, not recognizing Cyprus. The EU called for full implementation, including opening ports to Greek Cypriot ships. Failure to comply may impact Turkey's accession negotiations. The EU declaration emphasized the importance of normalizing relations between Turkey and all member states, including recognition of Cyprus. Turkish officials expressed disappointment over the one-sidedness of the declaration and reiterated that recognition of Cyprus is not possible before a comprehensive settlement. Turkey's ports and airports will remain closed to Cyprus until the isolation of northern Cyprus ends, as required by the EU's Negotiating Framework for Turkey's accession. Turkey has blocked Cyprus from joining various international organizations, while Cyprus has vetoed Turkey's participation in the European Defense Agency. The EU approved a financial aid package for northern Cyprus in 2006. The Greek Cypriot government welcomed aid for northern Cyprus, but the Turkish Cypriot administration refused aid under Greek Cypriot supervision. The European Commission opened an office in the north to administer aid, citing low absorption capacity and political obstacles as impediments. Turkey completed a negotiating chapter on Science and Research to join the EU, but faced criticism for not opening its ports to Cyprus as required. The EU warned Turkey about the impact of not fulfilling obligations, urging the opening of ports and airport to Greek Cypriots. Turkish Cypriots objected to Varosha arrangement and airport access, while Greek Cypriots wanted Varosha returned to former inhabitants quickly. Greek Cypriots demand the return of Varosha to its former inhabitants and oppose opening Tymbou, fearing it would legitimize a separatist Turkish Cypriot state.
