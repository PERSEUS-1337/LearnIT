    "content": "Anton's Law mandates that all child occupants in motor vehicles must be appropriately restrained to reduce injuries and fatalities from crashes. Research shows that many children aged 4 to 8 are not in the correct restraints. Children who have outgrown safety seats should use a booster seat until the adult seat belt fits properly, as properly restrained children suffer less severe injuries in accidents. SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENT OF SAFETY OF CHILD RESTRAINTS IN PASSENGER MOTOR VEHICLES. The Secretary of Transportation will establish performance requirements for child restraints, including booster seats, for children over 50 pounds. This includes considering injury performance criteria, seat belt fit with booster seats, and addressing specific child restraint situations. The Secretary of Transportation will establish performance requirements for child restraints, including booster seats, for children over 50 pounds. This includes considering injury performance criteria, seat belt fit with booster seats, and reviewing the definition of \"booster seat\" in Federal motor vehicle safety standards. The rulemaking proceeding must be completed within 30 months of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Transportation will develop an anthropomorphic test device simulating a 10-year-old child for testing child restraints in passenger vehicles. Within a year, a rulemaking proceeding will be initiated for the adoption of this test device. Additionally, requirements for the installation of lap and shoulder belts will be established. The Secretary will amend safety standards to require lap and shoulder belts for rear designated seating positions in passenger vehicles under 10,000 pounds, with phased implementation. The requirement for lap and shoulder belts in rear designated seating positions of passenger vehicles under 10,000 pounds will be implemented in phases on a production year basis, starting not later than 12 months after the regulations are prescribed. The final rule will apply to all such vehicles manufactured in the third production year of the implementation phase-in schedule. SEC. 6. EVALUATION OF INTEGRATED CHILD SAFETY SYSTEMS. The Secretary will evaluate integrated or built-in child restraints and booster seats within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The evaluation will consider safety, fit, testing data availability, compatibility, cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and benefits of built-in seats. A report is due within 12 months of enactment. The Secretary will evaluate integrated or built-in child restraints and booster seats within 180 days of the Act's enactment and transmit a report to the relevant committees within 12 months. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms like \"child restraint\" as products designed to restrain children, \"production year\" as the 12-month period from September 1 to August 31, and \"passenger motor vehicle\" as defined in title 23, United States Code. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $5,000,000 authorized for evaluation and research on child injury in motor vehicle crashes. Funds cannot be used for general administrative expenses."
