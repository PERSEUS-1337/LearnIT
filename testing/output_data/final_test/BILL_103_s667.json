    "content": "The \"Port of Entry Inspections Improvement Act of 1993\" may be cited as the short title. Admission fraud is addressed in the Act. The \"Port of Entry Inspections Improvement Act of 1993\" addresses admission fraud by amending the Immigration and Nationality Act to include exclusion for fraudulent documents or failure to present documents. Any alien presenting a forged, counterfeit, altered, or misrepresented document to an immigration officer is excludable. Failure to present a valid document related to eligibility when boarding a common carrier to the United States also results in exclusion. Any alien presenting fraudulent, forged, stolen, or misrepresented documents when seeking entry to the United States is excludable. This provision also applies to those boarding a common carrier for direct departure to the US. Aliens presenting fraudulent, forged, stolen, or misrepresented documents when seeking entry to the United States may not apply for asylum unless the document was presented during direct departure from a country where they fear persecution. Additionally, presenting documents related to eligibility for entry to the US upon boarding a common carrier without showing them to an immigration official upon arrival may also disqualify an alien from applying for asylum. Aliens presenting fraudulent documents may not apply for asylum unless presented during direct departure from a country where persecution is feared. Immigration officers refer asylum seekers to specially trained officers for eligibility interviews. The immigration officer determines if an alien has a credible fear of persecution in their last country before entering the United States. If not, the alien may be excluded and deported without appeal. Credible fear of persecution means it is more likely than not that the statements made are true. The amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act defines 'persecution' as the likelihood that the alien's statements are true and the possibility of establishing eligibility as a refugee. It also includes changes to sections 212(c) and 235 of the Act. The amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act specifies that aliens ineligible for withholding of deportation under certain conditions may only be returned to a country where they do not face persecution or significant danger. The amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act ensures that aliens ineligible for withholding of deportation can only be returned to a country where they do not face persecution or significant danger. SEC. 3. SPECIAL PORT OF ENTRY EXCLUSION FOR ADMISSIONS FRAUD. Section 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allow for the special exclusion and deportation of aliens found to be excludable under certain criteria. Additionally, aliens ineligible to apply for asylum may only be returned to a country where they do not face persecution. The amended Section 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows for special exclusion and deportation of aliens deemed excludable. Aliens without credible fear of persecution may be returned to a country where they are not at risk. Special exclusion orders are not appealable administratively and have the same effect as deportation orders. No inquiry is required for alien crewmen. SEC. 4. RESTRICTIONS ON JUDICIAL REVIEW. Section 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include new subsections regarding aliens excludable for admissions fraud. Courts are limited in their jurisdiction to review such cases, except through a petition for habeas corpus. Review is focused on whether the petitioner is an alien and was ordered specially excluded from the United States. Additionally, procedures for the determination of admissions fraud are not subject to court jurisdiction. Courts have limited jurisdiction to review cases of admissions fraud under section 212(a)(6)(C)(iii) and special exclusion of aliens. No court can provide relief or challenge the validity of exclusion or deportation orders in collateral enforcement proceedings. SEC. 5 enhances penalties for alien smuggling by increasing the maximum imprisonment to ten years and imposing fines or up to 20 years imprisonment for causing serious harm to the smuggled aliens. SEC. 6 specifies the effective date of these changes. The Act and its amendments will be effective upon enactment, applying to aliens arriving or seeking admission to the United States after that date."
