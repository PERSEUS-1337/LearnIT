The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, established in 1975, helps secure consistent financial support for children and promotes self-sufficiency for families. Administered by the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), it aims to strengthen families and reduce the need for public assistance. The Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families (ACF) partners with federal, state, tribal, and local governments to promote parental responsibility for children's financial support. OCSE helps states and tribes operate their Child Support Enforcement (CSE) programs effectively, providing services like establishing and modifying child support orders. The Family Support Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-485) mandated states to use guidelines to establish child support orders, ensuring children benefit from both parents' financial resources. These guidelines aim to make child support calculations fair, consistent, and reduce conflict between parents. Child support guidelines were implemented to bring uniformity and consistency to support orders, promote settlement, and ensure children receive adequate financial support based on the noncustodial parent's income. The guidelines allow for adjustments based on changes in income and eliminate the need for individual cost reviews. Child support guidelines are based on the parent's income, age of the child, presence of a stepparent, disability, and number of siblings. They ensure adequate support by considering the cost of raising children. States use income shares, percentage of income, or Melson formula to determine child support amounts. Child support guidelines are based on the parent's income, age of the child, presence of a stepparent, disability, and number of siblings. States use different methods to determine child support amounts, such as income shares, percentage of income, or the Melson formula. Setting accurate initial child support orders is crucial for ensuring regular payments and economic stability for the child. Child support orders may need periodic review and modification to ensure they are fair and adequate. Custodial parents should seek changes if facing increased expenses or if the noncustodial parent's income has improved. Similarly, noncustodial parents experiencing job loss should consider requesting modifications to reflect their changed circumstances. In FY2014, $114.8 billion in child support arrearages was owed to families receiving CSE services, but less than 7% ($7.6 billion) of those arrearages was actually paid, negatively impacting children, custodial parents, and noncustodial parents. It is crucial for noncustodial parents facing job loss to seek a modification to their order promptly to avoid falling behind in payments and dealing with child support arrearages. Prior to 1988, modifying a child support order required a party to petition the court based on a change in circumstances. The process involved filing a motion, serving notice, hiring a lawyer, and proving a significant change to meet statutory standards. Retroactive modifications were common, often resulting in reduced child support payments. In 1986, Congress passed legislation to prevent retroactive modification of child support orders, reducing arrearages for noncustodial parents. This change was prompted by cases where arrearages had serious impacts on custodial parents and their children. The Bradley Amendment prevents retroactive modification of child support orders, making them enforceable as judgments. Retroactive modification is limited to the period during a pending modification petition and notice given to the parents. The Family Support Act of 1988 required states to use guidelines for child support awards. The Family Support Act of 1988 mandated the use of state child support guidelines to simplify the process of updating child support orders. States were required to review their guidelines every four years to ensure appropriate support amounts. The Family Support Act of 1988 required states to review and modify child support orders every four years, with procedures for review and modification in place. Orders could be reviewed at the request of either parent or a state child support agency, and any modifications had to be consistent with the state's guidelines. Additionally, all orders enforced under the CSE program had to be reviewed within 36 months after establishment or the most recent review, and adjusted according to the state's guidelines. The Family Support Act of 1988 required states to review and modify child support orders every four years. Reviews were not required if it was not in the best interests of the child and no parent requested it. Reviews were mandatory every 36 months if there was no current assignment of support rights to the state, and modifications had to be made if deemed appropriate. Parents receiving CSE services were notified of their right to request a review. The 1996 welfare reform law revised the review and modification requirements for child support orders, allowing states flexibility in determining which cases to pursue and methods of review. States were required to review orders every three years or more often if requested by a parent or the state in welfare cases. The 1996 welfare reform law allowed states flexibility in reviewing and adjusting child support orders. States were required to notify parents of their review and adjustment rights every three years. States could use different methods for adjusting orders, including child support guidelines, inflation adjustments, or automated methods. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 eliminated state discretion and required states to adjust orders. Under P.L. 109-171, states must review and adjust child support orders for TANF families every three years. Non-TANF families can request a review every three years or based on a substantial change in circumstances. Parents must be notified of their review and modification rights regularly. Orders can be modified administratively or judicially. After child support is initially ordered by the CSE agency or the court, a modification generally occurs when there are changes in the financial situation of parents, inadequacy in meeting the child's needs, lack of medical support provision, or substantial changes in circumstances. States can adjust orders using child support guidelines, inflation adjustments, or automated methods. Most states use inflation adjustments or automated methods for child support modifications, allowing either parent to contest the adjustment. Child support guidelines in most states have quantitative thresholds, such as a 15% change in the order amount, to determine when modification actions are appropriate and ensure stability in support levels. Some states have implemented programs to simplify the modification process for child support orders. Approaches include technology and automation, targeting specific populations like those experiencing a change in income. Some child support programs offer expedited review for individuals with a change in income. Enhanced case management and outreach efforts aim to ensure parents receive necessary modifications. Temporary changes in circumstances can also be addressed through modification procedures. Increased publicity is used to encourage parents to seek modifications when needed.

Child support arrearages are unpaid child support resulting from various factors like noncompliance with orders, inadequate support amounts, birth costs included in orders, low collection rates, and interest charges. Retroactive reduction of owed amounts is not allowed under current law if the noncustodial parent delays explaining changed financial circumstances. Child support arrearages have increased from $84 billion in FY2000 to $114.8 billion in FY2014, with only about 7% of arrearages being paid. Noncustodial parents with no income, out-of-state addresses, and multiple child support orders are more likely to owe substantial amounts of arrears. This results in millions of children receiving less child support than they are owed. The increase in child support arrearages from $84 billion in FY2000 to $114.8 billion in FY2014 may lead to millions of children receiving less support, reduce the cost-effectiveness of the CSE program, hinder noncustodial parents' ability to make timely payments, create uncollectible debt, strain relationships, and limit job opportunities due to credit reporting. An Urban Institute study found common traits among those with large arrearages. Noncustodial parents with high child support arrearages are expected to pay a larger percentage of their income for current child support orders. They are more likely to have older orders, multiple current child support orders, and less likely to pay support or have a known address. OCSE's goal is to ensure reliable payment of child support by setting accurate orders based on a parent's actual ability. Child support orders should be set accurately based on the noncustodial parent's ability to pay. Research shows that realistic orders improve payment consistency. If initial support is inadequate or circumstances change, modification may be needed. States have flexibility in reviewing and modifying orders under the CSE program. Federal law mandates a review every three years, but parents may not know how to request changes. Some argue that child support modification laws should consider the noncustodial parent's ability to pay to prevent large arrearages. It is challenging for low-income noncustodial parents to meet support payments and their own needs. Concerns include high arrearages, garnishment limits, and the provision of work-related services by CSE agencies. In FY2014, $114.8 billion in child support arrearages was owed, with only $7.6 billion paid. 63% of noncustodial parents with arrearages continued making payments, indicating financial struggles. The OCSE has proposed procedures to reduce high child support arrearages, including updating guidelines regularly, simplifying order modifications, and ensuring obligations align with the noncustodial parent's ability to pay. Early intervention is seen as crucial to prevent the accumulation of unpaid child support, especially for low-income families. Automated systems are recommended to detect noncompliance early and contact noncustodial parents promptly. The OCSE proposes using automated systems to detect noncompliance early and contact noncustodial parents promptly. They suggest updating child support guidelines to reflect modern family dynamics and consider compromising uncollected child support arrearages to encourage regular payment of current support. Some states use debt compromise to forgive a portion or all of the child support debt owed in exchange for participation in specified activities. The University of Wisconsin research suggests that reducing large child support debts may increase payments, but caution is needed in lowering orders for low-income noncustodial parents as child support is crucial for some families to avoid poverty. The Consumer Credit Protection Act limits the amount of earnings that can be garnished for child support, with up to 50%-65% of disposable earnings allowed to be withheld. This ensures that noncustodial parents remain financially responsible for their children, even in dire financial situations. The Consumer Credit Protection Act limits wage garnishment for child support payments to prevent financial hardship for noncustodial parents. Federal law protects consumers from excessive deductions, with research showing that payments at 20% of earnings or lower are more likely to be met. Noncustodial parents argue that garnishing up to 65% of their paycheck is unreasonable and discourages work. The CSE agency's practice of garnishing up to 65% of noncustodial parents' wages for child support, even for those struggling financially, may hinder their ability to meet basic needs and maintain employment. This high garnishment limit could lead to difficulties in securing housing, transportation, and employment for low-income parents. Several studies show that low-income noncustodial parents with child support arrears may become discouraged and leave formal employment. Perceptions of unfairness in the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) system can decrease the likelihood of payment. Most families in the CSE program have low to moderate incomes, with many below the poverty level. Male unemployment and economic downturns contribute to noncustodial parents being unemployed or sporadically employed, impacting their ability to make child support payments. Many noncustodial parents struggle with unemployment or sporadic employment, leading to difficulties in meeting child support obligations. Policymakers and CSE administrators advocate for work-oriented services to increase child support payments. The child support program is well-equipped to manage employment services effectively for the benefit of children and families, especially those in poverty. The child support program manages work-oriented programs for noncustodial parents to help them find employment and ensure child support payments go to custodial families. 30 states and the District of Columbia have work-oriented programs in partnership with workforce development boards and local courts. The CSE program is usually the lead agency accountable for results in these programs. The Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) is involved in work-oriented programs for noncustodial parents, funded by various sources. They have proposed program standards to provide job services for eligible noncustodial parents to increase child support payments. There is controversy over the OCSE proposing new services eligible for funding. The Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) is proposing new services and programs eligible for funding to help noncustodial parents find work, leading to more consistent child support payments. Incarcerated parents often struggle to meet child support obligations, with significant arrearages upon entering and leaving prison. Policymakers are focusing on strategies to assist incarcerated and formerly incarcerated noncustodial parents. Several recommendations have been made to help incarcerated parents modify their child support orders, including enabling courts to consider obligations to children at sentencing, prohibiting incarceration from being seen as voluntary unemployment, and requiring states to automatically modify or forgive child support orders for the duration of the prison sentence. Some argue child support modification laws should be more sensitive to noncustodial parents' ability to pay, regardless of the reason for income decrease. States should offer enhanced assistance to all vulnerable noncustodial parents, not just those in prison. Policymakers should consider reducing child support obligations for prisoners. When considering policies to reduce child support obligations of prisoners, equity issues for low-income noncustodial parents must also be considered. It is argued that unilaterally lowering payments for lawbreakers while not making similar allowances for unemployed law-abiding citizens sends the wrong message."
