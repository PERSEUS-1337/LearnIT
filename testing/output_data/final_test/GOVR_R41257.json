    "content": "The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution in September 2009 to consolidate four U.N. bodies addressing women's issues into one entity due to current inefficiencies and lack of coordination. Member states, including the United States, are discussing the new entity's mission, functions, governance, and funding. The establishment of this new U.N. entity reflects a shift in prioritizing global women's issues. The international community, including the United States, recognizes the importance of addressing women's needs for security, development, and economic stability. The creation of a new U.N. entity for women is being discussed, with key issues including U.S. funding, support for global women's issues, and oversight of the entity's efficiency. Members of Congress have shown support for these efforts. The report discusses weaknesses in the current U.N. gender structure and recent steps taken by governments to address the issue. It analyzes U.S. policy toward the new entity, including funding and potential role. Possible policy issues related to the new entity's role in U.N. field operations, leadership, governance structures, and funding mechanisms are also examined. The entity is considered in the context of broader U.N. system-wide reform efforts and its potential impact on other U.N. agencies and involvement of NGOs. The international community has recognized the need for a new U.N. entity to address women's issues due to weaknesses in existing U.N. gender structures. Advocates argue that the current system lacks leadership, funding, visibility, and operational capacity, making women's issues a low priority. The U.N. system has made women's issues a low priority. The four U.N. gender entities will be consolidated into one composite entity - UNIFEM, DAW, OSAGI, and INSTRAW. UNIFEM aims to advance gender equality by focusing on women's economic security, violence against women, and reducing HIV levels. UNIFEM focuses on women's economic security, violence against women, reducing HIV levels, and advancing gender justice in democratic governance. It provides funding and technical assistance for gender equality and women's empowerment in developing countries, funded through voluntary contributions. Total contributions in 2008 were $121.4 million. UNIFEM also administers the U.N. Trust Fund to combat violence against women, relying on voluntary contributions from various sources. The Department of Economic and Social Affairs in the U.N. Secretariat, through DAW and OSAGI, promotes women's advancement by formulating policies, researching global standards, and implementing international agreements. DAW services the Commission on the Status of Women, while OSAGI focuses on implementing the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. OSAGI provides oversight and policy guidance to DAW in supporting the General Assembly, ECOSOC, and CSW. The U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs, through DAW and OSAGI, supports the General Assembly, ECOSOC, and CSW in promoting gender equality and women's empowerment. INSTRAW, a U.N. research institute, focuses on developing programs for women's empowerment and gender equality, with contributions from governments, academia, and NGOs. Weaknesses in the U.N. gender structure have led to gaps in implementing commitments to women's equality, related to coordination, governance, and resources. Critics argue that lack of leadership and coordination is a primary deficiency in the existing U.N. system gender structure. UNIFEM, DAW, OSAGI, and INSTRAW share similar objectives but often work independently without unified leadership. This lack of cohesion affects the status of women's issues in the U.N. system and its effectiveness in addressing women's needs. Some experts criticize the governance of existing gender entities, with concerns about UNIFEM's secondary status in the U.N. system. UNIFEM operates autonomously within the UNDP but requires involvement from other entities for project planning. Critics argue that UNIFEM lacks resources and capacity, hindering its ability to promote women's equality. Total budget contributions for UNIFEM and other gender entities in 2008 were approximately $247 million, which is seen as insufficient compared to other U.N. entities. Total budget contributions for UNIFEM, DAW, OSAGI, and INSTRAW in 2008 were around $247 million, while UNICEF alone had an income of over $3.3 billion during the same period. In 2006, efforts to establish a new entity focused on women's equality gained momentum with the appointment of a High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence by then-Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The Panel recommended the creation of a consolidated U.N. entity for women's equality and empowerment, citing the need for a more coherent and well-resourced approach within the U.N. system. The Panel recommended the consolidation of existing U.N. gender entities into a new, fully funded entity with a strengthened role. This led to the adoption of U.N. General Assembly resolution 63/311 in 2009, which called for the creation of a composite entity led by a new Under-Secretary-General. The resolution requested a comprehensive proposal from Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the new entity's mission, organization, funding, and governance for member state consideration. The Secretary-General's proposal in response to the General Assembly's request recommended the creation of a new gender equality entity that would combine the mandates of existing entities and address gender gaps in the U.N. system. The proposal suggested the establishment of both operational and normative entities at regional, national, and global levels, with normative work guided by the Commission on the Status of Women and operational work governed by an executive board. The Secretary-General proposed the creation of a new gender equality entity under the General Assembly, reporting through ECOSOC. It would be led by an Under-Secretary-General and funded by a mix of assessed and voluntary contributions, with a total of $500 million for start-up costs. The entity would operate at all levels in developed and developing countries. The Secretary-General proposed a new gender equality entity under the General Assembly, to be led by an Under-Secretary-General and funded by a mix of assessed and voluntary contributions. Issues to be resolved include merging existing gender entities, governance, funding, and in-country roles. The timeline for establishment depends on U.N. member states, with the General Assembly expected to address the proposal during its 64th session. The establishment of a new composite gender entity funded by a mix of assessed and voluntary contributions is a significant challenge. Policy issues such as accountability, funding, and coordination will be key during negotiations. U.N. member states are debating the proposed $500 million annual budget for the start-up phase, with $125 million for staff and operating costs and $375 million for program support. The proposed composite gender entity would be funded through a combination of voluntary contributions and the U.N. regular budget. Voluntary contributions would fund operational and programming activities, while normative functions like support to the Commission on the Status of Women would be funded through the regular budget. The main funding source would be voluntary contributions from governments, NGOs, and the private sector, with a small percentage from the regular budget to ensure substantive support for the intergovernmental process. Governments and NGOs have mixed responses to the funding proposal, generally supporting a combination of assessed and voluntary contributions for the new entity. Many member states and NGOs express concerns about the proposed funding for the new composite gender entity, suggesting that the $500 million budget is insufficient for effective gender equality programming. They argue that an annual budget of at least $1 billion is needed to make a substantial impact. Women's groups emphasize the importance of sustained and consistent funding to attract top experts in women's empowerment. It is recognized that the current U.N. gender-related structure lacks strong governance. Many member states and NGOs have raised concerns about the funding for the new U.N. gender entity, advocating for a larger budget to effectively promote gender equality. They also highlight the need for strong governance within the entity. In response, a General Assembly resolution called for the entity to be led by a new Under-Secretary-General and governed by an executive board to oversee operational activities. These actions aim to elevate the importance of women's well-being in the U.N. system and increase accountability on gender-related approaches. In his proposal, Ban presented two options to member states for the structure of the executive board: Join the UNDP/UNFPA Executive Board or establish a new executive board. The General Assembly could create a new board similar to UNICEF or UNDP/UNFPA boards, which would require a board secretariat and additional financial costs. Ban suggested the establishment of an \"autonomous segment\" of the UNDP/UNFPA Board for close collaboration between the new entity and the two organizations, ensuring a strong link between gender equality and development. Some member states prefer joining the UNDP/UNFPA Executive Board for the new gender entity, citing concerns about potential mission focus loss. Questions have been raised about the entity's impact on other U.N. bodies addressing women, with worries about duplication and the need for a separate board. The establishment of a new U.N. gender entity is expected to enhance existing gender equality activities within the U.N. system without replacing them. The new entity will engage more frequently with other U.N. bodies at both global and regional levels, focusing on high-level policymaking and coordination. The new U.N. gender entity will have a staff presence at U.N. regional hubs and work with regional directors teams to support U.N. country teams on gender equality. Some NGOs and governments have raised concerns about the entity's role in country teams. Critics argue that current U.N. gender activities lack gender perspectives in country teams. The new U.N. gender entity aims to establish a presence in every country where the United Nations operates and fully participate in U.N. country teams to oversee and coordinate gender-related programming. The Secretary-General's proposal suggests that the entity should lead and coordinate U.N. system actions on gender equality at the national level, supporting national efforts as needed. The proposed U.N. gender entity aims to support national efforts for gender equality, advocate critical issues, provide knowledge and training, and align gender programs with U.N. policies. NGO responses are mixed, with many supporting the entity's universal country presence and diverse approach based on individual needs. The proposed U.N. gender entity aims to support national efforts for gender equality with a diverse approach based on individual needs. Concerns exist regarding the entity's operational capacity for women's empowerment and rights, with some fearing that the language of the proposal may weaken its role in leading and coordinating U.N. system actions on gender equality. The level of civil society involvement in the entity will be a key topic of discussion during intergovernmental consultations. Many argue that civil society, especially women's organizations, should have systematic and meaningful participation in the proposed U.N. gender entity. Secretary-General Ban suggests building effective partnerships with civil society, including an advisory board of civil society and women's organizations. Women's groups believe that the proposal does not adequately incorporate civil society, and NGOs with expertise in gender issues should have a more formal role in the entity. The Gender Equality Architecture Reform (GEAR) Campaign, consisting of over 300 global NGOs, advocates for NGOs to have a formal role on the executive board of the proposed U.N. gender entity. They also propose the establishment of civil society advisory councils at different levels and the participation of NGOs in various meetings. Gender mainstreaming aims to achieve gender equality by integrating gender perspectives into U.N. programs and policies. Member states will consider the effectiveness of gender mainstreaming in the U.N. system during negotiations for the new entity. Gender mainstreaming was introduced as a U.N. strategy in the mid-1990s at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. Despite efforts to incorporate it into U.N. activities, some argue that a lack of accountability and understanding has hindered its success. This has affected the U.N.'s ability to mainstream gender perspectives and assist national governments with their gender mainstreaming initiatives. The new composite gender entity proposed by Secretary-General Ban would lead and coordinate U.N. gender mainstreaming efforts, provide support to U.N. bodies on gender equality, and work on refining policies for gender mainstreaming. Many observers and women's groups support the proposal, emphasizing the need for the entity to have authority and financial resources for its mission. The Secretary-General's proposal for a new composite gender entity emphasizes the need for member states to review its efficiency and effectiveness after three years. A similar review of the entity's executive board arrangements is also recommended to ensure alignment with system-wide coherence discussions. Evaluation and measurement of the entity's work by governments remain unclear. The United States has recognized the importance of women's well-being to development and international security. U.S. policymakers are cautiously optimistic about a new U.N. entity for women, with future policy likely depending on its effectiveness. The Obama Administration supports this initiative, as seen in the creation of the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues at the State Department. The Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues at the State Department is responsible for coordinating foreign policy activities related to the advancement of women worldwide. The U.S. government is actively involved in negotiating the scope and structure of a new U.N. entity for women, with the Obama Administration supporting this initiative. The Obama Administration supports the creation of a new U.N. entity for women, envisioning it as a central repository of expertise on gender issues. The entity would draft reports, deploy staff in the field, and work with operational agencies to ensure gender aspects are considered in projects. It is recommended to have a strong field presence without establishing new U.N. offices in all countries, with a small branch under the U.N. Secretariat to support the Under-Secretary-General. The Under-Secretary-General would have two primary responsibilities. The Obama Administration supports creating a new U.N. entity for women, with the Under-Secretary-General having dual roles. The entity would have equal representation on U.N. consultative mechanisms and be funded through voluntary and assessed contributions. A review by member states is suggested after three to five years. The Obama Administration supports the creation of a new U.N. entity for women, with recommendations similar to the Secretary-General's proposal. The entity should be a \"vigorous actor\" with resources and programs, jointly governed by an executive board and the Commission on the Status of Women. The Under-Secretary-General position should be on par with other major funds and programs within the U.N. Members of Congress generally support U.N. activities promoting women's well-being. Members of Congress generally support U.N. activities promoting women's well-being and show interest in the new gender entity. They may focus on issues such as U.S. funding, relevance to foreign policy, and oversight of efficiency. Congress could use legislative options like authorizing funding, enacting resolutions, and holding oversight hearings. This attention to global women's issues aligns with past U.N. mechanisms used by Congress to further U.S. foreign policy objectives. The possible establishment of a new U.N. gender entity has sparked congressional interest in its role in U.S. foreign policy. As the entity begins its work, Congress may consider oversight to ensure it effectively addresses women's well-being. Evaluating the entity's effectiveness and improvement poses a challenge for U.N. member states, including the United States. Some experts argue that women's rights should be integrated into existing international human rights and development mechanisms, rather than creating a new U.N. gender entity. They believe that U.N. member states should focus on fully integrating gender issues into existing U.N. system activities. This approach would avoid unnecessary expenses for member states, with some suggesting that the United States withhold contributions to the new gender entity. The possible role of the new composite gender entity in U.S. foreign policy is being considered by Members of Congress. Experts suggest that providing assistance to the entity may benefit the United States by sharing costs and resources for global women's issues. However, some argue that the U.S. should focus on its own efforts rather than aligning with U.N. gender-related activities. U.N. member states are expected to transfer mandates of existing U.N. gender entities in the coming months. U.N. member states are expected to transfer mandates of existing gender entities into a new composite entity. The funding for the new entity is still being negotiated, with options including U.N. regular budget, voluntary contributions, or a combination of both. If funded through the U.N. regular budget, the U.S. would be legally obligated to provide assessed contributions. If funded through voluntary contributions, the U.S. is not legally obligated to contribute. Members of Congress are considering whether to provide U.S. contributions to the new entity. The establishment of a new U.N. entity for women would impact annual appropriations, with U.S. funding levels for the new entity being debated. Consideration should be given to U.S. contributions to existing gender entities that will be consolidated. Funding for existing U.N. gender entities is mainly through voluntary contributions to UNIFEM and the UNIFEM Trust Fund. In FY2010, the United States contributed $6 million to UNIFEM and $3 million to the Trust Fund, totaling $9 million. Total UNIFEM income in CY 2008 was $215.3 million, with expenditures at $118.25 million. The U.S. contributed $3.571 million to UNIFEM in FY2008. DAW and OSAGI are funded through the U.N. regular budget. The United States has decided not to contribute to INSTRAW in recent years. The Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is a U.N. intergovernmental policymaking body addressing issues related to women, established in 1946 under the U.N. Economic and Social Council. The Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is a U.N. body that meets annually at U.N. Headquarters to advance women's rights and gender mainstreaming. CSW is funded through U.N. regular budget contributions. The U.S. is a member of CSW, with its term expiring in 2012. U.N. World Conferences on Women have addressed women's equality and empowerment through four conferences held in Mexico City, Copenhagen, and Nairobi, focusing on gender equality, women's integration into development, and their role in achieving world peace. The Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, aimed to build on previous commitments. The conference resulted in the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action by 185 governments, reaffirming equal rights for men and women, empowerment of women, and commitments to eliminate discrimination, promote sustainable development, combat violence, and ensure equal access to resources. The Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 reaffirmed women's rights and called for action on issues like poverty, education, health, violence, armed conflict, decision-making, environment, and economic inequality. The United States played a significant role in drafting the Declaration and Platform for Action, which was endorsed by the U.N. General Assembly in December 1995. The U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) focuses on eliminating discrimination against women in all areas of life. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) aims to eliminate discrimination against women in various aspects of life, including legal status, political participation, employment, education, health care, and family structure. 186 countries have ratified or acceded to the Convention, with the United States being the only nation to have signed but not ratified it. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women was established in 1982 to monitor the Convention's implementation. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is composed of 23 independent experts elected by States Parties to review national implementation reports. Countries must submit reports every four years, highlighting progress and challenges. The Committee engages in dialogue with countries, providing recommendations and general cross-cutting issue recommendations. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) is the largest global source for population and reproductive health programs within the United Nations. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) is the principal unit within the United Nations for global population issues, providing services in developing countries with funds from voluntary contributions. While not exclusively focused on women, its activities in family planning and reproductive health mainly impact women and girls. There has been ongoing debate in the US about funding UNFPA due to concerns about its support for China's family planning policies. The George W. Bush Administration found UNFPA ineligible for funding due to violations of the \"Kemp-Kasten\" amendment. President Obama later supported UNFPA and directed $55 million for the organization in 2010. UNICEF works to protect children's rights and promote equal rights for women and girls. UNICEF programs focus on reducing gender-based violence, ensuring equal access to water, enhancing gender equality in education, and protecting women and girls from child marriage. The organization is primarily funded through voluntary contributions from governments, with the United States contributing $132.25 million in FY2010. The U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1325, 1820, and 1888 address women, peace, and security, emphasizing the need to protect women and girls from human rights abuses in armed conflict. Resolution 1820, adopted by the UN Security Council, addresses sexual violence in armed conflict and calls for increased representation of women in decision-making levels. This resolution followed reports of abuse by UN peacekeeping personnel. Resolution 1820, adopted by the UN Security Council, demands the immediate cessation of sexual violence in armed conflict and reaffirms commitment to Resolution 1325. It notes that such violence can constitute war crimes and calls for training programs for peacekeeping personnel. Resolution 1888, adopted in 2009, further emphasizes the need to protect civilians, especially women and children, from sexual violence in conflict situations. Resolution 1820, adopted by the UN Security Council, emphasizes the need to protect civilians, especially women and children, from sexual violence in armed conflict. It calls for the immediate cessation of such violence and reaffirms commitment to Resolution 1325. The resolution also highlights that sexual violence can exacerbate armed conflict situations and hinder the restoration of international peace and security. The United States strongly supported the adoption of the resolution, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton chairing the Council meeting. The Inter-Agency Network on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment (IANGWE) promotes gender equality within the U.N. system, coordinates gender mainstreaming, and monitors the implementation of gender-related recommendations from U.N. sessions and summits. It has established issue-specific working groups to address areas like violence against women, peace and security, and gender and trade."
