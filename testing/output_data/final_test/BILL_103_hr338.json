    "content": "Distributions from individual retirement plans can be used penalty-free to buy first homes. Distributions from individual retirement plans can be used penalty-free for qualified first-time homebuyer distributions. Qualified first-time homebuyer distributions allow individuals to use payments or distributions for qualified acquisition costs within 60 days for a principal residence. Qualified acquisition costs include expenses for acquiring, constructing, or reconstructing a residence, along with settlement, financing, or closing costs. First-time homebuyer defined as individual with no ownership interest in a principal residence for 3 years prior to acquisition. The term \"principal residence\" in section 1034 has the same meaning as before. The term \"date of acquisition\" refers to the date of a binding contract to acquire the principal residence. If a distribution from an individual retirement plan fails to meet requirements for acquiring a principal residence due to a delay, the amount may be contributed back to the plan within 120 days. Effective Date: The amendments made by this section apply to payments and distributions after the date of the enactment of this Act."
