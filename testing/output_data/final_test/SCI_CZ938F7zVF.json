Gedit introduces on-keyboard gestures for efficient editing, including ring gestures, flicks for cursor control, bezel gestures for mode switching, and shortcuts for copy, paste, cut, and undo. In a study comparing Gedit with touch+widget editing interactions, Gedit's gestures were found to be 24% and 17% faster for one- and two-handed use, respectively, and preferred by participants. Text editing on touch-based mobile devices can be inefficient due to reliance on desktop mouse interactions. Modeless editing operations like copy and paste require multiple touch gestures, leading to errors, especially with small text characters. Users must navigate between text input area and keyboard, making editing tedious. Gedit introduces on-keyboard gestures for efficient editing, found to be faster and preferred by users in a study comparing with touch+widget interactions. Text editing on touch-based mobile devices can be inefficient due to reliance on desktop mouse interactions. Modeless editing operations like copy and paste require multiple touch gestures, leading to errors, especially with small text characters. Users must navigate between text input area and keyboard, making editing tedious. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of gesture shortcuts for editing operations on mobile touch screens. Building upon previous work, Gedit improves cursor and edit gestures for text editing on mobile devices. It introduces a ring gesture for continuous cursor control, bezel gestures for entering editing mode, undo functionality, and supports one-and two-handed modes for text editing. Gedit introduces innovative gestures for text editing on mobile devices, including ring and flick gestures for cursor control, bezel gestures for entering editing mode, and letter-like gestures for copy, paste, cut, and undo. These gestures can be performed with one or two hands, making text editing faster and more preferred for one-handed use. The ring gesture is a circular gesture for moving the text cursor, offering benefits such as continuous movement, adjustable speed, and direction changes without restarting. Users draw a circle to move the cursor, changing direction by reversing without lifting their finger. The text cursor moves as soon as the circle gesture is recognized. The text cursor moves with the circle gesture, updating the ring center every 270\u00b0 traversed. Cursor movement distance is based on angular distance, with a threshold of 60\u00b0 for character movement. Right and left flicks move the cursor word-level, while up and down flicks move between lines of text. Gesture typing systems like ShapeWriter may conflict with continuous contact gestures in Gedit. When gesture typing is enabled, only gestures starting on the spacebar key are considered cursor-moving gestures. Flick gestures ending on the spacebar are also recognized as flick-down gestures. A bezel mode-switch gesture is implemented for entering \"editing mode\" by swiping from the left edge of the keyboard. In editing mode, cursor control gestures trigger character, word, or line selection. In editing mode, control gestures enable character, word, or line selection, as well as copy, paste, cut, and undo commands. The gestures are designed based on desktop shortcuts for mnemonic value and are recognized using a point-cloud stroke-gesture recognizer. A 500 ms threshold is included to distinguish between ring gestures and editing gestures. Gedit offers one-handed editing gestures to improve user experience on mobile devices. These gestures combine mode-switching and editing commands, making it easier for users to edit text with just one hand. The gestures are based on the Android Open Source Project keyboard, providing a familiar interface for users. Gedit offers one-handed editing gestures for mobile devices, including statistical decoding for auto correction and word prediction. The study compared Gedit with touch+widget method for efficiency and user preference, recruiting 16 participants aged 22-26. The experiment used a Google Pixel 2 XL smartphone to log timestamps. The study compared Gedit with touch+widget method for efficiency and user preference on a Google Pixel 2 XL smartphone. Three sets of phrases were designed for transcription, encouraging participants to use editing features. Phrases were selected from Wikipedia and participants used one-handed and two-handed modes. Dependent variables analyzed were completion time, editing time, and questionnaire scores. The study compared Gedit with touch+widget method for efficiency and user preference on a Google Pixel 2 XL smartphone. Participants practiced gestures in one-and two-handed modes before transcribing phrases using a desktop keyboard for familiarization. They then completed a formal transcription task on the smartphone, filling out a NASA TLX workload questionnaire and rating their preferences for each interaction. The study compared Gedit with touch+widget method for efficiency and user preference on a Google Pixel 2 XL smartphone. Participants filled out a workload questionnaire and rated their interaction preferences. Results showed Gedit was faster than touch+widget for editing times in both one-and two-handed modes. The study compared Gedit and touch+widget methods on a Google Pixel 2 XL smartphone. Gedit reduced editing and completion times compared to touch+widget. Workload analysis showed editing with Gedit was easier with one hand. No significant difference in workload was found with two hands. Preference ratings ranged from 1 to 5. Preference ratings in Figure 5 ranged from 1 to 5, with Gedit being significantly preferred for one-handed use over touch+widget. However, there were no significant differences for two-handed use. Participants found Gedit's gesture interactions to speed up text editing compared to traditional methods, with many appreciating the precise control, convenience, and speed it offered, especially for one-handed use. Participants found Gedit's gesture interactions to speed up text editing, with many appreciating the precise control, convenience, and speed it offered. Preferences varied between one-handed and two-handed versions of Gedit, with different gestures being used for tasks like fixing typos and selecting words. Gedit is a system of on-keyboard gestures for text editing, including ring and flick gestures for cursor control and text selection. Gedit's gesture interactions, including bezel and letter-like gestures, allow for mode switching and editing commands in both one-handed and two-handed modes. A formal study showed that Gedit sped up editing, reduced text entry time, required less workload, and was preferred over traditional key tapping methods."
