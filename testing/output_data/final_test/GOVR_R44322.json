    "content": "Levels of pay for congressional staff are a recurring topic of interest among Members of Congress, congressional staff, and the public. The chair and ranking member of House committees determine job titles, pay rates, and resources for majority and minority staff. Congressional pay data is sought for various reasons, such as assessing operational costs, setting pay levels, and comparing with other federal government systems. However, aggregated congressional staff pay data is not readily available in public sources. Pay information is based on the House Statement of Disbursements (SOD), published quarterly by the Chief Administrative Officer. The House Statement of Disbursements (SOD) is published quarterly by the Chief Administrative Officer and collated by LegiStorm. It provides annual data on House committee staff compensation, including pay data for 11 staff position titles since 2001. The report identifies job titles used in House committees and excludes titles filled by only one staff member. In the second step, 76 titles were assessed to determine staff positions in House committees. Fifty-nine titles used by six or fewer panels were excluded. Pay data was collected for 17 positions with data available from at least five committees. Committees with multiple staff members with the same title had data collected for no more than two staff per committee. Staff had to hold the same position in the same committee for the entire year and not receive pay from other congressional authorities to be included in the data. The LegiStorm data tabulates every payment recorded for staff in the fiscal year, including overtime, bonuses, and other payments in addition to base salary. Pay data for Senate committee offices can be found in CRS Report R44325, while data for congressional staff in personal offices are available in CRS Report R44324 and CRS Report R44323. The data presented may have challenges that could impact findings or interpretation. The concerns raised include the representativeness of the data provided on House committee staff positions. Two categories of positions emerge: those typically held by one staff member per committee and those that may have two or more staff members. Pay information for the former is likely to be highly representative, while data for the latter may be less so due to limited collection. The data for House committee staff positions may not be fully representative as it is based on a sample of staff rather than complete data. Pay information does not consider factors like education, work experience, or job duties, leading to potential differences in compensation levels. Congressional employing authorities have discretion in setting employment terms, which can result in varying duties and pay levels for similarly titled staff. Tables in this section provide background information on House pay practices, comparative data for each position, and detailed data and visualizations. Table 2 shows maximum payable rates for House committee staff since 2001 in nominal and constant 2016 dollars. Table 3 displays cumulative percentage changes in pay in constant 2016 dollars for different positions. Tables 4-14 provide tabular pay data for each House committee staff position, with graphic displays included for additional perspectives. Graphic displays are included to show pay changes from 2011 to 2015 for various staff positions in nominal and constant 2016 dollars. Median pay changes ranged from a 14.96% increase for communications directors to a -12.24% decrease for subcommittee staff directors. Two positions saw pay increases while six saw declines. Comparisons are made to pay changes for Members of Congress. Between 2001 and 2015, all staff positions saw decreases in median pay, ranging from -9.22% for counsels to -22.32% for professional staff members. Comparisons to pay changes for Members of Congress and General Schedule, DC, are provided."
