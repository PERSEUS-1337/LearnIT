    "content": "SECTION 1. BUDGET DISCIPLINE AND ENFORCEMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003. Statutory discretionary spending limits for fiscal year 2003 are specified for various categories including nondefense discretionary, defense discretionary, highway, mass transit, and conservation spending. The budget for fiscal year 2003 includes $1,922,000,000 in new budget authority and $1,872,000,000 in outlays. A special rule amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 regarding budget authority for mass transit. Obsolete provisions in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 are repealed. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to remove certain subparagraphs and redesignate others. Additionally, amendments are made to change the year from 2002 to 2003 in specific subsections of the Act. SEC. 2. ENFORCEMENT EXTENSIONS. Extension of Budget Enforcement Act Provisions: Section 275(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to set expiration dates for certain sections, with exceptions for on-budget surpluses reported in specific fiscal years. The President must recommend pay-as-you-go enforcement procedures for on-budget surpluses in the next budget. Amendments are made to extend supermajority discipline in the Senate and adjust dates in budget control acts. SEC. 3. SENATE ENFORCEMENT. Upon enactment of this Act, the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee will allocate funds to the Senate Appropriations Committee in accordance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Senate is restricted from considering any bill providing advance appropriations, except for specific programs outlined in the accompanying joint explanatory statement. The explanatory statement accompanying this Act allows for advance appropriations totaling $23,159,000,000 of new budget authority for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In the Senate, a three-fifths vote is required to waive or appeal a point of order raised under this provision. In subsection (c), there is a prohibition on diverting the Crime Victims Fund. A point of order can be raised by a Senator under paragraph (1) as outlined in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. If a point of order is upheld against a conference report in the Senate, it will be handled according to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The term \"advance appropriation\" is defined as discretionary new budget authority in a bill for fiscal year 2003 that becomes available after 2003. In subsection (c), the purpose is to prevent diverting the Crime Victims Fund to ensure timely distribution for crime victims. Any reduction in spending from the fund in appropriations legislation will not be considered discretionary savings. In subsection (d), the Senate emphasizes the importance of maintaining the pay-as-you-go enforcement system. The Senate emphasizes the importance of maintaining the pay-as-you-go enforcement system by restricting direct spending or revenue legislation that would increase the on-budget deficit for specific time periods. The term \"direct-spending legislation\" is defined as any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that affects direct spending as defined by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, excluding concurrent resolutions on the budget and provisions that affect full funding and continuation. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 impacts the deposit insurance guarantee commitment. Estimates must use the most recent budget baseline and comply with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 requires that direct spending or revenue legislation must not increase the on-budget deficit when combined with all legislation enacted since the beginning of the calendar year. A waiver can only be granted in the Senate with a three-fifths majority vote. The Senate adopts provisions for appeals and determination of budget levels, requiring a three-fifths majority vote for appeals and estimates made by the Committee on the Budget for budget authority, outlays, and revenues. The Senate adopts provisions as part of its rulemaking power, allowing for changes to rules at any time. Section 205(g) of H.Con.Res.290 (106th Congress) is repealed. SEC. 4. REPEAL OF OBSOLETE PROVISIONS. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is repealed, along with corresponding amendments to the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is repealed, along with amendments to the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, including the removal of \"section 253\"."
