    "content": "The \"Sportsmen's Bill of Rights Act of 1997\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. The Act includes findings and policy provisions. Congress finds that fishing and hunting are important traditional recreational activities with millions of Americans participating. Survey data shows high approval rates for both activities. Anglers and hunters support wildlife management and conservation efforts in the United States. Fishing and hunting activities support wildlife management by providing funding and reducing conflicts between people and wildlife. States have agencies staffed with trained personnel for fish and wildlife management. The United States policy requires Federal agencies with authority over natural resources to support and enhance fishing and hunting opportunities. SEC. 3. TAKING OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ON FEDERAL PUBLIC LANDS. Federal public land is generally open for fishing and hunting unless restricted by the State or Federal agency for wildlife management, national security, or specific statutory requirements. This does not apply to national parks or monuments administered by the National Park Service. The section administered by the National Park Service does not prioritize fishing or hunting over other uses of Federal public land or land management priorities established by Federal law. SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF THE INTEGRITY OF SPORTSMEN'S TRUST ACCOUNTS. The Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act is amended to change the responsible Secretary to the Secretary of the Interior and restrict the use of funds for specific expenses. The Federal Aid in Fish Restoration Act is amended to specify that funding for expenses under the act cannot replace funding authorized for other expenses under the Secretary of the Interior's jurisdiction or decreased under any other provision of law. SEC. 5. EVALUATION OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT EFFECTS. No Federal agency action that may impact fishing or hunting on Federal public land can take effect without a detailed evaluation of its effects. Before such action, the agency must notify the State agency responsible for wildlife management and hold a public hearing. Individuals affected by a loss of fishing or hunting opportunities can seek judicial review in a US district court. In United States district court, individuals can seek review of the adequacy of the statement required before any Federal agency action impacting fishing or hunting on Federal public land. Agencies can close access to land for fishing and hunting in emergencies. This section does not apply to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. SEC. 6. CIVIL ACTIONS. Intervention in civil actions related to Federal public land use for fishing or hunting is allowed. The court must consider the impact on fishing and hunting access before granting relief under another Federal law. An individual licensed for fishing or hunting can bring a civil action in federal court under this Act to challenge its implementation, including seeking relief that may affect fishing or hunting opportunities. States have authority under this Act. SEC. 8 of the Act emphasizes the authority of States in regulating the taking of fish and wildlife on land within the State, including Federal public land. Federal agencies' authority on Federal public land is limited to that of a private landowner unless specified by Congress."
