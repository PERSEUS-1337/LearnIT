    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Early Access to Treatment Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that Section 506(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs intended for serious or life-threatening conditions. Additionally, Section 506(b)(1) allows the Secretary to not approve an application for a fast track product, even if it shows potential clinical benefit. The Code of Federal Regulations allows for the treatment use of new drugs under clinical investigation for serious or life-threatening conditions in patients with no alternative therapy available, to facilitate early access to promising therapies before general marketing. Applications for approval of promising therapies for desperately ill patients suffering from serious and immediately life-threatening diseases have faced unjustified delays and denials. This has resulted in patients being denied potentially life-saving treatment protocols. Such applications should be granted if they meet the statutory criteria, without discretion from the Secretary. Applications for fast track product review should be granted if they meet the statutory criteria outlined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Treatment Use Approval System is outlined in Section 3. Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allows for the treatment use of investigational drugs for patients with serious or immediately life-threatening conditions when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy is available. The treatment use of investigational drugs is allowed under Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for patients with serious or immediately life-threatening conditions. The drug must be under investigation in a clinical trial, and an application for treatment use must be filed with the FDA by a licensed practitioner. The application must specify the intended use of the drug and provide rationale for its use in the treatment of the patient. The patient's treatment protocol for the investigational drug must include the method of administration, dosages, practitioner's qualifications, familiarity with the drug's safety and effectiveness, and a detailed signed statement from the patient or guardian. The patient's treatment protocol for the investigational drug must include details on safety, risks, and informed consent. Within 30 days of application, the Secretary grants permission for treatment use. The patient's treatment protocol for the investigational drug must include details on safety, risks, and informed consent. The sponsor, licensed practitioner, and patient can determine the terms for use, including waiving liability. In emergency situations, the application for treatment use can be submitted to the Secretary by telephone or rapid communication and must be acted on within 30 days. The term 'serious' refers to a disease causing major irreversible morbidity, while 'immediately life-threatening' refers to a disease with a high likelihood of death unless interrupted or with potentially fatal outcomes. SEC. 4. REMOVING DISCRETION IN APPROVAL OF APPLICATION FOR FAST TRACK PRODUCTS. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to change \"may\" to \"shall\" in the approval process for fast track products."
