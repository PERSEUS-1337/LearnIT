    "content": "The \"Hiring Our Veterans Act of 2011\" may provide tax credits for hiring returning heroes and wounded warriors. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to increase tax credits for qualified veterans. The amendment specifies different annual amounts based on the veteran's qualification criteria. Additionally, new clauses are added to the Returning Heroes Tax Credits section for individuals with periods of unemployment. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to provide tax credits for qualified veterans with periods of unemployment. Qualified veterans are certified by designated local agencies based on specific criteria, including aggregate periods of unemployment exceeding 4 weeks or 6 months. Qualified veterans can receive tax credits if certified by a designated local agency for receiving unemployment compensation for specific periods: 6 months for certain cases and 4 weeks to less than 6 months for others. The Secretary may provide alternative certification methods for tax-exempt employers to receive work opportunity credits under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The work opportunity credit for tax-exempt employers is determined based on the amount of payroll taxes or hiring of qualified veterans. The credit amount is calculated at 26 percent instead of 40 percent for tax-exempt employers, and at 16.25 percent instead of 25 percent for certain cases. Tax-exempt employers are defined as organizations exempt from taxation under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. Tax-exempt employers, defined as organizations exempt from taxation under section 501(c), are eligible for the work opportunity credit based on payroll taxes withheld from employees. Payroll taxes include amounts withheld under sections 3401(a) and 3101(a), as well as taxes imposed on the employer under section 3111(a). The Secretary of the Treasury will pay possessions of the United States with mirror code tax systems for losses incurred due to this section. For possessions without mirror code tax systems, the Secretary will estimate and provide amounts equal to the credits that would have been given. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay possessions of the United States with mirror code tax systems for losses incurred due to this section. For possessions without mirror code tax systems, the Secretary will estimate and provide amounts equal to the credits that would have been given. Coordination with credit allowed against United States income taxes is also addressed. The subsection (e) applies to individuals eligible for tax credits or payments under specific plans in possessions of the United States, including American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands. The subsection defines a \"mirror code tax system\" as the income tax system of US possessions where residents' tax liability is based on US income tax laws. Rules similar to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 apply for payment treatment. Taxpayers must provide necessary information for the Treasury Secretary to determine. The Secretary of the Treasury needs to determine the number of veterans eligible for a tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code. The amendment applies to individuals starting work after the enactment of the Act."
