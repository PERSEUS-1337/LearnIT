The Congress findings include the Japanese attack on Clark Field, Luzon in 1941, the brave defense by US and Philippine military personnel at Bataan, and the surrender of forces on the Bataan Peninsula in 1942. During the Bataan Death March, soldiers from the United States and the Philippines were taken prisoner and forced to march 65 miles without food, water, or medical care. Thousands died from starvation, lack of medical care, exhaustion, or abuse by captors. Additionally, 1,600 more prisoners from the United States died at Camp O'Donnell. Lieutenant General Jonathan M. Wainwright surrendered Corregidor and its fortified islands to the enemy on May 6, 1942, leading to more prisoners being exposed to harsh conditions with little food or water. During the Bataan Death March, prisoners were held in substandard conditions, leading to increased disease and malnutrition. They were later transferred to Cabanatuan where mistreatment, malnutrition, and lack of medical care continued. In 1945, all prisoners were liberated. The prisoners of war from the Bataan Death March were honored for their courage and perseverance during World War II. Many have passed away, but those who remain continue to share their story. The United States is forever grateful for their sacrifice and resilience in the face of captivity and harsh conditions. The Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to the prisoners of war from the Bataan Death March for their courage and perseverance during World War II. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for the award of a gold medal to honor soldiers who were prisoners of war at Bataan/Corregidor/Luzon. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal, and it will be given to the Smithsonian Institution after the award ceremony. The gold medal awarded to honor soldiers who were prisoners of war at Bataan/Corregidor/Luzon will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research. Congress suggests that the medal should also be displayed at other locations associated with those who fought in defense of Bataan/Corregidor/Luzon and the prisoners of war. The Secretary may strike duplicates of the gold medal and sell them to cover costs. Medals struck under this Act are considered National medals. Authorization of appropriations and proceeds from sales are also addressed. SEC. 5. Authorization of Appropriations up to $30,000 from the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund for the medal under section 2. Proceeds from the sale of duplicate bronze medals under section 3 will be deposited into the same fund."
