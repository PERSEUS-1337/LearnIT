    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Global Internet Freedom Act of 2003\". Congress finds that freedom of speech, press, and association are fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including the right to communicate freely via the Internet. The Internet is a powerful tool for democratization and the free exchange of ideas. Unrestricted access to news and information online serves as a check on repressive regimes worldwide. Countries like Burma, Cuba, North Korea, and China actively restrict their citizens' access to the Internet to control the flow of information. Intergovernmental, nongovernmental, and media organizations report authoritarian governments blocking, jamming, and monitoring Internet access using methods like firewalls, surveillance, and blacklists. The Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, along with many other news sources, are being jammed by repressive governments. The US has used anti-jamming technologies since the 1940s to ensure broadcasting access in nations with restrictive governments. However, only modest efforts have been made to counter Internet censorship, with some funding allocated for technology to combat jamming by the People's Republic of China. The success of United States policy in supporting freedom of speech, press, and association requires new initiatives to defeat totalitarian and authoritarian controls on news and information over the Internet, especially in countries like the People's Republic of China where there is no meaningful United States support for Internet freedom. The purpose of new initiatives is to defeat totalitarian and authoritarian controls on news and information over the Internet, especially in countries like China where there is no meaningful support for Internet freedom. The Act aims to establish a global Internet freedom policy, counter Internet censorship by repressive regimes, develop technology to protect Internet freedom, allocate resources for technology development, and involve the private sector in implementing secure technologies. The Act aims to promote democracy and freedom by using business transactions and virtual meeting spaces. It also seeks to pressure repressive governments guilty of Internet censorship and persecution of their citizens. SEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES TO DEFEAT INTERNET JAMMING AND CENSORSHIP. The Office of Global Internet Freedom is established within the International Broadcasting Bureau to combat state-sponsored internet jamming and persecution of internet users. $30,000,000 is authorized for the Office for fiscal years 2004 and 2005. All federal departments and agencies must cooperate with the Office's strategy to combat internet censorship. The Director of the Office of Global Internet Freedom must report to Congress annually on state interference with Internet use, including countries practicing censorship and the technological means used for blocking. The Director reports annually to Congress on state interference with Internet use, including censorship methods. The Act does not authorize US interference with foreign censorship that aligns with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Sense of Congress is to denounce governments that restrict Internet access, submit a resolution condemning Internet censorship at the UN, and deploy technologies to combat censorship."
