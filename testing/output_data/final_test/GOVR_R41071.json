    "content": "Congress and the Executive Branch view the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) as crucial for promoting liberalized international trade and investment in Asia and globally. APEC stands out for its consensus-based approach to reducing trade barriers and facilitating trade, known as \"open regionalism.\" Apart from trade goals, APEC serves as a platform for the US to engage in discussions on non-economic issues like security and human rights in the Asia-Pacific region. China's rise as a major competitor to the United States in the Asia-Pacific region has challenged US leadership. Suggestions include increasing involvement in Asian trade discussions, elevating the importance of APEC, and reformulating APEC's mission to focus more on trade facilitation and economic integration. APEC, while offering benefits like including Taiwan and Hong Kong, faces criticism for slow progress in achieving trade goals. Some experts doubt APEC will fulfill its goals due to voluntary compliance. Suggestions include shifting US trade policy towards formal trade associations like the TPP. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 called for a comprehensive strategy to address China's emergence economically, diplomatically, and militarily, with a focus on revitalizing U.S. engagement in East Asia through APEC. The Obama Administration also sees APEC as a valuable forum for advancing U.S. interests in Asia. The Obama Administration views APEC as a valuable forum for advancing U.S. interests in Asia, with officials like Kurt Tong and Ron Kirk emphasizing its importance as a key venue for multilateral engagement on economic matters. The role of APEC in future U.S. trade policy in Asia remains uncertain. The Bush Administration viewed APEC as a tool for regional economic integration in Asia, particularly through the concept of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). This was seen as a counterforce to ASEAN's efforts for an \"Asian only\" integration model. The Obama Administration's interest in the TPP raised questions about its commitment to APEC's vision. The future role of APEC in U.S. trade policy is uncertain, especially regarding the FTAAP. The 111th Congress may play a critical role in APEC's development by considering financial support, U.S. commitments, and increasing oversight of APEC-related activities. Questions remain about whether APEC has effectively advanced U.S. interests in Asia. APEC, established in 1989, is an association of 21 member economies in the Asia-Pacific region working together to promote economic growth. The organizational structure of APEC is unique, making it challenging for the US to advance its positions on various issues through its activities in the organization. APEC, established in 1989, aims to promote economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region. It operates as a cooperative forum where decisions are made by consensus, and members commit to voluntary trade liberalization policies. The organization's \"Bogor Goals\" set targets for free and open trade by 2010 for industrialized economies and 2020 for developing economies. The APEC approach to trade liberalization emphasizes voluntary commitments over obligatory ones to facilitate easier implementation. By establishing a common vision, APEC aims to achieve consensus views among members for rapid progress towards organizational goals, avoiding confrontational negotiations seen in traditional trade agreements. The APEC approach to trade liberalization focuses on voluntary commitments to facilitate progress towards organizational goals. Critics warn that the lack of shared objectives may hinder resolving differences and achieving the Bogor Goals. Compliance requirements are lacking, allowing members to reverse trade commitments during economic downturns. APEC members focus on trade liberalization through voluntary commitments and cooperation in areas such as merchandise and service trade, international investment, and ECOTECH. The Osaka Action Agenda emphasizes principles like non-discrimination and transparency to achieve the Bogor Goals. President Obama attended the November 2009 APEC meetings in Singapore during a trip to Asia. President Obama attended the 2009 APEC meetings in Singapore with a strong U.S. delegation including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. This gesture was well received by other APEC members who had criticized the previous administration's lack of high-level representation. The main focus was on the Leaders' Meeting and its associated statements. The 2009 APEC meetings in Singapore included a Leaders' Meeting and a Ministerial Meeting, where discussions centered on economic growth, trade issues, and non-trade issues like countering terrorism and ensuring food security. APEC leaders endorsed G-20 goals of strong, sustainable, and balanced growth, adding the criteria of inclusive economic growth. The APEC leaders in 2009 agreed to unwind global imbalances, adopt policies for inclusive economic growth, broaden access to opportunities, protect the environment, resist protectionism, support the Doha Development Agenda, explore the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific, enhance cooperation, combat corruption, and improve governance. They also set a target to reduce energy intensity by 25% by 2030. APEC members pledged to focus on education, worker retraining, and support for SMEs to foster inclusive growth. They also committed to reducing barriers to trade for environmental goods and services, promoting sustainable growth, and enhancing regional economic integration through various initiatives. As part of APEC's integration program, members were developing business-friendly rules of origin and consistent policies for trade in services. Ministers focused on lowering business costs, facilitating investment, protecting intellectual property rights, aligning national standards with international specifications, and improving transport, logistical, and digital connectivity. Concerns about human security included food security and safety, with periodic reports of food shortages in Asia leading to export restrictions on staple grains. APEC members expressed concerns about food shortages in Asia leading to export restrictions on staple grains. They also addressed issues such as unsafe food products, H1N1 virus cooperation, governance improvement, gender equality promotion, tourism industry development, and strengthening the APEC Secretariat in their joint declaration. The APEC finance ministers issued a joint statement to support strong, sustainable, and balanced growth. They agreed to coordinate on implementing exit strategies based on the pace of recovery in different economies and work with international financial institutions to evaluate economic policies. They also committed to strengthening financial supervision, capital market development, and accepting market-oriented exchange rates. The 2009 APEC meeting included a U.S.-ASEAN meeting and bilateral meetings between President Obama and other APEC leaders. The U.S.-ASEAN meeting reaffirmed the new U.S. policy towards Burma, maintaining sanctions but open to high-level talks with the ruling military junta. During the 2009 APEC meeting, leaders agreed to hold a second meeting in 2010 and discussed ASEAN's plan for an ASEAN Community by 2015. President Obama had bilateral meetings with leaders from Russia, Singapore, and Indonesia, focusing on topics like nuclear disarmament and Iran. During the 2009 APEC meeting, President Obama met with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee and discussed global economic recovery, regional economic integration, and the future role of APEC. The U.S.-Indonesia bilateral meeting covered topics such as climate change, educational cooperation, trade, and investment relations. The media focused on the global economic recovery and the U.S.'s intention to negotiate TPP membership, overshadowing the upcoming milestone for the Bogor Goals in 2010. In 2010, APEC aimed to achieve free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific by hosting meetings in Japan. The U.S. favored a forward-looking approach for future APEC meetings. President Obama announced the 2011 Leaders' Meeting in Honolulu, while Russia planned the 2012 meeting in Vladivostok. The Obama Administration outlined its trade policy in Asia in late 2009. The Obama Administration's trade policy in Asia shows continuity with past administrations but also some differences. While supporting trade liberalization goals, there is a shift in style and focus. Unlike the Bush Administration, Obama's team has shown sustained interest in the region, with senior officials visiting besides the President. This broader engagement has been well-received in Asia. The Obama Administration's interest in Asia goes beyond China and North Korea, with a focus on trade and investment liberalization. There is uncertainty on how various initiatives form a consistent trade policy compatible with regional goals. The TPP talks may overshadow APEC as the primary vehicle for trade advancement in the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP talks are replacing APEC as the main vehicle for trade liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Demetrios Marantis aims for the TPP to create economic integration across the region, while also acknowledging APEC's role in addressing trade barriers. The United States, as host of APEC events in 2011, sees an opportunity to push for a bolder vision and eliminate barriers to trade and investment. Congress has been notified of discussions with current TPP members and interested parties like Australia, Peru, and Vietnam. The TPP talks, involving current members and interested parties like Australia, Peru, and Vietnam, are causing tension with APEC's trade liberalization approach. The TPP is a formal trade agreement that benefits only parties involved, protecting domestic markets. The Obama Administration's trade policy in Asia also involves developing relations with ASEAN. The Obama Administration sees APEC as the best regional mechanism for economic cooperation. The United States still aims for an Asia-Pacific free trade area as a long-term objective, but is determining the best approach tactically and organizationally. At a seminar following the APEC meetings, USTR Kirk highlighted U.S. interest in TPP as a model for future trade relations and updating policy in response to the global economic environment. Despite reassurances about APEC's importance, there is a perceived shift towards TPP in the short-run. APEC's unique approach to trade liberalization is reflected in its organizational structure, with a small Secretariat in Singapore overseeing various groups. The APEC organizational structure includes committees like the Committee on Trade and Investment, the Economic Committee, and the Steering Committee on ECOTECH. APEC leaders meet annually to set goals and make major decisions, with Taiwan sending a special representative due to China's objections. The Leaders' Meeting was first held in 1993 on Blake Island, near Seattle, Washington. The APEC Leaders' Meeting focuses on economic issues but also includes discussions on international security and human rights. Decisions are first considered in Ministerial Meetings throughout the year, covering various areas such as trade, finance, and energy. Recommendations from these meetings are made to the Leaders' Meeting, where major decisions are finalized. Senior Officials coordinate under the direction of APEC ministers. The Senior Officials in APEC coordinate activities of committees, working groups, and task forces under the direction of APEC ministers. Meetings are held three or four times a year. The current U.S. Senior Official for APEC is Kurt Tong. The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) advises on APEC agenda implementation and business-related issues. ABAC can also comment on Ministerial Meeting recommendations. APEC has ten working groups focusing on specific areas of cooperation and facilitation. The Committee on Trade and Investment plays a key role in implementing the Bogor goals. APEC has ten working groups focusing on areas such as Trade and Investment Data, Trade Promotion, Industrial Science and Technology, Human Resources Development, Energy Cooperation, Marine Resource Conservation, Telecommunications, Transportation, Tourism, and Fisheries. Each group is coordinated by one or more members. The APEC chair rotates annually among member countries. Decisions within APEC are made based on consensus. APEC operates based on consensus with representatives from all 21 members in committees and working groups. Members can delay or refrain from actions without facing sanctions. Decisions must be implemented according to the Osaka Action Agenda. APEC actions occur at three levels: individual member actions, actions within APEC, and collective actions with other organizations. Individual Action Plans (IAPs) are submitted annually by members at the Ministerial Meeting to outline trade advancement steps. APEC operates based on consensus with representatives from all 21 members in committees and working groups. Individual Action Plans (IAPs) are submitted annually by members at the Ministerial Meeting to outline trade advancement steps towards the achievement of the Bogor Goals. IAPs are organized along sectoral and topical lines, fostering comparability, transparency, and cooperation. APEC's internal actions involve research on trade liberalization, exchange of best practices, and standardization of policies related to international trade and investment. Working groups may create collective action plans (CAPs) to summarize member IAPs or play a more active role in certain cases. The APEC working group promotes trade liberalization through collective actions, such as the APEC Business Travel Card (ABTC) scheme. The ABTC allows fast-track entry for business travelers at major airports and visa-free entry among member countries. The United States became a transitional member in 2007, providing expedited visa appointments and immigration processing. APEC's collective actions focus on advancing trade and investment liberalization in multilateral organizations. APEC's recent focus has been on completing the Doha Round of the WTO, with commitments to reaching an ambitious agreement. Key areas include trade-distorting farm support, market access in agriculture, industrial tariff cuts, and services trade openings. The future challenge for APEC is its relevance in the creation of a trade and investment association in the Asia-Pacific region, amidst competing integration models. ASEAN has its own FTA called AFTA and has concluded FTAs with various trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region. There are proposals for an Asian economic community similar to the EU. The expanding TPP could potentially overshadow APEC as a platform for trade liberalization. The United States may find TPP's administrative process easier to understand than APEC's \"open regionalism.\" APEC has been seen as a possible vehicle for liberalizing regional and global trade, with methods including forming coalitions during WTO negotiations and the growth of Asia-Pacific bilateral trade agreements. The growth of bilateral trade agreements (BTAs) among APEC members is seen as a complex and competitive form of liberalization. The trade diplomacy in East Asia has become intricate, with various models of FTAs that cannot be integrated. Experts suggest that this unsystematic process could eventually lead to the formation of an APEC-wide regional trade agreement (RTA) similar to the proposed FTAAP. The growth of bilateral trade agreements (BTAs) among APEC members is complex, with some seeing ASEAN's FTAs as a potential base for an Asian RTA. However, experts also view the proliferation of BTAs as a barrier to trade liberalization due to fragmentation and WTO-incompatibility. The proliferation of bilateral trade agreements (BTAs) in the Asia-Pacific region is seen as hindering trade liberalization. These agreements often result in quick-fix deals, carve out politically sensitive sectors, and struggle to address domestic regulatory barriers. Power dynamics can lead to asymmetrical deals, potentially institutionalizing trade barriers. Concerns exist that merging BTAs into an Asia-Pacific RTA may not be effective, with some agreements being criticized as falling short of true free trade. The rising number of BTAs in the Asia-Pacific region is hindering the formation of a FTAAP and progress in the Doha Round, despite efforts by APEC. Scholars are skeptical about APEC's ability to contribute to regional economic integration, citing challenges in harmonizing heterogeneous bilateral FTAs. The stalled Doha Round is seen as further hindering the creation of a FTAAP. The stalled Doha Round is leading to more bilateral trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region, hindering the formation of a FTAAP. Experts suggest the United States should advocate for a more inclusive FTAAP to counteract this trend and improve prospects for the Doha Round. This could also help limit the growth of BTAs in Asia. Supporters of creating a FTAAP believe it could limit the growth of BTAs in Asia and ensure new BTAs are less discriminatory and WTO-compatible. APEC is seen playing four roles in this new regional dynamic: organizing meetings, reinforcing free trade goals, developing model measures for FTAs, and promoting WTO-plus FTAs. Critics argue that APEC lacks enforcement mechanisms and is criticized for being all talk and no action. APEC has implemented trade liberalization measures over the last 20 years, leading to significant trade growth in the region. These measures include substantial reductions in tariff rates and trade facilitation reforms. A 2005 study found that average tariff rates among APEC members decreased from 16.9% in 1989 to 5.5% in 2004, with nearly half of all tariff lines set at 5% or less. Non-tariff trade barriers have also been eliminated by APEC members through voluntary measures. APEC has significantly reduced tariff and non-tariff trade barriers over the last five years, leading to growth in regional trade. Trade facilitation measures have helped standardize trade documents and reduce transaction costs by 5% between 2002 and 2006. APEC members committed to further reducing transaction costs by 5% by 2010. APEC aims to reduce transaction costs by 5% by 2010 to foster international trade through liberalization and facilitation. A comparison of APEC exports shows growth outpacing global exports from 1981, with noticeable downturns in 1998 and 2001 due to financial crises and trade attacks. Since 1981, APEC's exports have consistently outpaced global exports, with notable downturns in 1998 and 2001 due to financial crises and trade attacks. A similar trend is seen in import growth rates within APEC and globally, with a divergence starting in 1981 and continuing until 1997. The Asian financial crisis in 1997 led to a sharp decline in APEC and global imports, followed by further drops after the attacks on September 11, 2001. Import levels saw modest growth in 2002 for both APEC and the world. Since 1981, APEC's exports have consistently outpaced global exports, with notable downturns in 1998 and 2001 due to financial crises and trade attacks. Import levels grew modestly in 2002 for both APEC and the world, and then accelerated starting in 2003, with APEC's import growth rate outstripping that of the world. APEC's trade growth may be due to its members' higher economic growth rates, such as China and Vietnam, rather than just trade liberalization and facilitation. The higher growth rate of trade among APEC members may reflect changes in the global supply chain, driven by major retailers and multinational corporations sourcing products internationally. This leads to complex multinational supply chain networks, common among Asian APEC members, possibly exceeding the total value of final goods produced. These networks may have been intentionally established due to APEC's low trade barriers. The growth of intra-APEC trade is driven by multinational supply chain networks with final assembly operations in China and parts sourced from various Asian nations. Concerns arise about possible trade diversion as intra-APEC trade expands faster than total APEC trade, possibly due to lower trade barriers and the spread of RTAs and FTAs among APEC members. Higher intra-APEC trade expansion may divert trade from non-APEC nations as members form preferential agreements. APEC's economic growth could suffer from the global financial crisis, impacting trade in intermediate goods within Asian supply chains. Initially focused on economics, APEC avoided political issues to prevent division among key members like China, Japan, Russia, Taiwan, and the United States. In 1995, APEC members debated expanding to include regional security issues, but consensus was to discuss security in other forums. However, security was added to the agenda in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks, focusing on terrorism, disease, and disasters. APEC's interest in human security in 2009 focused on enhancing food security and responding to the H1N1 pandemic. The organization aimed to ensure reliable access to safe and affordable food and build regional capacity to address outbreaks. APEC is recognized for promoting open trade and economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and serves as a forum for addressing U.S. concerns on human security issues. Congressional involvement with APEC has centered on financial support and oversight. The U.S. Congress focused on financial support and oversight of APEC, authorizing direct financial contributions and overseeing U.S. participation. The FY2010 budget allocated $900,000 annually for APEC, with additional funding for preparation work for the 2011 APEC meetings. Eligibility for a loan guarantee program was extended to non-communist APEC member nations. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 included provisions for fairer trade in agricultural products through negotiations with organizations like the World Trade Organization, Americas, and APEC. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 also highlighted the importance of economic and regional forums like APEC. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum and other regional fora have been utilized to combat the financing of terrorism. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 emphasized the need for a comprehensive strategy to address China's emergence economically, diplomatically, and militarily, promote trade relations, and encourage adherence to international norms. This strategy should include actions to revitalize U.S. engagement in East Asia with a regional focus. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) is important for U.S. engagement in East Asia. Bills introduced during the 111th Congress focus on U.S. policy towards APEC, including the establishment of an \"APEC Business Travel Program\" and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act emphasizing the importance of engagement in Asia for U.S. foreign policy. The President should appoint \"APEC Coordinators\" in relevant departments and agencies to set guidelines for participation at APEC. The legislation also requires the appointment of a small business liaison to APEC, creation of a dedicated webpage for communication with small businesses, and submission of a report on hosting APEC meetings in 2011. The United States-China Diplomatic Expansion Act of 2009 (H.R. 2311) aims to increase funding for U.S. relations with China and allocate $3 million for APEC in fiscal year 2010. Proposed legislation like the Energy Security Through Transparency Act of 2009 (S. 1700) seeks to align APEC members' regulations with those of the United States for extractive industries. Issues related to APEC could arise in various ways in the 111th Congress. Congress may address issues related to U.S. financial support for APEC and express preferences on policy issues and oversight concerns. This includes determining funding levels for APEC independently from previous appropriations and influencing the agenda and content of the 2011 APEC meetings in the United States. The 110th Congress appropriated funding for the 2011 APEC meetings, but additional funding is needed. President Obama has requested $38.220 million for hosting the meetings in 2011. APEC is seen as a vehicle for promoting free trade and negotiations may raise issues related to labor rights and environmental protection. Successful completion of the Doha Development Round is a high priority. The Obama Administration prioritizes the completion of the Doha Development Round, with APEC being a key ally. Congress could utilize APEC to break the current stalemate. Apart from economic and trade issues, Congress may also address human security concerns related to U.S. involvement with APEC, such as the APEC Business Travel Card and health issues. APEC serves as a crucial forum for the U.S. to engage with the Asia-Pacific region geopolitically. The United States can engage the Asia-Pacific region through APEC, a forum that includes a wide range of Asian economies. Some experts believe APEC could advance U.S. interests in the region, while others think mechanisms like the TPP may be more effective.
