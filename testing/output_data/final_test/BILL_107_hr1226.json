    "content": "The Act titled \"Young Witness Assistance Act of 2001\" is established for the purpose of assisting young witnesses. Congress finds that witness and victim intimidation among juveniles and young adults is a serious concern for law enforcement. Thousands of young people witness violent crimes each year, hindering efforts to bring perpetrators to justice. Prosecutors and police face challenges when young witnesses refuse to testify due to fear of retaliation. Young witnesses may be reluctant to come forward due to fear, trauma, personal connections with perpetrators, geographic proximity, or membership in vulnerable groups. Cooperation of young victims and witnesses is crucial for the criminal justice system to operate successfully. Most states lack adequate resources for juvenile and young adult witnesses. The Act aims to support juvenile and young adult witnesses who assist in bringing violent criminals to justice by encouraging the development of policies and programs by State and local prosecutors and law enforcement authorities. The Act defines key terms such as \"Director,\" \"juvenile,\" \"young adult,\" and \"State.\" It authorizes the Director to provide grants for juvenile and young adult witness assistance programs. Eligibility criteria are outlined for State and local prosecutors and law enforcement agencies. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY. State and local prosecutors and law enforcement officials must submit an application to the Director and assure the development of a witness assistance program for juvenile and young adult witnesses and their families. SEC. 6. USE OF FUNDS. Grants under this Act can be used for assessing needs of juvenile witnesses, setting program goals, and providing various witness assistance services like counseling, education, and protective services for young witnesses and their families facing threats from perpetrators. Community outreach and school-based initiatives are important for maintaining public awareness and support in addressing threats from perpetrators or their associates. SEC. 7. REPORTS.\n\nState and local prosecutors and law enforcement agencies receiving funds must submit progress reports to the Director by May 1st each year. The Director must then report to Congress by July 1st detailing grant awards, recipient activities, statistical information, and program evaluations.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n$3,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2004 to implement this Act."
