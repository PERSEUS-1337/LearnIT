    "content": "In the late 1990s, South Korea became a significant market for beef exporters, especially the United States. By 2003, U.S. beef exports to South Korea totaled $815 million, accounting for 21% of all U.S. beef products shipped worldwide. Boneless beef products made up 55% of the total, bone-in beef exports were 36%, and beef variety meats were 8%. After the discovery of mad cow disease in a Canadian-born cow in Washington State in December 2003, South Korea and other countries banned imports of U.S. beef. BSE is a fatal disease in cattle that can be transmitted to humans, causing a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It took two years for the U.S. government to negotiate partial access to the Korean market, with South Korea agreeing to a protocol in January 2006. In January 2006, South Korea agreed to allow imports of U.S. boneless beef only from cattle under 30 months old, due to concerns about mad cow disease. Difficulties in exporting beef to Korea affected negotiations for the KORUS FTA, with high-level meetings held to resolve the issue before the March 2007 deadline. In April 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun promised to open the Korean beef market based on OIE recommendations. The OIE classified the United States as a \"controlled risk\" country for mad cow disease in May 2007. The USDA requested South Korea to amend import requirements for U.S. beef due to effective BSE management measures in the U.S. U.S. boneless beef exports resumed in late April 2007 after South Korea's animal health regulatory agency assessed BSE risks and negotiated a revised bilateral agreement. In late April 2007, U.S. beef exports to South Korea resumed after a BSE-infected cow was discovered in 2003, leading to a ban on imports. However, inspections were halted in 2007 due to the discovery of prohibited bones, leading to formal negotiations to revise the 2006 protocol. Beef shipments from Australia and New Zealand increased during this period to meet South Korean demand. Shipments from Australia and New Zealand increased significantly to meet South Korean demand previously supplied by U.S. beef exporters. In 2007, both countries accounted for 92% of South Korea's beef imports, compared to 29% in 2003. U.S. boneless beef exports to South Korea resumed in late April 2007 but were halted in early October 2007 due to bone fragments being found. South Korea ranked as the fourth-largest market for U.S. beef in 2007, with sales of $119 million or 25,165 MT. The U.S. aimed for full access for all beef exports into South Korea's market. South Korea proposed a two-phased approach to reopening its market to U.S. beef, allowing imports of boneless and bone-in beef cuts from cattle less than 30 months old. The U.S. argued that its beef is safe and meets international standards to prevent BSE. South Korea accounted for a significant portion of U.S. beef exports in 2007 before the ban. The United States and South Korea reached an agreement on sanitary rules for beef imports, allowing for imports of all cuts of U.S. beef from cattle of any age as long as specified risk materials are removed. However, a private-sector arrangement limits sales of U.S. beef to cattle less than 30 months old for an unspecified time period. The April 2008 agreement between the United States and South Korea expanded the products covered by the January 2006 protocol, allowing imports of U.S. beef from cattle of any age as long as specified risk materials are removed. Prohibitions include mechanically recovered and separated meat, as well as advanced meat recovery products from cattle over 30 months old. Other provisions detail which beef products can enter South Korea, with quarantine inspection steps prescribed. The agreement between the United States and South Korea in April 2008 expanded the products covered by the January 2006 protocol, allowing imports of U.S. beef from cattle of any age as long as specified risk materials are removed. The agreement also outlines steps for South Korea's quarantine inspection agency and the U.S. agency to address any issues found in shipments from U.S. meat firms, without halting all U.S. beef exports to South Korea. Additionally, requirements for U.S. beef processing plants and the Food Safety and Inspection Service are specified for selling beef and beef products to South Korea. A private-sector deal in June 2008 stated that only U.S. beef from cattle under 30 months of age will be sold to Korea as a transitional measure. The U.S. government will meet the U.S. meat industry's request for Korea's beef importers under a Quality System Assessment program. This program will verify that beef for Korea is from cattle under 30 months old and will be voluntary for beef processing plants. Korean protests against the beef agreement were sparked by safety concerns and rumors spread online. Opposition parties and farmers called for the agreement to be renegotiated or scrapped. Opponents in Korea called for the rejection of the KORUS FTA due to concerns about mad cow disease and the government's rushed deal. This led to political challenges for the new president. The government tried to address public pressure by engaging in talks with the U.S. to address health and safety risks without renegotiating the beef agreement. On June 21, 2008, South Korea and the United States confirmed an arrangement allowing Korean firms to import U.S. beef from cattle under 30 months old. The OIE recommends certain conditions to prevent BSE, regardless of the age of the cattle slaughtered for beef. The U.S. argues it complies with OIE guidelines. The U.S. and South Korea reached an agreement allowing Korean firms to import U.S. beef from cattle under 30 months old. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about the deal, stating that it deviates from international safety standards and sets a risky precedent for future negotiations. South Korean officials portrayed the agreement as addressing public fears about U.S. beef safety. The controversy over the safety of U.S. beef in South Korea led to the resignation of high-ranking officials and parliamentary inquiries. The KORUS FTA would gradually eliminate tariffs on U.S. beef imports, but a controversial livestock sector bill was debated, which included a ban on beef imports in case of BSE-infected cattle. The KORUS FTA would gradually eliminate tariffs on U.S. beef imports in South Korea. Additional tariffs could be imposed temporarily in response to import surges. The protective safeguard mechanism would no longer apply after year 16. Tariffs on beef offals and other beef products would also be eliminated in 15 years. The phase-out of tariffs and safeguards could increase U.S. beef exports by $600 million to $1.8 billion. The KORUS FTA would gradually eliminate tariffs on U.S. beef imports in South Korea, potentially increasing U.S. beef exports by $600 million to $1.8 billion. The American Farm Bureau Federation projects higher U.S. beef sales in the South Korean market, but acknowledges that South Korean preferences for grass-fed Australian beef may limit long-term market share growth. USDA's Economic Research Service estimates that U.S. beef exports would be $563 million higher under KORUS, accounting for a significant portion of additional U.S. agricultural imports. The KORUS FTA's beef market access provisions require addressing South Korea's concerns about U.S. beef safety. Cattle producers are divided on the agreement, with NCBA and USCA in favor, and R-CALF USA opposing it. South Korea implemented the beef agreement in June 2008, inspecting U.S. beef shipments in cold storage since 2007. Since fall 2007, U.S. beef has been stored in Korea. USDA agencies implemented procedures to meet Korea's import requirements. Each U.S. beef shipment must have an export certificate from FSIS confirming participation in two USDA programs. The Export Verification program outlines product requirements for entry into Korea, with 58 suppliers currently approved. The Quality System Assessment program verifies beef from cattle under 30 months of age, with 54 plants approved. In 2008, U.S. beef exports to South Korea totaled $294 million or 57,269 MT. Shipments accelerated from mid-July to early October to meet consumer demand, but fell through year-end due to unsold inventories. Three large Korean retail chains began selling U.S. beef in late November, with strong sales in December driven by discount pricing. In 2008, U.S. beef exports to South Korea reached $294 million or 57,269 MT, with bone-in beef products contributing $118 million. Compared to 2007, exports increased by 148% in value and 128% in quantity. South Korea ranked as the fourth-largest market for U.S. beef, with a market share of 15%. In 2009, exports dropped to $216 million or 55,633 MT, a decrease of 27% in value and 3% in quantity. Despite the decline, the U.S. market share rose to 26%. In the first quarter of 2009, U.S. beef exports to South Korea fell as importers reduced their inventories. Department store chains resumed sales due to easing public opposition. In the following quarters, exports stabilized at a lower level due to household spending cuts and competition from cheaper Australian beef. In 2010, U.S. beef exports to South Korea increased significantly, reaching $518 million and 112,757 MT. This growth was attributed to promotional efforts to rebuild consumer confidence, lower retail prices for imported beef, and a higher market share of U.S. beef in South Korea. U.S. beef sales in South Korea have increased due to marketing efforts and promotional campaigns. Despite the growth, there is still a significant number of consumers who have not resumed buying U.S. beef. Efforts are being made to target this group and encourage them to purchase U.S. beef again. Additionally, while upscale restaurants are selling U.S. beef, smaller establishments are hesitant to include it on their menus. During the first five months of 2011, U.S. beef exports to South Korea saw a significant increase in both value and quantity. This surge was a response to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in late 2010, which led to a decrease in Korean meat supplies. Importers quickly moved to meet the demand, resulting in a rise in U.S. beef shipments during the first quarter. During the first quarter of 2011, U.S. beef exports to South Korea increased significantly in response to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Shipments have since returned to 2010 levels. The protests against the beef agreement in 2008 had lasting effects on U.S.-South Korean relations and President Lee's political standing. The uproar over Lee's decisions on beef ruined his \"honeymoon\" period and affected his policy goals. President Lee lacked political capital to eliminate the beef ban, impacting U.S.-South Korean relations. The domestic uproar in Korea increased the perception that Lee was too accommodating to the United States. The 2008 bilateral beef agreement was a significant step in the U.S. government's effort to regain access to South Korea's beef market. While lifting the beef ban was initially crucial for the KORUS FTA, other opposition, particularly over auto trade provisions, made it less sufficient. President Obama's announcement in June 2010 further complicated the passage of the trade agreement. The U.S. government consulted with Congress and stakeholders to resolve issues related to access for U.S. beef in the South Korean market as part of the KORUS FTA. Negotiations focused on achieving full access for U.S. beef, with the main challenge being how to get South Korea to accept all U.S. beef regardless of the age of the cattle when slaughtered. The requirement to remove specified risk materials during processing was not a point of contention. The U.S. government aims to secure full market access for U.S. beef in South Korea under the KORUS FTA. Negotiations involve ensuring access for all U.S. beef cuts regardless of cattle age. Senator Baucus insists on this condition for ratifying the agreement. Senator Baucus emphasizes the need for full market access for U.S. beef in South Korea under the KORUS FTA, citing OIE guidelines that support importing U.S. beef from cattle of any age. The U.S. cattle and beef industry is eager for the FTA to take effect to benefit from reduced tariffs on beef muscle cuts in South Korea. The U.S. beef industry is concerned about a 40% tariff on beef muscle cut imports in South Korea, fearing a loss of market share gains. They are cautious about pushing for full beef access too quickly to avoid public backlash. Securing tariff reductions for U.S. beef would provide a price advantage over competitors like Australia and New Zealand. In negotiations with South Korea, the U.S. is focused on revising auto provisions rather than discussing the beef issue. President Obama aims to ensure full access for U.S. beef in the Korean market. Senator Baucus expresses disappointment over the lack of progress in addressing barriers to American beef exports. He refuses to support the KORUS FTA until South Korea opens up its beef market. Senator Baucus will not support the KORUS FTA until South Korea opens its beef market. Despite concerns, some Senators are positive about the deal and look forward to its consideration in 2011. Meat industry groups support the trade agreement, expecting increased exports to South Korea. Beef interests also back the deal and call for continued efforts to secure full market access. Korean negotiators' stance on the beef issue is influenced by past anti-beef protests in 2008, leading to a rejection of discussions on the matter during recent negotiations. In final talks for the supplemental agreement, Presidents Obama and Lee confirmed no more discussions on ending age limits of U.S. cattle for beef. The Administration announced measures to address the beef access issue in preparation for submitting the KORUS FTA to Congress. USTR's Ron Kirk committed to requesting consultations with South Korea on opening Korea's market to all ages and cuts of U.S. beef. The USDA announced a $1 million award to the USMEF for promoting U.S. beef sales in South Korea. Senator Baucus welcomed the steps and expressed support for the KORUS FTA, along with working on a package of trade measures including FTAs and trade adjustment assistance."
