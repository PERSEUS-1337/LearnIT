    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bear Protection Act of 2001\". Congress finds that all 8 extant species of bear are listed on Appendix I or II of CITES, allowing for stricter domestic measures to combat illegal trade in bear parts, particularly addressing the cruel confinement of bears in Asia for bile extraction. The wild Asian bear population has declined due to habitat loss and poaching for bear viscera used in traditional medicines and cosmetics. American bears have also been poached for their viscera, posing a threat to certain populations. Prohibitions are in place against the importation, exportation, and interstate trade of bear viscera and products containing it. Prohibitions are in place to prevent the decline of bear populations from commercial trade in bear viscera. The Act aims to protect bear species by prohibiting trade in bear viscera and products containing it, promoting international efforts to stop such trade, and ensuring adequate legislation for domestic trade. In this Act, \"bear viscera\" refers to the body fluids or internal organs of a bear, excluding blood or brains. \"Import\" means bringing something into the United States. \"Person\" includes individuals, corporations, and government entities. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"State\" includes various territories and possessions of the United States. \"Transport\" means moving or conveying by any means. SEC. 5. PROHIBITED ACTS. In general, it is prohibited to import, export, sell, or possess bear viscera or any product containing bear viscera in the United States. However, there is an exception for wildlife law enforcement purposes. Importing, exporting, or transporting bear viscera is allowed for wildlife law enforcement purposes with a valid permit under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. SEC. 6. PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT. (a) Criminal Penalties: Violating section 5 can result in a fine, imprisonment for up to 1 year, or both.\n(b) Civil Penalties: A person who knowingly violates section 5 may face a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per violation, assessed and collected similar to penalties under the Endangered Species Act.\n(c) Seizure and Forfeiture: Any illegal bear viscera or related items can be seized and forfeited. Any items purchased, possessed, transported, delivered, or received in violation of this section shall be seized and forfeited to the United States. Regulations will be issued by the Secretary to enforce this section, with enforcement activities similar to those under the Endangered Species Act. Penalty amounts collected will be used in accordance with the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981. The Secretary will engage in discussions with relevant parties to address bear viscera trade and coordinate efforts to protect bears. The Act does not affect state regulation of bear populations or lawful bear hunting."
