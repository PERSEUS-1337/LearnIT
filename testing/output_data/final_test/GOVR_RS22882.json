    "content": "In 2005, Indiana implemented a Voter ID Law requiring citizens to present a government-issued photo ID when voting in person. Exceptions include absentee ballots by mail and residents of state-licensed facilities. Indigent voters or those with religious objections can cast provisional ballots. Photo ID is not needed for voter registration, and free IDs are available for qualified voters. The Indiana Democratic Party and other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against state officials over the Voter ID Law, alleging it violates the Fourteenth Amendment by burdening the right to vote and disenfranchising certain groups. The State of Indiana intervened in defense of the law. The federal district court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in a case regarding Indiana's Voter ID Law, stating that there was no evidence of Indiana residents being unable to vote due to the law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit affirmed this ruling, allowing the Democratic Party to challenge the law's constitutionality. The 7th Circuit ruled that the Democratic Party had standing to challenge the constitutionality of Indiana's Voter ID Law. The court found that the law did not deter voters and that the burden on voters was balanced by reducing voter fraud. The Supreme Court affirmed this decision in a 6-3 vote, stating that there was insufficient evidence to support a facial attack on the law's constitutionality. The Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's Voter ID Law in a 6-3 vote. Justice Stevens wrote the lead opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy, while Justice Scalia wrote a concurrence. Justice Souter and Justice Breyer filed dissents. The lead opinion referenced the Court's 1966 decision in Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, stating that even rational restrictions on the right to vote are invidious if unrelated to voter qualifications. The lead opinion in the Supreme Court's decision on Indiana's Voter ID Law referenced the Court's 1983 decision in Anderson v. Celebrezze, confirming that evenhanded restrictions protecting the electoral process are not invidious and satisfy the Harper standard. The opinion emphasized the need to evaluate the state's justifications for imposing burdens on voters and applied a balancing test in subsequent election decisions. In Crawford, the Court analyzed Indiana's interests in deterring voter fraud to determine the law's legitimacy. The opinion on Indiana's Voter ID Law finds that the state's interests in deterring and detecting voter fraud, preventing voter fraud, and safeguarding voter confidence are relevant to protecting the integrity of the electoral process. It notes that the law aims to address in-person voter impersonation at the polls, but there is no evidence of such fraud in Indiana. The opinion also discusses the burdens imposed on voters by the Voter ID Law, which are not present with non-photo identification requirements. The opinion on Indiana's Voter ID Law acknowledges the state's interests in deterring voter fraud and safeguarding voter confidence. It discusses the burdens imposed on eligible voters without compliant photo identification, stating that the availability of provisional ballots remedies potential issues. The opinion emphasizes that the law's relevant burdens are on those without acceptable identification, and highlights that requiring payment for identification would not be justified. The lead opinion on Indiana's Voter ID Law notes that while most voters already have valid identification, free photo ID cards are available for those who don't. It states that the inconvenience of obtaining an ID does not qualify as a substantial burden on the right to vote. The law may impose a heavier burden on a limited number of individuals, but eligible voters can still cast provisional ballots that will be counted. The lead opinion on Indiana's Voter ID Law states that while most voters have valid identification, free photo ID cards are available for those who don't. Casting a provisional ballot may require visiting the circuit court clerk's office within 10 days, but it is unlikely to create a constitutional problem unless unjustified. The burden of proof for invalidating the Voter ID Law in all its applications is deemed heavy, as it requires a unique balancing analysis between voter burden and the state's interest in election integrity. The lead opinion on Indiana's Voter ID Law finds that it does not excessively burden voters and is justified by the state's interests. It argues that valid neutral justifications should not be ignored, even if partisan interests played a role in enacting the law. Justice Scalia's concurrence supports the law as a nondiscriminatory regulation and disputes the relevance of individual impacts on the burden it imposes. The concurring opinion emphasizes that state legislatures should assess the costs and benefits of election regulations, with judicial review ensuring objectivity and uniformity. Criticizing the lead opinion as lacking certainty and potentially abandoning precedents, the concurrence labels it an \"indulgence\" that Indiana accommodates certain voters by allowing the casting of ballots. The State of Indiana allows provisional ballots but it is not a constitutional requirement. The Voter ID Law is considered constitutionally sufficient as it does not significantly increase voting burdens. The dissent argues that the law imposes nontrivial burdens on voting rights and may deter many citizens from voting, making it unconstitutional under the Court's standard in Burdick v. Takushi. The dissenting opinion in the case of the Voter ID Law in Indiana argues that the state failed to justify the practical limitations on voting rights created by the law, creating an unreasonable burden on certain voters. Comparisons are made with similar laws in Georgia and Florida that accept a broader range of identification for voting. The dissent in the Indiana Voter ID Law case argues that the state did not sufficiently justify the burden created by the law. The Supreme Court's ruling in Crawford may lead to more states enacting similar laws. However, challenges to such laws may still be possible if evidence of the burdens on voters' rights is provided. Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito believe a \"record-based\" evaluation is inappropriate, but the rest of the Court may not share this view."
