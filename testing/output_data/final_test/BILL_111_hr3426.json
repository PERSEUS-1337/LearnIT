    "content": "The Act titled \"Coordinated Environmental Public Health Network Act of 2009\" amends the Public Health Service Act by adding a new section for a coordinated environmental public health network with defined terms. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator, Coordinated Network, Director, Director of the Center, Medical privacy regulations, and Priority chronic conditions and health effects. The Act defines key terms such as Priority chronic conditions and health effects, State Network, and State. Establishment of Coordinated and State Environmental Public Health Networks. Establishment of a Coordinated Environmental Public Health Network within 36 months of the enactment of the title. The network will coordinate existing data and surveillance systems, surveys, registries, and other public health and environmental infrastructure. The Coordinated Environmental Public Health Network will include various surveillance systems and databases such as the Public Health Information Network, State birth defects surveillance systems, State cancer registries, State asthma surveillance systems, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Hazardous Substance Release/Health Effects Database, and Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance System. The Coordinated Environmental Public Health Network includes various surveillance systems and databases for tracking chronic conditions and health effects. It also provides public access to a national database while protecting personal privacy. Additionally, it aims to make information about environmental health available at the federal, state, and local levels. The Coordinated Environmental Public Health Network aims to provide a national database for tracking chronic conditions and health effects. It requires submitting a biennial report to Congress identifying gaps in data, activities carried out, and analyzing current incidence and trends. The Coordinated Environmental Public Health Network aims to track chronic conditions and health effects by State and local areas, provide recommendations for high-risk populations, public health concerns, response strategies, and establish State Networks for coordination and technical assistance. Minimum standards must be developed within 12 months of enactment. The enactment requires the development of minimum standards and procedures for data collection and reporting by State Networks, updated annually. States can set priorities and allocate resources accordingly. Minimum standards include tracking chronic conditions, health effects, and environmental exposures of concern. Environmental exposures of concern, such as hazardous air pollutants, national ambient air quality standards, pollutants, contaminants, and toxic chemicals, are to be tracked through State Networks. The Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 requires tracking of hazardous substances, pesticides, and other environmental factors. Additionally, relevant behavioral, socioeconomic, and demographic factors associated with chronic conditions are to be identified. The State Networks will track chronic conditions and health effects, along with risk factors like race, ethnicity, gender, age, occupation, and language. Data collection and reporting procedures to the Coordinated Network will be established, ensuring data availability to the public and researchers while maintaining confidentiality. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of laboratories for biomonitoring data collection and the awarding of grants to States for the creation of State Environmental Public Health Networks. This is in line with the goal of expanding biomonitoring data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Coordinated Network provides specialized assistance to grantees in establishing State Networks for tracking priority chronic conditions and environmental exposures. States receiving grants must use them to establish environmental public health networks for monitoring health trends. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of identifying priority chronic conditions and health effects that disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities. It also emphasizes the protection of confidentiality of personal data reported and the disclosure of confidential data to researchers for public health research purposes. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for the State Network to ensure public access to collected data while protecting individual privacy. It also includes the development of a plan for establishing the State Network and appointing a lead public health department. The State Network must appoint a lead public health department for development, operation, and maintenance, and coordinate with state and local agencies. It should also recruit and train public health officials. States receiving grants cannot use more than 10% for administrative costs. To apply for a grant, a state must submit an application to the Secretary. The Secretary may specify time and information for grant applications for pilot projects to enhance State Networks and address local concerns. Results of pilot projects may be considered for inclusion in the Coordinated Network. The Secretary shall ensure privacy protection for health information in the Coordinated Network and grants, consistent with HIPAA regulations. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. Beginning in fiscal year 2010, the Secretary will work with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists to train and place epidemiology fellows in State and local health departments to enhance public health capacity. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. The Secretary will integrate environmental health tracking programs and coordinate with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. There will be an expansion of biomonitoring capabilities and data collection. The purpose of this section is to expand biomonitoring data collection to obtain robust information on environmental exposures. The Secretary will ensure data collection through various sources and partnerships with other entities to gather information on vulnerable subpopulations. Cooperative agreements will be entered into with States. The Secretary will enter into cooperative agreements with States or consortia of States to support biomonitoring data collection. Applications for agreements by consortia of States must address coordination with other States and designate a lead State. The Secretary will provide laboratory training and quality assurance through these agreements, ensuring privacy protection for health information. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 under section 264(c) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996."
