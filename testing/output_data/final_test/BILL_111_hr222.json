The Northern Neck National Heritage Area Study Act authorizes a study to designate the Northern Neck area in Virginia as a National Heritage Area based on specific criteria. The Northern Neck National Heritage Area Study Act aims to designate the Northern Neck area in Virginia as a National Heritage Area based on its unique cultural, historical, and natural significance. This designation recognizes and conserves traditions, beliefs, and resources of national importance, providing opportunities for conservation, recreation, and education. The proposed National Heritage Area designation for the Northern Neck area in Virginia involves residents, businesses, nonprofits, and governments showing support for the management plan. The local coordinating entity and supporting government units have committed to partnership for resource protection and development, with a conceptual financial plan in place. The proposal for the National Heritage Area in Virginia involves a conceptual financial plan outlining roles of participants, including the Federal Government. The proposal is consistent with economic activity in the area, supported by a boundary map and public agencies. The study area includes part of Virginia between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers. Consultation with Federal land managers is required before designation. The Secretary will review and determine if the study meets the criteria for designation as a National Heritage Area in Virginia. Consultation with the Governor of Virginia is required, and a report must be submitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate within three fiscal years of funds being made available. The Secretary will review the study on the proposed National Heritage Area in Virginia, including comments from the Governor and a determination of whether it meets designation criteria. If not approved, reasons for the decision will be included in the report."
