    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Multiparty, Multiforum Trial Jurisdiction Act of 2002\" and grants jurisdiction to district courts for multiparty, multiforum cases. The \"Multiparty, Multiforum Trial Jurisdiction Act of 2002\" amends Chapter 85 of title 28, United States Code, to grant district courts original jurisdiction over civil actions involving minimal diversity between adverse parties arising from a single accident where at least 75 natural persons have died at a discrete location. This jurisdiction applies if a defendant resides in one state and a substantial part of the accident occurred in another state, if any two defendants reside in different states, or if a defendant resides in a state where a substantial part of the accident took place. The \"Multiparty, Multiforum Trial Jurisdiction Act of 2002\" grants district courts jurisdiction over civil actions with minimal diversity between parties from different states arising from a single accident where at least 75 individuals have died at a specific location. The district court must abstain from cases where the majority of plaintiffs and primary defendants are citizens of the same state and the claims are governed by that state's laws. Minimal diversity exists if any party is from one state and an adverse party is from another state, a foreign state, or a foreign entity. A corporation is considered a citizen of any state. The text defines terms such as 'injury' as physical harm to a person or property, 'accident' as a sudden event resulting in death of at least 75 individuals at a specific location, and 'State' to include the District of Columbia. The text outlines that the term 'State' includes the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any U.S. territory or possession. It also allows individuals with claims from an accident to intervene in related district court actions and mandates notification to the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation. The text outlines that the term 'State' includes the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any U.S. territory or possession. Additionally, chapter 85 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to include a new item at the end. The text introduces amendments to the jurisdiction and venue rules for civil actions in federal courts, allowing for multiparty, multiforum jurisdiction. It also addresses the removal of actions from State courts to federal courts under specific conditions. In a civil action, a defendant in a State court can remove the action to a United States district court under certain conditions. The removal must comply with specific rules, including filing a notice of removal within 30 days after the defendant becomes a party to the action in State court. The defendant can request to remove an action to a United States district court within 30 days of becoming a party in a State court action under section 1369. If the district court determines liability but further proceedings are needed for damages, the action may be remanded back to the State court for damages determination. The remand is effective 60 days after the district court's liability determination. The defendant can request to remove an action to a United States district court within 30 days of becoming a party in a State court action under section 1369. If the district court determines liability but further proceedings are needed for damages, the action may be remanded back to the State court for damages determination. An appeal can be made to the court of appeals within 60 days for the liability determination. Once the remand is effective, the liability determination is final and not subject to further review. Any decision on remand for damages is not reviewable by appeal. The action removed is considered under section 1369 for jurisdiction purposes. The text discusses the authority of district courts to transfer or dismiss actions based on inconvenient forum. It also addresses the service of process in multiparty, multiforum actions under section 1369 of title 28, United States Code. The text introduces amendments to Chapter 117 of title 28, United States Code, regarding service of subpoenas in multiparty, multiforum actions. Subpoenas can now be served nationwide or internationally with court authorization. The amendments allow nationwide or international service of subpoenas in multiparty, multiforum actions.
