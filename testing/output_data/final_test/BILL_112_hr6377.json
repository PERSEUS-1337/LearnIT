    "content": "The \"Mobile Device Privacy Act\" requires disclosures to consumers about mobile device monitoring software. The Federal Trade Commission must create regulations within a year of the Act's enactment, mandating disclosure of monitoring software information to consumers by sellers of mobile devices and providers of mobile services. The Act requires disclosure of monitoring software information by sellers of mobile devices and providers of mobile services. This includes installing monitoring software on devices not purchased from the provider and disclosing information to consumers at the time of installation. The Act mandates disclosure of monitoring software information by sellers of mobile devices and providers of mobile services. This includes disclosing the fact that monitoring software is installed on the device and the types of information it can collect and transmit. The regulations require disclosure of information regarding monitoring software, including the identity of recipients, intended use, consumer opt-out procedures, and additional details as deemed necessary by the Federal Trade Commission. Disclosure must be clear and conspicuous as determined by the FTC. The Federal Trade Commission requires clear and conspicuous disclosures on websites for monitoring software, with exemptions possible if consistent with consumer expectations. SEC. 3 of the Act mandates consumer consent for monitoring mobile device usage, requiring explicit permission before data collection and the option to stop it. SEC. 4 outlines information security requirements. The Federal Trade Commission must create regulations within a year of the Act's enactment, requiring individuals who receive information from monitoring software to establish security policies. Factors considered include the size of the person, safeguards available, and the cost of implementation. The Federal Trade Commission must create regulations within a year of the Act's enactment, requiring security policies for information received from monitoring software. Policies must include a security policy, identification of a security officer, vulnerability assessments, and preventive/corrective actions. The regulations require implementing security practices, disposing of information securely, and destroying paper documents. Policies and procedures must be displayed prominently on the website of the entity. The regulations require entities to implement security practices, dispose of information securely, and destroy paper documents. If a person does not have a website, they must file their policies and procedures with the appropriate Commission. Entities governed by other federal laws that provide similar or greater information security protections are deemed compliant with the regulations. SEC. 5. FILING OF AGREEMENTS REGARDING INFORMATION RECEIPT: The FTC must create regulations within a year that require agreements involving information from monitoring software to be filed with the Commission. These agreements exclude those between the recipient and the consumer. SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT. The Federal Trade Commission enforces regulations on unfair or deceptive acts or practices under sections 2, 3, 4, and 5, with the same powers and penalties as outlined in the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Federal Communications Commission enforces regulations on commercial mobile services and devices, treating violations as violations of the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC has the power to enforce these regulations with respect to providers and manufacturers in the same manner. The Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission will work together to regulate and enforce rules for data services and mobile device manufacturers, with penalties for violations similar to those in the Communications Act of 1934. The Federal Communications Commission, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission, may establish regulations for filings required by certain sections. States can take civil actions on behalf of residents if they believe a violation of regulations has occurred. States have the authority to file civil actions in State or federal court to enjoin acts, enforce compliance with regulations, obtain damages or other compensation, or seek legal and equitable relief. Before filing, the State must provide written notice to the appropriate Commission. Upon filing a civil action, if it is not feasible to provide prior notice, the attorney general, official, or agency must immediately notify the appropriate Commission. The Commission has the authority to intervene, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal in the action. The Federal Trade Commission, Federal Communications Commission, or Attorney General of the United States can bring a civil action for violation of regulations. No State attorney general, official, or agency can bring an action during a Federal action. This Act does not prevent an attorney general, official, or agency from bringing a civil action. Private Right of Action allows a person harmed by a violation of regulations to sue in State or Federal court for injunction, monetary damages, or up to $1,000 per violation. Private Right of Action allows individuals to sue for violations of regulations in court. The court may increase the award up to 3 times the original amount for willful or knowing violations. Prevailing plaintiffs are entitled to costs and attorney's fees. Actions must be filed within 2 years of discovering the violation. This remedy is not the only option available. The Private Right of Action allows individuals to sue for violations of regulations in court. The remedy provided by this subsection is in addition to any other remedies available, except for common carriers subject to the Communications Act of 1934. In that case, the person may pursue either the remedy provided by this subsection or any remedies provided by such title, but not both. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"appropriate Commission\" refers to either the Federal Trade Commission or the Federal Communications Commission, depending on jurisdiction. \"Commercial mobile data service\" and \"commercial mobile service\" have specific definitions under different Acts. A \"mobile device\" is a personal electronic device capable of voice, video, or data communications. The term \"monitoring software\" refers to software that can track mobile device usage or user location and transmit the collected information to another device or system."
