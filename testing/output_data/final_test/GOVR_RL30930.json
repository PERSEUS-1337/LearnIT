EPSCoR aims to improve research infrastructure in states that historically receive limited R&D funding, promoting a more equitable distribution of resources. EPSCoR was created by Congress in 1978 to address unequal distribution of federal R&D funds. States outside the top 10 in R&D support have shown commitment to improve research and education quality. EPSCoR was described as an affirmative action program to aid less successful states in competing for research funds. It was not intended as an entitlement but as a catalyst for improving competitiveness. EPSCoR faced challenges in its early stages, including rejection by the National Science Board. EPSCoR, created by Congress in 1978 to address unequal distribution of federal R&D funds, faced challenges in its early stages, including rejection by the National Science Board. The program had to be modified to align with NSF values and has since expanded to 29 jurisdictions, receiving significant NSF funding. EPSCoR is a joint program of NSF and selected states and territories aimed at building competitive science through partnerships involving state universities, industry, government, and the federal R&D enterprise. Its mission is to enhance research capabilities and promote equity in federal funding distribution among states. The EPSCoR program aims to provide equity in federal funding distribution among states by offering opportunities for sustainable improvements in research and development capacity. It catalyzes research themes, fosters collaborations among stakeholders, and promotes participation in science and engineering. EPSCoR aims to provide societal benefits, broaden participation in science and engineering, and support future programmatic experiments. It is a federal-state partnership that supports research and education in science and engineering through competitive grants. EPSCoR funding supports research and education in science and engineering through competitive grants, involving academic, state, profit and nonprofit organizations, and individuals. Principal investigators must be associated with research institutions in participating states, with projects designed to enhance research competitiveness. States must provide matching funds, and EPSCoR aims to add specific value to academic infrastructure not available through other funding sources. EPSCoR funding requires states to provide matching funds. Each state has a governing committee to identify award opportunities. Programs are reviewed periodically by external panels and independent organizations. Data shows that 29 EPSCoR jurisdictions represent over 20% of the U.S. population and receive about 13.6% of NSF R&D funding. In FY2010, NSF allocated $145.4 million for EPSCoR activities. Funding is provided through research infrastructure grants, co-funding, and outreach efforts. NSF's EPSCoR program includes three investment strategies: research infrastructure improvement grants, co-funding, and outreach and workshops. RII grants support S&T infrastructure improvements essential to a state's R&D competitiveness, with Track 1 grants up to $15.0 million and Track 2 grants up to $2.0 million. Examples of RII grants include startup funding for faculty research and faculty exchange projects with major research centers. The EPSCoR program focuses on projects to enhance research infrastructure, develop high-performance computing capabilities, acquire advanced research instrumentation, create multidisciplinary research training groups, and promote minority participation in STEM fields. RII grants are the main focus, with funding estimated at $110.0 million in FY2012 and a requested $116.2 million in FY2013. Co-funding encourages collaboration with federal and private sector R&D support. Co-funding is an internal NSF funding mechanism that allows states to receive additional support for critical R&D areas identified by the EPSCoR governing committee. Proposals must be rated highly to qualify for co-funding, with an FY2012 appropriation of $39.4 million. The FY2012 appropriation for co-funding is $39.4 million, with a slight increase over FY2011. The Administration requests $40.0 million in FY2013. EPSCoR's outreach and workshops funding mechanism provides support for NSF program directors to visit researchers in EPSCoR states, familiarize them with NSF policies, and increase grant proposal submissions. In FY2012, funding for outreach strategy is estimated at $1.5 million, with an increase to $2.0 million in FY2013. An evaluation in 1994 found that EPSCoR program led to improvement in states' R&D competitiveness. The evaluation in 1994 found that EPSCoR had improved states' R&D competitiveness by increasing their share of funding. EPSCoR also helped reduce geographic concentration of R&D in the US, fostering partnerships among institutions, government, and the private sector. While no state had graduated from EPSCoR, many research clusters had become fully competitive without EPSCoR support. The evaluators found that the cluster strategy was more effective in improving research capability for colleges and universities in EPSCoR states compared to supporting individual researchers or projects. A report in August 2006 highlighted the need for participating states to progress faster in developing S&T capabilities to benefit more from a national research agenda. The focus now is on accelerating the positive trends in building research infrastructure and capacity in the states. Building research infrastructure and capacity in EPSCoR states is crucial as the federal commitment to basic research doubles. It is important to incorporate the expertise of these states into the national research agenda. All NSF programs should aim to broaden geographical and cultural participation. A more flexible RII grant program is proposed to better support the diverse needs of the 27 different states. The workshop proposed a more flexible RII grant program for the 27 different states, suggesting grants of $3.0 million-$5.0 million per year for up to five years. This would allow states to better implement their strategic plans and address the \"S&T transformative challenge.\" It was also suggested to place the EPSCoR program in NSF for enhanced cross-directorate interactions. The FY2008 budget request for NSF transferred the EPSCoR program to Integrative Activities in the Research and Related Activities account for greater leverage in improving research infrastructure and developing scientific talent. EPSCoR states were recommended to become a \"test bed\" for new initiatives, expanding research capacity in areas like homeland security, cyberinfrastructure, and energy. The EPSCoR program aims to enhance research infrastructure in areas such as defense, cyberinfrastructure, environmental observatories, coastal and ocean issues, and energy expenditures. The proposed flexibility in RII grants allows states to pursue transformative research outlined in NSF's strategic plan. Questions remain about the duration of EPSCoR support for states to improve their research infrastructure. Some argue that states should take more responsibility for building their research infrastructure and reduce reliance on EPSCoR funds. Concerns have been raised about researchers and states becoming complacent with EPSCoR funding without actively working towards graduation from the program. The issue of states graduating from EPSCoR has attracted Congressional attention, with questions raised about promoting independence from EPSCoR resources and achieving progress towards mainstream grant funding. The COV proposed creating an EPSCoR Advisory Committee to address the challenging issue of graduation from the program. A fixed definition of graduation is difficult due to ongoing additions to the EPSCoR family. The current Office Head envisions a programmatic mechanism for graduation. The current Office Head envisions programmatic graduation/progression for EPSCoR programs as infrastructure grows. The increase in eligible states has strained resources, with a funding rate of 27.0% in FY2002 and 21.0% in FY2006. Budget constraints may limit the program's ability to serve its core clientele if the number of eligible states and institutions continues to rise. The Foundation may need to address infrastructure, capacity, and geographic distribution in its grant programs as the number of eligible states and institutions increases. One solution could be to re-organize programs to focus on \"institutional competitiveness\" rather than \"state competitiveness.\" The COV review in August 2005 suggested supplementing capacity building programs with initiatives for building capability and competitiveness, with the SBRC grant mechanism playing a key role in enhancing competitiveness in EPSCoR programs. The COV report recommended enhancing the competitiveness of EPSCoR by strengthening linkages between faculty at minority serving institutions and research intensive institutions. It also suggested a more rigorous review process for large RII-type proposals, including site visits and expanding the pool of reviewers. The report proposed rotating in a minimum of 25.0% new reviewers each year to inject new viewpoints into the review process. The EPSCoR program should rotate in a minimum of 25.0% new reviewers each year, following a review model similar to NSF's Engineering Research Centers. Questions raised by the EPSCoR COV are being debated by stakeholders, including criteria for state graduation from the program. Senator Rockefeller introduced S. 753, authorizing appropriations for EPSCoR from FY2008-FY2012. The bill, S. 753, proposed allocating $125.0 million for EPSCoR states and jurisdictions to participate in NSF programs. It required a percentage of the budget to be spent on top-ranked projects and mandated partnerships with out-of-state research institutions. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions but did not progress further. President Obama signed the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act, FY2010 (P.L. 111-358) into law on January 4, 2011, authorizing appropriations for the NSF from FY2011 through FY2013. The law does not specify funding levels for EPSCoR but mandates its continuation to help eligible states enhance their research infrastructure. A cross-agency evaluation of EPSCoR and similar programs will be conducted to assess their impact on increasing research funding opportunities. The legislation directs the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on the EPSCoR program to assess the effectiveness of state programs, make recommendations for improvement, and evaluate the use of awards to develop science and engineering infrastructure. This study may have policy implications for federal agencies and is expected to be completed in August 2013. The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, FY2012 (P.L. 112-55) provided $7,033.1 million for the NSF in FY2012, with $150.9 million allocated to EPSCoR. The funding supported research infrastructure improvement, co-funding, and outreach for EPSCoR jurisdictions. Approximately 24.0% of the funding was for new research awards. The Administration's FY2013 budget request for the NSF is $7,373.1 million, a 4.8% increase over FY2012. The NSF's FY2013 budget request is $7,373.1 million, a 4.8% increase over FY2012. $158.2 million is allocated for EPSCoR, with 40.0% for new awards and the rest for supporting prior year awards."
