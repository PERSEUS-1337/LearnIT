Over the years, the Banks have evolved to lend for various purposes, including low- and moderate-income housing, federal government debts, and community development projects. The system has grown to be comparable in size to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and is now part of Congressional discussions regarding housing-related GSEs and their regulators. The Federal Home Loan Bank System, established in 1932, consists of 12 regional member-owned Banks overseen by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. The Banks provide liquidity for mortgage lenders, originally focusing on savings and loan associations. The System has evolved to support various purposes, including low-income housing and community development projects. It is now part of discussions regarding housing-related government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and their regulators. The Federal Home Loan Bank System, established in 1932, provided liquidity for mortgage lenders, particularly savings and loan associations. The Banks made loans to savings associations to ensure consistent access to capital markets, secured by liens on home mortgages. They also offered regulatory oversight and deposit insurance to bolster confidence in housing finance. The System remained largely unchanged during the \"golden years\" of the savings and loan industry. The Federal Home Loan Bank System, established in 1932, provided liquidity for mortgage lenders, particularly savings and loan associations. The System remained largely unchanged during the \"golden years\" of the savings and loan industry until the Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970 added Freddie Mac to create a secondary market for mortgages. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 made major changes to the System in response to industry failures, replacing the old FHLBB with the FHFB. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 made significant changes to the Federal Home Loan Bank System, including removing Freddie Mac from the Bank System and reconstituting it as a publicly owned stock corporation. It also opened membership in the Banks to all depository institutions engaged in significant mortgage lending and set requirements for the System, such as a set-aside of earnings for low- and moderate-income housing programs. The Federal Home Loan Bank System Modernization Act of 1999 further broadened membership qualifications by dropping minimum mortgage asset requirements. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 brought significant changes to the Federal Home Loan Bank System, expanding membership to all depository institutions engaged in mortgage lending. It also established new capital standards for the Banks and allowed them to make advances secured by assets other than housing loans. The Act simplified the System's contribution to the old REFCORP debt and designated twelve regional Banks to carry out operations. Each Bank has its own board of directors appointed by the FHFB. The Federal Home Loan Bank System has 12 regional Banks with directors appointed by the FHFB. Six directors are appointed by the FHFB, known as public interest directors, while the remaining eight are elected by members. At least two directors must represent consumer or community interests. The FHFB also approves compensation for Bank presidents and directors. Membership is limited to regulated depositories, insurance companies, and certain governmental housing finance bodies, with each member owning capital stock in their district Bank. Each Bank is privately owned with its own board of directors, management, and employees, and membership is voluntary. Members receive dividends on their shares of capital stock from the Bank's earnings. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System receive dividends on their shares of capital stock from the earnings of their respective Bank. System membership includes commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, and insurance companies. Banks fund their activities through System \"consolidated obligations,\" which are publicly traded bonds issued through the Office of Finance. These obligations are not guaranteed by the United States. The Federal Home Loan Bank System funds its operations through consolidated obligations, which are not guaranteed by the United States but are assumed to have an implied guarantee. The System assets were $1,037 billion with $640 billion in advances to members and $94 billion in mortgages. Liabilities totaled $992 billion, and capital totaled $41 billion, meeting regulatory minimums but falling short of commercial banking requirements. The Federal Home Loan Bank System operates with close to the regulatory minimum capital levels, which are lower than those required for commercial banking companies. The system extends secured loans to member institutions, primarily collateralized by first mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Special privileges and exemptions granted by Congress support the System's mission, including a $4 billion line of credit. The Federal Home Loan Bank System benefits from special privileges and exemptions granted by Congress, including a $4 billion line of credit with the U.S. Treasury, eligibility for Federal Reserve open market purchases, and exemption from certain taxes. These privileges create a perception among investors that the Banks may be treated as government agencies, potentially leading to lower returns on debt issuances compared to private-sector companies. The Federal Home Loan Bank System borrows money at rates similar to Treasury issues, with investors believing the government would prevent any Bank from failing. The Banks have three missions, each developing its own strategies to provide liquidity to members through advances and acquisition of member assets. The Federal Home Loan Bank System has three missions: providing liquidity to members through advances, letters of credit, and acquisition of member assets. Each Bank is limited in holding mortgage-backed securities to 300% of capital, except for certificates acquired under the Shared Funding Program. This program allows members to sell eligible mortgage loans to the Chicago Bank, which then sells the loans to a trust that issues structured securities. Sales of securities are limited to Banks or members within the System to avoid direct competition with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The Federal Home Loan Bank System has three missions: providing liquidity to members through advances, letters of credit, and acquisition of member assets. Each Bank must give away 10% of net income for low- and moderate-income housing under the affordable housing program (AHP). They also lend to members at cost for loans in moderate-income households and economic development in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods under the community investment program (CIP). Additionally, they must pay 20% of net earnings to help repay interest on bonds until the debt is repaid by REFCORP by April 15, 2030. The Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) regulates the Banks and is associated with HUD. It has five members appointed by the President for seven-year terms. The Board ensures the safety of the Banks and their public purpose. It is self-supporting through assessments on the Banks and operates independently from congressional appropriations. The Finance Board has powers to ensure the safety and soundness of the Banks and their public purpose of providing home finance. They can take preventive action to protect individual Banks and have authority to issue supervisory directives, suspend officers, and issue cease and desist orders. The FHFB has strong oversight over FHLB Chicago's risk-management policies, with the power to approve activities, debt offerings, and budgets. It can liquidate or reorganize individual Banks to aid in efficient accomplishment of the Bank Act. Another Bank can acquire assets and liabilities with approval for any liquidation or reorganization. The FHFB has supervisory powers over FHLB Chicago and FHLB Dallas, allowing for potential mergers. Some Bank assets, like derivatives and manufactured housing loans, have caused losses similar to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Restatements and changes in management have been necessary, mainly due to accounting for derivatives used to hedge against interest rate movements. The FHFB required all Banks to register equity with the SEC in 2004. The FHLB system was required to register equity with the SEC in 2004, giving up charter exemptions. SEC registration for the Banks involves similar disclosures as publicly held companies. Once registered, they cannot de-register and must comply with SEC reporting requirements, facing fines for inaccuracies. Policy analysts discuss risks related to joint liability and the super lien. Policy analysts are concerned about risks related to joint and several liability and the super lien in the FHLB system. Joint liability ensures Banks support each other before the government intervenes, creating moral hazard. The super lien allows Banks to claim assets from a failed institution before other creditors. This system has led to concerns about collateral specification after a failure. The FHLB system has historically not specified collateral assets until after a failure, leading to the potential for cherry-picking the best assets from a failed institution. This raises costs for the FDIC in resolving failed banks. Concerns about systemic risk arise from treating Bank debt as federal agency debt, potentially triggering failures in other financial institutions overexposed to System debt. This could have wide repercussions throughout the financial system. On December 22, 2006, the FHFB adopted a new rule to limit the finances of Federal Home Loan Banks by capping excess stock of member banks at 1% of assets. This rule aims to ensure appropriate capitalization, access to capital markets, and financial stability. The implied guarantee for GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac raises concerns about systemic risk and incentivizes them to take on greater risks. The government's support for GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac raises concerns about systemic risk and incentivizes them to take on greater risks, potentially leading to over-allocation of capital into housing markets. Regulators may struggle to control their activities, posing a threat to financial markets as they grow in size. The slowdown in the housing market could also negatively impact the Federal Home Loan Banks. The decline in house prices could harm the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) by reducing collateral value and impacting bank balance sheets. Estimating the exact effect is challenging due to the lack of a national house price decline since the FHLB System's creation. Refinancing troubles in mortgage markets could also affect FHLBs, with large lenders using the System to access liquidity for troubled loans. Despite a decrease in mortgage lending, FHLB advances to members increased, indicating potential challenges in the mortgage market. The volume of FHLB advances to its members increased, possibly to refinance troubled borrowers. This could help reduce foreclosure rates but may also shift defaulting loans to the FHLB System. Congressional focus is on GSE regulatory reform, with proposed changes to strengthen oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHLB System. The Finance Reform Act of 2007, H.R. 1427, passed the House and aims to create a new regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, merging FHFB and OFHEO. A similar bill in the Senate, S. 1100, also proposes a single regulator but has not seen further action. The legislation seeks to address the weaknesses in OFHEO's powers by granting more authority and independence to the new regulator. The Finance Reform Act of 2007 aims to create a new regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, merging FHFB and OFHEO. The new regulator would have a single agency director and may adopt commercial bank-style regulatory controls. Government-sponsored enterprises are subject to agency-to-agency variations in regulatory standards. Government-sponsored enterprises are wholesale nondepository institutions that do not make loans directly to the public, and they are subject to agency-to-agency variations in regulatory standards. Multiple banking regulations intended for retail banking institutions are omitted in Table 2."
