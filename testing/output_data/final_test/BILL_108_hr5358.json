    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Park Centennial Act of 2004\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The National Park Service was established to conserve national parks, but chronic funding shortfalls have created operational and maintenance backlogs, jeopardizing the enjoyment of future generations. Generations will receive diminished visitor services and inherit a national park system in worse condition than before. The annual appropriations process is insufficient to address funding shortfalls, requiring additional funding. Congressional oversight is crucial to ensure wise and effective spending on national parks. Congress can enhance resources for park operations and oversight. The Act aims to improve oversight and funding for national park operations to eliminate deficits and maintenance backlog by the centennial anniversary of the National Park System. Congress will focus on fully funding core park operations through the appropriations process. SEC. 101. CENTENNIAL FUND FOR PRESERVING AMERICA'S NATIONAL PARKS. Establishment of the National Park Centennial Fund in the Treasury of the United States to fund programs for preserving America's national parks. The Secretary of the Treasury deposits specified amounts each fiscal year to fund programs identified in titles II, III, and IV. Appropriations include amounts designated under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and additional amounts to meet the total funding requirement. SEC. 102. DESIGNATION OF OVERPAYMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF UNITS OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM. This section adds a new part to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, allowing for the designation of overpayments and contributions for the benefit of units of the National Park System. Individual taxpayers can designate a portion of their overpayment of tax and any cash contribution on their tax return to benefit units of the National Park System. This designation must be made at the time of filing the tax return and in the manner prescribed by the Secretary. Overpayments designated in this way will be treated as refunded. Individual taxpayers can designate a portion of their overpayment of tax on their tax return to benefit units of the National Park System. This designated overpayment will be treated as refunded to the taxpayer as of the last date prescribed for filing the tax return. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2004. Amounts designated under section 102 will be deposited in the Centennial Fund for fiscal years 2005 to 2008 and as necessary through fiscal year 2016. The funds will be available to the Secretary of the Interior without further appropriation. SEC. 104. DISTRIBUTION OF FUND. Three accounts created within the Centennial Fund for specific purposes: National Park Backlog Elimination Fund (60%), Natural Resource Challenge Fund (20%), and Cultural Resource Challenge Fund (20%).\n\nSEC. 105. PATRIOTS FOR PARKS PROMOTION. Authorization for a public awareness campaign about the National Park Centennial Fund and taxpayer contributions.\n\nTITLE II--ELIMINATING THE NATIONAL PARK MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. Backlog elimination measures implemented. Sixty percent of funds in the Centennial Fund will be used to address the backlog of unmet needs in National Parks identified in the Facility Condition Index. The Secretary of the Interior will prioritize projects annually, with funding becoming available on October 15 unless legislation changes the priority list. Projects in park unit general management plans will be given priority. Projects eligible for funding from the Centennial Fund must be identified in the park unit's general management plan, listed in the Facility Condition Index, deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Interior for resource conservation or visitor education, and necessary for public health and safety. Up to 8 percent of funds can be allocated for project oversight and other overhead responsibilities. TITLE III--PROTECTING NATURAL WONDERS\n\nSEC. 301. NATURAL RESOURCE CHALLENGE. Twenty percent of funds from the Centennial Fund will be used to protect natural resources in parks. The Secretary of the Interior will outline projects to be funded annually, including natural resource inventories, monitoring, protection of species, collaboration with scientists, and environmental restoration projects. Establishment of partnerships with nonpark entities to leverage Federal funds for natural resource protection. TITLE IV--PROTECTING NATIONAL TREASURES\n\nSEC. 401. CULTURAL RESOURCE CHALLENGE. The Centennial Fund allocates 20% of funds to protect cultural resources in national parks. The Secretary of the Interior will outline projects annually, with funds available from October 15 for activities like preserving archaeological sites, collections, and cultural landscapes, and forming partnerships for resource protection. TITLE V--MEETING ANNUAL OPERATING NEEDS\nSEC. 501. PROGRESS ON ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS. The GAO Report must be submitted annually to specific committees in the House and Senate, detailing Congress's progress in eliminating the National Park System's operating fund deficit exceeding $600 million. It should include comparisons between park needs and actual funding, as well as any discrepancies in the Park Service's business plan. The GAO Report must detail the Park Service's business plan methodology, management improvement measures, adjustments in positions, service adjustments to the public, and changes in effort due to partnerships. The GAO Report will detail new requirements and assessments for parks, including homeland security and natural disasters. At least 60% of funding under Titles II, III, and IV will go to parks with comprehensive business plans. The Secretary of Education can provide grants for education in national parks. The Act authorizes grants for schools to partner with the National Park Service for distance learning and onsite education programs, focusing on connecting students to national park history and facilitating scientific instruction. Congress intends for the funding to supplement, not replace, annual appropriations for the National Park Service."
