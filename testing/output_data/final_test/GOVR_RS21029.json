    "content": "Under CSRS, the surviving spouse of a federal employee who dies after 18 months of service is eligible for a 55% annuity. The nine-month marriage requirement is waived in case of accidental death. A divorced spouse may be eligible if a survivor annuity was elected or through a court decree. The annuity is guaranteed to be no smaller than 55% of the employee's highest three years of pay or projected service to age 60. If a federal employee participating in FERS dies after 18 months but fewer than 10 years of service, the spouse is eligible for a lump-sum survivor benefit equal to half of the employee's annual basic pay plus a lump sum payment. If the employee had at least 10 years of service, the spouse receives a lump sum and an annuity equal to 50% of the retirement annuity earned at the time of death. Survivor annuities under CSRS and FERS end if the surviving spouse remarries before age 55, unless the marriage lasted at least 30 years. Under CSRS, a monthly annuity is paid to the surviving children of a deceased employee, as long as they are under the age of 18 and not married, or under age 22 if still in school. A child survivor enrolled full-time in school and whose 22nd birthday occurs before July 1 or after August 31 can continue to receive benefits while enrolled as a student through the following July 1. A surviving child is eligible for benefits regardless of age if he or she is incapable of self-support because of a physical or mental disability incurred before the age of 18. If a deceased federal employee is survived by a spouse or former spouse who is the biological or adoptive parent of the employee's surviving child(ren), each child receives the smallest of these three annual amounts: 60% of the employee's high-3 average pay, divided by the number of children, $6,024 (in 2014). Under CSRS, a monthly annuity is paid to the surviving children of a deceased employee, as long as they are under the age of 18 and not married, or under age 22 if still in school. The benefit amount is determined based on the employee's high-3 average pay and is indexed annually to the Consumer Price Index. If the deceased employee is not survived by a spouse or former spouse who is the biological or adoptive parent of the surviving child(ren), each child receives a different benefit amount. Children of deceased federal employees who were covered by FERS may also be eligible for Social Security benefits. Deceased federal employees covered by FERS may be eligible for Social Security benefits. FERS will pay a monthly benefit that, combined with Social Security, equals the CSRS benefit if it would have been greater. Social Security benefits end at age 18 (or 19 if still in high school), but FERS pays a benefit equal to CSRS for unmarried, under 22, full-time post-secondary students. Widows, widowers, and unmarried dependent children under 22 of deceased federal employees enrolled in FEHBP may continue benefits. If a federal employee enrolled in the FEHBP dies from a duty-related injury, their surviving spouse and children may receive compensation equal to a percentage of the employee's monthly pay. The compensation is not payable concurrently with a survivor annuity under CSRS or FERS. The surviving spouse receives 50% of the deceased employee's final pay if there are no children, and 60% if there is one child, or 75% if there are two or more children. Compensation for federal employees who die from duty-related injuries varies based on the number of surviving children and spouses. If there are surviving children but no spouse, compensation is 40% of pay for one child plus 15% for each additional child, not exceeding 75% of pay. If no spouse or children survive, compensation may be paid to dependent parents or other relatives. Benefits are prorated to ensure total compensation does not exceed 75% of the employee's pay. Compensation for surviving family members of federal employees who die from duty-related injuries is based on dependency. Up to 20% of pay can be paid to a dependent sibling, grandparent, or grandchild, with adjustments for multiple dependents. If the employee is survived by a spouse, children, or dependent parent, benefits are distributed proportionally to ensure the total does not exceed 75% of pay. Payments to surviving spouses are for life unless they remarry before age 55, while payments to children, siblings, or grandchildren continue until marriage, reaching age 18 (unless a full-time student), or no longer incapable of self-support. The compensation for surviving family members of federal employees who die from duty-related injuries is based on dependency. Payments are made until the individual marries or is no longer incapable of self-support. The maximum monthly pay for survivor compensation is 75% of the maximum basic pay for level GS-15. Lump-sum payments may be made under certain circumstances. Additionally, a surviving spouse or representative of an employee killed in the line of duty may receive reimbursement for termination costs and funeral expenses. The Federal Employees' Compensation Fund provides $800 for funeral and burial expenses, with additional payments authorized by P.L. 104-208 for federal employees who die from duty-related injuries. Married federal employees retiring under CSRS or FERS receive a joint and survivor annuity unless declined in writing. Under CSRS, a worker's annual benefit is reduced by 2.5% of the first $3,600 plus 10% of the annuity above that amount if they opt for a joint and survivor annuity. The spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity equal to 55% of the worker's full annuity. Alternatively, under FERS, the retiree's annual benefit is reduced by 10% for a joint and survivor annuity, with the spouse entitled to a survivor annuity equal to 50% of the worker's full annuity. The survivor annuity for a spouse under CSRS is 55% of the worker's full annuity, while under FERS it is 50%. If the retiree's marriage ends, their annuity is increased to the full amount payable under a single-life annuity. If they remarry after retirement, they have two years to make changes. When a worker marries or remarries after retirement, they have two years to elect survivor coverage for their new spouse, with the retiree's annuity being reduced accordingly. A lump-sum payment with interest must be made to cover the period before the post-retirement marriage to maintain equity between couples. Survivor benefits for children of deceased federal retirees are the same as for children of deceased federal employees under both CSRS and FERS. Retired federal workers with unmarried dependent children eligible for child survivor benefits do not need to reduce their retirement annuities. Surviving spouses of deceased retirees under CSRS or FERS can continue FEHBP coverage at the same cost. If the survivor annuity is less than the FEHBP premium, the difference must be paid to OPM. Retirees can ensure FEHBP coverage for a new spouse by electing a minimal survivor annuity. If a retired federal employee has a former spouse with a full survivor annuity, the current spouse can continue FEHBP coverage after the retiree's death by electing survivor coverage. Unmarried dependent children can stay on FEHBP until age 22, with possible extension. Both CSRS and FERS allow survivor benefits for individuals with an \"insurable interest\" in the retiree. An insurable interest exists if the person may benefit financially from the retiree continuing to live, such as a former or current spouse named as having an insurable interest for survivor benefits. The retiree's annuity is reduced by 10% plus 5% for each full five years the beneficiary is younger, not exceeding 40%. Survivor benefits are 55% of the retiree's reduced annuity, payable upon the retiree's death. Federal employees are entitled to a retirement annuity after five years of service, and can defer receipt of benefits until reaching retirement age if resigning before eligibility. Under CSRS and FERS, employees can defer their retirement benefits until reaching eligibility age. A deferred annuity can start at age 62 under CSRS, and at different ages under FERS based on years of service. If a former employee dies before receiving their annuity, the surviving spouse may be eligible for a survivor annuity. If the employee dies before age 62, no survivor benefit is paid, but the spouse receives a refund of the employee's contributions. If a former employee dies before receiving a deferred annuity, the surviving spouse may receive a refund of the employee's contributions. The surviving spouse of a former FERS employee can choose between an annuity or a lump-sum payment. Cost-of-living adjustments are made annually in January to benefits paid under CSRS and FERS, with limitations on COLAs under FERS if the CPI increase exceeds 2.0%. Cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for FERS are limited if the CPI increase exceeds 2.0%. The FERS COLA varies based on CPI increase percentages. Participants in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) can designate beneficiaries using Form TSP-3. If no form is filed, distribution follows a specific order. P.L. 111-31 outlines guidelines for beneficiary distribution. Section 109 of P.L. 111-31 allows the surviving spouse of a deceased Thrift Savings Plan participant to maintain the portion of the account they are entitled to."
