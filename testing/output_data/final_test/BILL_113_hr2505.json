    "content": "The \"Motorcoach Safety, Accountability, and Technology Act of 2013\" requires brake performance inspections before each trip and the implementation of brake monitoring systems for motorcoaches. The Act mandates the establishment of minimum performance standards for electronic brake monitoring systems on motorcoaches within 3 years. It also requires motorcoaches manufactured after 2 years of the standards to be equipped with such systems. Additionally, the Act addresses the implementation of automatic emergency braking and collision warning systems. The Act mandates the implementation of automatic emergency braking, collision warning, lane departure warning systems, and speed limiting devices on motorcoaches within 3 years of enactment. The Act requires motorcoaches to be equipped with speed limiting devices that restrict travel to 70 miles per hour within 3 years. Additionally, regulations must ensure tamper-resistant technologies and establish compliance certification processes. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on retrofitting motorcoaches with required technologies and issue regulations for the use of regrooved, recapped, or retreaded tires. Additionally, a motor carrier safety assistance program will be established. The Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program under Section 31102(b)(2) of title 49, United States Code, ensures inspections of passenger-carrying vehicles are conducted at various locations with facilities for passengers and accommodations for those with disabilities. Definitions are provided in Section 11. SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS. This section provides definitions for \"motorcoach\" and \"provider of motorcoach services\" as outlined in MAP-21."
