The \"Stop Sexual Abuse by School Personnel Act of 2015\" mandates criminal background checks for school employees funded under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. State and local educational agencies must have policies for background checks, which can be funded to establish, implement, or improve. The \"Stop Sexual Abuse by School Personnel Act of 2015\" requires background checks for school employees, expanding the registries searched to include state criminal, child abuse, FBI fingerprint, and National Sex Offender Registry. Employees must also receive training. The \"Stop Sexual Abuse by School Personnel Act of 2015\" mandates training for school employees on recognizing, responding to, and preventing child abuse. It also requires the development of mechanisms, dissemination of information on best practices and resources, establishment of professional standards, and implementation of policies and procedures for addressing incidents of child abuse by school employees. The procedures for providing background check results include informing individuals of their eligibility for employment, informing employers of an employee's eligibility without disclosing disqualifying crimes, and sharing information with other employers as permitted by state law. The procedures involve conducting periodic background checks on school employees, allowing for an appeals process, and sharing information with other educational agencies as permitted by state law. The school employee can appeal background check results in a timely manner, with notice and instructions provided. A review process can determine eligibility for employment based on mitigating circumstances. Policies are in place to prevent knowingly transferring disqualified employees. The covered State educational agency must transfer or facilitate the transfer of a school employee engaged in sexual misconduct with a student, publish policies and procedures on their website, provide training on reporting child abuse, and support activities to improve student safety. The section emphasizes the importance of coordination and transparency in policies for criminal background checks for school employees. It clarifies that there is no private right of action if compliance with state regulations is met. Additionally, it allows states to charge school employees for background check costs as long as they do not exceed the actual expenses. Each plan submitted must meet state and local requirements. Each state or local educational agency plan under title I must include policies and procedures for background checks for school employees to comply with state laws. This includes terminating individuals in violation, improving reporting of violations, and reducing employee transfers after violations. State background check requirements for school employees include providing a timely appeal process, giving employees access to their background check results, providing a statement to the employer indicating eligibility for employment without revealing disqualifying information, and ensuring public availability of the results. The Secretary will provide technical assistance to States, school districts, and schools to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse by school personnel. This includes developing materials and determining cost-effective ways to disseminate information. Educational and child welfare agencies, along with criminal justice entities, should have access to information on child sexual abuse by school personnel. Mechanisms should be identified to track and analyze the prevalence of such abuse through existing Federal data collection systems. Covered State and local educational agencies using funds for this purpose must report annually to the Secretary on the amount and purpose of funds used. The Secretary must provide an annual national report card to Senate and House committees, detailing actions taken under subsection (f) and incidents of reported child sexual abuse by school personnel using existing Federal data collection systems. The section discusses rules of construction regarding background checks for State or local educational agencies, emphasizing that the Federal Government cannot mandate, direct, or control their policies or procedures. The section prohibits the Secretary from regulating background check policies for school employees and from defining the term 'background checks'. It also prevents the Secretary from requiring additional data reporting from State or local educational agencies. The terms defined in this section include 'covered local educational agency', 'covered school', 'covered State educational agency', and 'school employee', which encompasses individuals working in these educational institutions with unsupervised contact duties. The text chunk discusses job duties involving unsupervised contact with elementary or secondary school students, as well as contracts with educational agencies. It also mentions an amendment to the table of contents in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. \"Sec. 9537. Criminal background checks for school employees.\""
