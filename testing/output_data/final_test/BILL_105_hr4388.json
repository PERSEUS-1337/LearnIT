    "content": "The Consumer Financial Privacy Protection Act of 1998, also known as the Financial Institution Privacy Protection Act, amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act by adding a new title focused on consumer financial privacy. It includes general provisions and definitions for financial institutions. The definitions provided in the Consumer Financial Privacy Protection Act of 1998 include terms such as 'customer,' 'customers' financial information,' and 'document,' with a focus on information maintained by financial institutions. The term 'financial institution' encompasses institutions providing financial services to customers with credit, deposit, trust, or other financial accounts. This includes depository institutions, broker-dealers, insurance companies, loan companies, investment advisers, credit card issuers, and consumer reporting agencies. The Federal Trade Commission may define financial institutions for the credit card system. Financial regulatory agencies include Federal banking agencies, the National Credit Union Administration Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Federal Trade Commission. The term 'personal information' refers to non-financial information that is personal or identifiable to an individual, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, Social Security numbers, tax identification numbers, dates of birth, and other identifying information. The term 'record' refers to any customer personal or financial information or document used to collect, store, or disseminate such information. SEC. 1003. PROTECTION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION. Financial institutions must protect customers' privacy and safeguard their financial and personal information through appropriate measures to prevent harm or unauthorized access. Financial institutions are required to establish safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records. Financial institutions must collect and protect customer information for transactions and business relationships. They are prohibited from disclosing this information to third parties unless necessary for transactions or requested by the customer. Financial institutions are required to protect customer information and can only disclose it in specific circumstances, such as when requested by the customer, required by law, or with explicit notice to the customer. \"SEC. 1004. REGULATIONS.\" The financial regulatory agencies must create regulations for financial institutions to establish safeguards for customer record security and accuracy, limiting employee access to information and providing training on confidentiality. Financial institutions must maintain security standards to prevent unauthorized access to customer information, require third parties to maintain confidentiality, and provide clear disclosure of privacy policies to customers. Financial institutions must disclose information to third parties, provide options for customers to prevent disclosure, and outline procedures for filing complaints about confidential information disclosure. Financial regulatory agencies will provide model disclosure statements to aid compliance. Financial institutions using model disclosures will be deemed compliant with disclosure requirements. Regulations under this section have a 6-month period before taking effect, with the possibility of extension for security measures implementation. \"SEC. 1005. ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT.\" Enforcement of compliance with this title is under the Federal Trade Commission Act by the Federal Trade Commission. Violations of requirements regarding information brokers are considered unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Enforcement authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act is available to enforce compliance with this title. Civil penalties may be imposed on any person violating the requirements. Any person violating the provisions of this title may face civil penalties and be subject to enforcement under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Enforcement for national banks and Federal branches is under the Comptroller of the Currency. The Comptroller of the Currency oversees national banks, while the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates member banks, branches of foreign banks, and commercial lending companies. The Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation supervises banks insured by the FDIC and insured State branches of foreign banks. The Federal Credit Union Act is administered by the Administrator of the National Credit Union Administration for Federal credit unions. The Farm Credit Act of 1971 is overseen by the Farm Credit Administration for Federal land banks, associations, and credit institutions. The securities laws are regulated by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Commodity Exchange Act are overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, respectively, for individuals subject to the securities and commodities laws. Civil liability under this chapter applies to those who knowingly fail to comply with regulations, leading to substantial financial injury for customers. The liable party must compensate the customer for damages, additional damages determined by the court, and legal fees. Waiver of rights is addressed in Section 1007. Section 1007 prohibits financial institutions from including waivers of rights, remedies, requirements, or obligations in agreements with customers. However, agreements can grant consumers more extensive rights or protections. Section 1008 addresses the relationship to state law. Section 1008 clarifies that this chapter does not override state laws on financial privacy practices unless there is inconsistency, in which case the greater protection for consumers under state law prevails."
