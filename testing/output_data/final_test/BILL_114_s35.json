    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians Restoration Act of 2015\". Congress finds that the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians, along with other tribes, are political successors to the signatories of the Pembina Treaty of 1863. The Tribe continues to reside in Montana and has a long history dating back to the 1863 treaty. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Tribe made repeated petitions. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Little Shell Tribe petitioned the Federal Government for reorganization under the Indian Reorganization Act. Federal agents and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs confirmed the Tribe's eligibility for trust land, but due to lack of funds during the Depression, the Bureau of Indian Affairs couldn't purchase land for the Tribe. The Little Shell Tribe, despite the lack of funding from the Federal Government to secure land for reorganization, continued to exist as a separate community with clear political leadership. The Tribe, along with other tribes, filed lawsuits under the Indian Claims Commission Act to seek additional compensation for land ceded to the United States. The Little Shell Tribe sought compensation for land ceded under treaties and agreements with the United States. They also petitioned for Federal recognition in 1978, which is still pending. The Tribe has had continuous dealings with the Federal Government, the State of Montana, and other recognized Indian tribes since the 1930s. Federal recognition is extended to the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana, allowing them to receive federal services and benefits. All federal laws applicable to Indian tribes will apply to the Tribe and its members. Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana and its members will be eligible for all federal services and benefits provided to Indians and federally recognized tribes, regardless of reservation status or member residence location. The service area for the Tribe will include Blaine, Cascade, Glacier, and Hill Counties in Montana. Additionally, the Act reaffirms the rights of the Tribe. SEC. 6. REAFFIRMATION OF RIGHTS. This Act does not diminish any existing rights or privileges of the Tribe or its members. Claims of the Tribe to enforce any wrongfully denied rights are preserved. SEC. 7. MEMBERSHIP ROLL. SEC. 7. MEMBERSHIP ROLL. The Tribe must submit a membership roll to the Secretary within 18 months of the Act's enactment, based on qualifications outlined in the Tribe's constitution. The Tribe is responsible for maintaining the membership roll. SEC. 8. TRANSFER OF LAND. The Secretary will acquire 200 acres of land for the Tribe's benefit to establish a tribal land base. Additional land may be acquired under the Indian Reorganization Act."
