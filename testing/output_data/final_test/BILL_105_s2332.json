    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crime Doesn't Pay Prison Act\" and includes findings and purposes. The \"Crime Doesn't Pay Prison Act\" includes findings that prison conditions must deny the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities for an eighth amendment violation. Inmates can challenge conditions only if they are contrary to societal standards and officials are indifferent. The \"Crime Doesn't Pay Prison Act\" highlights the excessive expenditures on prisons, diverting funds from expanding capacity and assisting the law-abiding poor. Congress is urged to establish a national standard of minimum decency. The \"Crime Doesn't Pay Prison Act\" aims to establish a national standard of minimum decency for prison conditions to prevent inmates from living better than law-abiding individuals at the poverty guideline level. Federal courts have been burdened with frivolous inmate litigation due to the lack of legislative guidance on contemporary prison standards, leading to excessive micromanagement of correctional facilities. This Act seeks to address these issues and emphasize the expertise of prison administrators in managing prison conditions. The \"Crime Doesn't Pay Prison Act\" aims to establish a national standard for measuring prison conditions' minimum decency, ensuring punishments reflect the offense's seriousness, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment, deterrence, and protecting the public. It also aims to limit state spending to achieve constitutional minimum standards and prevent the unnecessary infliction of pain in prisons. The infliction of pain in prisons due to institutional administrators' deliberate indifference deprives inmates of basic necessities, as established in legal cases such as Hudson v. McMillan, Wilson v. Seiter, Whitely v. Albers, and Rhodes v. Chapman. SEC. 3. JUDICIAL STANDARDS FOR PRISON CONDITIONS. Section 722 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1988) is amended to state that in any legal challenge regarding prison conditions, relief cannot be granted unless the conditions involve deliberate indifference leading to unnecessary suffering. If a prison meets or exceeds the poverty guideline level in per-inmate expenditure, there is a presumption that administrators are not indifferent, which can only be disproved with clear evidence. In legal challenges on prison conditions, relief requires proof of deliberate indifference causing unnecessary suffering. Failure to meet poverty guideline level in per-inmate expenditure does not presume unconstitutional conditions. Definitions include aspects of confinement, inmates, institutions, and per-inmate expenditure calculation. The term 'poverty guideline level' refers to the dollar allowance in the poverty guideline for additional family members in the largest households, as established by the Department of Health and Human Services."
