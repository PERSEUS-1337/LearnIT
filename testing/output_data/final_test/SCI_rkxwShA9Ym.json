It can be used in semantic segmentation tasks without high-resolution labeled data, utilizing both low-resolution and high-resolution labels to improve performance. Our proposed algorithm super-resolves labels from 30m to 1m resolution, achieving similar performance with low-resolution data alone and better performance with a small amount of high-resolution data. It is also successful in medical imaging, accurately segmenting lymphocytes from low-resolution probability maps. Semantic image segmentation involves labeling pixels in an input image into fine-scale classes. Weakly supervised segmentation uses partial observations of ground truth labels in the training set. Our proposed algorithm super-resolves labels from low to high resolution using accessory classes defined for sets of pixels in input images. Training models to produce high-resolution application labels based on joint distribution P(Y, Z) between accessory class labels and application labels. Aim to derive high-resolution land cover map from aerial image and low-resolution ground truth. The formulation of the problem aims to solve weakly supervised image segmentation tasks for various applications, such as land cover mapping and lymphocyte segmentation. It addresses the mismatch between coarse and fine-scale labels in these tasks. Our method generates high-resolution label predictions from low-resolution labels by utilizing statistical descriptions between them. Unlike existing methods for weakly supervised semantic segmentation, we do not rely on bounding boxes or coarse approximations of ground-truth segmentation. Our approach is suitable for tasks like land cover mapping and lymphocyte segmentation. Our proposed method for weakly supervised semantic segmentation aims to address land cover mapping and lymphocyte segmentation tasks. It avoids relying on bounding boxes or coarse approximations of ground-truth segmentation, offering a more efficient approach compared to existing methods. The method utilizes statistical descriptions to generate high-resolution label predictions from low-resolution labels. Our methodology involves summarizing probabilistic estimates from a segmentation network over sets Bk to compare with expected distributions from low-resolution labels. This extension allows for end-to-end training of image segmentation neural networks for applications like land cover mapping from aerial imagery. Land cover mapping is crucial for sustainability-related tasks such as conservation planning and habitat monitoring. The method involves creating high-resolution land cover maps from high-resolution imagery using low-resolution labels, achieving accuracy similar to models trained on high-resolution labels. Combining low-and high-resolution labels improves model performance in transfer learning tasks. In another example, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are segmented from high-resolution pathology images to understand immune cell distribution for cancer treatment. The first contribution is a label super-resolution network that uses low-resolution labels to predict high-resolution labels based on visual cues. The second contribution is the method's robustness in land cover segmentation when high-resolution training data is limited, outperforming models trained only on high-resolution data. Our method utilizes more training data with weak labels for tasks like lymphocyte segmentation and segmenting foreground given object bounding boxes. It assumes no pixel-level supervision, only coarse accessory labels given on sets of input pixels. Our method leverages coarse accessory labels to represent high-resolution pixel counts in blocks, providing weak supervision for semantic segmentation networks. This approach is particularly useful in computer vision applications where high-resolution labeled data is limited. The method uses coarse accessory labels to represent high-resolution pixel counts in blocks, providing weak supervision for semantic segmentation networks. This is beneficial in computer vision applications with limited high-resolution labeled data. The descriptions of labels from the National Land Cover Database suggest distributions over high-resolution labels, allowing for interpretation with Gaussian distributions to account for variance. The method utilizes coarse accessory labels to represent high-resolution pixel counts in blocks, providing weak supervision for semantic segmentation networks. It allows for interpretation with Gaussian distributions to account for variance in real-world instances. The label counting layer computes a statistical representation of label counts in each block, with the output being two parameters for each label in the block. Our model utilizes coarse accessory labels to provide weak supervision for semantic segmentation networks. It computes statistical representations of label counts in blocks and compares distributions to optimize the segmentation model. This approach is effective for detecting land cover change over time in the same geographical location. Our model utilizes coarse accessory labels to provide weak supervision for semantic segmentation networks, optimizing the segmentation model for land cover change detection. The network is trained to minimize expressions over all blocks in the input image, using proposed methods in land cover classification tasks. Land cover mapping involves segmenting aerial or satellite imagery into different classes, which is useful for various government programs and planning purposes. Acquiring high-resolution land cover data is challenging and costly. The Chesapeake Conservancy, for instance, spent significant time and money on generating detailed land cover data. The text discusses the creation of high-resolution land cover maps using deep learning models, focusing on the Chesapeake Bay area. It also mentions the development of an automated land cover change detection method and an interactive web application for users to query and paint land cover maps. The effectiveness of label super-resolution method is demonstrated by comparing models trained with low-resolution data to segmentation models with high-resolution training data access. The text discusses the effectiveness of models trained using label super-resolution in identifying details in urban areas more effectively than weakly-supervised models. It also shows how models trained with a combination of low-and high-resolution data can generalize more effectively. Three datasets are used, including high-resolution aerial imagery, expensive high-resolution land cover data, and widely available low-resolution land cover data. The datasets are divided into four geographical regions for training and testing. The study uses different datasets for training and testing models, including high-resolution aerial imagery and low-resolution land cover data. Models are trained with high-resolution data from Maryland 2013 and tested in different regions. Four groups of models are tested: HR models with high-resolution data, SR models with label super-resolution technique, weakly-supervised models with low-resolution labels, and HR + SR models with both high and low-resolution labels. The experiments in the study vary two factors: the dataset used for training with low-resolution data and testing, and the amount of high-resolution data seen in training. The models are tested in different regions using high-resolution data from Maryland and low-resolution data from the Chesapeake area. This addresses the goals of the study to evaluate model performance under limited high-resolution labels. The study evaluates model performance by varying the amount of high-resolution data available for training. A U-Net architecture is used for segmentation, optimizing the core model on both high-resolution and low-resolution data. Parameters for super-resolution model training are derived from (low-res, high-res) pairs in the Maryland 2013 training set. See Appendices A and B for more details. The study evaluates model performance using a U-Net architecture for segmentation, optimizing on both high-resolution and low-resolution data. Baseline models include U-Net core trained with pixelwise cross-entropy loss and three weakly supervised segmentation approaches. See Appendices A and B for more details. The study evaluates model performance using a U-Net architecture for segmentation, optimizing on both high-resolution and low-resolution data. Baseline models include U-Net core trained with pixelwise cross-entropy loss and three weakly supervised segmentation approaches. The approach involves using a one-hot vector for the most frequent label, an EM approach similar to BID3, and comparing output label frequencies to NLCD class means using different loss criteria. Superpixel denoising is used instead of dense-CRF due to computational constraints. The study evaluates model performance using a U-Net architecture for segmentation, optimizing on both high-resolution and low-resolution data. Results show that the log-variance term in the criterion FORMULA10 is essential for accurate predictions. Different approaches were discussed in Appendix C. The results for weakly supervised models and SR models are compared in TAB4, with a focus on errors in \"Developed\" (urban) low-resolution classes. Jaccard score is highlighted as a more informative measure of classification quality than overall accuracy. The study emphasizes the importance of Jaccard score in evaluating classification quality, especially in developed areas. The results in TAB4 compare accuracies and Jaccard scores of different models on various datasets. The addition of high-resolution data in training super-resolution models is shown to improve performance. The study compares the performance of super-resolution models trained with varying amounts of high-res data. Adding low-res data during training slightly worsens results in Maryland but allows the model to adapt to new geographies. The SR-only model produces segmentation that better matches true color segments and fine features. Our super-resolution model outperforms weakly supervised baselines, especially in developed classes where the distribution of labels is flat. Adding high-resolution labels during training improves model performance gradually. The super-resolution model shows improved performance with more high-resolution data, outperforming HR-only models even with a small amount of high-resolution pixels. In the Chesapeake 2014 dataset, HR+SR models consistently outperform HR-only models, demonstrating the potential for creating fine-scale labels with limited supervision. The accuracy of HR+SR models closely matches the estimated accuracy of ground truth labels in the Chesapeake region. Our method for lymphocyte segmentation in pathology images aims to super-resolve low-resolution probabilities of lymphocyte infiltration, providing pixel-level detail. This is crucial for quantitative characterization of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in precision medicine, especially with the rise of cancer immunotherapy. Existing approaches only classify large tumor regions, but our method offers a more detailed analysis. Our method aims to super-resolve low-resolution probabilities of lymphocyte infiltration in pathology images, providing pixel-level detail for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in precision medicine. We use existing probability heatmaps as ground truth labels and evaluate segmentation performance using a lymphocyte classification dataset. The study compares different models for lymphocyte classification, including HR SVM, HR, and HR semi-supervised methods. These models use various techniques such as hand-crafted features and CNN training to classify objects in pathology images. The study evaluates baseline CNNs for classifying objects in pathology images using supervised data and four-fold cross-validation on a dataset of 1786 image patches. Low-resolution probability maps are quantized into 10 classes, with expected ratios of lymphocyte pixels ranging from 0% to 40%. A super-resolution network is trained on 150 slides with low-resolution labels, focusing on lymphocyte and non-lymphocyte cells. 20% of pixels in each input patch are assigned labels to guide the algorithm. In the study, a super-resolution network is trained on 150 slides with low-resolution labels for lymphocyte and non-lymphocyte cells. 20% of pixels in each input patch are assigned labels based on color. The method performs comparably to the best-performing baseline method with cell-level supervision. Our weakly supervised method effectively classifies lymphocyte/non-lymphocyte cells based on segmentation, achieving comparable results to the best-performing baseline method with cell-level supervision. A label super-resolution network is proposed to derive high-resolution labels from low-resolution labels, improving classification accuracy. Our method involves training a network to predict high-resolution labels by minimizing the distance between predicted and expected distributions based on low-resolution labels. It has been successfully applied in real-world scenarios where obtaining high-resolution labels is costly. Combining low and high-resolution labels improves generalization to test sets, and the model is robust to errors in estimating joint label distributions. The model cores and label counting modules were implemented in the CNTK framework and trained using RMSProp with an initial learning rate of 10 \u22123 decaying to 10 \u22126 by a factor of 10 per 6000 minibatches. Each minibatch contained 20 patches of 240\u00d7240 pixels. The training loss converges after 14k minibatch iterations using a U-Net architecture with 4 down-sampling and 4 up-sampling layers. The model uses a U-Net architecture with 4 down-sampling and 4 up-sampling layers for training. It applies a soft constraint on label assignments, allowing for multiple interpretations before converging to the correct mix of labels. The National Land Cover Database provides low-resolution land cover data. The National Land Cover Database is a joint effort of US Governmental Agencies, providing low-resolution land cover data every 5 years. The dataset represents land cover with 16 classes, with a focus on the Chesapeake Bay watershed. A label super-resolution method is proposed, relying on a joint distribution between NLCD classes and high-resolution land cover classes. This distribution can be estimated from NLCD class descriptions or derived from ground truth data, as shown in Table 4 for the state of Maryland. The study explores the relationship between NLCD classes and high-resolution land cover classes, showing expected percentages for different land cover classes in low-resolution regions. The data in Table 4 provides interval constraints for the frequency of high-res labels based on low-res labels. For example, regions classified as \"Developed, Open Space\" have 42% forest and 46% field cover. This method is similar to previous studies and aims to improve label super-resolution. Developed areas can be categorized into different intensities based on the amount of constructed materials and vegetation present. These categories range from low to high intensity, with varying percentages of impervious surfaces. Examples of these areas include single-family housing units, apartment complexes, and commercial/industrial spaces. Impervious surfaces make up 80% to 100% of developed areas, including apartment complexes, row houses, and commercial/industrial spaces. Barren Land consists of various earthen materials with less than 15% vegetation cover. Different types of forests, such as Deciduous, Evergreen, and Mixed, dominate developed areas with trees over 5 meters tall and more than 20% vegetation cover. The curr_chunk describes different types of vegetation cover including Shrub/Scrub, Grassland/Herbaceous, Pasture/Hay, and Cultivated Crops used for livestock grazing or crop production. Each type has specific characteristics and vegetation composition requirements. The curr_chunk discusses various types of vegetation cover, including crop vegetation, woody wetlands, and emergent herbaceous wetlands. It also mentions the use of interval constraints in statistics matching. The use of interval constraints in the statistics matching module of the network fails to produce accurate label super-resolution results. The true distributions of high-res classes given NLCD labels are obscured, making it more suitable to use a Gaussian model for better data fitting. The direct use of interval constraints in label super-resolution fails to produce accurate results. Using a Gaussian model for statistics matching leads to better data fitting and dramatically improved label super-resolution outcomes. After calibrating signals from satellite images, land cover change is detected by comparing mean absolute differences. Using raw NAIP images yields poor results, while model predictions show reasonable detection. A web application allows interactive querying of models for performance evaluation. Users can interactively compare land cover predictions from different models on an ESRI World Imagery basemap. They can adjust the opacity of predictions and switch between model outputs to see how they match up with the underlying imagery. The tool currently displays predictions from a high-performing HR+SR model and a model trained with US-wide data. The tool allows users to manually adjust the weighting scheme for model predictions by using sliders. Despite potential errors in estimating distribution models, results were robust in two main applications. For land cover classification, setting target distributions based on NLCD specifications yielded similar results with some noise in classes like \"Water\" and Evergreen Forest. The tool allows users to adjust the weighting scheme for model predictions manually. There was more noise in classes like \"Water\" and Evergreen Forest due to wide intervals in the specifications. The distribution can be tuned by hand to adjust proportions, such as forcing the \"Water\" class to have a higher proportion of water. The web application allows interactive querying of the HR+SR model for any area in the United States. Our approach benefits various application scenarios by using rough block guidance for segmentation tasks. By assuming uniform distributions in labeled blocks, we achieve results comparable to fine-grained hand segmentation, making crowd-sourcing labeling faster and more consistent. This falls under weakly supervised segmentation methods in computer vision, excelling when there is spatial structure present. Our problem formulation focuses on cases where traditional weakly supervised models are not suitable, demonstrated through foreground-background segmentation of pedestrians from datasets. Images are extracted from bounding boxes in the \"pedestrian\" class, using a small U-Net model with 4 upsampling and down-sampling layers. Training involves dividing images into blocks and inputting foreground pixel counts to the statistics matching layer. True label frequencies are used for coarse target distributions. For coarse target distributions, true label frequencies are used as means with a fixed variance. Three models are trained using different techniques, including super-resolution, L2 distance loss, and interval constraint. Results are compared with baseline models trained on high-resolution data using pixelwise cross-entropy and L2 losses. The focus is on spatially invariant segmentation of large images using the U-Net architecture. The core segmentation network can be replaced with other models, such as for bounding box segmentation. The study explores different core network models for bounding box segmentation, highlighting the need for varied weights for pixel labels due to spatial invariance issues. A larger U-Net variant is used for pedestrian segmentation, with training images divided into blocks labeled as \"background\", \"boundary\", and \"foreground\". The super-resolution model is trained to produce example segmentations. The super-resolution model was trained to produce example segmentations, yielding results in Table 6 and Fig. 10. It locates object boundaries comparably to the high-resolution model, showing potential for reducing costs of acquiring labels for new object classes. The super-resolution model can automatically generate coarse labels using co-segmentation techniques like class activation mapping. The probabilistic index map model (PIM) is a simple unsupervised co-segmentation technique that can be implemented in a few lines of code. It analyzes registered images using Gaussian color models to derive coarse labels for object crops. The color palette for individual images is shown on the left, with each image having its own palette. The model groups pixels into segments based on color consistency across the image collection. Once segmented, the left and right edges are assumed to be background. The model groups pixels into segments based on color consistency across the image collection. The left and right edges are assumed to be background, and the rest is assigned to foreground probabilistically. The segmentation consistency is controlled by clipping variances of Gaussian models. The PIM model can produce reasonable approximations to image segmentations. The label super-resolution network can produce segmentations by approximating block segmentation. Count constraints are common in computer vision and other applications. A recent natural language processing paper addresses learning features of important emails through soft guidance on groups of emails. The text discusses learning features of important emails through soft guidance on groups of emails and how similar situations arise in public health with different statistical summaries for groups of patients. It also mentions the analysis of individual medical records leading to fine-grained segmentation maps. The technique discussed can create coarse labels in an unsupervised manner, allowing predictions for individual patients without needing these labels in training. This approach can be adapted to various applications."
