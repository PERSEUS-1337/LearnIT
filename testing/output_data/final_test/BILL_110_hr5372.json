The Congress finds that recycling in the United States is a significant industry, employing over 1,100,000 people and generating billions in revenue. Recycling helps save energy by reducing the need for virgin raw materials in manufacturing. The United States recycling rate for various materials like aluminum, glass, and plastic is stagnant or declining. Businesses relying on recycled materials are struggling to obtain the quantity and quality needed, leading to manufacturing facilities closing or switching to virgin materials. Recycling aluminum, steel cans, paper, printed materials, glass, and plastic can save energy equivalent to 15 medium-sized power plants annually. Reusing 500 steel drums per week can yield enough energy savings to power a city the size of Colorado Springs for a year. Increased reuse and recycling have significant environmental benefits, such as cleaner air, safer water, and reduced production costs. For example, between 2 and 5 percent of the waste stream is reusable, preventing waste creation and adverse impacts from disposal. Recycling office paper prevents 60 pounds of air pollutants from being released, saves 7,000 gallons of water, and 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space. Aluminum, plastic, and glass recycling also result in significant landfill space and air pollution savings. A national investment in the reuse and recycling industries is crucial to preserve and expand America's recycling infrastructure. The manufacture of 100 percent recycled paperboard products significantly reduces greenhouse gases and prevents material from going to landfills, reducing landfill gases. Steel and aluminum recycling also save significant landfill space. Special depreciation allowance for certain reuse and recycling property. Special Allowance for Certain Reuse and Recycling Property: An amendment to Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code allows for a 50% depreciation deduction for qualified reuse and recycling property in the year it is placed in service. The adjusted basis of the property is then reduced by this deduction before calculating the depreciation allowance. Qualified reuse and recycling property eligible for a depreciation deduction must have a useful life of at least 5 years and be acquired by the taxpayer after December 31, 2006. Qualified reuse and recycling property eligible for a depreciation deduction must have a useful life of at least 5 years and be acquired by the taxpayer after December 31, 2006, with exceptions for certain types of property. Taxpayers can elect to have a system apply to certain property classes for a taxable year, excluding all property in that class placed in service during that year. A special rule applies to self-constructed property if manufacturing begins after December 31, 2006. Taxpayers can elect a system for certain property classes, excluding property placed in service during the year. A special rule applies to self-constructed property if manufacturing begins after December 31, 2006. The deduction for qualified reuse and recycling property is allowed in computing minimum tax without adjustments under section 56. Reuse and recycling property refers to machinery, equipment, and software necessary for operation. The term 'qualified reuse and recyclable materials' refers to scrap materials used exclusively for collecting, distributing, or recycling, excluding equipment for transportation or producing new products from recycled materials. The term 'qualified reuse and recyclable materials' includes scrap plastic, glass, textiles, rubber, packaging, fiber, ferrous and nonferrous metals, and electronic scrap like cathode ray tubes and central processing units. The effective date of this amendment is specified. The effective date for the amendment is after December 31, 2006."
