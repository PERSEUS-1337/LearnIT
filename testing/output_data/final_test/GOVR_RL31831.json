While chemical weapons have seen little technological evolution since the mid-twentieth century, recent advances have been made in biological weapons. Most terrorist groups have historically avoided using CBW due to concerns about alienating their constituencies and lack of technical expertise. The use of chemical and biological weapons by terrorists is a growing concern, with past incidents being rare but indicating a potential shift in patterns. The 1995 sarin gas attack by Aum Shinrikyo in Tokyo raised awareness of the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction. Concerns stem from the increasing availability of CBW and the psychological impact of their use. The use of chemical and biological weapons by terrorist groups like the PKK, HAMAS, Al Qaeda, and domestic individuals has raised concerns. Aum Shinrikyo's actions were particularly alarming due to their systematic pursuit of technical capabilities. Aum Shinrikyo's bizarre agenda included attempts to kill Japanese civilians with technical failures. Despite heightened anxiety, CBW attacks have not increased, with hoaxes rising but actual incidents decreasing. Experts remain concerned about the use of chemical and biological agents. The potential use of chemical and biological agents by terrorist groups has increased due to the growth of militant religious groups with political agendas, global availability of CBW information and stockpiles, internationalization of the threat of terrorism, and clear evidence of terrorist interest and capabilities. Militant religious terrorists may target victims labeled as heretics or infidels, showing a willingness to kill large numbers of people without constraints. The lethality per terrorist attack increased over the past decade, with a larger proportion of attacks executed by persons with religion-based animus. Concern is growing about the availability of information and resources for building weapons by subnational groups. The tragedies of September 11th highlighted these trends. Terrorist groups, including the PLO, Red Army Faction, Hezbollah, and others, have shown interest in acquiring unconventional weapons. The breakup of the Soviet Union has increased access to advanced nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. Globalization and the post-Soviet era have made materials and expertise more available, posing a serious threat to state security. The evolution of international terrorism has led to increased commonality of interests between diverse populations, with groups forming ties across ideological, ethnic, and national lines. This internationalization of the threat has broadened the potential recruitment pool and increased the distance between groups and their targets, removing moral constraints. The internationalization of terrorism has led to a removal of moral and political constraints, increasing incentives for groups to consider unconventional weapons. Contemporary terrorist groups, particularly Al Qaeda, have shown interest and some capability in acquiring chemical and biological weapons, with Osama bin Laden actively pursuing them since the early 1990s. Al Qaeda's interest in chemical and biological weapons is evident from various incidents, including findings of ricin and anthrax in Afghanistan, nerve gas experiments on dogs, and plots to use cyanide and ricin in attacks. These incidents highlight the group's efforts to acquire and use CBW. Al Qaeda's interest in chemical and biological weapons is demonstrated by the arrest of individuals with training in various regions. Evidence seized in 2003 showed technical sophistication in producing bio-chemical agents like weaponized anthrax. The logic behind this interest in CBW is unclear, as these agents are more effective in causing anxiety and panic rather than high casualties. Projections of casualties in the tens of thousands are possible but often exaggerated worst-case scenarios. Terrorist groups like Al Qaeda may avoid using chemical and biological weapons in attacks due to practical obstacles and reasons such as causing economic damage, showing strength, or emulating other groups. Western governments should be cautious not to overstate the threat and heighten anxieties. Al Qaeda may avoid using chemical and biological weapons in attacks due to significant technical difficulties. Aum Shinrikyo's failed attempts serve as a warning of the challenges involved in acquiring, maintaining, and effectively disseminating such weapons for most nonstate actors. Despite technical advances in recent years, there are still considerable obstacles to terrorist development of chemical and biological weapons. These weapons have not resulted in large death tolls compared to conventional weapons like truck bombs. The incentives and disincentives for individual terrorists to use CBW are complex and may not be the same. Recent suicide attacks indicate a growing willingness among terrorist organizations to plan and condone the death of their own operatives in the service of the cause. Handling chemical and biological agents poses risks without top-quality equipment, but the consequences of a CBW attack differ from conventional attacks. Incentives for dying in a CBW attack may not be the same as for other types of attacks, especially with the presence of religious terrorists. The presence of religious terrorists may decrease the likelihood of chemical and biological weapon attacks, as these groups tend to prefer conventional weapons with a proven track record. While there are no guarantees, historical patterns suggest that the next major terrorist attack will likely use conventional means. However, terrorism seeks to shock, so a chemical or biological attack cannot be ruled out entirely. Targets of terrorism must balance preparing the public for possible attacks while avoiding hyping the threat, which could incentivize terrorist organizations. Measures to counter the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons are crucial for reducing future threats. The challenge of countering the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is becoming increasingly difficult in a globalized world. Defensive measures and consequence management are crucial to reduce the impact of potential attacks. Some security measures have been implemented in the United States, but opinions vary on their adequacy. The fate of individuals involved in Iraqi weapons programs is a concern as global availability of information and materials related to these weapons increases. The potential danger of losing control of Iraqi chemical and biological weapons (CBW) during and after military operations is a concern. There is a risk of dissemination to terrorist organizations, especially in times of political or economic instability. New links could develop between Iraqis with previous regime connections and groups like Al Qaeda. Osama bin Laden has expressed support for Iraq. The potential proliferation risks of Iraqi chemical and biological weapons to terrorist groups like Al Qaeda, along with the need for caution and additional measures to address this emerging danger, are highlighted. Measures under the Nunn-Lugar program may not be sufficient to mitigate these risks in a post-conflict Iraq."
