    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Sunshine in Academic Admissions Act\". It includes findings related to academic admissions. Congress finds that federally funded institutions of higher education may be treating student applications differently based on race, color, or national origin, despite Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting such discrimination. The Supreme Court has allowed racially discriminatory admissions, but the case of Fisher v. University of Texas brought attention to this issue. In Fisher v. University of Texas, the Supreme Court affirmed the need for strict scrutiny in university admissions to ensure diversity is not just racial balancing. Colleges must reconsider racially selective admissions policies if less discriminatory alternatives can achieve similar results. (8) Academic \"mismatch\" refers to a significant discrepancy in academic qualifications between various groups within a student body, encouraged when universities lower their standards to achieve a specific composition. Academic \"mismatch\" harms students by leading to lower achievement, higher dropout rates, less competitive majors, and a heavy student loan burden. SEC. 3. REPORT ON CONSIDERATION OF RACE, COLOR, OR NATIONAL ORIGIN IN STUDENT ADMISSIONS. Each institution of higher education must submit a report to the Secretary of Education within 180 days of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, regarding the consideration of race, color, or national origin in student admissions. The report should disclose if these factors are taken into account in the admissions process. The report must include information on the racial, color, and national origin groups considered in admissions, how group membership is determined and weighted, and the rationale for considering group membership in relation to the educational mission of the institution or department. The report must include a description of racially neutral alternatives considered, how often group membership is reassessed, and factors other than race, color, or national origin collected in the admissions process. The report must include raw admissions data for applicants based on various criteria, including race, color, and national origin, to analyze the weight given to these factors in admissions decisions. The institution must analyze the correlation between group membership based on race, color, or national origin and enrollment in remediation programs, graduation rates, and likelihood of defaulting on education loans. The report must be made publicly available. SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION: This Act prohibits preference or discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. \n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITION: \"Institution of higher education\" is defined as per the Higher Education Act of 1965, excluding institutions outside the United States."
