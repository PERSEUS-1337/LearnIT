    "content": "The Act is titled the \"No Taxation Without Representation Act\" and includes findings. The \"No Taxation Without Representation Act\" highlights the American colonists' opposition to being taxed without representation in British Parliament. The slogan gained prominence after the Sugar Act in 1764 and was further fueled by the Stamp Act in 1765. Benjamin Franklin emphasized the Englishmen's right to consent to taxation through their own representatives. The Stamp Act was the first direct tax on American colonies, later repealed. Article I, section 2, clause 1 of the US Constitution defines House of Representatives composition. The Organic Act of 1801 placed Washington, DC under US Congress jurisdiction. Residents no longer considered part of Virginia or Maryland. Opposition in Washington, DC to the Act was immediate. In Washington, DC, opposition arose to being taxed without representation. Congressional leaders tried to grant DC voting rights through constitutional amendments, but none succeeded. Puerto Rico acquired in 1898 has a Resident Commissioner with limited voting rights. The Virgin Islands, acquired in 1917, granted citizenship in 1927. Residents are exempt from federal taxes on income earned in Puerto Rico under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. Residents of the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are not subject to Federal income taxes if they fully pay all income tax liabilities to their respective territories. Guam residents file tax returns with Guam, not the United States Federal Government, under section 935 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Residents of the Northern Mariana Islands entered into territory status in 1975 and do not pay United States Federal income taxes. Residents of American Samoa, governed by section 931 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, are exempt from Federal taxes on income earned in certain territories but must pay taxes on income earned elsewhere. This tax treatment is in line with the democratic traditions of the United States and the principles established in the Constitution. Residents of the District of Columbia should be exempt from paying US Federal income taxes, in line with other territories with delegates but no Representatives. Residents of the District of Columbia are proposed to be excluded from paying US Federal income taxes under a new section added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In the case of a bona fide resident of the District of Columbia, gross income excludes income from DC sources and income connected to business in DC. Deductions and credits related to excluded income are not allowed. Rules similar to section 876, 937 apply. Rules similar to section 876, 937, 957(c), 3401(a)(8)(D), and 7654 apply. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part III of subchapter N of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by this section regarding income from sources within the District of Columbia apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of this Act."
