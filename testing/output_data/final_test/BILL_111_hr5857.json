    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fair American Corporate Tax Act\" or \"FACT Act\" and includes a decrease in the top marginal rate. The \"Fair American Corporate Tax Act\" or \"FACT Act\" includes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, such as reducing the top marginal rate to 28 percent for taxable income exceeding $75,000. Personal service corporations will also see a decrease in their tax rate from 35 percent to 28 percent. Conforming amendments throughout the Code will reflect this change. The amendments made by the \"Fair American Corporate Tax Act\" reduce the top marginal tax rate from 35 percent to 28 percent for taxable income exceeding $75,000. These changes apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010. Limitation on treaty benefits for certain deductible payments. Limitation on treaty benefits for certain deductible payments: Amends Section 894 of the Internal Revenue Code to impose a withholding tax on deductible related-party payments to foreign parent corporations. The term 'deductible related-party payment' refers to payments between members of the same foreign controlled group of entities that are allowable as deductions. A foreign controlled group of entities is defined as a controlled group with a foreign corporation as the common parent. A partnership or entity (excluding corporations) is considered part of a controlled group if it is controlled by members of that group. The term 'foreign parent corporation' in this context refers to a foreign corporation that is the parent of a controlled group. The term 'foreign parent corporation' in the context of deductible related-party payments refers to the common parent of a foreign controlled group of entities. The Secretary may issue regulations to clarify the treatment of entities within a foreign controlled group, including the common parent designation. The amendment applies to payments made after the enactment of the Act."
