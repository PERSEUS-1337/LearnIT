The all-milk price received by farmers was 36% lower in 2009 compared to the previous year, while alfalfa prices only decreased by 20%. This economic downturn has raised concerns about the effectiveness of current dairy policies in supporting producers. The dairy market boom in 2007 turned into a bust, with dairy farmers experiencing high returns followed by a significant drop in milk prices. The all-milk price hit a record $21.90 per hundredweight in 2008, but feed prices rose rapidly, creating concern for dairy farmers. The milk-feed price index, reported by the USDA, averaged 2.01 in 2008, the lowest since at least 1985. In 2009, the ratio dropped to 1.56, below the 10-year average of 2.90, indicating economic stress in the dairy industry due to weak demand relative to milk supplies. In 2009, USDA expects the all-milk price to average between $12.05 per cwt. and $12.25 per cwt., down from $18.29 per cwt. in 2008. Productivity growth in the dairy industry is driven by improved cattle genetics and feed management practices, leading to record high milk production per cow. Dairy farmers increased herds in 2008, resulting in a 2.3% rise in U.S. milk production. In 2009, U.S. milk production declined by 0.8% due to lower returns leading to a decrease in dairy cow numbers. Despite the drop in production, demand also decreased, resulting in lower prices. Dairy exports accounted for a small but significant portion of U.S. dairy product sales, with growth driven by reduced product availability from other countries. In 2009, U.S. dairy exports saw strong gains, but export prospects weakened due to factors like the global recession and a stronger dollar. This decline in export demand led to more products being sold domestically, driving down prices. Domestic demand also slowed, with reduced restaurant sales and consumer spending. However, increased purchases for home consumption supported the market to some extent. Feed costs rose sharply in mid-2008 due to factors like expanding corn demand for ethanol use. In 2008, the U.S. faced uncertainty in corn and soybean yields due to flooding in the Midwest. The farm prices of corn and alfalfa surged, but the commodity price boom collapsed in September as markets faltered. Supply fears diminished as crop yield prospects improved by the end of the year. Dairy feedstuff prices dropped substantially from earlier highs but remained elevated. In 2008, dairy feedstuff prices dropped substantially from earlier highs but remained elevated. Corn prices in December averaged $4.10 per bushel, alfalfa was $155 per ton, and soybean prices averaged $9.24 per bushel. USDA revised its forecasts for 2009 corn and soybean prices downward due to prospects for larger crops. Dairy economists expect a slight decline in total milk production in 2009 as dairy farm income decreases. Dairy exports in 2009 have declined as global economic conditions weaken. Based on USDA forecasts, milk prices are expected to rise in the last quarter of 2009 due to supply adjustments and higher support prices. In 2010, milk production is expected to decline further as farmers cull more cows following low returns in 2009. Exports are expected to increase slightly as the global economy improves, but export prospects may be limited by higher domestic prices and larger exportable supplies in competitor countries. The all-milk price is forecasted to increase from $12.15 per cwt. in 2009 to $15.05 per cwt. The U.S. dairy policy has evolved over seven decades to address issues such as lack of bargaining power for producers, price volatility, and market shortages. Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) and the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) were established in the 1930s and 1940s to address these issues. Additionally, newer programs like the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) were introduced in the 1985 farm bill to support dairy exports. The 1985 farm bill established the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) to counter foreign competitor subsidies. The Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program, established in the 2002 farm bill, provides government payments to dairy farmers during times of low milk prices. The MILC program pays dairy producers when prices decline below a specified level. Lower milk and dairy product prices since late 2008 have led to increased program activity, with USDA purchasing dairy products under the DPPSP and MILC payments being triggered. The MILC program, extended until September 30, 2012, pays dairy farmers when farm milk prices fall below a target price. The MILC program, similar to subsidy programs for crops, pays dairy farmers when milk prices drop below $16.94 per cwt in Boston. Eligible farmers receive a payment equal to 45% of the price difference, limited to 2.985 million pounds of annual production. Large dairy farm operators have expressed concerns about the payment limit affecting their income. The 2008 farm bill adjusts the target price based on feed costs, with a formula to calculate monthly feed costs. Milk prices remained high in 2007 and 2008, eliminating the need for MILC payments. However, prices have since dropped below the trigger for MILC payments. The Class I Boston farm milk price for February 2009 was $13.97 per cwt, triggering MILC payments for the first time in two years at a rate of $1.51 per cwt. Payments rose to $2.01 per cwt in March, with expectations for continued payments in 2009 at smaller rates. Producers must choose when to start receiving payments based on potential rates and production limits. As of October 26, 2009, total MILC payments distributed were $775 million. Timing of payments has raised concerns for producers due to data availability for feed cost adjustments. The Agricultural Act of 1949 established a dairy price support program to protect farmers and consumers. USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation supports milk prices by purchasing surplus dairy products. MILC payments are delayed by two months due to data availability for feed cost adjustments. The Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) established by the 2008 farm bill sets minimum prices for dairy products like cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk. These prices serve as a floor for market prices, indirectly supporting farm milk prices. USDA purchases surplus products at these minimum prices to stabilize the market and support dairy farmers. The 2008 farm bill established the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) to set minimum prices for dairy products, indirectly supporting farm milk prices at $9.90 per cwt. USDA resumed purchases in 2008 and 2009 when product prices approached support levels, buying 111 million pounds of nonfat dry milk in 2008 and expecting to purchase 379 million pounds in 2009, with total expenditures of $223 million. The DPPSP spent $223 million from October 1, 2008, through September 10, 2009. USDA announced a temporary increase in price support for cheese and nonfat dry milk in 2009. The Senate approved an amendment to increase Farm Service Agency funding by $350 million for dairy product price support, but the FY2010 Agriculture appropriations bill allocated $60 million for dairy product purchases. The DPPSP program in 2009 allocated $60 million for dairy product purchases and $290 million in direct payments to farmers. Federal milk marketing orders set minimum prices for milk based on its use, while the DPPSP serves as a price floor for dairy products. FMMOs regulate the farm price of two-thirds of the nation's fluid milk. Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) establish a uniform system of classified pricing for milk based on its end use within defined marketing areas. Producers are impacted by classified pricing and pooling of receipts to pay all farmers a blend price. Handlers must pay minimum class prices for Grade A milk, with higher prices for milk used for fluid consumption (Class I) compared to manufactured dairy products (Class II). The differences between dairy product classes reflect market values, with blend pricing allowing all farmers to pool milk receipts and receive a single price based on order-wide usage. Class II, III, and IV prices are the same nationwide, calculated monthly by USDA. Class I prices for fluid consumption vary by area, determined by adding to a base price. Class I prices are determined by adding a \"Class I differential\" to a monthly base price, which increases with distance from milk surplus regions. This pricing mechanism ensures adequate milk supplies for consumption centers, with local dairy farmers protected by minimum price rules. Dairy farmers support minimum prices to balance marketing power, while processors oppose them for limiting market adjustments and profitability. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) provides cash bonus payments to U.S. dairy exporters to counter foreign dairy subsidies. Authorized in 1985, the program has totaled $1.1 billion in payments since inception, with funding from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) was reactivated by USDA in 2009 after not being used since FY2004. U.S. dairy product exports under DEIP bonuses are limited by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to specific quantities and expenditures. Dairy producer groups have called for action due to market challenges since 2008, with the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) urging the Department of Agriculture to address the situation. In January 2009, dairy industry stakeholders urged the Secretary of Agriculture to assist dairy producers by increasing government purchases of dairy products and reactivating the Dairy Export Incentive Program to boost exports. The International Dairy Foods Association also focused on ways to bolster demand for dairy products. These actions were aimed at spurring domestic demand, slowing price declines, and helping exporters maintain business relationships. In early May 2009, the National Milk Producers Federation requested the U.S. government to restart the Dairy Export Incentive Program to address excess dairy products. They also asked for increased support prices for cheese and nonfat dry milk. A proposal for a dairy herd buyout to reduce milk supply was discussed, although not included in NMPF requests. The Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry of the House Agriculture Committee held hearings in July 2009 to review economic conditions in the dairy industry. The Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry of the House Agriculture Committee held hearings in July 2009 to address challenges in the dairy industry. USDA took actions to support dairy farm income, including increasing price supports and activating the Dairy Export Incentive Program. They expect to spend about $1 billion in fiscal 2009 on dairy products and payments to producers under the MILC program. Additionally, USDA announced a temporary increase in price support for cheese and nonfat dry milk from August 2009 through October 2009. The USDA announced a temporary increase in price support for cheese and nonfat dry milk from August 2009 through October 2009. This raised the government purchase price for nonfat dry milk, cheddar blocks, and cheddar barrels. The goal was to boost U.S. dairy farmers' revenue by $243 million and result in the government purchase of additional dairy products. The purchases were expected to be a no-net-cost transaction as the products would be resold at higher prices when the market recovers. Cheese prices rose following the announcement. Cheese prices rose to new support levels, with the government purchasing less than 1 million pounds of nonfat dry milk. Market observers noted a strengthening in product markets overseas, with milk powder prices increasing due to improved demand in Asia. USDA announced the transfer of 200 million pounds of nonfat dry milk to domestic feeding programs to support dairy product consumption and prices for farmers. Additionally, USDA announced allocations under DEIP for the marketing year ending June 30, 2009. USDA announced DEIP allocations for the marketing year ending June 30, 2009, and for the following year. Export subsidies aim to move more products into market channels, reduce inventories, and raise farm prices, but significant quantities are needed to have a noticeable impact on prices. Free trade supporters caution about the effects of price-enhancing DEIP export quantities. Free trade supporters caution that exceeding price-enhancing DEIP export limits may lead to breaking WTO commitments, with little impact on farm milk prices. Policymakers need to consider the implications of returning to aggressive export subsidies and the reaction from major trading partners. Producer groups advocate for reactivating DEIP, citing the EU's actions to stabilize dairy prices. The current discussion on dairy policy includes maintaining the status quo, implementing new programs like a dairy buyout, and modifying existing programs to support dairy farmer income. The Federal Milk Marketing Improvement Act of 2009 aims to improve farm milk prices but raises concerns about the competitiveness of the U.S. dairy industry. Some are concerned that the Federal Milk Marketing Improvement Act of 2009 could reduce the competitiveness of the U.S. dairy industry by rewarding inefficiency. The Milk Import Tariff Equity Act aims to address low milk prices by imposing import barriers, but no action has been taken on similar bills introduced in Congress over the last decade. Protein Concentrates (MPCs) are affecting the dairy industry's price environment. Producers are reducing milk production due to lower returns, which is expected to increase farm prices. Policymakers have the option to maintain current programs like DPPSP and MILC, which are supporting milk prices by removing excess inventory and providing payments to dairy farmers. The feed cost adjustor helps offset high feed prices for dairy farmers. Supporters of the status quo argue that current dairy programs may lead to excess milk supplies, which could be worsened by modifications to enhance producer incomes. Proponents of additional action highlight significant income loss among producers, but any new budgetary outlays could add to the federal deficit and burden consumers with higher costs. Some producers are facing income loss and may not survive financially without assistance. The Dairy Termination Program in 1986 aimed to reduce government costs by paying farmers to remove dairy cows from production. This program temporarily reduced milk production capacity and helped farmers transition to lower price support levels. The Dairy Termination Program in 1986 aimed to reduce government costs by paying farmers to remove dairy cows from production, helping them transition to lower price support levels. The National Milk Producers Federation operates its own dairy buyout program called Cooperatives Working Together, which has purchased and removed 276,000 cows from production since 2003. The program is not pursuing a new federal buyout, and recently closed its seventh round of bidding for dairy cow purchases on May 1, 2009. The Cooperatives Working Together (CWT) closed its seventh round of bidding for dairy cow purchases, with herd culling slowing in March and April. CWT accepted bids for nearly 101,000 cows and 2 billion pounds of milk production capacity, its largest retirement program to date. The eighth round, announced in July 2009 and completed in September 2009, saw bids accepted for 74,114 cows and 1.5 billion pounds of milk. Additionally, nearly 3,000 bred heifers were sent to processing plants. Another round was announced on October 1, 2009, with bids due by October 15. A related bill, H.R. 3322, was introduced in Congress on July 23, 2009. H.R. 3322, introduced in Congress on July 23, 2009, aims to use Section 32 funds to incentivize dairy producers to remove cows from production. It also proposes increasing MILC payments temporarily. Various farm groups suggest adding funds to boost MILC payments to support dairy farmers' income. Some bills in Congress seek to raise MILC payments, but opponents fear it could hinder the necessary supply adjustment in the dairy market. The National Milk Producers Federation and the International Dairy Foods Association have proposed administrative changes to the dairy market, including loosening packaging requirements and exchanging government-owned dairy inventory for consumer-ready products. These changes aim to bring the dairy market back into balance and provide additional support to prices. Regulatory measures addressing these issues are currently under review at USDA. In response to low financial returns for dairy farmers, Congress included $350 million in the FY2010 Agriculture appropriations bill for supplemental income payments and the purchase of dairy products for distribution. The bill allows for expedited rulemaking to ensure timely payments, but the allocation of funds among producers is a contentious issue. Regulatory measures addressing dairy market issues are currently under review at USDA. The Senate-passed bill included an amendment for an additional $350 million in FSA salaries and expenses for dairy disaster assistance through an increase in dairy product price supports. This funding was expected to raise minimum purchase prices for nonfat dry milk and cheese. The House-passed appropriations bill did not have a similar provision. The National Milk Producer Federation (NMPF) supports direct purchases to remove surplus dairy products, arguing it would raise overall price levels and provide greater benefits than higher purchase prices or direct farmer payments. The International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) opposes higher purchase prices, suggesting alternative options like additional MILC payments and government purchases of various products to minimize market impacts and avoid increasing costs for food processors. The USDA implemented a dairy import assessment program as part of the 2008 farm bill. U.S. dairy producers pay a 15-cent per cwt. assessment on all milk produced for dairy product promotion and research. The program also collects assessments on imported dairy products as required by the 2002 farm bill. The Secretary of Agriculture, in collaboration with the USTR, found that a mandatory dairy import assessment was not allowed due to exemptions for Alaska and Hawaii. To address this, the 2008 farm bill extended the assessment to include these states and Puerto Rico, aligning with U.S. trade obligations. The import assessment is set at 7.5 cents per cwt and is supported by dairy producer groups to ensure fair contribution to domestic dairy promotion efforts. Dairy importers and processors oppose the import assessment, arguing it is an unfair tax on imported products that could be challenged as trade-distorting. USDA held a public hearing on proposals to amend federal milk marketing orders regarding producer-handler provisions in May 2009. Currently, dairy farmers who qualify as producer-handlers under federal milk marketing orders are exempt from pricing and pooling provisions, giving them a cost advantage over other handlers. Proposals have been made to eliminate this exemption. The proposed changes to federal marketing orders would eliminate or modify exemptions for producer-handlers based on the size of their operation, ranging from 450,000 to 3 million pounds of milk per month. USDA recommended limiting exemptions to those with total route disposition of fluid milk products of 3 million pounds or less per month. A final decision will be made after a 60-day comment period and approval by two-thirds of producers in a referendum. If approved by two-thirds of producers, the amendment to the order becomes effective through a final rule in the Federal Register. A negative vote on the amended order would result in the elimination of the order."
