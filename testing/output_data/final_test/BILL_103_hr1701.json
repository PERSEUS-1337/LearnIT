The Administrator will provide capitalization grants to States with primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems to further health protection objectives. Grants will be deposited in drinking water treatment revolving funds established by the State.

These funds will be used for providing loans or financial assistance to public water systems to facilitate compliance with drinking water regulations.

Each fund will be managed and credited with repayments and interest, available perpetually for financial assistance. Unused amounts will remain in the fund for future obligations. The State will establish revolving funds using capitalization grants to provide loan assistance to public water systems serving less than 10,000 individuals. The funds will be managed to ensure that amounts are invested in interest-bearing obligations of the State or the United States. States must deposit available funds promptly into State revolving funds to earn interest. States are restricted from providing grants exceeding the interest collected on deposits in the revolving fund. The State may provide assistance from a State revolving fund to public water systems experiencing financial hardship, with priority given to those with the greatest public health needs. Assistance is limited to systems owned by governmental or inter-governmental agencies, non-profit organizations, Indian tribes, or a combination thereof. The State may provide loan assistance to public water systems with the greatest public health needs and financial need, ensuring they can repay the loan and establish a dedicated source for repayment. The Administrator will only enter into an agreement with a State after it has deposited all grants received for this purpose.

No financial assistance will be provided for avoidable expenditures in public water systems, except for consolidation purposes.

State contributions of at least 20% of the grant amount are required, and financial administration can be combined with other revolving funds if approved by the Administrator.

The fund can be used solely for specified purposes, with the State agency retaining authority over assistance priorities. Up to 4 percent of the grants can be used for fund administration costs. The State can establish a revolving fund for grants under this subsection, with up to 4 percent of the grants used for fund administration costs. For fiscal year 1994, each State may use up to 2 percent of the grants for public water system supervision if matched with non-Federal funds, and an additional 1 percent for technical assistance to public water systems. The Administrator will provide necessary guidance and regulations for implementation. The section provides guidance to ensure states use funds from revolving funds in accordance with laws, prevent fraud, and avoid financing public water system expansions for future growth. States and water systems must follow accounting standards. The Administrator requires states to report on their activities and audit revolving funds every 2 years. A needs survey of public water systems in the US will be conducted, and 1.5% of funds can be used by Indian tribes. The Administrator can use appropriated funds to make grants to Indian Tribes and Alaskan Native Villages for public water system expenditures. Authorization of appropriations is $599,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and $1,000,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997, with additional funds as needed."
