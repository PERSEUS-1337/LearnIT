    "content": "The \"Reservist Access to Justice Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title. Improvements to veterans' reemployment rights are included in the act. The \"Reservist Access to Justice Act of 2007\" includes amendments to provide liquidated damages for employers who willfully fail to comply with reemployment rights, with a maximum amount of $20,000 for state and private employers and relief options for federal government employers. The court may require the employer to compensate the person for any loss of wages or benefits due to non-compliance with the law. If the violation is willful, the employer may have to pay liquidated damages or $20,000. Any compensation awarded is in addition to other rights and benefits provided by the law. States must hold compensation awarded under certain subparagraphs in a special account and pay it directly to the person. If not paid within 3 years, the compensation goes to the Treasury. Injunctive relief under Section 4323(e) is now mandatory. Employers violating Chapter 43 of Title 38 may be required to pay punitive damages. The court may order the employer to pay punitive damages if their failure to comply with Chapter 43 of Title 38 was done with malice or reckless indifference to the person's federally-protected rights. Additionally, the right of action under USERRA allows for lawsuits against State or private employers in federal or state courts. The receipt or use of Federal financial assistance by a State for any program waives sovereign immunity for employee suits under Chapter 43 of Title 38. State officials can be sued for injunctive relief, with costs awarded to the prevailing party. SEC. 3. Exemption from Chapter 1 of Title 9, United States Code for claims by members of the uniformed services regarding employment and reemployment rights and benefits. Section 4322 of Title 38 is amended to exclude Chapter 1 of Title 9 for claims under this subchapter. SEC. 4. Effective date for the amendments made by this Act applies to actions commenced after the enactment date."
