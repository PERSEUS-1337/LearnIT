The \"Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 1999\" prohibits individuals involved in Nazi persecution from receiving Federal public benefits. It defines \"Federal public benefit\" and \"participant in Nazi persecution\" for the purpose of this Act. The \"Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 1999\" prohibits individuals involved in Nazi persecution from receiving Federal public benefits, including those who would be deportable under certain sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act or citizens who obtained citizenship illegally or through willful misrepresentation and participated in Nazi persecution. SEC. 3. DETERMINATIONS. If the Attorney General suspects an individual receiving a Federal public benefit may have been involved in Nazi persecution, a hearing may be held before an immigration judge. Respondents, including U.S. citizens, permanent resident aliens, and individuals present in the United States, have the right to appear at the hearing. Respondents, including U.S. citizens, permanent resident aliens, and individuals present in the United States, may appear at a hearing under this section. Non-citizens not present in the U.S. may appear by video conference. Respondents have the right to be represented by counsel, present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and obtain subpoenas at no cost to the government. This Act does not allow the return of individuals inadmissible under section 212(a)(3)(E) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The immigration judge conducts hearings, makes findings of fact and conclusions of law within 60 days, and determines if the respondent participated in Nazi persecution. The rules of evidence apply, and an order is issued based on the judge's findings. The immigration judge issues an order declaring the respondent ineligible for Federal public benefits if they have been found to be a participant in Nazi persecution. The immigration judge will dismiss the proceeding if there is insufficient evidence that the respondent has been involved in Nazi persecution. An order issued under this finding is effective immediately, and there is a limitation of liability for providing such a benefit. The Attorney General may review findings or orders under subsection (c) within 30 days. Otherwise, the order is final. The Attorney General serves final orders with findings and conclusions to the respondent. Parties can seek judicial review within 30 days. Issue and claim preclusion rules apply in administrative or judicial proceedings under this Act. The jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit over appeals under this Act is expanded to include appeals from final orders issued under the Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 1999."
