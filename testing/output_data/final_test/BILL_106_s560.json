    "content": "The \"Gun Industry Accountability Act\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to the gun industry. Congress finds that local communities are taking legal action against the gun industry for changes in business practices to address public health and safety concerns related to firearm violence. The industry's failure to include safety devices with their products has contributed to the burden of firearm-related violence on society. The gun industry's lack of safety devices with their products has led to them being deemed unreasonably dangerous. Additionally, the industry has been accused of oversupplying legal markets with firearms, knowing that the excess will end up in illegal markets. The economic costs of treating firearm injuries are largely covered by taxpayer dollars, with over $24 billion spent on hospital and medical expenses in 1990. The gun industry's lack of safety devices and oversupplying legal markets with firearms has led to over $24 billion spent on hospital and medical expenses in 1990 for long-term disability and premature death. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"Federal damages\" refer to damages incurred by the Federal Government due to firearm sale, distribution, or misuse, including medical expenses, care costs, law enforcement expenses, and lost wages. \"Firearm\" is defined as per section 921 of title 18, US Code. \"Gun violence\" encompasses offenses under Federal or State law involving a firearm and constituting a crime of violence. \"Manufacturer\" is defined as per section 921 of title 18, US Code. The term \"State\" refers to various political subdivisions including States, the District of Columbia, and territories. The term \"unit of local government\" includes cities, towns, counties, and other political subdivisions. States and units of local government can seek federal damages under Section 4 for recovery of damages. In civil actions against firearm manufacturers, States or local governments can recover Federal damages related to the sale, distribution, or use of firearms. If the Attorney General files a federal action for damages, States or local governments cannot seek those damages in their own actions. The government must serve a copy of the complaint on the Attorney General to recover Federal damages. If the Attorney General is served, they have 30 days to enter appearance in the action. Failure to do so means the State or local government can only recover damages if the Attorney General does not enter appearance. If the Attorney General fails to enter appearance or gives notice of not entering the action, or if they do not proceed within 6 months of entering appearance, the State or local government cannot recover Federal damages. Prevention of Dual Recovery of Federal Damages: In case of a conflict between a State and local governments over jurisdiction to recover Federal damages, only the first jurisdiction to file an action can recover those damages. The recovery of Federal damages by a State or local government does not waive the Federal Government's right to recover other damages. In an action for Federal damages, approval of the court is required for dismissal or compromise. In cases of conflict over jurisdiction to recover Federal damages, only the first jurisdiction to file can do so. Court approval is needed for the dismissal or compromise of an action for Federal damages, with notice to the Attorney General. The court must determine if the dismissal is with or without prejudice and the percentage of recovered amount representing Federal damages. The total amount of Federal damages recovered by a State or local government will be split, with 1/3 going to the Federal Government for crime prevention, mentoring programs, and firearm injury prevention research, and 2/3 retained by the State or local government. Of the 2/3 retained, 1/3 will be used for law enforcement activities, support for families of law enforcement officers affected by gun violence, and a compensation fund for victims of gun violence, while the remaining 1/3 will be allocated for education to reduce class sizes. The section specifies that 1/3 of Federal damages recovered by a State or local government must be used for education, child care, or children's health care, while the remaining 2/3 can be used at the discretion of the State or local government. The effective date of this section applies to actions filed on or after the enactment of the Act. After the enactment of the Act, if a State or local government amends a complaint to include relief for Federal damages, they must use 1/3 of the recovered damages for education, child care, or children's health care."
