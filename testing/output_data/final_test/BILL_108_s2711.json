    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004\". The Congress acknowledges the significant impact of hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, and thunderstorms on life, property, and the economy. The United States faces billions of dollars in damages annually due to windstorms, exacerbated by rapid development in high-risk areas. Implementing cost-effective design, construction methods, and mitigation programs at various levels can help reduce these losses. The Federal Government acknowledges the impact of windstorms on life, property, and the economy. There is a need for improved data collection, engineering research, and public education to reduce windstorm impacts. Federal support and interagency coordination are essential for effective windstorm impact reduction programs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDirector - Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\nProgram - National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program.\nState - States of the United States, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, etc.\nWindstorm - Storm with damaging wind component like hurricane, tornado.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL WINDSTORM IMPACT REDUCTION PROGRAM. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program is established with the objective of achieving major reductions in losses from windstorms through a coordinated federal effort. An Interagency Working Group will be established to collaborate on improving understanding of windstorms and developing cost-effective mitigation measures. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program establishes an Interagency Working Group to coordinate federal efforts in reducing losses from windstorms. The Working Group will be chaired by an agency responsible for planning, management, and budget coordination. Specific agency roles include the National Institute of Standards and Technology supporting research on building codes and standards, and the National Science Foundation supporting research on windstorm behavior. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program includes support for atmospheric sciences research to understand windstorms' impact on buildings and lifelines. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will develop risk assessment tools, mitigation techniques, data collection, public outreach, and implementation of mitigation measures. The Program consists of three primary components: improved understanding of windstorms, windstorm impact assessment, and windstorm impact reduction. The components of the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program involve activities such as data collection, risk assessment, outreach, technology transfer, and research. Research activities will be peer-reviewed and designed to complement other hazard reduction efforts. Research will focus on improving knowledge and data collection on the impact of severe wind on buildings and infrastructure. Activities will also include developing mechanisms for collecting information on performance during windstorms. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program involves inventorying information on building performance in windstorms, improving data collection from various sources, research to enhance loss estimation and risk assessment systems, and developing simulation models for windstorm impacts. Activities to reduce windstorm impacts include improving outreach mechanisms to translate research findings into cost-effective solutions. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program focuses on developing cost-effective and affordable windstorm-resistant systems, structures, and materials for construction. It also includes outreach and information dissemination related to construction techniques, loss estimation, and risk assessment to various stakeholders. The Interagency Working Group will develop and submit an implementation plan to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The plan will assess past and current windstorm mitigation efforts, describe technology transfer plans, outline strategic goals and priorities, and detail agency responsibilities for achieving these goals. The Interagency Working Group will provide a biennial report to Congress on the status of the windstorm impact reduction program, detailing progress made in the preceding two fiscal years and including recommendations for legislative action. The report will consider the recommendations of the Advisory Committee established under section 5. The National Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction is established under section 5. The Director establishes a National Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction with 11-15 non-Federal members. The Committee assesses trends in windstorm impact reduction, Program effectiveness, the need for revisions, and Program management. A biennial report is required. The National Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction must report to Congress and the Interagency Working Group every two years on their assessments. Section 14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to this Committee. SEC. 6. SAVINGS CLAUSE. This Act does not override the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. Any new design or construction method developed under this Act is not mandatory for homes certified under the 1974 Act without following the consensus development process. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- Federal Emergency Management Agency: \n  - $8,700,000 for fiscal year 2006\n  - $9,400,000 for fiscal year 2007\n  - $9,400,000 for fiscal year 2008\n- National Science Foundation: \n  - $8,700,000 for fiscal year 2006\n  - $9,400,000 for fiscal year 2007\n  - $9,400,000 for fiscal year 2008\n- National Institute of Standards and Technology: \n  - $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2006\n  - $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2007\n  - $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized $2,100,000 for fiscal year 2006, $2,200,000 for fiscal year 2007, and $2,200,000 for fiscal year 2008. SEC. 8. BIENNIAL REPORT.\n\nSection 37(a) of the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act is amended to require a report by January 30 of each odd-numbered year.\n\nSEC. 9. COORDINATION.\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce, the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and other Federal departments and agencies will collaborate to share research, technologies, and response techniques to reduce vulnerability to hazards."
