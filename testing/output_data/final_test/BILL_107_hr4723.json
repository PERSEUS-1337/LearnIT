The Congress finds that Ukraine allows its citizens the right to emigrate without heavy taxes, has been compliant with freedom of emigration requirements since 1997, and has made progress towards democracy and a free-market economy since 1991. Ukraine, as a member state of the OSCE, is committed to developing governance in line with human rights principles. Despite progress in recent elections, issues remain such as shortcomings in election laws, interference by authorities, and intimidation of opposition. Ukraine also aims to address issues concerning national and religious minorities. Ukraine, as an OSCE member, has enacted legislation to protect against incitement to violence based on discrimination. It is committed to ensuring freedom of religion and combating ethnic and religious intolerance through cooperation with US NGOs. Ukraine is also continuing the restitution of religious properties. Ukraine is working on developing a legislative framework to return confiscated properties to minority groups, facilitating their revival. It has normal trade relations with the US since 1992 and is progressing towards joining the World Trade Organization, addressing issues like intellectual property rights and tariff reductions. Ukraine has enacted protections for labor rights but gaps remain in enforcement, including restrictions on independent unions and unsafe working conditions. The country has good relations with neighboring countries and is committed to European integration for democracy and prosperity. Ukraine has cooperated with the United States in peacekeeping operations in Europe and the fight against international terrorism. Termination of application of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 to Ukraine. The President may determine that Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 should no longer apply to Ukraine and extend nondiscriminatory treatment to their products. After this extension, Title IV, except for section 406, will no longer apply to Ukraine, and section 406 will apply to Ukraine as it does to Communist countries. SEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES. The United States is committed to engaging with Ukraine by urging them to continue policies such as free emigration, safeguarding religious liberty, enforcing anti-discrimination laws, and expanding property restitution. Working with Ukraine through various government officials is also emphasized. The United States is committed to engaging with Ukraine to ensure progress in areas such as eligibility for the Generalized System of Preferences under the Trade Act of 1974, market access opportunities for US businesses, and protection of intellectual property before joining the World Trade Organization. Ukraine's eligibility for the Generalized System of Preferences under the Trade Act of 1974 is being monitored by the United States, along with human rights issues in Ukraine. Assistance is provided to NGOs and human rights groups, and efforts are made to establish annual discussions on these issues. The reports required by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 shall include an assessment of the issues described in section 3(1)."
