The outcomes may affect efforts to withdraw from Iraq, stabilize Afghanistan, and contain Iran. If Hezbollah and its allies win in Lebanon's parliamentary elections, U.S. support for the country may be questioned. The election in Lebanon is seen as a test of democratic reform and a sign of Iran's strategic influence. The elections in Lebanon, Iran, Afghanistan, and Iraq are crucial for U.S. policy in the Middle East. The outcomes could impact efforts to withdraw from Iraq, stabilize Afghanistan, and contain Iran. A victory for reformist candidate Mir Hossein Musavi in Iran may improve U.S. engagement with Iran and Middle East peace prospects. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the election process is as important as the outcomes for U.S. objectives. The upcoming elections in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Lebanon are crucial for U.S. policy in the Middle East. The outcome of these elections could impact U.S. efforts to withdraw from Iraq, stabilize Afghanistan, and shape policy towards Lebanon. Hamid Karzai's choice of Muhammad Fahim as his vice president candidate in Afghanistan improves his chances of winning, potentially continuing the status quo. In Iraq, Nuri al-Maliki's success is uncertain, and violent or delayed elections could affect U.S. troop withdrawals and reconciliation efforts. The Lebanese parliamentary elections on June 7, 2009, will determine U.S. policy direction towards Lebanon. The new electoral law in Lebanon introduces quotas based on religious confession and smaller, more competitive districts. This change aims to prevent the influence of one district on the voting patterns of the entire country. Analysts believe that the new law will increase both competition and sectarianism in the upcoming elections. The new electoral law in Lebanon introduces quotas based on religious confession and smaller, more competitive districts for the June 2009 elections. The March 14 coalition, largely Sunni, aims to maintain its slim majority in parliament, while the opposition coalition, led by Hezbollah and Amal, holds 56 seats. Political stalemate was fueled by narrow margins in parliament and sectarian tensions. The 18-month political stalemate in Lebanon from 2006 to 2008 was marked by narrow margins in parliament and sectarian tensions, leading to targeted assassinations, a general strike, and a siege of Beirut by Hezbollah. The outcome was a May 2008 agreement in Doha, Qatar, granting the opposition minority a blocking one-third plus one of cabinet seats. Political violence, including sectarian fighting and assassinations, is common in Lebanon, potentially affecting the possibility of elections. However, with both sides perceiving a close projected outcome in the pending election, stability in the weeks leading up to the election seems promising. Political identity in Lebanon tends to align along sectarian lines, particularly among Sunnis and Shias. The upcoming election in Lebanon is expected to be decided by Christian voters in key battleground districts, such as Metn near Mount Lebanon. The March 8 coalition, potentially benefiting from changing international opinions on Syria, is aiming to appeal to Christian voters and make inroads in the Christian community, which has historically struggled for political power in Lebanon. The Christian community in Lebanon has long struggled for political power. Divisions among Christians stem from the lack of a prominent leader like Saad Hariri or Hassan Nasrallah. Michel Aoun initially had strong support but lost popularity due to alliances with Hezbollah. Other Christian leaders like Samir Geagea and Amin Gemayel have not been as successful in rallying support. Michel Aoun is a prominent figure in the March 8 coalition, appealing to Christians for political influence. March 8 is seen as the party of nationalism and Lebanese independence, contrasting with March 14's perceived foreign tutelage. Increased U.S. engagement with Syria and Lebanon has influenced regional dynamics. The upcoming election in Lebanon will likely result in a slim majority for the winning camp, with only a few possible governance scenarios. If the March 14 coalition wins, the new government would resemble the existing one, with key ministries held by March 14 but governing by consensus with other parties. Members of the March 8 coalition are willing to form a unity government if March 14 wins a narrow majority. Hezbollah's election strategy aims for a national unity government if the opposition wins, emphasizing a partnership rather than a majority. March 8 may demand a blocking minority in the cabinet and seek more influence. If March 8 secures the majority of parliament seats, the formation of the next government becomes uncertain. Saad Hariri's Future Movement party refuses to participate in a government where March 8 holds the majority, potentially leading to a legitimacy and financial resource crisis. March 14 may choose not to participate in the government to undermine its legitimacy and financial resources. If they do join, they would likely demand concessions from March 8, potentially leading to a breakdown of the current political dichotomy. New alliances could form as independent parties and candidates may play a significant role in the government formation process. The current situation in Lebanon could lead to a government formation with the involvement of March 8 and March 14 parties, potentially avoiding a political stalemate. The US policy aims to support democratic institutions and government control in Lebanon, with significant financial assistance provided since 2005. However, if Syria's allies secure a parliamentary majority, US support for Lebanon could be at risk. In a statement to the Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia in 2009, Jeffrey Feltman emphasized Lebanon's right to determine its government without outside interference. The US would assess its assistance programs based on Lebanon's election results, particularly concerning Hezbollah's potential increased role in the cabinet if they win a majority. The Lebanese constitution grants the cabinet authority over government operations and policies. A strong showing for March 8 on election day could lead to a cabinet with more Hezbollah members, expanding their control. The US may be hesitant to support a military influenced by Hezbollah. Discussions are ongoing regarding Hezbollah's weapons, with reports of intelligence sharing between security forces and Hezbollah. Reports indicate that intelligence sharing between the Internal Security Forces and Hezbollah occurs in some cases. Analysts believe a March 8 victory would hinder U.S. policy in the Middle East and Arab states' efforts against Iran and Syria. Hezbollah is fielding only 10 candidates, possibly to limit its government presence if March 8 wins a majority. This strategy could increase the chances of March 14 joining a unity government, garnering international support. Some analysts believe that international support for the Lebanese government shields Hezbollah from pressure to disarm and reduces the risk of an Israeli attack. There are concerns that if March 8 wins the elections, the United States may halt aid to Lebanon, potentially undermining democratic processes. Critics argue that the U.S. supports the March 14 coalition over democracy in Lebanon. The United States supports the March 14 coalition in Lebanon, not democracy. Reducing U.S. assistance could reinforce this perception among the Lebanese. Iran is set to hold presidential elections on June 12, 2009. Candidates are determined by the Council of Guardians, with 450 registering this year. The screening process typically narrows the field to 8-10 candidates. The Council's screening process narrows the field to 8-10 male candidates for Iran's presidential elections. If no candidate gets 50% of the vote on June 12, a runoff will be held. Incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a non-cleric, opposes compromising Iran's right to enrich uranium. Conservative and reformist candidates are vying for support to challenge Ahmadinejad. The election contest for Iran's presidential elections began with Mohammad Khatemi announcing his candidacy, but he later withdrew to avoid dividing the reformist vote. Mir Hossein Musavi then entered the race, sharing similar policy outlooks with Khatemi on domestic reforms and social freedoms. Mir Hossein Musavi, a reformist candidate for Iran's presidential elections, shares Khatemi's policy outlook on domestic reforms and social freedoms. He advocates for strong state intervention in the economy and better relations with the international community. Musavi is seen as less confrontational to conservatives and benefits from being untainted by recent allegations of corruption. Ahmadinejad's presidency has led to international isolation due to his defiance on nuclear issues, resulting in U.N. sanctions. Rivals are emerging in the conservative camp, with former Revolutionary Guard Commander-in-Chief Mohsen Rezai registering to run in the June 2009 election. Musavi, a reformist candidate, benefits from Ahmadinejad's weakened position in urban areas. Students have protested against Ahmadinejad, most recently in February 2009 at Amir Kabir University. Ahmadinejad's support among lower classes and rural voters could potentially lead to his re-election, as he has implemented measures such as raising wages and providing social welfare payments. The Supreme Leader's backing has also been instrumental in Ahmadinejad's political success. Rivals Karrubi and Rezai may siphon votes based on their respective ideologies. Observers believe that a Musavi presidency would benefit U.S. interests by potentially curbing Iran's nuclear program and being more cautious on supporting Islamist movements like Hezbollah and Hamas. Iran's foreign policy is influenced by Shiite Islamist movements like Hezbollah and Hamas, as well as Iraqi Shiite militias. There are differing opinions on whether a Musavi presidency would change Iran's policies significantly. Afghanistan's upcoming elections on August 20, 2009, are facing challenges with concerns of a possible \"failed election\" due to contested decisions and deteriorating security. Disillusionment with President Hamid Karzai is growing, especially regarding official corruption. The upcoming elections in Afghanistan on August 20, 2009, are marked by controversy over the election date set by the Independent Election Commission. President Karzai's differences with political rivals, especially non-Pashtun ethnic minorities, are highlighted, with concerns over official corruption and governmental inefficiency. The election process involves provincial councils selecting representatives for the upper house of the National Assembly, with the remaining seats appointed by the President. The election date in Afghanistan was changed to allow 30 days before President Karzai's term expires on May 22, 2009, due to difficulties in voter registration, printing ballots, and security concerns. The ethnic minority-dominated \"United Front\" faction criticized Karzai for trying to monopolize Pashtun control of the government and stated they would not recognize his presidency after May 22. Karzai responded to the criticism by stating he would address their concerns. Karzai issued a decree in February 2009 directing the election date to be set in accordance with the constitution, despite calls from the United Front for him to step down on May 22. The Independent Election Commission reaffirmed the election date as August 20, 2009. Karzai argued that the Constitution does not allow for a transfer of power outside of elections or a President's death. The Afghan Supreme Court supported Karzai's decision to hold elections on August 20, 2009, despite opposition from the United Front. Voter registration was completed by March 2009, with reports of fraud and security concerns during the process. U.S./NATO military operations were conducted to secure registration centers. Women were legally allowed to register and vote but had to do so in person. The Afghan elections in January 2009 aimed to secure registration centers, with lower registration percentages in unstable areas. The elections were expected to cost $200 million, with the U.S. committing $40 million. Candidates declared their candidacies between April 24 and May 8, 2009, with a wide range of challengers, including Karzai. Observers predict victory for an ethnic Pashtun due to the two-round election system. Karzai recruited a UF supporter as his vice presidential running mate, and former Defense Minister Muhammad Fahim agreed to be his main running mate. Ethnic Hazara leader Karim Khalili is running with Karzai as the second vice. Karzai's running mate is Ethnic Hazara leader Karim Khalili. Anti-Karzai Pashtuns failed to unite around a challenger. Ashraf Ghani and Mirwais Yasini are also running. The UF is divided over Fahim's alliance with Karzai. Burhanuddin Rabbani insisted on an ethnic Tajik heading the UF ticket, with Abdullah Abdullah chosen as the top contender. The UF chose Abdullah as their candidate for the election, with running mates who are relatively unknown. Some observers believe that Karzai's opponents are trying to create the impression that the Obama Administration does not support his re-election. Other contenders include Ramazan Bashardost, running on an anti-corruption platform, and Abdul Salam Rocketi, a former Taliban commander. The upcoming election in Afghanistan features various candidates, including Abdul Salam Rocketi and Shahnawaz Tanai. The outcome is not expected to significantly change U.S. policy, as the main contenders are familiar to the United States. A victory by a non-Pashtun candidate could lead to increased dissent among Pashtuns, who traditionally believe in their right to govern Afghanistan. A non-Pashtun presidential win in Afghanistan could lead to Pashtun tribal leaders withholding cooperation with U.S. forces. A \"failed election\" marred by violence or fraud could hinder U.S. efforts to build governance. The traditional Afghan dispute resolution mechanism, the loya jirga, may be available. The loya jirga, a traditional Afghan gathering of notables, may be used to select the next president if the election cannot be held on August 20 due to security concerns. This process could potentially lack legitimacy compared to a national election, as Pashtun delegates often dominate the selection process. Additionally, some Afghans believe that a loya jirga could be influenced by outside powers. Iraq is preparing for national elections on January 30, 2010, following the provincial elections in January 2009. The results of the provincial elections, particularly for the main Shiite parties, will impact the upcoming national elections. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's political position was strengthened by the success of his list in the provincial elections. In the provincial elections, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's position was enhanced by his list's strong showing, particularly in Baghdad and Basra. The Fadhila party's attempt to form a new region in Basra did not succeed due to lack of support. ISCI was the apparent big loser in the elections. ISCI, favored for its organization and funding, lost in the provincial elections. It advocates for more provincial power, contrasting Maliki's centralization preference. ISCI's ties to Iran and push for decentralization may have contributed to its poor showing. The elections aligned with U.S. goals to engage Sunni Muslims. The provincial elections in Iraq furthered U.S. goals to involve Sunni Muslims in the political structure, with Sunni tribal leaders gaining strength at the expense of established Sunni parties. The main \"Iraq Awakening\" tribal slate won in Anbar Province, while the Accord Front's component parties competed with the Iraqi Islamic Party in several provinces. The Dialogue Council, a slate competing with the IIP in some provinces, was seen by U.S. officials as a way to steer Moqtada al-Sadr's faction away from armed conflict. Sadr decided not to run separately in the provincial elections but supported Sadrists on other lists. Despite not winning control of any councils, the Sadrists, mainly in the \"Independent Liberals Trend\" list, gained senior positions in some southern provinces through coalition partnerships. Voter disillusionment with parties fielding militias, blamed for much of Iraq's violence, may have contributed to their lack of success. Despite positive results following the fall of Saddam Hussein, concerns about reconciliation in Iraq persist. The status of Iraqi Kurds remains unresolved, with upcoming elections for the Kurdistan Regional Government raising questions about the future of Kurdish regions. Post-election efforts to form provincial administrations show that Maliki must negotiate with rival factions, including Sadr, ISCI, and the Sunni list of Saleh al-Mutlaq. The outcome of the national election in January 2010 is uncertain, with Maliki facing challenges and viewed as somewhat weaker than expected. Ayad al-Samarrai, a Sunni critic of Maliki, was elected as the new Assembly speaker on April 20, 2009. Some Sunnis are eyeing the presidency in the next government, with President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, announcing he will not continue due to health issues. Elections for the Kurdistan National Assembly are set for July 25, 2009, with a referendum on the U.S.-Iraq status of forces agreement planned by June 30, 2009. District and sub-district elections are scheduled by July 31, 2009, while other possible elections in Iraq are yet to be scheduled. Provincial elections in Iraq, including in Kurdish-controlled provinces and Kirkuk, are pending due to unresolved disputes. The UN is working on a settlement for Kirkuk and other disputed territories. Further elections, such as a referendum on Kirkuk and amendments to the constitution, may follow. The focus is on peaceful elections with broad participation from Iraqi factions. Provincial elections in Iraq, including in Kurdish-controlled provinces and Kirkuk, are pending. The focus is on peaceful elections with broad participation from Iraqi factions to ensure the planned draw-down of U.S. troops from Iraq continues smoothly."
