    "content": "The text discusses the autonomy and adaptation of machines in measuring their own errors, specifically in a regression task. A compressed sensing approach can recover the precision error of regressors without the need for ground truth, allowing for some regressors to be strongly correlated. The solutions obtained are not unique, similar to ground truth inference solutions. Ground truth inference algorithms aim to distinguish between self-errors and environmental changes in autonomous systems like self-driving cars. These algorithms measure ground truth statistics based on evaluator outputs to determine if the system is malfunctioning or if environmental conditions are causing model breakdowns. The curr_chunk discusses a non-parametric approach using compressed sensing to solve the ground truth inference problem for noisy regressors. Ground truth is defined as the correct values for the predictions of the regressors, and the approach postulates the existence of such ground truth. The main critique of parametric approaches is that they assume a family of probability distributions for errors, which has not worked well in theory or practice. The curr_chunk discusses the ground truth inference problem for regressors, focusing on estimating error moments without true values. It mentions the deliberate separation of moment terms for defining covariance between estimators and references a solution using compressed sensing for sparsely correlated regressors. The curr_chunk discusses solving the ground truth inference problem for regressors using compressed sensing for sparsely correlated regressors. It highlights the ability to detect and correct biased regressors and simplifies the problem to independent, unbiased regressors for easier understanding. The curr_chunk discusses subtracting estimates from two regressors to obtain error quantities for estimation. It simplifies the problem to independent regressors and presents a linear algebra equation for solving with three regressors. An application of this equation to a synthetic experiment is shown in a figure. The approach is similar to least squares, where the underlying topology between data points is irrelevant for experimentation. The curr_chunk discusses using synthetic noisy regressors to regress each pixel value of a photo, simulating two correct regressors and one malfunctioning regressor. The equation is solved via least squares to account for spurious non-zero cross-correlations. The results are not well-known in Statistics 101 courses due to the focus on imputing parameters of a model rather than the error of regressors with themselves. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of studying the error signal between regressors rather than imputing properties of the true signal. Moment methods are now more practical with big data, and the math fails for biased regressors. The focus is on determining the average precision error of the regressors, accounting for a global bias. The curr_chunk discusses the issue of determining bias between regressors and the impact of a global bias on accuracy and precision. The matrix rank is analyzed in the context of bias shifts among regressors, leading to a specific case with equal constant bias. The general solution to Eq. 10 involves compressed sensing to minimize the 1 norm of the recovered vector, allowing for error detection and correction in biased regressors. By assuming sparse errors, an 1-minimization approach can detect and correct bias in a single regressor, with the option to use more regressors for increased accuracy. The contribution of the study is to apply engineering logic, similar to error correcting codes in signal transmission, to address estimation errors in regressors recovering signals. A compressed sensing algorithm can recover average error moments from multiple noisy regressors, leading to non-unique solutions in well-engineered systems. In well-engineered systems, algorithms like the one discussed can detect malfunctioning sensors by analyzing sparse and uncorrelated errors. This technique can be applied to machines like self-driving cars, where it adds an extra layer of protection by detecting anomalies early. It also allows for supervision arrangements with a mix of expensive precise sensors and cheaper, imprecise ones. Sensors can be used to benchmark a more precise one in various applications, such as self-driving cars. The method proposed has advantages like wide applicability and easy understanding of the math, but it lacks generalization and a theoretical model to explain errors. This approach can be readily applied to autonomous, adaptive systems. Theoretical guarantees of compressed sensing algorithms demonstrate the potential of autonomous, adaptive systems. Compressed sensing can handle correlated estimators and non-parametric methods exist for classification tasks. Polynomial algebra replaces linear algebra in regressor problems, leading to ambiguities in determining classifier accuracy without correct labels. The accuracies of classifiers can range from x to 1-x, with multiple classifiers ensuring ambiguity is removed. The preferred solution is to have one classifier below 50%, rather than all classifiers."
