    "content": "Electric utilities have been subject to air pollution emission requirements since the Clean Air Act of 1970, with controls focused on sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates. These pollutants have health effects and contribute to acid rain, visibility impairment, and smog. Regulations target particles 10 microns or smaller, with new rules aiming to control particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter. Electric utilities are major contributors to emissions of SO2, NOx, and PM10. Regulations have evolved over time to control these pollutants, with a focus on reducing particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter. Additional controls are being developed for NOx and SO2 as contributors to PM2.5. Mercury and carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities are also of concern, with some sources of mercury currently regulated but emissions from electric utilities not yet addressed. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 designated mercury (Hg) as a hazardous air pollutant subject to regulation. A study in 1997 found that electric utility steam generating units account for about one-third of the nation's mercury emissions. EPA announced its intention to regulate utility mercury emissions in 2004, with an effective date of 2007 or 2008. Fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities are major contributors to carbon dioxide emissions, accounting for about 36% of U.S. emissions. Fuel-fired electric generating facilities in the U.S. contribute to 36% of emissions. The U.S. has voluntary commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels, but currently exceeds this goal by 10%. While signed to the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to reduce emissions by 7% from 1990 levels, it has not been ratified. There is a possibility of future emissions limits on CO2 for utilities. The emissions requirements for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities impact strategic and operational decisions in the face of industry restructuring. Changes in the electricity generating sector may lead to favoring older, more polluting coal-fired facilities over newer, cleaner natural gas-fired ones. The environmental effects of restructuring in the electricity industry depend on the existing regulatory regimen. Emissions caps like SO2 under the 1990 CAA Amendments are effective regardless of industry structure. Some believe tradeable emissions credits are better suited for a restructured industry. Calls for a simplified approach to air quality control have increased with potential new control programs on pollutants like SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 intersecting with industry changes. In the mid-1990s, the EPA began investigating a simplified approach to utility emissions control through the \"Clean Air Power Initiative,\" aiming to develop an integrated regulatory strategy for pollutants emitted from electric power plants. This collaborative effort sought new approaches that cost less, rely on market mechanisms, and reduce complexity in requirements. The \"multi-pollutant\" approach has emerged as a key strategy for regulating utility emissions, targeting SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2. During the 106th Congress, ten bills were introduced to increase pollution controls on electric generating facilities, all involving emissions caps and tradeable credit programs. President Bush endorsed a four pollutant emissions cap with tradeable permits program, setting the stage for potential action in the 107th Congress. The report discusses the regulatory framework for addressing air pollution controls in the utility industry in the 107th Congress. It highlights the need for a \"four pollutants\" approach and legislative options to balance environmental and industry objectives. The diverse requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act impact utility planning and operations. The Clean Air Act established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to regulate air pollutants in the nation. EPA sets primary NAAQS to protect public health with an \"adequate margin of safety\" for pollutants like SO2, NOx, and PM. The Act requires national emission limits for major new polluting facilities. The EPA periodically reviews NAAQS for an \"adequate margin of safety.\" States are responsible for implementing the standards through State Implementation Plans (SIPs), focusing on reducing emissions to ensure compliance. New sources in non-attainment areas must use LAER technology to control emissions, with offset rules to prevent overall increases. LAER is based on the most stringent emission rate without considering cost or energy use. Existing sources in non-attainment areas must install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) determined by the state to meet NAAQS. New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) set emission limitations for major new stationary sources like fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities. NSPS for SO2, NOx, and PM10 are reviewed every eight years. Major new sources are subject to NSPS regardless of location or ambient air conditions. Existing sources in attainment areas have fewer controls. The 1977 Clean Air Act broadened air quality control with the addition of Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions. PSD focuses on ambient concentrations of pollutants in clean air areas, allowing some increase in pollution depending on classification. States can reclassify areas to allow for more degradation. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review. The Clean Air Act's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions allow for controlled degradation of air quality up to NAAQS standards. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review and install Best Available Control Technology (BACT). State permitting agencies determine BACT on a case-by-case basis, ensuring it is at least as stringent as federal NSPS. The regional haze program complements PSD by addressing visibility impairment from pollutants like sulfates, organic matter, and nitrates. Existing sources must also comply with BACT requirements. The EPA's regional haze program requires existing sources to install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to control pollutants like sulfates, organic matter, and nitrates. This program, implemented in 1999, aims for more stringent controls on NOx and SO2 emissions. However, environmental and economic factors have revealed flaws in the regime over the past thirty years, with ecological effects occurring at pollutant levels below those deemed safe for human health. This has led to older facilities extending their lifespan to avoid costly upgrades. Title IV of the 1990 CAAA established a cap and trade scheme to limit SO2 emissions more stringently than NAAQS levels, focusing on total emissions rather than ambient concentrations. This approach is suitable for addressing regional, national, or global pollutant loadings that reach critical levels, increasing economic efficiency through emission rights trading. The Title IV of the 1990 CAAA established a cap and trade scheme to limit SO2 emissions, increasing economic efficiency through emission rights trading. The NOx program set performance standards based on low-NOx burner technology for affected facilities. Concerns about existing controls are rising due to difficulties in meeting ozone NAAQS and health effects of pollutants. New initiatives are being driven by concerns about meeting ozone NAAQS, health effects of pollutants, impaired visibility, and global warming. More air quality controls on utilities are pending, raising questions about effectiveness and economic efficiency. Achieving NAAQS for certain pollutants like ozone requires new control regimes, such as EPA's NOx SIP Call encouraging states to implement cap and trade programs. The ozone control regime is seasonal, based on EPA regulation, and may not address all environmental concerns. Uncertainty surrounds potential NOx cap and trade provisions implemented by states. Concern is growing about health and environmental impacts of mercury and greenhouse gases under the 1990 CAAA. The EPA is required to set standards for reducing mercury emissions under Section 112, taking into account cost and other factors. New sources must meet Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) requirements, while existing sources must meet emission limitations achieved by the best performing 12%. Regulations for utility emissions of mercury are expected, but the form is uncertain. Control programs for carbon dioxide emissions are less clear at the federal level. The federal policy on emission controls, particularly for CO2, is unclear. However, there is a growing concern about global climate change. Utilities would be significantly impacted if such a policy is implemented. Various regulations and provisions highlight the need for monitoring greenhouse gases and reporting voluntary reductions. Fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities are major sources of emissions and are closely watching the developments in air pollution controls. Fuel-fired electric generating facilities are closely monitoring federal emission control policies, especially for CO2, due to concerns about global climate change. The 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments created an economic bias favoring existing sources over new ones, leading to more stringent controls for new sources. Market mechanisms added in the 1990 Amendments did not change this bias, with existing sources receiving more lenient reduction requirements compared to new sources. The current NSPS creates a disadvantage for new sources in the emerging competitive electric supply market, as existing suppliers have less stringent control requirements and free emission credits. Economic bias is also seen on a regional basis, such as in the Ozone Transport Region where individual states struggle to meet ozone NAAQS due to interstate air movement. This has led to the implementation of significant NOx controls in some states but not in neighboring ones. The implementation of regional NOx controls in some states, not required in neighboring states, has led to a complex mix of control requirements and market mechanisms, complicating corporate planning for capacity renovation and new construction. Uncertainty is increasing due to the possibility of new pollutants being regulated, like carbon dioxide and mercury, and conflicting control regimes for existing pollutants. Compliance strategies are affected by the seasonal nature of controls based on ozone concerns, while potential year-round NOx controls may be required for fine particulate NAAQS implementation. NAAQS implementation strategies may require year-round NOx controls, leading to potential costly adjustments for utilities. Market forces from electricity restructuring are driving companies to seek flexibility and a level playing field in complying with environmental standards. Producers of clean electricity want competitors to meet equivalent standards, while all producers desire more certainty in future standards. Interest in finding simpler, cost-effective mechanisms to achieve new health and environmental goals is rising, with a proposed \"multi-pollutant\" approach modeled after the successful acid rain program. This approach would establish emissions caps through trading, potentially replacing or overlaying current regulatory regimes. The key assumption is that addressing pollution problems sequentially can be replaced with a coordinated approach. A coordinated national program could replace sequential pollutant-by-pollutant approaches, offering regulatory and economic certainty in the short to mid-term. This could lead to earlier emission reductions compared to the current regulatory process, similar to the success of the acid rain program. Challenges and delays may be reduced under a cap and trade system, although reduction targets could be frozen for a specific period. Implementing emission caps through a cap and trade system could reduce costs for industry and provide regulatory certainty. Reducing emissions caps in the future may be easier than developing new regulatory schemes. This approach could save costs directly and reduce uncertainties for utilities, allowing for better future planning. Implementing emission caps through a cap and trade system could reduce costs for industry and provide regulatory certainty. However, there is a concern that unnecessary emission reductions could be required, leading to unnecessary costs and earlier incurred expenses. Mechanisms to ensure local air quality standards are met may still be necessary in a cap and trade system. The four pollutant approach calls for a coordinated cap and trade system to supplement or replace existing structures. Each pollutant has unique issues with baselines, allocation schemes, reduction targets, and compliance measures. Sulfur dioxide emissions from utilities are currently controlled with a cap-and-trade system targeting acid rain concerns. Congress enacted title IV acid rain provisions without removing existing provisions for utility SO2 emissions, creating another patch in the current regulatory framework. The SO2 program under title IV is a successful example of emission caps and trades. It costs about $1 billion annually, below initial estimates, and has exceeded environmental targets by 23-40%. Compliance has been 100% with no delays in implementation. The current SO2 program is a successful model for controlling utility air emissions. It has a credible inventory, continuous monitoring system, and well-established trading mechanics. To tighten control, allowance values could be reduced. However, this may reveal issues such as economic bias and transparency in allowance values. The allocation system for the 1990 CAAA title IV program was a hard-fought compromise, but schemes to protect new competitors have proven unnecessary as allowance prices have remained low. Higher valued allowances could change this dynamic, potentially leading to a more expensive process for new sources to obtain necessary allowances. Revising the allowance allocation scheme could spark a debate among different interest groups, involving baseline and distribution issues. The current system allocates free allowances to existing facilities based on a 1985-87 database and legislated emissions rate. Alternatives include new source pool of free allowances or wholesale auctions. Decisions on SO2 allowances could impact NOx, Hg, or CO2 allocation schemes. NOx emissions raise health and environmental concerns, controlled under different parts of the CAA due to their multiple effects. Nitrogen oxides are precursors of fine particulates, with significant human health impacts. The environmental concerns surrounding NOx emissions include its impact on human health, acid precipitation, visibility impairment, and effects on plant life. Up to 40% of nitrogen loading in the Chesapeake Bay is attributed to air-borne nitrogen oxides. The need for a more stable regulatory regime for NOx is highlighted, but changing the existing structure could disrupt agreed-upon outcomes and stakeholders. Continuous monitoring of NOx emissions is mandated under title IV of the 1990 CAAA. A monitoring network measures NOx emissions at the stack, with experience in trading NOx credits in the Northeast. However, the regional nature of current NOx markets may pose challenges for a national cap and trade program. Implementation of EPA's Ozone Transport Rule may not improve this situation due to the lack of authority to require compatible cap and trade systems at the state level. The EPA has provided guidance on a model cap and trade program for NOx emissions, but states are not required to follow it. Developing an acceptable allocation scheme for NOx allowances may be more difficult than for SO2 allowances, as NOx allowances could be more expensive. The EPA has provided guidance on a model cap and trade program for NOx emissions, but states are not required to follow it. NOx allowances in the OTC program have fluctuated between $500 and $1000 each, which may pose challenges for new competitors in the generation market. The focus on NOx as a precursor to ozone results in it being treated as a regional, not national problem, with efforts concentrated in the northeast and California. EPA's NOx SIP Call covers only the eastern 21 states and D.C. The EPA's NOx SIP Call covers the eastern 21 states and D.C., focusing on summer controls for ozone pollution. There is confusion over control strategies, especially with other pollutants requiring year-round controls. Different regions have their own NOx control programs, with the Northeast having a cap and trade system. The integration of a national four-pollutant strategy is challenging due to existing individual programs. The development of a national cap and trade program integrating diverse NOx control elements poses a significant challenge. Utility emissions of Hg are prospective and would be regulated under the hazardous air pollutants section of the CAA. Despite challenges, EPA plans to regulate Hg in the next few years, making its inclusion in a four-pollutant strategy reasonable. The lack of experience in regulating Hg is reflected in proposed four-pollutant strategies, with some deferring decisions to the EPA, requiring MACT on a unit-by-unit basis, or allowing a trading system under an emissions cap. Hg allowances under a 90% reduction cap would be expensive, necessitating careful allocation. Developing market institutions for a trading system would be crucial. CO2 is not controlled under the CAA, leading to controversy over its classification as a pollutant. The Clinton Administration did not submit the Kyoto treaty to the Senate due to low chances of ratification. The US is obligated to maintain CO2 emissions at 1990 levels under the FCCC. Current emissions are 10% above 1990 levels. US climate change policy debates focus on cost, competitiveness, and comprehensiveness. Consensus is difficult due to wide cost estimates for the Kyoto Protocol. The cost estimates for CO2 reduction under the Kyoto Protocol range from $23 to $348 per metric ton, making consensus difficult. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of emissions trading in achieving cost savings. A four-pollutant strategy could potentially address some of these concerns by not being tied to Kyoto targets. The 104th Congress chose the FCCC 1990 stabilization target for CO2 cap, not the Kyoto reduction requirement. CO2 emissions from electric generation have risen about 23% from 1990 to 2000, with an additional 19% increase anticipated between 2000 and 2010. Meeting the FCCC target would be a significant challenge, but less costly than meeting the Kyoto requirements. Building blocks for a CO2 cap and trade program are in place, including an established baseline, credible inventory for powerplant emissions, and experience with international emission credits. The Joint Implementation program pioneered by the U.S. in the mid-1990s aims to address multiple environmental issues through a multi-pollutant strategy. This approach integrates efforts to tackle problems such as aquatic loadings, health effects of fine particulates, and visibility impairment. The strategy is expected to bring environmental, economic, and regulatory benefits, with the hope that the benefits will outweigh the costs. The EPA analyzed the costs and benefits of two multipollutant initiatives introduced in the 106th Congress: S. 172 / H.R. 25 and H.R. 2569. S. 172 / H.R. 25 mandated reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions, while H.R. 2569 mandated annual emission caps on utilities for SO2 and NOx. The EPA analyzed the costs and benefits of two multipollutant initiatives introduced in the 106th Congress: S. 172 / H.R. 25 and H.R. 2569. H.R. 2569 mandated reductions in emissions, including 1.914 billion tons for CO2 and a 90% reduction in Hg from 1990 levels. The costs did not rise as expected due to the combination of NOx and SO2 reductions in each bill. EPA did not calculate separate cost-per-ton estimates for NOx and SO2. The EPA analyzed the costs and benefits of two multipollutant initiatives introduced in the 106th Congress. Separate cost-per-ton estimates for NOx and SO2 were calculated, showing a 5% increase in per ton costs for H.R. 2569 compared to S. 172. The relatively flat cost curves for SO2 emissions were attributed to the surplus SO2 allowances under the title IV program. The EPA analysis of two multipollutant initiatives in the 106th Congress showed a 5% increase in per ton costs for H.R. 2569 compared to S. 172. The surplus SO2 allowances were seen as dampening the effects of controls mandated for 2005 through 2010. However, the relatively flat NOx reduction costs raised questions about the SO2 compliance costs beyond 2010. EPA also considered Hg and CO2 controls in their analysis. The EPA analyzed the cost of reducing CO2 emissions to 1990 levels at $3.82 billion. For Hg provisions, a 90% reduction would cost about $3 billion annually in 2010. Utilities would use technology and fuel choices to meet reduction requirements. NOx control would involve installing control equipment like Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for coal-fired capacity. Half of coal-fired capacity projected to install SCR, a quarter to install SNCR. For SO2, a fifth to install FGD, some to switch to lower sulfur coal. Less than 1% to be repowered for natural gas. CO2 reduction proposals increase chance of natural gas displacing coal. EPA analysis suggests shift to lower emitting technologies and fuels, mainly natural gas. No data on fuel source effects provided. EPA's H.R. 2569 analysis lacks data on fuel source effects, but previous analyses suggest a significant reduction in carbon emissions from coal production. This would lead to a shift towards natural gas and conservation measures, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach to emission control. The EPA's analysis emphasizes the importance of controlling multiple emissions together to optimize compliance strategies and reduce costs. Having advance knowledge of reduction requirements for all pollutants can lead to different compliance strategies compared to addressing them individually. An integrated, multi-pollutant air pollution control regime may offer opportunities for utilities to lower costs. A multi-pollutant air pollution control regime can help utilities reduce costs through comprehensive approaches to generation and control technologies. EPA estimates that the benefits of certain pollution control measures greatly exceed costs, primarily from health benefits of PM 2.5 reductions. Other benefits are likely but not quantified. The benefits of PM 2.5 reductions are estimated to exceed costs, primarily from health benefits. Critics argue against these large estimates. Evaluating the costs of an integrated, multi-pollutant air quality program involves comparing them to the current pollutant-by-pollutant approach. Integrating a four-pollutant strategy with the Title V permit process is easier than with the NAAQS/SIP process. Regulatory effects of the strategy are challenging to determine, impacting air quality control programs and managers. The challenges of implementing a multi-pollutant approach include difficulties in integrating the cap and trade framework with NAAQS regulations, as well as addressing other regulatory requirements like NSPS, NSR, visibility, and PSD. There is a need for considerable discussion on the continuation of NSPS and potential modifications to NSR/PSD processes to focus on local ambient concentrations. A comprehensive cap and trade program could potentially replace NSPS and NSR for affected pollutants, allowing flexibility for new sources to emit more with offsetting reductions elsewhere. The disposition of PSD and visibility requirements could be controversial due to concerns about ambient concentrations. Tensions may arise between potential synergies and fear of eroding control capabilities with a multi-pollutant approach. Stakeholders involved in the legislative process may resist changes to existing air quality control programs. The multi-pollutant approach in air pollution control management may face resistance from stakeholders due to perceived symbolic values and tradeoffs. Past experience suggests that projected compliance costs tend to be overestimated, with technological innovations lowering costs. A cap and trade approach allows managers flexibility in seeking cost-effective emission control solutions. The current pollutant-by-pollutant decision-making process may be replaced by a more efficient multi-pollutant approach. The multi-pollutant approach in air pollution control management aims to improve efficiency by allowing individual decisions within a collective framework, like cap and trade, to reduce costs. Studies show that trading mechanisms lower costs, but the extent varies based on factors like transaction costs and the number of participants. Implementing a multi-pollutant system can have implications beyond just reducing costs for achieving emissions reductions. A multi-pollutant approach in air pollution control management allows for caps and trades for each pollutant, leading to cost savings and synergies in addressing pollutants comprehensively. Legislation would be required for this approach as the current Clean Air Act focuses on pollutants individually. The Clean Air Act does not allow for integrating regulatory decisions for pollutants, limiting EPA's authority to implement a collective emissions approach. Multi-pollutant proposals often include cap and trade programs for efficiency, but each pollutant poses unique challenges for such a system. The cap and trade program raises questions about scope, reduction requirements, time frame, and permitted techniques for pollutants. The Clean Air Act limits EPA's authority to implement a collective emissions approach, posing challenges for multi-pollutant proposals. The cap and trade program raises questions about scope, reduction requirements, time frame, and permitted techniques for pollutants. Table 7 summarizes the current status of pollutants with respect to a cap and trade program, indicating different positions for each pollutant. Establishing cap and trade programs for additional pollutants may require modifications to the existing regulatory system. The cap and trade approach raises concerns about creating localized \"hot spots\" due to unrestricted trading, potentially hindering compliance with air quality standards. Stringent emissions caps and restrictions on trades in certain areas could help ensure compliance. The Clean Air Act has evolved over time in response to changes in technology and industry. The Clean Air Act has evolved over time in response to changes in technology and industry, resulting in a patchwork of requirements that are not always consistent. Despite some considering the Act unwieldy, emissions of most air pollutants have substantially declined. The Act's success puts the burden of proof for revising the existing structure on those favoring change. Multi-pollutant proposals aim to bring more consistency and stability to the Act, focusing on pollutants emitted by utilities. The proposals aim to align pollution control processes for regulated pollutants, adopt economic mechanisms like \"cap and trade,\" stabilize requirements over time, and anticipate future control requirements for other gases. This approach could reduce complaints about costs and inefficiencies for regulators and utility managers. The new approach aims to align pollution control processes, adopt economic mechanisms like \"cap and trade,\" and stabilize requirements over time. It could speed up emissions reductions, advance controls on Hg and CO2, but may also add more requirements and regulatory overload for utility managers and regulators. The multi-pollutant approach involves tradeoffs among stakeholders, potentially removing existing protections and creating local \"hot spots\" of emissions. Achieving balance is challenging, but could offer benefits to all parties involved."
