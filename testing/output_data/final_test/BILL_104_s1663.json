    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States Peace Tax Fund Act\". It includes findings and policy. The Congress finds that some Americans have sincere conscientious objections to paying taxes that support military expenditures. The policy aims to allow conscientious objectors to pay their full tax liability without violating their beliefs, reduce administrative burden, recognize conscientious objector status for tax purposes, and allocate funds for nonmilitary purposes through congressional appropriations. The United States Peace Tax Fund is established to allow conscientious objectors to pay taxes without supporting military expenditures. The United States Peace Tax Fund is created as a special trust fund within the Treasury of the United States. It consists of amounts transferred from individuals under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code for the Fund's purposes. Transfers are done monthly to the Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers funds monthly from the general fund to the United States Peace Tax Fund based on estimates. Adjustments are made if prior estimates were inaccurate. The Secretary must report the total amount transferred to the Fund each year to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. SEC. 4. INCOME TAX PAYMENTS TO UNITED STATES PEACE TAX FUND. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow individuals to designate income tax payments for transfer to the United States Peace Tax Fund. Every eligible individual (other than a nonresident alien) with an income tax liability of $1 or more can designate their tax payment to the United States Peace Tax Fund if they are conscientiously opposed to war participation due to religious beliefs and have been exempted from military service as a conscientious objector. The taxpayer must attach a questionnaire return receipt to their tax return if they make a designation under subsection (a) to contribute to the United States Peace Tax Fund. Additional information may be required for verification purposes. The Secretary may request additional information from taxpayers who designate contributions to the United States Peace Tax Fund to verify their eligibility. If the Secretary determines a taxpayer is not eligible, they can deny the designation, and the taxpayer can challenge this decision. The Secretary's ruling can be challenged in the United States Tax Court or district court for a declaratory judgment on a taxpayer's eligibility as an eligible individual. The term 'income tax liability' refers to the tax amount reduced by credits and designated amounts. 'Income tax payment' is also defined. The term 'income tax payment' refers to taxes paid or withheld by a taxpayer for a taxable year, not exceeding their income tax liability. Designation can be made at the time of filing the tax return or at a later time specified by regulations. The designation must be made as prescribed by the Secretary, with specific requirements if made at the time of filing. The taxpayer's signature is required on the page. For joint returns, with the spouse's consent, the income tax payment can be designated. General instructions for income tax returns must include an explanation of the United States Peace Tax Fund, criteria for meeting Military Selective Service Act requirements, and the process for making the designation. (b) Clerical Amendments.--The table of parts of subchapter A of chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding a new item. Part IX--Designation of income tax payments for transfer to United States Peace Tax Fund. Designation Information. Subpart A of part III of subchapter A of chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding a new section: SEC. 6039F. UNITED STATES PEACE TAX FUND DESIGNATION INFORMATION. SEC. 6039F of the Internal Revenue Code requires taxpayers who make a designation for the United States Peace Tax Fund to submit a questionnaire return certifying their beliefs about participation in war. Upon timely filing, the Secretary will issue a receipt to the taxpayer. The amendments made by Sec. 6039F apply to taxable years after December 31, 1996, and before January 1, 1997, for which refund claims are not expired. Penalties may apply for failure to pay taxes before the enactment date. Individuals who conscientiously object to participating in war can avoid violating Federal law by paying the tax due with interest and proving to the Secretary of the Treasury that their refusal to pay was based on their objection to war. The amounts collected from these individuals are transferred to a Fund and can only be used for specific purposes outlined in the Act. Individuals who object to war can designate their estate tax payments to the United States Peace Tax Fund, established by the United States Peace Tax Fund Act. The election can be made by the executor or administrator of the estate under written authority of the decedent. Designation of estate tax and gift tax payments for transfer to United States Peace Tax Fund. Amendments apply to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1996. New section added for gift tax payments to the fund. Any eligible individual may elect to transfer the tax imposed by section 2501 to the United States Peace Tax Fund. The election must be made as prescribed by the Secretary. A new section 2506 is added for the designation of gift tax payments to the fund, effective for gifts made after December 31, 1996. The Comptroller General certifies the percentage of military appropriations each fiscal year to Congress and the President. Authorization of appropriations is made for a portion of the Fund based on previous year's transfers and determined percentage. Funds in the Fund accrue interest at prevailing long-term Government bond rates. Surplus funds not authorized for appropriation are transferred to the general fund of the Treasury each fiscal year, with restrictions on military expenditures. SEC. 8. ELIGIBLE APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nFunds appropriated under section 7(b) can be used for grants, loans, or arrangements for eligible activities like the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and Head Start. The Fund should not redirect funds from nonmilitary to military expenditures.\n\nSEC. 9. DEFINITIONS.
