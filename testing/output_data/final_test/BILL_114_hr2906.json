    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"50th Anniversary of the Texas Western College Men's Basketball Championship Commemorative Coin Act\". It includes findings related to the commemoration. The Congress acknowledges the historic significance of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball championship win, which was the first time an all-Black starting lineup won the NCAA championship. This victory led to increased recruitment of Black athletes in college teams, ending years of segregation in sports. In 1966, Texas Western College integrated all basketball teams, leading to their NCAA championship win over the University of Kentucky. Coach Don Haskins taught his team a defensive style he learned from legendary coach Henry Iba. Their journey was later depicted in the film \"Glory Road\". SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and half-dollar clad coins with specific weights, diameters, and compositions as outlined in the Act. The coins minted under this Act will be legal tender and considered numismatic items as per the specifications in title 31, United States Code. The coins minted under this Act will have designs emblematic of basketball, selected by the Secretary in consultation with relevant bodies. Each coin will bear a value designation, the year \"2017\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a single designated Mint facility during a 1-year period starting on January 1, 2017. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. The coins will be sold by the Secretary at a price including face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount. All sales of coins issued under this Act will include surcharges of $35 for the $5 coin, $10 for the $1 coin, and $5 for the half-dollar coin. The surcharges received will be promptly paid to the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame for renovations. The Hall of Fame will be audited for the amounts received. No surcharge may be included for the issuance of any coin under this Act. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue guidance to limit the number of commemorative coin programs issued in a calendar year to avoid exceeding the annual issuance limitation. SEC. 8. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES. The Secretary ensures minting coins won't cost the government and no funds are disbursed until all costs are recovered."
