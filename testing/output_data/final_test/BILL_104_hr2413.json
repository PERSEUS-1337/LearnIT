The \"Tongass Transfer and Transition Act\" finds that it is in the public interest to transfer ownership of the Tongass National Forest to the State of Alaska for management. Alaska is deemed most sensitive to the needs of the Tongass and committed to sustainable resource use. The Tongass Transfer and Transition Act states that the State of Alaska should own and manage Tongass National Forest to achieve ecological and economic balance in Southeast Alaska. Alaska is better suited to address the diverse needs of the forest without federal constraints. A smooth transition between federal and state ownership is necessary to resolve issues before the transfer. The Tongass Transfer and Transition Act emphasizes the need for the State of Alaska to own and manage Tongass National Forest for ecological and economic balance in Southeast Alaska. A smooth transition between federal and state ownership is crucial for resolving issues before the transfer. The Act defines key terms such as \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Agriculture, \"Tongass National Forest\" as depicted on a specific map, and \"Federal obligation\" as duties of the Forest Service related to the forest. It also includes all US interests in real property within the Tongass National Forest. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the transfer of real property in the Tongass National Forest to the State of Alaska, including the transfer-transition period, transfer date, and patent date. Terms in section 6(c) are defined according to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The curr_chunk focuses on the transfer of Tongass lands and property to the State of Alaska. The State of Alaska can elect to receive all Tongass National Forest lands within 10 years of this Act. The transfer will be by operation of law, subject to valid existing rights, and in accordance with the Act. The election must be in the form of a bill approved by the Alaska State Legislature and signed by the Governor, stating the State's decision to receive the lands subject to valid existing rights. Upon receipt of the specified law, the Secretary of Agriculture will prepare a patent conveying all Tongass National Forest lands to Alaska, ensuring no infringement on existing rights under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Delivery of the patent is a ministerial duty and must be done by the patent date. The United States Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction to compel actions necessary for conveying Tongass National Forest lands to Alaska. Along with land transfer, the Secretary will also transfer all property used for forest management, including vehicles painted in official state colors. All vehicles transferred must be painted in the official colors of State of Alaska vehicles before transfer. During the transition period, all vehicles must be painted in the official colors of State of Alaska vehicles before transfer. During the transfer-transition period, the United States remains obligated for Federal obligations. The State of Alaska will interview current Tongass National Forest employees for reemployment within the new State administrative system. Employees not hired by Alaska will receive preferential treatment for other government positions. Alaska will discuss and reach an agreement with Alaska Pulp Corporation during the transition period. During the transition-transfer period, the State of Alaska will negotiate with Alaska Pulp Corporation to reinstate Contract No. 12-11-010-1545 within six months of the patent date. The agreement will include the sale or assignment of the contract to a third party who will build a manufacturing facility in Southeast Alaska using pulp-grade logs.

Additionally, the Secretary shall provide gross receipts from the Tongass National Forest timber sales to Alaska as seed money for a timber roads revolving fund. SEC. 6. Transition provisions outside the transition period. Beginning on the patent date, lands transferred under this Act will be managed under State of Alaska law, except during the transition period where they will be managed under Federal law and the Tongass Land Management Plan. Land use designations from the Tongass Land Management Plan will continue for up to one year after the patent date, until the State of Alaska adopts its own system. Subsistence use after the patent date will be overseen by the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior will manage subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on transferred lands until Alaska law complies with the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Federal mining claims in the Tongass National Forest will be subject to US laws but administered by Alaska for 15 years after the patent date. Claimholders' right to patent mining claims will not be affected during this period. Federal mining claims in the Tongass National Forest can be converted into State claims under Alaska law after 15 years. The claim holder must elect to be subject to Federal mining claim patent procedures administered by the State of Alaska. Upon expiration of the 15-year period, each Federal mining claim can be converted into one or more State claims.

The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act requires the State of Alaska to convey surface and subsurface estate to native communities for development and subsistence use. Unprocessed timber cannot be exported from Alaska, and negotiations must conclude within two years after the transfer date, or be submitted to binding arbitration. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act mandates the State of Alaska to allocate 25% of timber stumpage receipts to local governments for schools, educational materials, and roads.
