    "content": "The farm bill is a multi-year law governing agricultural and food programs, periodically addressing various issues. It has evolved to include support for staple commodities, nutrition, conservation, horticulture, and bioenergy programs. Recent farm bills have faced challenges like insufficient votes, presidential vetoes, and short-term extensions. The 2002 farm bill was the most recent before some programs expired. The current farm bill, the Agricultural Act of 2014, has provisions expiring in 2018. The 115th Congress has not finalized a new farm bill yet. The House initially failed to pass H.R. 2 but later approved it. The Senate passed its bill as an amendment to H.R. 2. Conference proceedings began in September 2018 but no agreement has been reached. Expiration dates for programs vary between September 30 and December 31. The 2014 farm bill generally expires at the end of FY2018 or the 2018 crop year. The 2018 crop year for dairy ends on December 31, 2018, while the farm bill expiration on September 30 affects programs with fiscal year authorizations, including nutrition, conservation, trade, and agricultural support programs. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) can continue to operate with an appropriation even after its authorization ends on September 30. Farm commodity programs expire based on the crop year, which is the year crops are harvested and may extend into a new calendar year. If the current farm law expires without replacement legislation or an extension, the first farm commodity program to be affected would be dairy. If the current farm law expires without replacement legislation or an extension, the first farm commodity program to be affected would be dairy, whose new crop year begins on January 1, 2019. The possible consequences of expiration include minimal disruption, ceasing new activity, or reverting to permanent laws enacted decades ago for the farm commodity programs. An appropriations act or a continuing resolution can continue some farm bill programs even though an authority has expired. Programs using discretionary funding can continue to operate via appropriations action. Most farm bill programs with mandatory funding generally cease new operations when they expire. The farm commodity programs, including dairy, would be affected if the current farm law expires without replacement legislation. Payments for the 2018 crop year would continue from the 2014 farm bill, with final payments for corn and soybeans expected by October 2019. Crop insurance, with permanent authorization and mandatory funding, would not be affected by the expiration of the farm bill. The farm bill is funded through discretionary appropriations and mandatory spending, which impact its construction and expiration. Discretionary authorizations set program parameters but do not guarantee funding, while mandatory spending authorizes outlays with multiyear budget estimates. Budget enforcement is through future appropriations acts, budget resolutions, and \"PayGo\" rules. The baseline is a projection of future federal spending on mandatory programs under current law. The farm bill is funded through discretionary appropriations and mandatory spending. Discretionary programs include rural development, credit, research, conservation, and nutrition programs. Without a new farm bill or extension, some programs may not have statutory authority to receive appropriations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) states that appropriations law allows programs to continue operating with only appropriations action. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) clarifies that appropriations do not always require prior authorization from Congress. Expired authorizations can still receive funding, and programs with mandatory funding are most at risk if the farm bill expires. Some agricultural programs, including farm commodity, conservation, trade, and food aid programs, would cease without reauthorization. Mandatory-funded programs in the farm bill face disruption when authorizations expire, with differences in baseline funding affecting congressional action. For example, a budget-neutral one-year extension of the 2008 farm bill in 2013 extended major programs with baseline funding. The 2013 extension of the farm bill was budget-neutral, extending major programs with baseline funding at no additional cost. Programs without baseline were not continued in the extension to avoid increasing the deficit. The current partial expiration of the 2014 farm bill follows a pattern seen in previous farm bills. The 2008 farm bill was extended for one year, with provisions in effect on September 30, 2012, extended through FY2013. The 2014 farm bill was enacted to cover the 2014-2018 crop years and other programs through September 30, 2018. The 2002 farm bill expired and was extended multiple times before the 2008 bill was developed. The 2002 farm bill provisions were extended for about three months, with additional short-term extensions for certain programs. The 2014 farm bill's commodity programs are set to expire after the 2018 crop year. The dairy margin protection program is the first to expire on December 31, 2018, while farm commodity income support programs aim to raise farm income by reducing financial risks. The government offers payments through \"Title I\" programs to support farmers during market price drops. Farm commodity support policy has evolved since 1933, with nonexpiring provisions known as \"permanent law\" enacted in 1938 and 1949. Modern farm bills have suspended permanent law provisions, but they could be reactivated if the suspension expires. The 2014 farm bill's expiration could reactivate commodity programs authorized by permanent law, starting with dairy in 2018. While some bills have proposed repealing permanent law, recent farm bills have retained it but suspended its effects. The 1938 and 1949 permanent laws differ significantly from current policy and are unlikely to take effect due to their potential costs and inconsistency with modern farming practices and trade agreements. Congress is unlikely to let permanent law take effect, which provides mandatory support for basic crops through nonrecourse loans. Official budget estimates of reverting to permanent law have been rare, with studies in 1979 and 1985 showing potential market intervention and increased government expenditures. The White House in 2013 estimated that permanent law for dairy could cost $12 billion per year, resulting in milk prices doubling. If the suspension of permanent law expires, USDA would need to implement the permanent law statutes for dairy, with estimated outlays between $10 billion and $12.5 billion per year. USDA outlined in 2012 how it would implement permanent law, which may require writing new regulations and could take additional time. Implementation of permanent law is tied to crop years and the harvest, with market effects being gradual and taking weeks or months to fully manifest. The 2014 farm bill covers farm production through the 2018 crop year, with payments potentially extending beyond. Permanent law would affect dairy first on January 1, 2019, followed by wheat, barley, and oats. Parity prices are used to determine support prices, guaranteeing producers 50% to 90% of the parity price. Loan rates for various commodities function under permanent law. Nonrecourse loan rates for wheat, rice, cotton, corn, and other feed grains serve as farm price supports, allowing producers to forfeit crops to the government if market prices fall below the loan rate. USDA has the authority to allow farmers to repay loans for less than the principal plus interest. Productivity gains and technological advances have made parity prices outdated for modern farming practices. Wheat and cotton have additional production controls in place. Permanent law requires USDA to announce acreage allotments and marketing quotas in advance, with producer referenda on implementing marketing quotas. A two-thirds affirmative vote results in mandatory restrictions on acreage and support levels above 2018 market prices. For example, the national average \"all milk\" farm price received in July 2018 was $15.40 per hundredweight, less than half the permanent law support price of $39.08/cwt. USDA would need to purchase dairy products to raise demand. The 2014 farm bill's dairy margin protection program has not been making many payments at current prices and margins. Some commodities under the 2014 farm bill would not receive federal support under permanent law, including soybeans, peanuts, wool, mohair, sugar beets, sugar cane, dry peas, lentils, small and large chickpeas. Parity-based supports for wool, mohair, and peanuts were repealed, and parity support is not allowed for oilseeds or sugar. Other commodities could receive support under discretionary authority given to the Secretary of Agriculture. The federal crop insurance program, authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act, protects producers against crop revenue or yield losses. Producers of ineligible crops may be eligible for direct payments under USDA's Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program. Additionally, USDA administers around 20 conservation programs to assist producers and landowners with conservation practices. Conservation programs provide technical and financial assistance to address natural resource concerns on private agricultural and forested lands. These programs have different expiration dates for program and funding authority, with some having permanent program authority but expiring mandatory funding. An extension of the 2014 farm bill would allow programs with expired mandatory funding authority to continue if they have baseline beyond FY2018. For example, the Conservation Reserve Program's funding and program authority expired at the end of FY2018. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) funding and program authority expired at the end of FY2018. An extension is needed to allow the program to continue enrolling up to 24 million acres. Without reauthorization, new contracts cannot be signed after September 30, 2018. Some conservation programs lack baseline funding beyond FY2018 and would require offsets to continue. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) was extended to September 30, 2019, with funding authority through the end of FY2019. Some conservation programs have permanent authority but require discretionary appropriations, which vary based on appropriated levels. The expiration and extension of SNAP and related nutrition programs in the farm bill depend on explicit funding extensions. The impact of funding for programs in the farm bill, such as SNAP and other food assistance programs, depends on the type of funding extension provided, whether through an explicit extension or an appropriations act. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized various domestic food assistance programs with an expiration date of September 30, 2018, affecting operations based on authorizing statutes, appropriations actions, and the terms of a farm bill extension. The 2008 farm bill created various nutrition programs, including the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) with permanent funding. Programs in the farm bill fall into three categories for expiration or extension: permanently authorized, funded programs; programs needing further funding; and programs requiring extension by statute or appropriations. The majority of nutrition spending falls into the second category. After the 2008 farm bill, FFVP's operations were not affected by expiration periods and would not be impacted after September 30, 2018. Appropriations can allow programs to continue even without extended authorization. Funding for the SNAP account would enable most nutrition programs to operate under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008. Programs like continuing appropriations SNAP, TEFAP commodities, FDPIR, and nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico and American Samoa could continue with appropriations for the SNAP account. The text discusses the authorization and funding for various nutrition assistance programs, including CSFP and SNAP. It mentions the impact of expiration periods on program operations and the need for either an extension of authority and funding or appropriations to continue operations. Additionally, it highlights the resilience of these programs during past funding challenges, such as the 2014 farm bill expiration and the 2013 government shutdown. The Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program and the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive grant program require either an extension of authority and funding or specific reference in appropriations acts to continue operations. Without such provisions, program operations may be affected after September 30, 2018, and a sixth year of FINI grants for FY2019 would not be available. The expiration of the SNAP Employment & Training (E&T) Pilot Projects authority after September 30, 2018, means that USDA cannot award additional grants without specific appropriation. Agricultural trade programs with mandatory funding, such as export credit guarantees and market promotion, are also affected by fiscal year expiration. Without new mandatory program authority, the Commodity Credit Corporation would be unable to undertake new activities in these areas. Several international emergency and nonemergency food assistance programs authorized in the farm bill rely on discretionary funding and can continue to operate after the bill expires with annual appropriations. However, programs like the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust and Food for Progress, which rely on mandatory funding, cannot be reauthorized through annual appropriations and expire without a new farm bill. Permanent law provides assurance for farm bill supporters regarding commodity programs. Permanent law provides assurance for farm bill supporters regarding commodity programs. Congress is not likely to let a farm bill remain expired without taking action eventually. Legislative options exist as a farm bill approaches expiration, including retaining or repealing permanent law. If Congress cannot agree on a new farm bill, they may extend the current one with its suspension of permanent law. Repealing permanent law would allow for debate on farm supports without the threat of reverting to permanent law, but this also requires legislative action. Some find it easier to negotiate a new farm bill with compromises and reforms rather than dealing with repealing permanent law. In the 1950s and 1960s, farm bills amended the 1938 and/or 1949 acts, sometimes making amendments permanent or applying them to specific years. In the 1970s, farm bills began moving away from permanent law provisions with parity-based price supports. Recent farm bills have suspended portions of the permanent law parity-based support system for the duration of the bill. The 1977 farm bill onwards suspended parts of the permanent law regarding price support for covered commodities, cotton, sugar, and milk until December 31, 2018. The Agricultural Act of 1949 provisions are suspended for covered commodities, cotton, sugar, and milk until December 31, 2018. The joint resolution relating to corn and wheat marketing quotas under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 is not applicable to wheat crops planted for harvest in the years 2014-2018. Proposals to repeal permanent law have been rare, with one advancing during the 1996 farm bill development but ultimately dropped in favor of continued suspension. During the 1995-1996 farm bill development, a proposal to repeal permanent law was considered but ultimately dropped in favor of continued suspension. The House Agriculture Committee initially considered a bill to suspend permanent law, which was later incorporated into a broader House-passed budget reconciliation package. However, the Senate version of the reconciliation package included a provision to repeal permanent law, which was adopted in the conference agreement. The agreement passed both the House and Senate but was vetoed for reasons unrelated to the farm bill provisions. In 1996, a stand-alone farm bill was introduced and passed in the House with the provision to repeal permanent law. In 1996, a stand-alone farm bill was passed in the House with a provision to repeal permanent law. The Senate-passed version continued to suspend permanent law, and the conference agreement followed suit. Other bills proposed repealing permanent law from 1995 to 2001, including restructuring government agencies and transferring powers to the Department of Commerce. In 1996, a stand-alone farm bill was passed in the House with a provision to repeal permanent law. Several bills introduced from 1995 to 2001 aimed at repealing permanent law, but none advanced beyond committee referral. In the 112th Congress, a Senate amendment was proposed to replace the suspension of permanent law with its repeal. The 2014 farm bill suspended permanent laws from 1938 and 1949, replacing them with a new farm commodity program as the permanent law. The Senate bill continued the suspension of permanent law, as did the initial House-rejected bill."
