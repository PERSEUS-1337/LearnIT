    "content": "On October 7, 2004, a conference agreement on the FY2005 defense authorization bill (H.R. 4200) was announced. The House and Senate approved the conference report, and the President signed the bill into law (P.L. 108-375) on October 28. Key decisions included rejecting a provision to delay military base closures, authorizing purchases of Boeing KC-767 aircraft, increasing Army and Marine Corps end-strength, rejecting limits on defense goods purchases, and enhancing benefits for military retirees' survivors aged 62 and older. Earlier, on July 22, 2004, both the House and Senate approved a conference agreement on the FY2005 defense appropriations bill (H.R. 4613). The FY2005 defense appropriations bill (H.R. 4613) was approved by Congress with a budget of $416.9 billion, including $391.2 billion for regular Department of Defense programs and $28.2 billion in emergency funding. $25 billion of the emergency funding is allocated for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, $300 million of regular FY2005 defense appropriations was rescinded in the energy and water appropriations bill (H.R. 4818). Congress provides funding for national defense programs through various annual appropriations measures. The annual defense appropriations bill funds military activities of the Department of Defense, including personnel pay, weapons procurement, and research. Congressional action on the authorization and appropriations bills is closely related, with debates on major defense policy and funding issues often occurring during authorization bill discussions. The annual defense appropriations bill funds military activities of the Department of Defense, including personnel pay, weapons procurement, and research. The bill also provides funds for national foreign intelligence activities administered by various agencies, with Congress beginning action on annual defense authorization bills in May 2004. The House and Senate both began markup and floor action on their versions of the FY2005 national defense authorization bill in May. The Senate debated their bill for four weeks before passing it with a vote of 97-0 on June 23. The House also began action on the defense appropriations bill in June, with the full House debating and passing their version of the bill. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4613, with the Senate incorporating S. 2559 into the bill. A conference report was approved on July 22, and the bill was signed into law on August 5, 2004. Additionally, both chambers approved the FY2005 concurrent budget resolution. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4613, with the Senate incorporating S. 2559 into the bill. A conference report was approved on July 22, and the bill was signed into law on August 5, 2004. The conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill included a provision deeming approved amounts in the budget resolution for discretionary programs to be in effect in the Senate for subsequent action on appropriations bills. The conference on the defense authorization bill had to resolve differences between the House and the Senate on major policy issues, with a summary of how the conference agreement of October 7 addresses them. The conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill provided $25 billion in emergency funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The authorization conference authorized $25 billion, including funding for body armor, up-armored Humvees, and bolt-on armor, with additional reporting requirements. Reports include quarterly accounting for operations in the Global War on Terrorism and training for post-conflict operations. The Senate-passed bill includes an amendment stating U.S. policy not to abuse prisoners and requires the Administration to produce related documents. The House rejected similar proposals. The conference outcome includes a sense of Congress on detainee abuse, policy development to prevent abuse, and reporting to Congress. The House authorization bill increases Army and Marine Corps end-strength by 39,000 over three years, establishing new totals as statutory minimums. The bill establishes new end-strength totals as statutory minimums, with an increase of 20,000 Army and 3,000 Marine troops in FY2005. It also authorizes potential additional increases in the future. The House delays military base closures until 2007 and requires interim reports. The Senate rejected an amendment to delay domestic base closures until 2007 by a vote of 49-47. The Administration threatened a veto if the final bill includes a delay in base closures. The Senate approved an amendment to provide health insurance through the TRICARE program for non-deployed reservists and their dependents. The House approved a three-year demonstration program for providing health insurance through TRICARE for reservists without access to employer-provided health insurance. The Senate also approved a similar two-year demonstration program. The final outcome does not include providing TRICARE for all non-deployed reservists but offers one year of access to TRICARE for reservists who serve 90 consecutive days in active service and agree to sign up for an additional year or more of service in the reserves after demobilization. The House authorization includes measures to phase in increased benefits for 62-and-older surviving dependents of military retirees to 55% of retired pay by 2008. The Senate approved increasing benefits for older survivors to 45% after September 2008 and to 55% after September 2014. The conference outcome phased in the full 55% benefit level by 2008. The House authorized the acquisition of Boeing 767 tanker aircraft, but the conference outcome did not approve this mandate. The conference outcome does not approve the House mandate to enter into a contract for 767 tanker acquisition. Instead, it repeals the lease-purchase program approved last year and authorizes the procurement of 100 new aerial refueling aircraft. The authorization conference agreement repeals the funding cap for military housing privatization, offset by savings from repealing the KC-767 lease-purchase. The House authorization includes a provision requiring trade \"offsets\" for foreign-made defense items, with a waiver option for national security needs. The Senate amendment allows exemptions for allies from Buy American requirements. The conference outcome rejects the House provision and mandates the Secretary of Defense to develop a new provision. The House authorization includes provisions to limit arms sales and technology transfers to China, while the Senate bill includes measures to dispose of nuclear waste at Department of Energy facilities. The conference outcome would expand the number of Chinese firms defined as \"military companies.\" The Senate provision redefines nuclear weapons production waste as low-level waste for on-site storage. The House bill does not address this issue. The conference outcome approves the Senate provision with amendments, including a study on waste cleanup alternatives. Both the House and Senate reject amendments to eliminate funds for new nuclear weapons development. The House-passed energy and water appropriations bill eliminates funds for these programs. The consolidated appropriations bill, H.R. 4818, eliminates funds for RNEP and new nuclear weapons R&D. The FY2005 defense appropriations bill provides $25 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The main issue in Congress was the flexibility in allocating funds for the Defense Department. The conference agreement for the FY2005 defense appropriations bill provides $3.8 billion in a flexible transfer account called the Iraq Freedom Fund, with $1.8 billion allocated for classified programs. The agreement also repeals a previous rescission of $1.8 billion in defense funds from the FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Defense Department will need approval to shift funds to other uses. The FY2005 defense appropriations bill includes $26.8 billion in emergency funding for the Defense Department, with additional amounts for other agencies. It also provides funds for State Department operations in Iraq, humanitarian crisis in Darfur, wildfires in the West, security at political conventions, and Federal Judiciary defender services. Additionally, funding is allocated for Navy DD(X) and LCS ship construction. The House and Senate approved funding for Navy ship construction in the FY2005 defense appropriations bill. The House cut funds for DD(X) construction but added money for an additional destroyer, while fully funding the first Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). The Senate approved construction funds for both programs and added design funds for DD(X) to accelerate production of a second ship. The appropriations conference agreement shifted $221 million from R&D to procurement for DD(X) construction, fully funding the first LCS. The Senate trimmed F/A-22 fighter request from 24 to 22 aircraft, saving $280 million. The appropriations conference agreement supports the full 24 aircraft request. The House authorization trimmed $245 million from the Army Future Combat System program. The House Appropriations Committee cut $324 million from the Army Future Combat System program, eliminating funds for the non-line of sight launch system (NLOS-LS) but providing full funding for the non-line of sight cannon (NLOS-C). The Senate provided the full $3.2 billion requested and specifically approved funding for NLOS-LS. The appropriations conference agreement trimmed $268 million from the program but included $58.2 million for NLOS-LS. Additionally, the House appropriators shifted $91 million from the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program to the Space-Based Infrared System-High (SBIRS-High) program, while the Senate cut $100 million from the EELV due to delays. The appropriations conference agreement cuts $100 million from the EELV program and adds $91 million to SBIRS-High. The House appropriators cut $100 million from the Transformational Communications Satellite program, while the Senate cut $400 million. The Air Force will need to restructure the program due to a $300 million cut. Space-Based Radar development was essentially terminated by the House appropriators, with only $75 million allocated for basic technology development. The Senate cut $100 million from the program. The appropriations conference agreement aligns with the House decision to terminate the Space-Based Radar program. The House marked up its version of the defense authorization bill on May 12, with highlights including increased end-strength for the Army and Marine Corps, approved pay raise for uniformed personnel, increased benefits for military retirees, and adjustments to various allowances and pays for troops.

The House approved funds for various military programs, including missile defense and procurement of aircraft. They also provided funding for the construction of a new LHD(R) amphibious ship and approved funds for the procurement of several ships and auxiliary vessels. Additionally, they allocated substantial funds for force protection programs, including up-armored Humvees, add-on armor for vehicles, body armor, and the Army's Rapid Fielding Initiative. The House approved a measure, H.R. 4323, to provide rapid procurement authority to the Secretary of Defense for combatant commands. They also approved provisions related to military basing requirements, trade offsets for foreign countries, restrictions on technology transfer to China, and the definition of Chinese \"military companies.\" The House Rules Committee met to consider proposed amendments to H.R. 4200 and approved funding for various defense programs, including the Cooperative Threat Reduction program and research on new nuclear weapons. A provision was included to shift costs for TRICARE health insurance to the Treasury Department, freeing up $11-12 billion for defense programs. The House Rules Committee reported a rule on May 19 for debate on H.R. 4200. Leading Democrats opposed the rule for not allowing certain amendments, including one to transfer funds for military pay raises and missile defense improvements. Other amendments were also not made in order. Several key amendments were proposed for H.R. 4200, including adjustments to penalties for sexual abuse crimes in the military, limiting missile defense funding, requiring operational testing before deployment of missile defense systems, authorizing supplemental appropriations for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and deleting funding for a new facility to produce plutonium pits for nuclear weapons.

The main issue in congressional debate was whether to fund operations in Iraq and Afghanistan before early 2005. The Bush Administration requested an additional $25 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in May, which Congress approved. However, Congress did not agree to provide the Administration with the flexibility it wanted to allocate the money among accounts. Other key issues for Congress included budget deficits constraining defense spending and whether to increase active duty end-strength to ease pressures caused by operations in Iraq. The key issues for Congress include budget deficits constraining defense spending, the need to increase active duty end-strength in the Army, concerns about major weapons programs' cost growth, and the impact of the Defense Department's new regulations on weapons acquisition procedures. Congress is also considering providing additional military personnel benefits. The key issues for Congress include budget deficits constraining defense spending, increasing active duty end-strength in the Army, concerns about major weapons programs' cost growth, and the impact of the Defense Department's new regulations on weapons acquisition procedures. Congress is also considering providing additional military personnel benefits such as reservists and their dependents, increased military retiree survivor benefits, base closure delays, Pentagon's plans for redeploying U.S. military forces, Army's combat forces reorganization, Defense Department's civilian personnel system restructuring, and changes in environmental laws for military training. The Administration did not request funding for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in the regular FY2005 defense bills. They planned to request supplemental appropriations in early 2005. Congress is discussing various issues such as military training, new nuclear weapons investigation, acquiring Boeing KC-767 tanker aircraft, and limiting foreign military sales offsets. The White House requested $25 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in early FY2005. Congress debated whether to appropriate more funds, but ultimately passed bills providing $25 billion. The key issue was how much flexibility Congress would give the Administration in allocating additional funds. The Administration requested $25 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress debated the flexibility of allocating additional funds, with some members concerned about the lack of specificity in the request. The debate began when legislators criticized the Administration for not requesting funds to avoid a congressional debate on Iraq policy. The failure to request money was intended to avoid a congressional debate about Iraq policy during the presidential election campaign, obscure the war's long-term costs, and understate projected federal budget deficits. Army Chief of Staff General Peter Schoomaker expressed concern about bridging the gap in funding, while DOD Comptroller Dov Zakheim assured that regular FY2005 appropriations could meet Army and Marine Corps requirements into next Spring. DOD Comptroller Dov Zakheim assured that regular FY2005 appropriations could meet Army and Marine Corps requirements into next Spring by \"cash flowing\" funds for Iraq war costs. Zakheim argued that delaying fund requests was appropriate due to uncertainty about costs post-transfer of sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government. Various issues emerged, including the precedent set by initial funding for past conflicts. Funding for past conflicts, from World War II to Vietnam, was provided through supplemental appropriations. The Korean conflict was mainly financed with supplementals, while World War II and Vietnam were funded with both supplementals and regular appropriations. Vietnam serves as a comparable example, with funding requests made through supplementals and regular defense appropriations bills. In 1965 and 1966, the Johnson Administration requested $12.3 billion for FY1966 and $10.3 billion for FY1967 for Vietnam. Emergency supplementals were asked for when needed, along with regular appropriations. General Richard Myers testified about a $4 billion shortfall in FY2004 funding for Iraq before the House Armed Services Committee. The Defense Department faced a $4 billion shortfall in FY2004 funding for Iraq, with potential underexecuting acquisition programs to cover the gap. General Myers and CRS believed funds could be found to get through FY2004, while the Government Accountability Office estimated a $12 billion shortfall requiring significant changes to cover costs. The Defense Department faced a funding shortfall in FY2004 for Iraq. Congress provided $25 billion in emergency funds, with $2 billion used immediately. Senator Jack Reed raised concerns about funding for equipment for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Senator Jack Reed highlighted a Defense Department reprogramming request for $619 million for urgent Iraq needs. In a House Armed Services Committee hearing, Representative Curt Weldon mentioned equipment shortfalls identified by the Army. Congress agreed to provide $25 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2005 through annual defense bills. The appropriations would cover initial costs in FY2005 and any shortfalls in FY2004. Key issues in the appropriations conference included dividing the money among Department of Defense accounts and determining flexibility in funding allocation. The House and Senate debated on how to allocate $25 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2005. The House bill provided $2.978 billion in a flexible transfer account, while the Senate bill technically allocated all $25 billion to the Iraq Freedom Fund. The House bill set detailed limits on transferring funds from the $25 billion Iraq Freedom Fund, leaving $2.5 billion as flexible funding. The Senate bill provided $4 billion in general transfer authority for FY2005 defense appropriations, subject to strict requirements for fund reprogramming. House appropriations bill required various reports on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate appropriations bill required reports on costs, foreign support, reserve mobilizations, and contracts for operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. It also mandated advance notifications for fund transfers, logistical support to allied nations, and support for the New Iraqi Army and Afghan National Army. Quarterly reports on fund use for the Commander's Emergency Response Program were also required. The appropriations conference agreement provides most of the $25 billion in regular appropriations accounts, with detailed allocation of procurement and operating funds. $3.8 billion is allocated to the Iraq Freedom Fund, with $1.8 billion for classified programs. $1.5 billion of the $25 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan can be transferred among accounts with prompt notification to Congress. The bill increases FY2004 general transfer authority by $700 million to $2.8 billion. The conference agreement allocates $3.5 billion for general transfer authority, a significant increase from previous years. Reports on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are required, including semi-annual reports on expenditures, progress in preventing attacks, effects on military readiness, recruitment and retention, costs, foreign support, and reserve mobilizations. Congressional debate on the FY2005 budget reflects a renewed focus on deficit reduction after years of prioritizing tax cuts, Medicare coverage, and military benefits. The Administration proposed a budget plan to cut the federal budget in half by FY2009, with debates on its effectiveness. Both the House and Senate imposed tighter restrictions on discretionary spending in their FY2005 budget resolutions. PAYGO rules were reintroduced to control deficits, with past battles over deficit control measures in Congress. In the 1990s, Congress passed measures to limit deficits, leading to budget surpluses after 1998. The end of the Cold War and deficit battles affected defense spending, which declined for 14 years before increasing in FY2000. Ongoing efforts to control deficits may limit defense funding. This year, there was a serious debate in Congress about defense budget amounts for the first time in several years. Chairman Don Nickles proposed a budget resolution that reduced national defense spending by $6.9 billion below the Administration request. In the House, Budget Committee Chairman Jim Nussle suggested a $2 billion cut in defense to control long-term spending. The Senate initially recommended $415.2 billion for defense but later approved an amendment to restore the funds. The long-term budget situation may raise the issue of defense cuts again in the future. The House resolution recommended the requested level of funding for national defense, including $50 billion for overseas contingency operations. The Senate did not take up the budget resolution, leading them to start acting on FY2005 appropriations bills. The Senate began acting on FY2005 appropriations bills with funding set at $814 billion, $8 billion below the Administration's request. To bridge the gap, the Senate designated $7 billion in the defense appropriations bill as \"emergency\" funds, allowing for equal allocations to non-defense bills. The House and Senate disagreed on additional funding for non-defense bills within the $821 billion cap on discretionary funding. The solution was to include a measure in the FY2005 defense appropriations bill deeming a total of $821 billion in discretionary budget authority to apply in both chambers. The defense appropriations conference agreement provided $391.2 billion for regular Department of Defense programs, slightly below the Administration request. The CBO reestimate, Blue Dog Coalition plan, and Democratic Substitute project figures through FY2014. The House-passed budget resolution shifts $2.6 billion of homeland security funding from the national defense budget to a new \"homeland security\" budget function. The House Armed Services Committee included a measure to transfer future health insurance costs for military personnel from the Defense Department to the general Treasury. The Defense Department is required to shift contributions for military retirement to the Treasury instead of using discretionary funds, reducing DOD personnel costs by $12 billion annually starting in FY2006. The Defense Department is mandated to shift military retirement contributions to the Treasury, reducing DOD personnel costs by $12 billion annually starting in FY2006. A sense of Congress provision aims to maintain total discretionary funding for the Defense Department, effectively increasing defense spending by $12 billion a year. The Office of Management and Budget has not agreed with this proposal. The Defense Department has waived statutory caps on end-strength, keeping about 30,000 more personnel in the active duty force than before the war in Iraq. The costs of paying these additional troops, as well as temporarily mobilized reserve troops, have been covered. Representative Ike Skelton argued for increasing the size of the active duty force, particularly in the Army, to reduce strains on military personnel exacerbated by frequent military operations abroad. The Defense Department has waived statutory caps on end-strength, keeping about 30,000 more personnel in the active duty force than before the war in Iraq. Army leaders aim to maintain 30,000 additional troops for the next few years to ease overseas deployment strains and allow flexibility during Army reorganization. The Administration is likely to continue funding these additional troops with supplemental appropriations until the end of FY2006. The Defense Department opposes congressional measures to increase statutory end-strength, preferring flexibility in troop levels without a mandate. Critics and proponents have not addressed the benefits or drawbacks of increasing statutory end-strength compared to the current situation where the Department of Defense is exceeding statutory caps. Secretary Rumsfeld suggested that deployable troop numbers can be increased without raising overall end-strength by managing forces more efficiently, such as transferring jobs from uniformed personnel to civilians. Despite Pentagon studies showing potential for civilian job performance, Congress remains unconvinced that issues related to rotating forces into Iraq are being adequately addressed. Some members have proposed increasing the Army's statutory end-strength. Some Members of Congress have proposed increasing the Army's statutory end-strength by up to 40,000 troops, with some suggesting that additional troops should be assigned to units trained for stability operations overseas. The cost implications of adding troops are significant, with estimates suggesting that each additional 10,000 troops could add about $1 billion to the defense budget. Army projections indicate that adding 30,000 troops would cost $3.6 billion annually. Congressional Action: House Armed Services Committee Chairman Duncan Hunter proposed increasing statutory end-strength for the Army and Marine Corps in the FY2005 defense authorization bill. The proposal includes adding 10,000 troops to the Army and 3,000 to the Marine Corps annually for the next three years, totaling 39,000 troops. The costs for this increase are expected to be covered by additional funding for Iraq. In the Senate, a bill sponsored by multiple Senators also addresses increasing troop levels. The Senate sponsored a bill to increase Army end-strength by 30,000, with an amendment passed to increase FY2005 Army active duty end-strength by 20,000. The defense authorization conference agreement raised Army end-strength by 20,000 and Marine end-strength by 3,000 in FY2005. The conference bill authorizes additional increases in Army and Marine Corps end-strength over the next four years. A plan to deploy ground-based missile defense interceptors has been delayed due to production issues with missile boosters. The Missile Defense Agency has delayed production of a second rocket engine for the ground-based missile defense system. The system being deployed will rely on a ground-based missile tracking radar called \"Cobra Dane,\" which has limitations in tracking warheads launched from certain regions. A more capable ship-borne radar is still in development, and the interceptor warheads are also being improved. The ground-based missile defense system is still in development, with interceptor warheads being tested against complex targets. The system has not yet proven to be a reliable operational weapon. A test bed is being used to conduct progressively more demanding tests under realistic conditions. Test intercepts cannot be carried out from the deployed interceptor missiles at Fort Greeley, Alaska due to range safety issues. The Pentagon's Director of Operational Testing advocates for the deployment of a test bed to strengthen the development process. The White House decision to declare the system operational has faced little criticism. The White House decision to declare the missile defense system operational during an election campaign sparked debate in Congress. Key issues include cost justification for increased funding, prioritizing development of space-based systems versus more immediate defense systems like Patriot missiles, and program management challenges such as delays and cost overruns. The Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS)-High and Space Surveillance and Tracking System (SSTS) are missile defense programs run by the Air Force and Missile Defense Agency. Congressional committees generally supported the Administration's funding request with some minor changes. The Senate committee added funding for various missile defense programs, including THAAD and PAC-3, while the House Rules Committee did not allow any missile defense-related amendments. Representative John Spratt's proposed amendment to shift funding was not permitted. The Senate debated shifting funds from missile defense programs to military pay and benefits and force protection. A key issue was whether to require more stringent operational testing of missile defense systems. The Senate adopted an amendment by Senator John Warner for realistic testing of fieldable prototypes, rejecting an amendment by Senator Jack Reed. A later amendment by Senator Carl Levin to reduce missile defense funds by $515 million was rejected. The House Appropriations Committee cut $457.9 million from the request for missile defense programs, with remaining total $632.4 million above FY2004 funding. Cuts included $205 million in program elements for a \"Ballistic Missile Defense National Team\" effort to integrate missile defense program elements. The committee found the Missile Defense Agency's budget justification material lacking in sufficient rationale for the amounts. The House Appropriations Committee cut $457.9 million from missile defense programs, citing insufficient rationale in the Agency's budget justification. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the full $10.2 billion requested, with adjustments to missile defense programs. This included adding funds for the Israeli Arrow program and Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, while cutting funds from the Ballistic Missile Defense System Interceptor program. The appropriations conference report provides $10.0 billion for missile defense, with increased funds for ground-based missile defense and reduced funds for interceptor R&D. A perennial issue in defense policy is whether future defense budgets will be large enough to finance all weapon acquisition programs. The term \"bow wave\" refers to the normal funding profile of a major program. The normal funding profile of a major program involves small funding in early stages, increasing during development, peaking at full rate procurement, and declining as production winds down. Concerns arise when multiple weapons programs are expected to grow simultaneously, leading to a potential \"bow wave\" in the future. A 1999 report by CSIS highlighted a significant shortfall in projected procurement budgets needed to maintain a modernized force, sparking controversy. Minor changes in cost growth rates between generations of weapons could result in large variations in total costs. Since 1999, the Congressional Budget Office has conducted studies on the procurement rate needed to maintain a modernized force and the cost of the Pentagon's weapons plans. Cost growth in major weapons programs has been a long-standing issue, with concerns about potential \"bow wave\" in the future if program costs exceed projections. Cost growth in major weapons programs has been a persistent issue, with recent examples including the Air Force F/A-22 fighter and the Air Force/Navy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Development costs have increased significantly, unit procurement costs have risen, and planned procurement numbers have decreased, leading to concerns about budget constraints and program viability. Between September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2003, DOD estimates of JSF costs increased by $45 billion, EELV program costs grew by $11.6 billion, missile defense R&D program costs increased by $3.2 billion, and Marine Corps V-22 aircraft acquisition costs rose to $104.9 million per aircraft. Additionally, Congress appropriated $1.3 billion for cost growth in Navy ships under construction. The Administration requested $484 million for shipbuilding cost growth in FY2005 for Navy ships under construction. The Navy estimates $39 billion for 24 DD(X) destroyers and $14 billion for 56 LCS, but CBO estimates $53 billion for DD(X) destroyers. The SBIRS-High program cost has more than doubled since 1995 to over $8 billion. The cost of the SBIRS-High program has doubled since 1995 to over $8 billion, with additional cost increases and delays reported. The Missile Defense Agency-run SBIRS-Low program and Air Force-run Airborne Laser program have also experienced delays and cost growth. The Army Future Combat System (FCS) program is still in early development stages, with production initially planned for 2008 now facing delays. The Army Future Combat System (FCS) program, planned to start in 2008, faced delays due to immature technologies. A major restructuring will delay components for two years and increase costs by $25 to $30 billion. This raises concerns about the affordability of current weapons modernization plans. Congress must decide whether to increase defense spending or terminate other programs to address the issue. The Senate Armed Services Committee reduced F/A-22 procurement from 24 to 22 aircraft, saving $280 million. Critics argued that production capabilities would ramp back up by 2007, making the decision moot as the appropriations conference agreement provides funds for 24 aircraft. The House Armed Services Committee trimmed funds for Navy programs DD(X) destroyer and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) due to concerns about technology maturity and system design stability. They cut $221 million from DD(X) and $107 million from LCS, arguing that production is not yet justified. The Senate Armed Services Committee provided funding for both programs and added $99 million for DD(X) design acceleration. Opponents fear delays in ship construction and advocate for avoiding obsolete technology deployment. The House Appropriations Committee cut $221 million from DD(X) and added $125 million for an additional DG-51 destroyer. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $221 million for DD(X) construction and added $99 million for second ship design. Both House and Senate supported LCS construction. Key differences were in the approach to DD(X) production. The House and Senate appropriations committees supported LCS construction, with the House wanting to add $107 million and the Senate adding $99 million. The appropriations conference agreement did not support cuts imposed by the House Armed Services Committee. $221 million was allocated for DD(X) construction in procurement, and $214 million was provided for the first LCS construction as the House proposed. The House Armed Services Committee also trimmed $245 million from the Army's Future Combat System development request. The House Appropriations Committee cut $324 million and eliminated funds for non-line of sight launch system (NLOS-LS) development. The Army is proposing a two-year delay in the program, with $268 million trimmed from the program but $58.2 million included for NLOS-LS. The agreement requires the Army to field a version of the non-line-of-sight cannon by 2010. Other major weapons issues in the negotiations concerned space systems, with $91 million shifted from the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle. The House appropriators shifted $91 million from the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program to the Space-Based Infrared System-High program as requested by the Air Force. Senate appropriators cut $100 million from the EELV due to delays but did not add anything to SBIRS-High. The appropriations conference agreement cut $100 million from the EELV and added $91 million to SBIRS-High. Additionally, the House appropriators cut $100 million from the Transformational Communications Satellite program, while the Senate appropriators cut $400 million. The appropriations conference report cut $300 million and essentially terminated the Space-Based Radar development program. The appropriations conference report follows the House in terminating the program. The Defense Department has adopted a new process for acquiring weapons called evolutionary acquisition with spiral development. The goal is to accelerate technology deployment to troops by progressively improving it as new technology matures. These goals have widespread support in Congress, but there are concerns about weakening managerial controls and oversight. Some programs, like the Littoral Combat Ship, lack systematic analysis of alternatives. In recent years, Congress has increased personnel benefits for uniformed personnel, including \"TRICARE for Life\" for Medicare-eligible military retirees, repeal of a 1986 law reducing retirement benefits for new enlistees, and increased pay and allowances. The issue of concurrent receipt of benefits has been a major concern. In recent years, Congress has addressed personnel benefits for uniformed personnel, including TRICARE for Life for Medicare-eligible military retirees and increased pay. The issue of concurrent receipt of military retired pay and veterans disability payments has been a significant concern, with Congress approving limited plans to allow retirees with combat-related disabilities to receive both benefits without an offset. Additionally, there have been discussions about providing medical insurance to non-deployed reservists. Several Members of Congress proposed extending provisions in the FY2004 Iraq supplemental appropriations bill to allow reservists without employer-provided health insurance to sign up for TRICARE by paying a share of the cost. Senators Daschle and Graham also proposed a bill to permit all reservists to sign up for TRICARE. Another issue discussed was increasing benefits under the military Survivor Benefit Plan, with proposals to revise rules that reduce benefits for surviving dependents of military retirees once they reach age 62. Veterans groups have argued against this reduction. Veterans groups have long argued that the reduction in Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments is outdated, unclear, and unfair to survivors. Congressional action has been taken to increase SBP payments to over-62 dependents of deceased military retirees from 35% to 55% by March 2008. The Senate adopted an amendment to phase in increased benefits over 10 years through 2014, providing 45% of retired pay after September 2008 and 55% after September 2014. The Survivor Benefit Plan payments were increased to 45% of retired pay after September 2008 and 55% after September 2014. Congressional action focused on how to pay for the increase, with a provision for deficit-neutral funding. The challenge was finding offsets for the increase in payments within limited mandatory programs under the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committees. The Democratic alternative budget proposed increasing survivor benefits as part of a larger reconciliation bill, but it was rejected. The Senate adopted a floor amendment to establish a reserve fund to raise funds for eliminating the SBP over-62 Social Security reduction. Senator Landrieu's amendment suggested offsetting costs by eliminating tax benefits. Landrieu's amendment proposed offsetting costs by eliminating tax benefits for individuals and corporations avoiding US taxation. The House provision in the budget resolution allows for an increase in SBP payments only if offset by other spending cuts. The House Armed Services Committee found a way around this potential impasse through committee action on Boeing KC-767 tanker aircraft acquisition. Last year's defense authorization included a provision for the Air Force to lease and buy aircraft. The House Armed Services Committee revised the KC-767 acquisition plan, approving a multi-year procurement contract for 80 aircraft. This approach was scored as a discretionary program, resulting in $14.3 billion in savings in mandatory programs from FY2006-FY2012. The Senate, lacking similar offsets, limited the cost of the program by providing 55% of survivor benefits. The Senate limited the cost of the program by providing 55% of retired pay after FY2014. They eliminated a provision limiting premium increases for retirees, shifting the cost to beneficiaries. The issue is whether to adopt the Senate's limited benefits or offset costs of the House proposal. Both House and Senate approved measures for TRICARE for reservists. The Senate Armed Services Committees approved measures for non-deployed reservists to access health insurance through the TRICARE program. The Senate also approved a floor amendment for all non-deployed reservists to receive health insurance with the federal government covering the employer share of costs. The issue for the authorization conference was whether to approve only some kind of program. The authorization conference debated whether to approve a demonstration program for health insurance for reservists or adopt TRICARE ReserveSelect or the Daschle-Graham proposal. The appropriations conference report did not resolve these personnel benefits issues, but allocated $25 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan, including funds for TRICARE for reservists. The authorization conference agreement resolved these issues. The conference agreement resolved issues regarding Survivor Benefits Plan and TRICARE for reservists. It phased in the full 55% benefit by FY2008 and provided TRICARE benefits for activated reservists who reenlist. The costs were offset by savings in mandatory budget accounts. Additionally, Congress approved a new round of military base closures in 2005. In 2005, the Defense Department met requirements for base closures by issuing criteria and guidance. Pentagon officials suggest a 25% reduction in base size. Congress debated restrictions on future base closures. In 2005, the Defense Department met requirements for base closures by issuing criteria and guidance, suggesting a 25% reduction in base size. Congress debated restrictions on future base closures, with the House-passed defense authorization bill including provisions to delay the next round of closures from 2005 to 2007. Senator John Kerry expressed a preference to delay new base closures pending decisions on force size and overseas deployments. The committee discussed how force transformation, reserve force changes, and surge requirements would impact basing requirements. Despite agreeing to delay base closures, there were disagreements in both the House and Senate on the issue. The Administration threatened to veto the authorization bill if it included a measure delaying base closures. After the Cold War, the US reduced troops overseas but kept them at old bases. In 2003, a Global Posture Review was initiated to reconsider troop deployment. By 2004, 60,000-70,000 troops were to be withdrawn, with reductions in Germany and relocation of a naval command from England to Italy. The United States will relocate troops to Italy and build bare bones facilities in various countries to support troop deployments. Congress has shown interest in the issue, with potential implications for global capabilities, regional alliances, and foreign policy. The Army is undergoing changes to increase deployable combat brigades from 33 to 43 by 2006, aiming for greater flexibility and rapid deployment capabilities. The Army plans to increase deployable combat brigades from 33 to 43 by 2006, with a potential further increase to 48. Brigades will become the basic unit of action, equipped to operate independently. Unit manning will replace the individual replacement system. Congress is concerned about the cost, estimated at $20 billion, especially in equipping brigades for independent operations. The Army's plan to increase deployable combat brigades from 33 to 43 by 2006, potentially to 48, raises concerns about cost, end-strength requirements, and the relationship between active duty and reserve components. Unit manning will replace the individual replacement system, impacting rotational requirements for promotion and the overall Army personnel system. Congress is monitoring the implementation of changes in the Army's personnel system, including disagreements over work rules and bargaining authority. Last year, Congress considered amendments to ensure traditional civil service procedures but did not act on them. The Defense Department also requested changes in laws governing senior officer assignments, which Congress did not act on. The Pentagon has submitted legislative proposals to give the Secretary of Defense more authority over senior officers, including reassigning three- and four-star generals and admirals without Senate confirmation, allowing senior officers to serve up to age 72, and greater flexibility in reassigning officers between ranks. Congressional action includes a measure allowing the President to extend the terms of military service chiefs. The House version of the bill included measures to increase the military's mandatory retirement age for senior officers and repeal a restriction on flag officer promotions. Civilian personnel management issues were also debated, with the House rejecting an amendment to prohibit changes in civilian personnel practices. The House did approve conditions on converting work to private contractors. The House approved measures to limit outsourcing and allow civilian employees to protest privatization decisions. The Senate also approved similar measures with some differences. The authorization conference agreement includes limits on privatization and a provision for employee protests. The agreement requires a study on the impact of health insurance costs in privatization competitions. The Defense Department has proposed legislative measures to ease environmental statutes for military training. Congress agreed to amend various acts in defense authorizations. The Administration proposed revised versions to amend the Clean Air Act and other environmental laws. The Defense Department proposed changes to environmental laws for military training, including extending time for new activities in Clean Air Act plans and clarifying regulations for munitions under CERCLA and RCRA. State attorneys general and Representative John Dingell criticized the proposals. Congress did not consider the Administration's environment proposals this year. Last year, Congress approved a measure in the FY2004 defense authorization bill that repealed a provision limiting research on new low-yield nuclear weapons. In FY2004, Congress approved funding for R&D on new weapons but imposed limitations. $6 million was allocated for the Department of Energy's Advanced Concepts Initiative, with $4 million withheld until a report is submitted. Funding for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator warhead was reduced from $15 million to $7.5 million. Controversy arose over the proposed $27.6 million FY2005 funding for the RNEP, with a projected total of $484.7 million over five years. The Administration requested $27.6 million for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) with a projected total funding of $484.7 million over five years from FY2005-FY2009. Senator Dianne Feinstein criticized the plans for new nuclear weapons, including the RNEP, and also requested $9 million for the Advanced Concepts Initiative (ACI). Senator Feinstein intended to propose an amendment to the defense authorization bill to restrict the development of the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) and require specific congressional authorization for its engineering and development. The House and Senate rejected amendments to eliminate funding for RNEP and the Advanced Concepts Initiative (ACI), with the authorization conference agreement ultimately not limiting funding for RNEP or ACI. The Energy and Water Appropriations bill eliminated funds for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator and the Advanced Concepts Initiative. The Senate did not act on its version of the bill, but a conference agreement in the consolidated appropriations bill approved by Congress removed funding for these programs. Last year, Congress rejected an Air Force proposal to lease 100 Boeing 767 aircraft as refueling tankers, opting instead to lease 20 and purchase 80. The Defense Department approved a plan to lease 20 aircraft and purchase 80 more, but questions were raised about the program's status. A decision on the program was put on hold pending further analysis. The program faced scandal when a former Air Force official pleaded guilty to seeking employment with Boeing. Congress investigated the proposal, and there were concerns about reviewing proposals from other suppliers like EADS. The House Armed Services Committee-approved a provision for the Air Force to proceed with multi-year procurement of 80 KC-767 aircraft from Boeing, replacing an earlier authorization. A new contract for KC-767 acquisition had to be signed after June 1, 2004, and reviewed by an independent panel to ensure fair value. The House approved an amendment to require completion of the KC-767 contract by March 1, 2005. Senator McCain opposed the acquisition plan until mandated studies were completed. The Senate Armed Services Committee proposed a modified lease 20-buy 80 plan for the Air Force to lease 80 aircraft. Senator McCain proposed several amendments setting conditions for the defense authorization bill. The Senate adopted a McCain amendment to delay acquisition of Air Force aerial refueling aircraft until required studies are completed and certification is obtained. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees supported the KC-767 program with funding allocated for procurement, R&D, or leasing of the aircraft. The appropriations conference report includes $100 million for a tanker replacement program, repealing the lease provision and approving multiyear procurement. The Air Force may acquire KC-767 refueling aircraft or another system. Last year, the House passed provisions to strengthen buy American requirements for defense equipment, which was opposed by the Senate. The issue is expected to resurface this year. The House Armed Services Committee indirectly addressed the issue of \"Buy American\" provisions in the FY2005 defense authorization bill by including a provision regarding offsets for foreign military sales. This provision allows for agreements to offset the value of military equipment sales to foreign countries, which may include allowing foreign suppliers to provide parts or perform assembly operations. The House version of the authorization bill includes a measure that would prohibit the United States from purchasing foreign-made defense items unless the seller agrees to provide trade \"offsets\" equal to what the selling nation applies to purchases from the United States. The Senate's version allows the Defense Department to waive domestic content requirements for purchases from foreign countries with reciprocal trade agreements. The Senate passed a substitute amendment by Senator McCain allowing waivers of domestic content requirements for trade with nations that signed a \"Declaration of Principles\" agreement with the US. Senator Dodd's amendment penalizes contractors for offsets exceeding 100% of contract value. The authorization conference agreement mandates the Defense Secretary to develop a defense acquisition trade policy to address adverse impacts of offset agreements. Waivers of buy American laws were removed from the final resolution. S.Con.Res. 95 (Nickles) is a concurrent resolution setting the congressional budget for FY2005 and subsequent years. It was passed by the Senate with amendments and later approved by the House after a conference report was filed. The House Budget Committee reported on the congressional budget for FY2005 and set budgetary levels for fiscal years 2004 and 2006 through 2009. The House agreed to the budget on March 25, 2004, and inserted provisions of H.Con.Res. 393 into S.Con.Res. 95. H.R. 4200 was marked up by the House Armed Services Committee for military activities of the Department of Defense for FY2005. The House Budget Committee set budget levels for FY2005 and FY2004-2009. H.R. 4200 was marked up by the House Armed Services Committee for military activities. Senate approved H.R. 4200 with amendments from S. 2400 and it was signed into law as P.L. 108-375 on October 28, 2004. The Senate Armed Services Committee marked up H.R. 4613 for the Department of Defense appropriations for FY2005. The bill was considered and passed in the Senate with amendments and incorporated into H.R. 4200. The House Appropriations Committee reported on H.R. 4613, which was later passed in the House with amendments. The Senate then considered and adopted the provisions of S. 2559 for the bill. The Senate passed S. 2559, an appropriations bill for the Department of Defense for FY2005, which was later incorporated into H.R. 4613. The bill went through amendments, a conference, and was eventually signed into law as P.L. 108-287 on August 5, 2004. The Senate passed an appropriations bill for the Department of Defense for FY2005, which was later incorporated into H.R. 4613. The bill went through amendments, a conference, and was eventually signed into law as P.L. 108-287 on August 5, 2004. Additionally, various CRS reports were filed on topics such as Army and Air Force transformation, civil service reform, combating terrorism, and defense funding for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Homeland Security. The CRS reports cover various topics such as defense funding for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Homeland Security, defense outsourcing, military base closures, and funding for military operations and peacekeeping. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on military topics such as military base closures, military benefits for former spouses, missile defense, naval transformation, and nuclear weapon initiatives. The curr_chunk lists budget requests and appropriations related to defense programs and missile defense for fiscal years 2002 to 2009. The Department of Defense requested $423.1 billion in new budget authority for national defense in FY2005, with $402.6 billion for military activities. This excludes $22.3 million for military construction. House and Senate actions on major weapons acquisition programs were detailed in various reports. The Department of Defense requested $423.1 billion for national defense in FY2005, with $402.6 billion for military activities. The request does not include funding for ongoing military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Administration officials plan to submit a supplemental appropriations request for these operations in early 2005. The Administration's projections for funding from FY2005 to FY2009 include Department of Defense military activities and defense-related activities of other agencies. The FY2004 funding amounts are not directly comparable due to supplemental appropriations for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration's FY2005 defense request does not mark a significant change from previous plans presented to Congress, except for the termination of the Comanche helicopter program. The request reflects ongoing trends in the defense budget, including growth in operation and maintenance costs, military personnel costs, and large weapons programs such as the F-22 fighter, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, DD(X) destroyer, Littoral Combat Ship programs, Future Combat System, and missile defense. The FY2005 defense request shows ongoing trends in the defense budget, including growth in operation and maintenance costs, military personnel costs, and large weapons programs like the F-22 fighter, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, DD(X) destroyer, Littoral Combat Ship programs, Future Combat System, and missile defense. The National Defense Budget Function and Department of Defense Budget for FY2004-FY2009 are detailed in tables with budget authority in billions of dollars. The FY2005 defense budget request includes a decision to terminate the Comanche helicopter development program, saving billions of dollars from FY2005-FY2011. The Army plans to reallocate these funds to other aviation programs. The FY2005 defense budget includes a budget amendment shifting Comanche funds to other Army programs. The budget shows a $26 billion increase from FY2004, with $6.4 billion for military personnel and $13.0 billion for operation and maintenance. Operation and maintenance costs have steadily increased at a rate of over 2.5% per year above inflation since the Korean War. The Defense Department's operation and maintenance costs have been steadily increasing above inflation since the Korean War. This trend is attributed to factors such as the cost of new weapons, military training improvements, maintaining quality of life for personnel, and compensation growth for civilian personnel. Despite efforts to control costs, efficiency measures have been implemented to address the rising expenses. The Defense Department's operation and maintenance costs have been steadily increasing above inflation since the Korean War. Efficiency measures have been implemented to address the rising expenses, but they have not been enough to slow the long-term trend perceptibly. Military personnel costs have also grown over time, particularly since the inception of the all-volunteer force in 1973. Until FY2000, the rate of growth was relatively modest. Since FY2000, Congress has approved increases in military pay and benefits, driving up personnel costs dramatically. These increases include annual military pay raises, pay table reform for mid-level personnel retention, repeal of the REDUX retirement benefit reduction, and TRICARE for healthcare. In FY2001, a measure called \"TRICARE for Life\" was introduced to provide full health care benefits to over-65 military retirees. Military personnel funding has increased by 30% from FY1999 to FY2005, with high personnel costs being a significant factor in long-term military budget planning. The Bush Administration's FY2005 budget request reflects these rising costs. The Bush Administration's FY2005 budget request shows a significant increase in funding for major weapons acquisition programs, with a 36% rise in weapons procurement and a 78% increase in research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) over a five-year period. Seven selected major weapons acquisition programs account for a large portion of this growth, dominating the defense budget for the foreseeable future. Large programs will continue to dominate the defense budget for the next several years, with increasing funding for selected acquisition programs. The growing cost of major weapons programs has historically driven budgets higher, with much of the increased spending going towards procurement of weapons developed in previous decades. The early years of the George W. Bush Administration will see a significant increase in defense spending, particularly in procurement and R&D. This growth raises concerns about the long-term affordability of current weapons plans. The FY2005 defense request shows a 23% increase from the final years of the Clinton Administration, with the largest increases in procurement at 28% and R&D at 66%. This represents an average annual growth rate of 3.7% above inflation over a five-year period. The defense budget saw a 3.7% annual growth rate above inflation over a five-year period, with substantial increases in procurement and R&D. This growth is not as large as the increases during the first five years of the Reagan Administration. The defense budget grew by 48%, with an average annual increase of 8.1%. Military spending, including costs for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, remains relatively low as a percentage of GDP. Advocates of higher military spending argue that the nation can afford more due to the long-term decline in defense as a share of the economy. Total federal spending has been stable at about 20% of GDP. Total federal spending has been stable at about 20% of GDP over the past 40 years. Increasing defense spending substantially would require either an increase in total federal spending as a share of GDP or offsetting reductions elsewhere. The Administration's defense plan calls for modest increases in the defense budget averaging a bit over 2% per year above inflation."
