U.S. leadership has played a critical role in defusing political crises and tensions in the country. North Macedonia is moving closer to NATO and potentially EU membership, showing signs of stability after a political crisis from 2015 to 2017. The years 2019-2020 are crucial for the country's relations with Greece and reform momentum. North Macedonia, a small landlocked country in southeastern Europe, has a history of being part of empires and kingdoms centered on the Balkan Peninsula. After declaring independence in 1991, it has been working towards EU and NATO membership, with recent breakthroughs in relations with Greece and sustaining reform momentum. North Macedonia declared independence in 1991 as the Republic of Macedonia, facing challenges to its identity and statehood from neighboring countries. The small population identifying as Macedonian, coupled with external pressures, has made Macedonian nationalism vulnerable. This has led to reluctance in making concessions on the country's name, particularly in the long-standing dispute with Greece. Despite avoiding the conflicts of the 1990s Yugoslav Wars, North Macedonia has faced destabilization due to internal tensions. Tensions in North Macedonia between the Slavic Macedonian majority and ethnic Albanian minority reflect differing views on the country's identity and rights. Macedonian nationalists fear cultural rights for Albanians may change the country's character, while Albanians fear marginalization. Interethnic clashes have occurred due to policies seen as discriminatory towards Albanians. In 2001, Albanian insurgents waged an armed campaign against state security forces in North Macedonia over perceived discrimination. NATO deployed peacekeeping missions, and the Ohrid Framework Agreement was brokered for minority rights and power devolution. The country is a parliamentary republic with a unicameral legislature and a ceremonial president. Since independence, political competition in North Macedonia has mainly been between the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) and the center-right, nationalist VMRO-DPMNE. Both parties are considered \"ethnic Macedonian\" and have often led coalition governments with ethnic Albanian parties. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev currently leads a coalition government with a slim majority in parliament. The coalition government in North Macedonia, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, holds a slim majority in parliament. The largest opposition party is VMRO-DPMNE. Stevo Pendarovski (SDSM) was elected president in May 2019, succeeding Gjorge Ivanov (VMRO-DPMNE). The Zaev government reached an agreement with Greece in 2018 to resolve a long-standing dispute, paving the way for North Macedonia's NATO and EU membership bids. North Macedonia signed its NATO accession protocol in February 2019 and is committed to implementing reforms for EU membership. Concerns exist that delays in EU accession negotiations could jeopardize the country's reform progress and stability. North Macedonia's early reform progress and stability in the 1990s positioned it as a frontrunner for EU and NATO membership. Despite becoming a candidate for EU membership in the mid-2000s, the country faced setbacks in democracy and reforms in the late 2000s, leading to a political crisis from 2015 to 2017. Greece's veto of North Macedonia's NATO membership bid in 2008 is believed to have triggered this period of backsliding. Nikola Gruevski, who served as prime minister from 2006 to 2016, played a significant role during this time. Nikola Gruevski, Macedonia's prime minister from 2006 to 2016, responded to Greece's veto of North Macedonia's NATO membership bid in 2008 by promoting a controversial \"antiquisation\" campaign. This initiative alienated the Albanian population and worsened relations with Greece. Concerns were raised about setbacks in the rule of law, judicial independence, media freedom, corruption, and abuse of public institutions. As a result, North Macedonia's EU and NATO membership bids fell behind its neighbors. In 2015, a political crisis in Macedonia was triggered by accusations of illegal wiretapping by the government. The scandal implicated top officials in abuses of office and led to pro- and anti-government protests. The crisis was defused with the help of the United States and the EU through the 2015 Przino Agreement. In 2016, elections in North Macedonia resulted in a tie between Gruevski's VMRO-DPMNE and Zaev's SDSM. The SDSM formed a coalition with the DUI and the Alliance for Albanians after intervention from the US and EU. In May 2017, Zaev's coalition formed a government, stabilizing the political situation. The SDSM further solidified its position in local elections in October 2017. The SDSM won the majority of mayoral elections in North Macedonia, prompting Gruevski to resign as party leader. Prime Minister Zaev aims to enact reforms for EU and NATO membership, with support from the EU, NATO, and the US. North Macedonia improved bilateral relations with Bulgaria and Greece, signing a Friendship Treaty in 2018 to address historical disputes. The historic Prespa Agreement in June 2018 resolved North Macedonia's long-standing dispute with Greece over the country's name, allowing for progress towards EU and NATO membership. The Prespa Agreement in June 2018 resolved the dispute between Macedonia and Greece by changing Macedonia's name to North Macedonia. Despite facing challenges from nationalist opponents, both countries' parliaments passed the required measures in January 2019. U.S. and EU officials praised Zaev and Tsipras for their leadership in making politically controversial concessions for the long-term prosperity of both countries. In 2017, Tsipras narrowly survived a no-confidence vote in exchange for support from some VMRO-DPMNE lawmakers and Albanian parties. Tsipras became the first Greek leader to visit North Macedonia in April 2019, improving bilateral relations. However, potential challenges may arise from Greek parliamentary elections in October 2019. Public opinion polls suggest Tsipras may lose power to Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who initially opposed the Prespa Agreement but now acknowledges its binding nature. Mitsotakis has expressed concerns about Greek interests in relation to North Macedonia's EU accession progress. The government may block North Macedonia's EU accession if Greek interests are threatened, including commercial interests in the Macedonia region. U.S. and EU officials urge the Zaev government to implement reforms to address political instability, weak rule of law, corruption, and labor shortages. Key challenges include overcoming a culture of state capture and corruption. EU priorities for North Macedonia focus on judicial independence and public administration reforms. The government in North Macedonia faces challenges in implementing reforms to improve political stability, rule of law, and combat corruption. Key priorities include enhancing judicial independence, depoliticizing appointments, updating the voters' list, and strengthening anticorruption institutions. The governing coalition's slim majority in parliament may hinder reform efforts without support from the opposition VMRO-DPMNE. Stevo Pendarovski, supported by Zaev's SDSM, won the presidential election in May 2019, facing opposition from former President Gjorge Ivanov. Pendarovski's victory highlighted the ongoing political tensions in the country. In the recent presidential election in North Macedonia, the candidate backed by VMRO-DPMNE received 45% of the votes. Pendarovski's campaign focused on the country's progress towards NATO membership, while his opponent criticized the Prespa Agreement. Despite Pendarovski's victory, there are concerns about a narrowing pro-government support base. Foreign leaders praised the breakthrough with Greece, but voters are eager for more tangible economic and political reforms. North Macedonia, once one of Yugoslavia's poorest regions, faces challenges in improving political stability and combating corruption. North Macedonia, formerly one of Yugoslavia's poorest regions, saw economic decline in the 1990s. Despite fluctuating GDP growth rates in the 2000s and 2010s, the country's economy is projected to grow by 2% or more in 2019 and 2020. The European Commission praised North Macedonia's public finance transparency reforms but expressed concerns about high unemployment, infrastructure deficiencies, weak contract enforcement, and a large informal economy. Unemployment has decreased from over 30% in 2010 to just over 20% in 2018, but youth unemployment remains high. Over 20% of the population lives below the poverty line, leading to high rates of emigration. North Macedonia has high rates of emigration due to unemployment and poverty, with 20%-30% of the population emigrating between 1994 and 2013. The EU is the country's most important economic partner, with 70% of total trade in 2017 being with EU member states. Foreign direct investment has increased since the late 1990s, with the top five source countries being EU member states. North Macedonia was ranked 10th in the World Bank's 2019 Ease of Doing Business rankings. North Macedonia has the best ranking in the Balkans and East-Central Europe, and the fifth-highest in Europe. The government's 2018 Plan for Economic Growth includes incentives for foreign firms in free economic zones. NATO and EU membership are top priorities, supported by the United States and EU officials. Euro-Atlantic integration is seen as crucial for stability and reforms. EU and NATO membership goals have guided reforms under the Zaev government. North Macedonia is on track to become NATO's 30th member in late 2019 or early 2020, with Greece being the first NATO ally to ratify its accession protocol. The US Senate is responsible for ratification, and President Trump has already transmitted the protocol. If all 29 NATO members approve, North Macedonia will be formally invited to join. The final step involves North Macedonia approving its NATO membership through a referendum or parliamentary vote. North Macedonia aims to increase defense spending to meet NATO's 2% target by 2024 through annual increments. The government plans to modernize equipment and streamline armed forces. Despite being an EU candidate since 2005, progress towards membership has stalled due to a name dispute with Greece. Popular support for EU membership remains strong among Macedonians. The EU's enlargement process for North Macedonia faces challenges as some member states question the unanimous support for it. The next step would be opening accession negotiations, which involves harmonizing domestic legislation with EU laws. Despite the European Commission's recommendation in 2018, some countries like France, Denmark, and the Netherlands oppose it, citing the need for further reform progress in North Macedonia. EU leaders delayed launching negotiations for North Macedonia's accession, setting 2019 as the target date. French President Macron's recent statements suggest a possible further delay. Concerns about the EU's future and migration issues have made some European leaders and publics wary of enlargement. Another delay could harm North Macedonia's reform agenda, damage the EU's reputation, and create uncertainty about membership. The EU is willing to admit North Macedonia despite meeting all requirements. North Macedonia is eligible for EU assistance and is expected to receive \u20ac664 million in allocations. Analysts believe EU and NATO membership would help counter Russian influence in the region. Russia's influence in North Macedonia was evident through support for anti-Prespa protests and disinformation campaigns. The Kremlin's involvement led to the expulsion of Russian diplomats by Greece. Pro-Russia groups spread narratives urging a boycott of a referendum on changing the country's name. US officials and intelligence agencies attributed online disinformation to pro-Russia entities. Despite concerns raised by US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Russia continues to challenge the legitimacy of the Prespa Agreement and push the narrative that the West coerced North Macedonia into NATO. Russia's ability to exert influence in North Macedonia post-Prespa Agreement signing was aided by a long-standing campaign to increase intelligence presence, project soft power through friendship organizations and Kremlin-linked media, forge alliances with anti-establishment groups, and promote anti-Western narratives. This was done to sustain instability and widen divisions to undermine North Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic integration. Analysts believe Russia's goal was to exploit cultural and religious ties with ethnic Macedonians. US and EU officials have expressed concerns over China's increasing influence. China's growing economic influence in the Western Balkans, particularly in North Macedonia, has raised concerns among U.S. and EU officials. Through its Belt and Road Initiative, China has invested in regional infrastructure and energy projects. In 2016, China's COSCO Shipping acquired majority stakes in the Piraeus Port Authority in Greece, aiming to use it as a gateway for container shipping to Western Europe via the Balkans. China also established the \"16+1\" group in 2012 (now 17+1) to engage with EU and non-EU countries in the region. Despite not investing heavily in North Macedonia, China provided a significant loan of \u20ac580 million in 2013. China's ExIm Bank provided a \u20ac580 million loan in 2013 for two highway projects in North Macedonia, awarded to Chinese company Sinohydro. The projects have faced controversies, including allegations of unlawful influence and extortion. This highlights potential risks of Chinese investment in the region. Allegations of corruption involve siphoning millions of euros from inflated project budgets, with recordings suggesting direct payments from Sinohydro officials. Chinese financing ease and debt risks are raised, as seen in a halted highway project in 2017 due to planning errors. A contract extension with Sinohydro led to a $160 million cost increase for the Kicevo-Ohrid segment. The United States supports North Macedonia's NATO and EU membership bids, following past obstacles from Greece. The United States supports North Macedonia's NATO membership and cooperation with the EU to address political crises and security challenges, including foreign fighters and cybersecurity threats. The U.S. has provided training for law enforcement and intelligence officials, judges, and prosecutors involved in terrorism cases to counter violent extremism. The U.S. State Department classifies North Macedonia as a Tier 2 country for trafficking in persons despite improvements in combating trafficking. U.S. Cyber Command has worked with North Macedonia to enhance cyber defense capabilities. The United States has provided significant foreign assistance to North Macedonia, totaling $819 million from 1991 to FY2015. North Macedonia is eligible for assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994 as a candidate for EU and NATO membership. North Macedonia, as a candidate for EU and NATO membership, receives assistance through the Countering Russian Influence Funds under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. The United States provided foreign assistance totaling $21.6 million in FY2017 and $15.3 million in FY2018. However, the Trump Administration proposed decreasing assistance levels to $6.3 million for FY2019 and $5.7 million for FY2020. Many Members of Congress supported North Macedonia's negotiations with Greece and resolutions were sponsored to back its NATO membership bid. On February 6, 2019, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to support North Macedonia. The Committee on Foreign Affairs urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to support North Macedonia's accession, highlighting concerns over Chinese and Russian influence in the Western Balkans. North Macedonia's strong desire for EU and NATO membership underscores the importance of the transatlantic partnership. Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov emphasized the significance of this partnership, stating that \"those on the inside forget how cold it is outside.\""
