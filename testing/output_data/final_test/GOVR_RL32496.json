    "content": "U.S. leaders use military contacts as leverage in policy towards China. The CRS Report discusses policy issues and records military-to-military contacts since 1993. Congress oversees these exchanges, which began in the mid-1970s to advance U.S. security interests. Secretary of Defense Harold Brown laid the groundwork for a relationship with China's military in 1980. President Ronald Reagan changed policy in 1981 to allow arms sales to China, leading to strategic dialogue and military technological cooperation. Sales included transport helicopters and gas turbine engines. From 1985 to 1987, the U.S. agreed to various government-to-government foreign military sales programs. The United States suspended mil-to-mil contacts and arms sales to China in response to the Tiananmen Crackdown in June 1989. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY1990-FY1991 enacted sanctions on arms sales and other cooperation, with waivers allowed in the U.S. national interest. China canceled the \"Peace Pearl\" program to upgrade F-8 fighters in April 1990. President George H.W. Bush closed suspended FMS programs in December 1992. In 1993, President Bill Clinton reengaged with China at the highest level, but military relations did not reach the closeness of the 1980s. Bilateral relations were affected by various crises, including the Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1995-1996 and the EP-3 aircraft collision crisis in 2001. President George W. Bush continued engagement with China in 2001. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld reviewed mil-to-mil exchanges with China after a PLA Navy fighter collided with a U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane. The crew was detained for 11 days, leading to limited mil-to-mil contacts and demands for apology and compensation from China's top ruler. In response to the collision between a PLA Navy fighter and a U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane in 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld limited mil-to-mil exchanges with China. The damaged EP-3 was not transported out of China until July 3, 2001. Subsequent visits by Chinese officials to the U.S. occurred in 2002, with Secretary Rumsfeld resuming Defense Consultative Talks with the PLA in late 2002. In late 2002, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld resumed Defense Consultative Talks with the PLA. In 2003, General Cao Gangchuan visited as Vice Chairman of the CMC and Defense Minister. General Richard Myers visited China in January 2004. Admiral William Fallon visited in September 2005 to enhance mil-to-mil contacts and discussed cooperation in various areas. In October 2005, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld visited China, the first visit by a defense secretary since 2000. General Guo Boxiong, a CMC Vice Chairman, visited the United States in July 2006, the first such visit since 1998. China's rising power and assertiveness, refusal to discuss nuclear weapons, cyber threats, and repeated suspensions of visits showed limitations in mil-to-mil exchanges. A review of the U.S. approach emphasizing cooperative contacts was needed due to the PLA's antagonistic attitude and leveraging of military contacts to influence U.S. policies. The PLA has suspended military contacts with the U.S. citing various obstacles. Defense Secretary Gates sees China as a partner and competitor, emphasizing the importance of engagement for mutual confidence. Concerns were raised about PLA's lack of transparency, especially after testing an anti-satellite weapon. General Pace highlighted transparency as a primary concern for the bilateral relationship. Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Richard Lawless expressed concerns about potential miscalculation and misunderstanding in the U.S.-China relationship due to lack of transparency in PLA capabilities. Despite unresolved issues, Secretary Gates visited China in November 2007, leading to the establishment of a \"hotline\" between the two countries. However, the PRC denied port calls at Hong Kong for U.S. Navy minesweepers in distress despite efforts to promote military-to-military relations. The PRC denied port calls at Hong Kong for U.S. Navy ships, leading to tensions in military exchanges and cooperative engagement efforts. President Obama emphasized military contacts to reduce disputes with China during the U.S.-PRC Strategic and Economic Dialogue in 2009. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 amended policies in response to these challenges. In 2009, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 expanded the focus on security developments and mil-to-mil contacts with China. Admiral Robert Willard initiated reviews on approaches towards China and Taiwan in 2010. The U.S. announced a strategic \"rebalancing\" towards the Asia-Pacific in 2011-2012, prompting debate in China on countering perceived containment efforts. President Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta issued new Defense strategies in 2012. In 2012, President Obama and Defense Secretary Panetta issued new Defense Strategic Guidance to maintain U.S. military superiority amidst budget cuts and prioritize attention to Asia and the Mideast. The strategy emphasized a \"whole of government\" approach, including a constructive relationship with China. The PLA's Defense White Paper in April 2013 criticized some countries for strengthening Asian alliances and creating regional tensions. The Obama Administration expanded engagement with the PLA, involving exercises and equipment, raising concerns about showing U.S. military technology. Defense Secretary Panetta visited China in 2012 and invited the PLA Navy to participate in the RIMPAC exercise in 2014. Admiral Greenert called for \"interoperability\" with the PLA. Admiral Greenert emphasized \"interoperability\" with the PLA Navy, while PACAF expressed interest in bringing a C-17 to China's air show. Despite concerns, a C-17 was sent to the Zhuhai Air Show for a static display. The U.S. is reassessing its strategy and leverage in mil-to-mil contacts with China, as China's rising influence may be reducing U.S. influence in relative terms. China's rising influence may be reducing U.S. influence, leading to a reassessment of mil-to-mil contacts. The U.S. aims to shape China's rise as a peaceful power, urging a mature relationship to avoid confrontations. There are calls for substantive talks and relaxing restrictions on engagement with the PLA to address common concerns. The U.S. military's relationship with the PLA reflects the antagonistic approach of the PRC towards the United States. To address competing interests, the U.S. military could prioritize the safety of its personnel and engage with the PLA in multilateral settings. However, unresolved disputes between the U.S. and PRC may hinder effective cooperation in international contexts. The PLA Navy has cooperated with the U.S. Navy to fight piracy in the Gulf of Aden since 2008. There could be expanded engagement between NATO and the PLA in Europe, and the U.S. military could engage with ASEAN and ARF to address China's neighbors' concerns. China's participation in defense dialogues like the Shangri-la Dialogue raised questions about its willingness to engage with others on military matters. In June 2010, the United States expressed concerns about the South China Sea, emphasizing challenges to freedom of navigation and intimidation of companies. The U.S. Secretary of Defense criticized the PLA for not advancing the mil-to-mil relationship as agreed upon by President Obama and Hu Jintao in 2009. Arms sales to Taiwan were defended due to China's military buildup focused on Taiwan. The goal was to establish reliable military contacts to enhance regional security and promote a positive U.S.-PRC relationship. Gates emphasized a positive, cooperative relationship with China, but the PLA declined to host him. General Ma made positive remarks about US-PRC military relationship, but Gates was cautious about engagement for the sake of it. Gates attended the first ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus in Hanoi, where the PLA sent a CMC Member. The PLA sent Defense Minister General Liang Guanglie to the Shangri-la Dialogue in 2011, where he met with Defense Secretary Gates. However, the PLA did not send the Defense Minister in the following years. In 2014, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel hosted a meeting with ASEAN defense ministers in Hawaii, aiming to integrate mil-to-mil relations into the bilateral relationship to shape China's rise as a peaceful power. Before Gates' visit in January 2011, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Schiffer emphasized the importance of mil-to-mil engagement in bilateral relations. Any disruptions in military contacts could have negative impacts on overall security, economic, and political relationships between the US and China. President Obama also highlighted the potential for increased military ties to reduce disputes and promote cooperation during the S&ED in Washington in July 2009. The PLA's objections to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have caused disputes, leading to disruptions in military exchanges. The U.S. is considering options under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide arms for Taiwan's self-defense. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell proposed including a PLA officer in the Strategic and Economic Dialogue in 2011. Some have suggested breaking the cycles of pending arms sales to Taiwan to avoid raising Beijing's expectations of changes in U.S. policy. Skepticism about military exchanges with China has grown due to past crises, but some in Congress aim to increase collaboration with the PLA. President George W. Bush pursued a closer relationship with the PRC in 2002, leading to the gradual resumption of mil-to-mil relations. Policy issues for Congress included compliance with legislation and effective use of leverage in contacts with the PLA to advance U.S. security interests. President Barack Obama and Hu Jintao agreed to improve mil-to-mil relations and establish the S&ED, combining the Strategic Economic Dialogue with the Senior Dialogue. The Obama Administration elevated the Secretary of State to co-chair the Strategic and Economic Dialogue with China, emphasizing military contacts to reduce disputes. There was an expansion of engagement with the PLA, including increased combined exercises. Congress exercised oversight over military exchanges with China, with concerns raised about the trajectory of mil-to-mil contacts. Issues for Congress include compliance with legislation overseeing dealings with the PLA and determining a program of contacts that advances U.S. security interests. The Defense Department conducts military-to-military contacts with China in line with the FY2000 NDAA. Various acts restrict arms sales to China and limit exposure of the PLA to certain operational areas. Congress oversees procurement from \"Communist Chinese military companies\" for goods and services on the Munitions List. The NDAA for FY2010 expanded the focus of the annual report on PRC military power to include security developments and mil-to-mil contacts. Congress is examining the role of congressional oversight in military engagement with the PRC, considering options such as hosting PLA delegations on Capitol Hill or engaging with them during visits to China. The PLA's role in visits by Codels to China includes receiving briefings from the Administration, investigating POW/MIA cases, reviewing exchanges at APCSS, passing legislation on sanctions, assessing adherence to laws, reviewing DOD's mil-to-mil contacts plan, requiring reviews by DTSA, and examining agreements like ACSA. Congress has oversight of sanctions imposed on the PLA for their role in the Tiananmen Square Crackdown of 1989, known as the \"Tiananmen Sanctions.\" These sanctions prohibit the export of US defense articles and services to China, with Presidents occasionally using waiver authority. President Obama issued a waiver for temporary export licenses under the USML for a civilian-operated C-130 transport plane in operations for an oil spill at sea. The issue is whether he is required to issue waivers and consult with Congress regarding increased exposures of the PLA to U.S. equipment in military exchanges. The U.S. ban on arms sales also upholds credibility and leadership, opposing the EU's arms embargo against China and Israel's arms transfers to the PLA. In January 2004, the EU considered lifting its embargo on arms sales to China, prompting discussions with the United States and other countries. The US opposes lifting the arms embargo on China, citing human rights abuses as the reason. Secretary of State Colin Powell expressed opposition to the EU's reconsideration of the embargo, highlighting the PLA's missiles aimed at Taiwan as a concern. France and other EU countries were in discussions about the embargo issue. The EU's policy change was influenced by the PLA's missiles aimed at Taiwan, referendums in Taiwan, and China's human rights conditions. Israel canceled the sale of the Phalcon system to the PLA in response to objections from the US. The US demanded Israel not return upgraded Harpy attack drones to China. The Arms Export Control Act governs US transfers of defense articles and services. The Arms Export Control Act prohibits arms sales to countries engaging in intimidation or harassment of US individuals without consent. The President must report such determinations to Congress. The PLA's Defense White Paper in 2013 acknowledged joint exercises with foreign militaries to modernize. Defense Secretary reported PLA participation in May 2013. The Defense Secretary reported to Congress in May 2013 that PLA participation in military training exercises could lead to unauthorized disclosure of defense articles to China. The U.S.-China Joint Defense Conversion Commission was established in 1994 to facilitate economic and technical cooperation in defense conversion, but concerns were raised in 1995. The House National Security Committee expressed concerns about U.S. assistance to PRC firms with ties to the PLA. They prohibited the use of DOD funds for activities related to the commission. Conferees agreed to require the Secretary of Defense to submit reports on the commission. Congress intends to examine the results of the U.S.-PRC security dialogue on human rights and military transparency. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY1997 banned DOD from using funds for the commission until a report is received by Congress. Secretary Perry terminated the JDCC in July 1996 due to controversy. The House Committee on National Security audited JDCC activities and sought a full accounting of DOD interaction with the PRC government and PLA in 1996. The DOD was required to provide a report on its interactions with the PRC government and PLA from 1994-1996 and proposed for 1997-1998. The unclassified report was submitted in February 1997, with no classified version. Concerns were raised by some Members of Congress about the benefits of mil-to-mil exchanges. In 1999, it was revealed that a U.S.-Sino Defense Exchange program had been ongoing for years. Representative Dana Rohrabacher raised concerns about military exchanges with the People's Republic of China (PRC), stating that they may benefit PLA modernization at the expense of allies in the Pacific region. He requested detailed descriptions of these exchanges and criticized the Clinton Administration for not following legislation governing military exchanges with the PLA. The legislation governing military exchanges with the PLA was largely ignored, with a violation occurring in August 2000 when the PLA visited the Joint Forces Command. Congress reminded Rumsfeld of the restrictions, set by the FY2000 NDAA, which prohibited mil-to-mil contact if it posed a national security risk in certain operational areas. The FY2000 NDAA set restrictions on military exchanges with the PLA, including prohibiting contact that posed a national security risk in certain operational areas. This included force projection, nuclear operations, logistical operations, chemical and biological defense, surveillance, reconnaissance, joint warfighting experiments, military space operations, arms sales, technology transfers, and access to DOD laboratories. The Secretary of Defense had to certify annually whether any authorized contact with China violated these restrictions. The FY2000 NDAA imposed restrictions on military exchanges with the PLA, prohibiting contact that posed a national security risk in specific operational areas. The Secretary of Defense had to certify annually if any authorized contact with China violated these restrictions. However, in 2011, the House passed H.R. 1540, the FY2012 NDAA, removing the certification requirement. The PLA objected to this law as an obstacle to their mil-to-mil relationship with the U.S. The Pentagon under Bush and Obama administrations stated that the law did not need to be changed to enhance exchanges, as it already allowed for some contacts. Congress or the Secretary of Defense could clarify what type of mil-to-mil contact with the PLA would pose a national security risk. In 2014, General Martin Dempsey suggested that Congress might relax restrictions on military exchanges with the PLA, depending on engagements and participation at RIMPAC. In June 2012, the PLA questioned why the PLA Navy was not invited to RIMPAC 2012. The PLA Navy was not invited to the U.S.-led RIMPAC 2012 maritime exercise in Hawaii due to sensitivity and U.S. laws. General Dempsey noted the PLA's lack of willingness to participate at a senior level in defense minister dialogues. However, Defense Secretary Panetta announced the invitation of the PLAN to participate in RIMPAC 2014, including drills on surface warfare, counter-piracy, HA/DR, search and rescue, and dive and salvage operations. The PLA Navy was invited to participate in RIMPAC 2014, which included drills on various operations. The PLAN's participation raised concerns in Congress about protecting technology and complying with U.S. laws. Representatives Dana Rohrabacher and Steven Chabot raised objections. On June 7, 2013, the House passed FY2014 NDAA, H.R. 1960, with an amendment requiring the Navy Secretary to brief Congress on PLAN's participation in RIMPAC 2014. On July 24, an amendment to H.R. 2397 was considered to ban funds for U.S. military exercises with PLA participation, but it failed. On October 21, Representative Forbes urged Defense Secretary Hagel to invite Taiwan to RIMPAC 2014. On June 2, 2014, the Senate Armed Services Committee reported S. 2410 (Levin), FY2015 NDAA, with a provision expressing the Senate's support for both the. S. 2410 (Levin), FY2015 NDAA, with Section 1212 expressing the Senate's support for both the PRC and Taiwan to participate in multilateral exercises like RIMPAC. Representative Chabot introduced H.Res. 643 concerning PLA hackers and U.S. trade secrets. Representative Forbes opposed PLAN's participation in RIMPAC due to Beijing's behavior. House and Senate Armed Services Committees agreed on language for FY2015 NDAA (H.R. 3979; P.L. 113-291) with Section 1259A. Section 1259A of the FY2015 NDAA expressed Congress's support for enhancing Taiwan's navy's capabilities and allowing Taiwan and the PRC to participate in HA/DR exercises like RIMPAC. Section 1201(f) of the FY2000 NDAA required a report on military-to-military contacts with the PRC, submitted in January 2001. Section 1201(e) mandated annual reports on mil-to-mil exchanges with the PLA starting in 2001. The report on military-to-military contacts with the PLA included past and planned exchanges, benefits expected by both parties, and the role of these contacts in the larger security relationship with China. The report submitted in January 2001 stated that all exchange activities are conducted at the unclassified level. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz submitted an unclassified report on mil-to-mil exchanges in 2000 under the Clinton Administration, with no schedule for 2001 activities provided. The 2001 program was under review by the Secretary of Defense. Under the Bush and Obama Administrations, reports on military exchanges with China were submitted to Congress by various Secretaries of Defense, with some reports classified as \"Confidential\" and others unclassified. In 2009, the House passed a bill to expand the focus of annual reports on \"PRC military power\" to include security developments involving China. In 2009, Congress passed a bill to expand annual reports on \"PRC military power\" to include security developments involving China. The Senate passed a version without changes to reporting requirements, but ultimately reconciled with the House. The conference report encouraged the Defense Secretary to examine China's psychological, media, and legal warfare on U.S. military affairs. The legislation, enacted as P.L. 111-84, changed the report title to \"Annual Report on Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China.\" The Defense Department was late in submitting the annual report on PRC Military Power in multiple years, citing inter-agency coordination as a reason. P.L. 111-84 required consultation with the Secretaries of Energy and State. The Senate Armed Services Committee expressed displeasure with the delays in submitting the report. Five Senators wrote to Defense Secretary Gates expressing serious concern over the failure to submit the report and requested an immediate submission to Congress with an explanation. The Senators expressed concern over the significant delay in submitting the annual report on PRC Military Power to Congress. They requested assurance that the report was not altered by White House political appointees to avoid angering China. The Secretary eventually submitted the unclassified report on August 16, 2010, incorporating reports on PRC military power and military contacts. Assistant Secretary of Defense Wallace Gregson later informed Congress of the need for additional time for inter-agency coordination. On May 3, Representative Randy Forbes expressed concern to Secretary Gates about the Defense Department's delay in submitting the annual report on China. Under Secretary of Defense Michele Flournoy cited inter-agency coordination for the delay. Representative Forbes later suggested that the delay was due to the Administration prioritizing diplomatic relations with China over complying with laws. The report was finally submitted on August 24. The House Armed Services Committee adopted an amendment to change the name of the report on China's military power and require information on cyber threats to the Pentagon. The final legislation required reporting on cyber threats but did not mandate the name change. Defense Secretary Panetta submitted the report late in 2012, prompting concerns from Chairman McKeon about its adequacy and timeliness. The Defense Department issued a statement denying intent to restrict information to Congress, rescinding guidance on page limits for reports. The NDAA for FY2013 required reports on China's military capabilities, cyber threats, and nuclear weapons program, among other assessments. The annual report submitted by Secretary of Defense Hagel in May 2013 covered China's denial, C4ISR, and maritime law enforcement capabilities, with a funding limit of $7 million for the Center of Excellence on Nuclear Security in China. The FY2014 NDAA required the report to include information on the PLA's 5th generation fighters and prohibited the integration of PRC's missile defense systems into U.S. systems. In June 2014, Hagel submitted another report after a visit by PLA Chief of General Staff Fang Fenghui. H.R. 4495, the Asia-Pacific Region Priority Act, introduced by Representatives Forbes and Hanabusa, aimed to support the strategic \"rebalance\" to the region. Section 205 sought to add more information to the annual report. Section 1252 and 1259 of the FY2015 NDAA amend requirements for the annual report to examine China's maritime strategy and the Defense Department's maritime security strategy in the Asia-Pacific. The report must assess how U.S.-PRC mil-to-mil engagements reduce tensions in the East and South China Seas. The NDAA for FY2015 includes provisions on mil-to-mil engagements with China, participation of PRC and Taiwan in multilateral exercises, prohibition of integrating PRC missile defense system, study on defense strategies against China and Russia's counter-space capabilities. P.L. 113-291 was enacted on December 19, 2014, and prohibits procurement from Communist Chinese military companies. The NDAA for FY2015 includes provisions on mil-to-mil engagements with China, participation of PRC and Taiwan in multilateral exercises, and a prohibition on integrating PRC missile defense systems. P.L. 113-291, enacted on December 19, 2014, prohibits procurement from Communist Chinese military companies. H.R. 1815 and S. 1042 had provisions regarding procurement from \"Communist Chinese military companies,\" with exceptions for U.S. military ship or aircraft visits, testing, and intelligence-collection, as well as waiver authority for the Secretary of Defense. The final version limited the ban to goods and services on the Munitions List, with exceptions and waiver authorization. In May 2011, an amendment to H.R. 1540 broadened the ban against such companies. The NDAA for FY2015 includes provisions on mil-to-mil engagements with China, participation of PRC and Taiwan in multilateral exercises, and a prohibition on integrating PRC missile defense systems. P.L. 113-291, enacted on December 19, 2014, prohibits procurement from Communist Chinese military companies. Enacted as P.L. 112-81 on December 31, 2011, a bill broadened the ban against procurement of PRC defense articles to include entities owned or controlled by the PLA, the PRC government, or affiliated with PRC defense industries. The Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on China's counterfeit electronic parts entering the U.S. defense supply chain. The House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces raised concerns about the Defense Department's lease of a PRC-owned commercial satellite for AFRICOM. The Defense Department renewed the contract after adding new higher-level review. The House passed the FY2014 NDAA with a section to prohibit the Defense Secretary from contracting satellite services with a foreign entity owned by a \"covered foreign country\". Section 1602 in the final legislation (P.L. 113-66) prohibits the Defense Secretary from contracting satellite services with a foreign entity owned by a \"covered foreign country\" such as the PRC, DPRK, or a state sponsor of terrorism. Representative Rogers expressed concerns about compromising military security by entering into such contracts. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 also prohibits assistance to Communist countries like the PRC, with provisions to ensure U.S. foreign aid does not support their projects. The President can remove a country from certain provisions if it benefits U.S. national interests. The PRC was removed from Section 620(f) in 1985. However, restrictions on aid to PLA projects were imposed in subsequent legislation. The Pentagon has pursued exchanges with the PLA as part of engagement with China, evaluating the benefits for U.S. security goals. The strategy focuses on goals, with dialogue critical for understanding regional security interests and building confidence to avoid military accidents. The Pentagon has engaged in exchanges with the PLA to understand regional security interests, prevent military accidents, and build confidence. The strategic non-targeting agreement in June 1998 was seen as symbolic but reassured both sides. Key achievements include the presidential hotline, Military Maritime Consultative Agreement, and Defense Consultative Talks. Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England outlined U.S. objectives in contacts with the PLA, aiming to support the President's policy goals, prevent conflict, lower the risk of miscalculation, increase understanding of China's military capabilities, and promote greater openness and transparency. The Pentagon has engaged in exchanges with the PLA to understand regional security interests, prevent military accidents, and build confidence. Key achievements include the presidential hotline, Military Maritime Consultative Agreement, and Defense Consultative Talks. The NDAA for FY2010 required the Defense Secretary to address the U.S. strategy for engagement with the PLA, emphasizing the importance of sustainable military-to-military ties for comprehensive U.S.-China relations. The Defense Department aims to expand practical cooperation with the People's Republic of China in areas of mutual interest, while addressing disagreements to prevent crisis or conflict. Priorities include building cooperative capacity, fostering institutional understanding, and developing common views on international security issues. This effort includes discussions on nuclear nonproliferation, stability in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and respectful dialogue on differences such as China's Exclusive Economic Zones and harassment of U.S. ships and aircraft. The United States remains vigilant in monitoring China's behavior in Exclusive Economic Zones and towards U.S. ships and aircraft. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel emphasized the importance of mil-to-mil engagement to shape China's rise and promote cooperation while addressing policy issues. Objectives in mil-to-mil contacts with China include gaining insights on PLA capabilities, deterring PLA use of force against Taiwan or allies, reducing tensions in Taiwan Strait, strategic arms control, weapons nonproliferation, engaging with PRC leaders, ensuring freedom of navigation, and accounting for American POW/MIAs. Critics argue that these contacts have little value in achieving U.S. objectives and instead inform PLA's warfighting capability against the U.S. They are concerned that exchanges may reward belligerence and oppose rehabilitating PLA officers involved in conflicts. Exchanges with China are criticized for rewarding belligerence and lack of transparency from the PLA. Critics urge caution in military contacts, limiting them to strategic and senior-level talks rather than operational areas. Past military-to-military contacts under the Clinton Administration allowed broad access to PLA officers, including to U.S. warships and military manuals. The PLA's military contacts with the United States have been criticized for aiding in its modernization goals. Calls have been made to limit exchanges to strategic dialogue on key issues like weapons proliferation and Taiwan, to prevent enhancing the PLA's war capabilities. Testimonies have highlighted how the PLA conceals its true capabilities during exchanges, showing scripted routines to visiting officials. In 2000, Randy Schriver, a former official in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, discussed lessons learned in military exchanges during the Clinton Administration. He emphasized the importance of limiting exchanges to strategic dialogue on key issues like weapons proliferation and Taiwan. Schriver noted that senior-level talks often involved exchanging talking points rather than real dialogue but considered the MMCA a successful confidence-building measure. Despite positive aspects like PLA participation in multilateral fora and exposure of younger officers to American society, Schriver criticized the United States for failing to gain insight into the PLA's modernization efforts. The United States failed to gain insight into the PLA's modernization efforts, shape China's behavior, or deter PLA aggression. The Pentagon needed to control PACOM's contacts with the PLA, with guidelines set by the Secretary of Defense. More consultations with Congress were called for, with warnings of modest expectations for military ties. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Kurt Campbell emphasized that security ties can only follow, not lead, the bilateral relationship. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Kurt Campbell emphasized that security ties can only follow, not lead, the bilateral relationship. Randy Schriver and Campbell highlighted the divergent objectives between the United States and PRC in dealing with maritime incidents and deterrence strategies. The United States and China have different approaches to deterrence strategies. While the US relies on overwhelming displays of military capability, China focuses on creating uncertainty to deter potential adversaries. Military exchanges with China may not be as transparent or reciprocal as with allies, but they provide valuable insights into the PLA's top leadership. U.S. military attaches have contacts with lower levels of the PLA and gain unique perspectives on China's military. Military exchanges with China can help minimize miscalculations and foster pro-U.S. leanings among younger officers. The U.S. seeks China's cooperation on international security issues, including in military medicine to prevent pandemics. Engaging with the PLA in multilateral venues could be more beneficial than bilateral exchanges. The PLA hosted the first \"Pan Asian-Pacific Conference on Military Medicine\" in Beijing. Congress and the Defense Department have seen China as crucial for resolving POW/MIA cases from the Korean War. Military exchanges aim to build mutual beneficial relations between the U.S. and China's armed forces, especially in the maritime domain. The importance of the Sino-American relationship in military exchanges is highlighted by former U.S. military attaches who advocate for a long-term engagement program with China to understand PLA developments. Despite limited access to PLA facilities, the U.S. has learned valuable insights through ongoing interactions. The PLA allowed foreign observers to witness military exercises in an effort to promote transparency and build trust in Sino-American military exchanges. In 2003, 27 military observers were invited to observe a PLA exercise in Inner Mongolia, followed by a landing exercise in Guangdong province in 2004. In September 2004, a limited number of foreign military observers attended an amphibious operations training base in Guangdong province. Recommendations for sustained high-level military strategic dialogue between the U.S. and China were made by various officials, including Admiral Dennis Blair and Admiral Michael Mullen. Improved communication between the two governments and militaries was emphasized to address distrust and misperceptions. Improved communication between the U.S. and China is crucial due to shared security interests and the increasing frequency of military operations. Concerns about misperceptions and challenges in military interactions persist, with a focus on managing friction and maintaining professionalism. Study highlights dangers of China's misperceptions that could impact U.S. security interests. The study identified five dangerous misperceptions held by China's military regarding the U.S., emphasizing the need for effective communication to address these issues. Despite 25 years of engagement, fundamental perceptions of world politics in China have not changed significantly, cautioning that continued dialogue may not completely eliminate these misperceptions. U.S. policy makers must carefully consider the implications for future exchanges with the PLA. The Center for Naval Analyses found in a 1999 study that U.S. and PRC military exchanges have different approaches, leading to tension at times. The PLA views the military relationship with the U.S. as a strategic political undertaking, while the U.S. focuses on mutual understanding before strategic agreement. The PLA views the military relationship with the U.S. as a strategic political undertaking, not solely for military reasons. The report argues that the PLA is cautious due to suspicions of U.S. motives, making progress based on reciprocity difficult. The PLA's cultural approach to relations treats them as tough business negotiations, emphasizing the need for true win-win solutions. Despite decades of U.S. efforts to engage the PLA, mil-to-mil engagement continues to face challenges with divergent perspectives. The PLA's modernization and assertive actions in maritime disputes have reduced the value placed on engaging with the U.S. The PLA's modernization and assertive actions in maritime disputes have reduced the value placed on engaging with the U.S., despite efforts to prioritize U.S. security interests in the Middle East, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The focus has shifted towards Asia-Pacific to balance risks from North Korea and China, with the PLA's improved capabilities and range being noted. China's assertiveness has been observed over the years, even in cooperative efforts like anti-piracy naval operations in the Gulf of Aden. The PLA's modernization and assertive actions in maritime disputes have shifted the focus towards Asia-Pacific, despite efforts to engage with the U.S. U.S. engagement with the PLA in anti-piracy included hosting the commander of the PLA Navy's task force at the Headquarters of the U.S. 5th Fleet in Bahrain. Admiral Mike Mullen emphasized the goals of a deeper military relationship to expand mutual interests and prevent miscalculation. However, the PLA's 2010 Defense White Paper did not portray anti-piracy cooperation as a priority for U.S.-PRC military engagement. The PLA Navy's anti-piracy operation was not highlighted as an area for U.S.-PRC military cooperation in the Defense White Paper. The commander of the PLAN's task force had an informal exchange in Oman at the request of Combined Task Force 151. A key researcher from the PLA's Academy of Military Science emphasized the difference in approach to transparency between China and Western militaries, calling for trust as a requirement for transparency. The Obama Administration has recognized challenges in cooperation with the PLA. The Obama Administration has recognized challenges in cooperation with the PLA, seeking to build confidence in mil-to-mil engagement with China. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Schiffer acknowledged the need for a deep \"strategic understanding\" between the two countries. The U.S. approach aims to institutionalize mil-to-mil as a critical component of the U.S.-PRC relationship, emphasizing sustained, reliable, and continuous engagement without using it as a reward or punishment. The Pentagon could pursue a program of military contacts with China under focused control by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with Congress and allies like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. This program would aim to improve communication, conflict avoidance, and crisis management in direct confrontations between the U.S. military and PLA. Analysts in China have studied the government's strengths and weaknesses in crisis management in light of the EP-3 crisis in 2001. The crisis over the EP-3 aircraft collision and subsequent confrontations have shown the limits in benefits to the United States of pursuing personal relationships with PLA leaders. During the crisis, PRC ruler Jiang Zemin pressed the United States with a hard-line stance, while PLA generals followed without any greater inflammatory rhetoric. Admiral Prueher, who served as ambassador to China, found personal ties with PLA officers to be ineffective during crises. Despite some believing in the benefits of fostering relationships with PLA officers, the EP-3 collision crisis in 2001 highlighted the limitations of personal connections in crisis management. General Myers emphasized the advantage of having established relationships with PLA officers for effective communication during challenging situations. The importance of personal relationships with PLA officers during crises was highlighted by Admiral Prueher and General Myers. Despite efforts to build relationships, the EP-3 collision crisis in 2001 showed the limitations. The MMCA, established in 1998, focused on discussing maritime and air safety but lacked communication protocols for crises. The U.S. military faced challenges with the PLA in discussions under the MMCA, including objections to U.S. activities in China's claimed exclusive economic zone. Despite efforts since the late 1990s, operational safety and freedom of navigation have been problematic. The Defense Secretary reported differences with China over coastal state rights in economic zones and emphasized the need for vigilance in monitoring risky behavior. The U.S. military faces challenges with the PLA regarding operational safety and freedom of navigation. Despite efforts under the MMCA, dangerous confrontations have occurred based on different national interests. The PLA aims to keep U.S. military operations away from China, leading to tensions. The Defense Secretary highlighted disagreements over coastal state rights in economic zones and the need for vigilance in monitoring risky behavior. The Defense Secretary reported no resurgence of harassment by PRC fishing vessels towards U.S. naval ships, but warned of potential future incidents. The U.S. military raised concerns about unsafe actions by PRC ships and aircraft risking American lives. The PLA blamed U.S. operations for any risks and limited representation at MMCA meetings to the PLAN. In 2010, PLA fighters conducted close intercepts of U.S. military aircraft in international airspace, and PRC ships harassed U.S. survey ships. The PLAN ignored ship-to-ship communication in Asia but acknowledged the risk of accidents. General Liang Guanglie mentioned the danger of accidents, using the phrase \"an accidental discharge of gunfire in cleaning a gun.\" In June 2011, Taiwan's F-16 fighters intercepted PLA Air Force Su-27 fighters in the Taiwan Strait. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and met with PRC State Councilor Dai Bingguo to discuss the issue. The MMCA working group meeting in Qingdao addressed disputes over U.S. reconnaissance flights, but there was no MMCA plenary in 2011. Policy issues include reinvigorating MMCA talks and addressing actions of the PLAAF and PRC maritime law enforcement. The PLAN has coordinated with PLAAF and maritime law enforcement ships. They have conducted military activities in other nations' EEZs without permission, including the U.S. EEZs of Hawaii and Guam in 2012. PLAN ships sailed through straits near Japan's islands for training in the Western Pacific Ocean, emphasizing freedom of navigation. The PLA's freedom of navigation and overflight should be respected by other countries according to international law. Despite invited participation at RIMPAC 2014, the PLAN sent an AGI ship to Hawaii's EEZ and Guam's U.S. EEZ. Admiral Samuel Locklear testified about unsafe maneuvers by the PLA to impede U.S. forces in international air and maritime areas. In July, PRC media showed a video of a CMS ship confronting the USS Impeccable in the East China Sea. In July, Admiral Locklear mentioned U.S. and PLA forces operating professionally near each other despite disagreements over EEZ interpretations. Concerns arose from interceptions of U.S. aircraft, including incidents in the East China Sea and South China Sea. General Hawk Carlisle stated that most encounters were safe, suggesting discussions between the U.S. military and PLA regarding the PRC's straight baselines around islands. In March 2013, the United States protested to China for using straight baselines around the Senkaku Islands, which is inconsistent with international law. The US Navy may assert freedom of navigation to challenge claims that violate international law. The Defense Department criticized China for improperly drawing baselines around the Senkaku Islands in a report to Congress. The US protested China's use of straight baselines around the Senkaku Islands, which violates international law. Progress was made in establishing safety procedures at sea, with the approval of the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) in 2014. PLAN Commander Wu Shengli praised the CUES for preventing incidents at sea and in the air. Issues remain regarding the PLAN's and China Coast Guard's adherence to international rules like COLREGS, UNCLOS, and CUES. Discussions have taken place on how U.S. and foreign militaries should respond to PRC violations of these rules. In 2013, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced new Working Groups with China on military activities notifications and rules of behavior. There are debates on negotiating \"security\" versus safety and creating new \"codes of conduct\" instead of following established international laws. In July to November 2014, Working Groups negotiated two MOUs on military-to-military confidence-building measures. Presidents Obama and Xi Jinping announced the MOUs on Notification of Major Military Activities and Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters. The MOU refers to UNCLOS, COLREGs, and CUES. An Annex on surface-to-surface encounters was issued, with an expected annex on air-to-air encounters in 2015. The MOU does not affect either side's perspective on military activities in the EEZ. The U.S. prioritized informing the other party of ballistic missile launches. In early 2005, U.S. defense and PLA officials held a Special Policy Dialogue to discuss policy disputes and end an impasse in talks over safety and operational concerns under the MMCA. The first combined exercise held under the MMCA, a search and rescue exercise (SAREX), did not take place until the fall of 2006, after eight years of talks. By 2007, the MMCA's status and value were in greater doubt, and no MMCA working groups or plenary meetings took place that year. In Qingdao, PACOM's Director for Strategic Planning and Policy (J-5), USMC Major General Thomas Conant, and PLA Navy Deputy Chief of Staff Zhang Leiyu led an annual meeting under the MMCA, the first since 2006. The PLA sought to amend the MMCA, but the U.S. opposed discussing policy differences and planning future military exercises at the meetings. Tensions arose over the PRC's disputes with foreign countries regarding freedom of navigation. The PLA downgraded the DPCT as \"working-level\" talks, conflicting with previous agreements on the importance of talks. Admiral Timothy Keating proposed negotiating an \"Incidents at Sea\" (INCSEA) protocol with the PLA to prevent dangerous incidents like the EP-3 crisis. In 2009, the Pentagon reported aggressive harassment of U.S. ocean surveillance ships by PRC ships, sparking discussions on the need for an INCSEA. Some suggested that an INCSEA could help avoid collisions and tensions with China, while skeptics questioned the effectiveness of such an agreement. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Randy Schriver highlighted that the MMCA was similar to an INCSEA but with limited usefulness due to China's focus on halting U.S. reconnaissance. He argued that the PLA is not interested in a rules-based approach to safety at sea. Chief of Naval Operations Gary Roughead also opposed an INCSEA, stating it would create a separate agreement with the PLAN and define the relationship with the PLA as abnormal. In 2003, Under Secretary of Defense Douglas Feith proposed a hotline for crisis management with the PLA. The PLA showed interest in 2007 and agreed to set up a defense telephone link with the Pentagon in 2008. The hotline was used in May 2008 by Admiral Keating to communicate with PLA Deputy Chief of General Staff Ma Xiaotian. In 2008, a defense telephone link was established between the Pentagon and the PLA. Despite initial reluctance, the PLA agreed to use the hotline in May 2008 for communication. However, actual use of the hotline by the PLA did not occur until May 2011, as confirmed by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mullen in July 2011. There were discussions on using the hotline for regular communication, transparency, and consultations with Congress and U.S. allies. The Obama Administration shifted to using the hotline for routine discussions. The Obama Administration expanded the use of the hotline for routine discussions, not just during crises. General Dempsey and Defense Secretary Hagel had phone conversations with Chinese military officials. In 2014, there were talks about upgrading the hotline to video teleconference. Improved communication in air traffic control in China was also discussed. In December 2010, a new national air traffic control system was established as part of a high-priority military project. Some suggest unofficial talks with retired U.S. military officials could help prevent conflicts with the PLA, while others are concerned about potential mixed messages and confusion. In January 2010, a delegation from the China Foundation for International and Strategic Studies visited Washington with PLA officers. In 2010, a delegation including PLA officers met with US defense and State Department officials. Admiral Keating used a network of retired Admirals for crisis management. PLA pursued ties with retired PACOM Commander Thomas Fargo. General Li Jinai asked for personal influence on military ties. The China Association for International Friendly Contact sponsored the group. The \"Sanya Initiative\" began in February 2008 with Xiong Guangkai leading the PLA side and Bill Owens leading the U.S. side. The PLA side sought help with PRC objections to U.S. policies and laws. A second meeting was held in 2009 at PACOM in Honolulu, Washington, and New York. Despite unofficial talks, key U.S. military officials were involved. In continuation of the \"Sanya Initiative,\" Bill Owens and his group met with Chinese officials in Beijing in 2010 and 2012. Owens, a Managing Director of AEA Investors in Hong Kong, expressed concerns over mil-to-mil suspensions and arms sales to Taiwan. In 2012, Owens led a meeting with retired PLA generals in Annapolis and Washington. Bill Owens and his group met with retired PLA generals in Annapolis and Washington, as well as Chinese officials in Beijing in 2010 and 2012. They also visited Beijing in December 2012 and June 2013, meeting with CMC Vice Chairman Xu Qiliang and GPD Director Zhang Yang. The Obama Administration has sought comprehensive engagement and bilateral dialogues to prevent conflict with China. The PLA and PRC's top leadership aim to enhance coordination through dialogues, including the S&ED structure. Despite tensions, the US and ROK conducted military exercises in response to North Korea's attack. PLA General Ma Xiaotian opposed the exercises in the Yellow Sea, showing a divide between the PLA and top PRC leadership. The PRC shifted from \"concern\" to \"opposition\" to foreign military presence in the Yellow Sea, especially objecting to the USS George Washington joining exercises off the coast of South Korea. Despite PLA's resistance, it may not always dominate PRC policymaking, as seen in the belated invitation to Gates. After North Korea's attack on South Korea, the PLA remained relatively quiet when the USS George Washington exercised with the ROK navy in the Yellow Sea. The PRC Foreign Ministry opposed any military action in China's EEZ without permission. Secretary Gates questioned Hu Jintao about a J-20 stealth fighter test. The PLA did not regularly inform political leadership. Hu Jintao agreed with President Obama that China welcomes the US as an Asia-Pacific nation contributing to peace and stability. The PLA's actions have raised questions about their independence from PRC policymaking. Concerns about Hu Jintao's control over the PLA were highlighted after a summit with President Bush in 2006. The PLA conducted an anti-satellite weapon test in 2007, which was kept silent by the Foreign Ministry for 12 days. There may have been a division of labor between the PLA and CPC leadership in their relationships with foreign countries. The PLA and CPC leaderships had parallel relationships with foreign countries, including the United States. Lack of coordination between PLA and civilian officials was noted, with priority programs for military modernization controlled by a top-level military-civilian Central Special Committee. Concerns about military-civilian coordination at lower levels, especially on foreign policy, were also raised. The lack of military-civilian coordination at lower levels, particularly on foreign policy, raised concerns by 2010. The PLA demonstrated stronger capabilities and influence, coordinating with civilian authorities in aggressive actions against U.S. ocean surveillance ships in international waters. Wu Shengli, CMC Member and PLAN Commander, highlighted close coordination between the PLAN and shipping companies in the Gulf of Aden in January 2011. In April 2011, the PLAN conducted a military-civilian exercise in the South China Sea, showing coordination with civilian agencies. The Defense White Paper of March 2011 highlighted coordination between the PLA and other agencies. Secretary of State Clinton emphasized that \"China is not the Soviet Union\" in a speech in April 2012. PRC leader Hu Jintao called for a \"new type of great power relationship\" during the S&ED in May 2012. General Liang Guanglie, the Defense Minister of China, visited the United States in May 2013 to promote a new type of state-to-state relationship with the U.S. The PLA supports positive U.S.-PRC ties, in line with top CPC leaders. Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow in March 2013 marked the first visit by a PRC head of state to the Russian Defense Ministry. Critics have raised concerns about limited information gained by the U.S. from military exchanges with China. The Pentagon's report to Congress in 2001 highlighted instances where the PLA denied access to U.S. officials, while requesting access to U.S. military exercises. This raised questions about reciprocity and transparency in efforts to increase mutual understanding with the PLA. The PLA requested unprecedented access to the U.S. Army's NTC in 1999, wanting to observe the 3rd Infantry Division and 82nd Airborne Division in a training exercise. Despite pressure from Admiral Prueher and Secretary Cohen, the Pentagon denied the request on March 17, 1999. This incident highlighted concerns about reciprocity and transparency in military exchanges with China. The Rand study in 2004 disputed claims of limited access to advanced Chinese military units by U.S. delegations. It recommended focusing on educational exchanges to address reciprocity and transparency issues. Challenges arose from the PLA's segregation of foreign military students. In March 2009, the PLA started mixing foreign and PLA students at the Air Force Command College. Despite some restrictions on U.S. participation in military exercises, there have been instances where insights into PLA capabilities were gained through contacts with the U.S. military. The PLA allowed U.S. officials unprecedented access to various military facilities and units between 1993 and 2012, including the Satellite Control Center in Xian, Beijing Military Region's Air Defense Command Center, and the 39th Group Army. The PLA's military buildup, including missile modernization, in response to concerns about Taiwan has raised security issues since the early 1990s. The U.S. has oversight under the Taiwan Relations Act, with Congress monitoring the President's management of cross-strait relations. The United States has increased arms sales and ties with Taiwan's military under the \"one China\" policy, following the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis. Policy considerations include deterring aggression, supporting self-defense, and promoting cross-strait dialogue. Questions arise regarding educational exchanges with the PLA, such as allowing PLA officers to attend U.S. military academies and Taiwan's military attendees at APCSS courses in Honolulu. The Bush Administration's policy change allowing Taiwan's attendance at APCSS affected the PLA's participation. The Bush Administration's policy change allowed Taiwan's attendance at APCSS, impacting interactions among the U.S., PRC, and other Asian militaries. Despite objections from the PLA, Taiwan sent students to APCSS in 2002. The PLA stopped attending courses after 2002, citing alternating attendance with Taiwan as a reason. However, the U.S. military viewed Taiwan's attendance as a convenient excuse, as the PRC sent non-PLA students to APCSS since 2008. The PLA's NDU set up its own International Symposium Course in 1999 to train foreign military officers, mirroring APCSS. There are questions about the U.S. role in promoting cross-strait dialogue, highlighted by Secretary of Defense Cohen's meeting with PRC's ARATS chairman in 2000. Cohen mentioned President Chen Shui-bian's potential for cross-strait reconciliation. In contrast, during a visit to Beijing in February 2004, Under Secretary of Defense Feith did not discuss the contentious issue of referendums in Taiwan with PLA leaders, as he deemed it not defense-related. This decision could lead to misperceptions or miscalculations in the U.S.-PRC military relationship. The PLA's missile buildup against Taiwan was highlighted in a 2007 study, calling for efforts to reduce tensions across the Taiwan Strait. The PLA has suspended military exchanges in retaliation for U.S. policy towards Taiwan, raising tensions across the Taiwan Strait. Beijing opposed Taiwan's proposal for a referendum on U.N. membership, seen as a step towards independence. The Bush Administration continued providing security assistance to Taiwan despite opposition from the PRC. The U.S. continued providing security assistance to Taiwan, leading to protests from China. This resulted in the suspension of military exchanges and denied port visits by U.S. Navy ships. The USS Kitty Hawk sailed through the Taiwan Strait without China's permission, causing objections from China. Keating asserted the U.S. does not need China's permission to navigate the Taiwan Strait, citing it as international waters. China's foreign ministry spokesperson did not outright reject the idea of needing permission from Beijing, calling the strait a \"highly sensitive area.\" The PLA suspended some military exchanges after the Bush Administration notified Congress of pending arms sales to Taiwan in 2008. PACOM's Admiral Keating raised the question of a potential U.S. role in cross-strait CBMs. In February 2009, PACOM's Admiral Keating offered to host talks between the PLA and Taiwan's military, despite Reagan's \"Six Assurances\" not allowing U.S. mediation. President Obama did not notify Congress of major Foreign Military Sales to Taiwan in 2009. After Obama's notifications in 2010, the PRC threatened to respond by postponing military exchanges, meetings, imposing sanctions on U.S. defense firms, and reacting on international issues. The State Department expressed regret over the PRC's plans to curtail military and security-related exchanges. The PRC announced plans to curtail military exchanges and take action against U.S. firms supplying defensive articles to Taiwan. This led to the postponement of Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg's meetings in Beijing. The threat to U.S. firms, including Boeing and General Electric, risked backfiring on Beijing. The PRC Embassy in Washington even contacted a U.S. defense firm's executive with an implied warning, which was deemed highly inappropriate. The PRC's messages should be directed to the State Department instead of U.S. firms. The impact on mil-to-mil meetings was mixed, with major visits discussed but canceled by the PLA. Admiral Mike Mullen was unaware of any ongoing mil-to-mil activities being called off. The USS Nimitz had a port visit in Hong Kong, while minor meetings in the spring saw the PLA decline to participate or host. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Bob Newberry visited Beijing in April to discuss with the PLA. In April, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Bob Newberry visited Beijing to discuss accounting for missing personnel with PLA officials. In May, PACOM Commander Admiral Robert Willard and Assistant Secretary of Defense Wallace Gregson met with PLA officials in Beijing for the Strategic and Economic Dialogue. In June, Secretary Gates traveled to Singapore for the \"Shangri-la Dialogue\" but the PLA declined to host him, possibly due to U.S. arms sales and North Korea support by the PRC. In June, Defense Minister Liang Guanglie attributed timing difficulties in not hosting Gates in Singapore. A PLA attach\u00e9 with the rank of Senior Colonel spoke officially at the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command in Virginia. The PLA has not retaliated against Taiwan for U.S. arms sales. The Obama Administration resurrected an approach involving PRC/CPC officials on Taiwan. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Schiffer visited Beijing in September 2010. In September 2010, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Schiffer visited Beijing to discuss military exchanges, including a meeting at the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO). The PLA expressed interest in resuming military-to-military exchanges but postponed visits and joint exercises after President Obama notified Congress of arms sales to Taiwan in September 2011. Despite this, the PLA hosted the 12th round of Defense Consultative Talks (DCT) in Beijing by December 2011. China's nuclear cooperation with Pakistan, support for DPRK, and potential undermining of sanctions against Iran are concerns for the United States. Despite not joining the Proliferation Security Initiative, China has voted for some UNSC sanctions on North Korea and Iran. The US has relied on China's influence on North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons, with limited results from the \"Six-Party Talks\" hosted by Beijing. Some suggest engaging more with Beijing to leverage its influence. China's approach towards proliferation in North Korea and Iran has not shown fundamental changes. Despite calls for engaging more with Beijing to use its leverage against Pyongyang and Tehran, China's implementation of agreed sanctions remains questionable. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sought cooperation on North Korea's \"growing threat\" in a phone call with Defense Minister Chang Wanquan in April 2013. China's approach towards proliferation in North Korea and Iran has not shown fundamental changes. Despite calls for engaging more with Beijing to use its leverage against Pyongyang and Tehran, China's implementation of agreed sanctions remains questionable. In August, Rear Admiral Guan Youfei of the PLA called for flexibility towards North Korea, while Under Secretary of Defense James Miller urged China to increase pressure on North Korea for denuclearization. There is a challenge in engaging the PLA in efforts to address the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. China hosted the first round of Six-Party Talks in August 2003, and PLA units replaced PAP units along the border with North Korea the following month. China has shifted its approach towards North Korea, focusing on buttressing the DPRK regime's security and survival for stability. Questions have arisen about discussing the PRC's military relationship with the DPRK, including PLA contingency planning in case of a crisis or regime collapse. Key concerns include the PLA's knowledge of the DPRK's missile and nuclear programs and plans to secure weapons and nuclear material. China's support for North Korea includes securing weapons and nuclear material, sharing intelligence with the US and allies, and exerting control to complicate US and ROK operations. The PLA views North Korea as a buffer against US and ROK forces, even supporting them after attacks on South Korea. Cooperation in nuclear security and counter-terrorism led to the establishment of a Center of Excellence on Nuclear Security in China in 2011. The China Atomic Energy Authority is responsible for implementing the agreement. The China Atomic Energy Authority (CAEA) is responsible for implementing an agreement regarding nuclear security. Concerns have arisen about China's modernizing strategic nuclear force and its \"No First Use\" policy. The Defense Department's 2011 report to Congress noted debates on conditions for China's use of nuclear weapons first. China's 'no first use' doctrine may be challenged by conditions threatening China's nuclear force or regime survival. The PLA sees the Second Artillery as separate from nuclear policy discussions and relies on uncertainty for deterrence. Concerns about U.S. missile defense exist, but China assured Secretary Rumsfeld they would not use nuclear weapons first. General Jing of the Second Artillery declined invitations to visit STRATCOM in 2006 despite interest in engaging on space issues. In January 2007, PLA conducted its first successful anti-satellite weapons test. China conducted its first successful direct ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons test in 2007, demonstrating improved capability to target the U.S. mainland. The PLA's refusal to hold a dialogue on nuclear policy raised questions about China's intentions and control over the military. Reports indicate that China has been pursuing ASAT programs for years, including the development of space-based and ground-based laser weapons. China has also enhanced its ability to track and identify satellites, a crucial step for counter-space operations. China has been actively pursuing advanced missile and space-related technologies that target U.S. national interests. They have conducted multiple ASAT tests, including a suspected ASAT test in 2013 reaching over 6,200 miles above Earth. The PLA's land-based \"missile defense\" test in 2014 was confirmed to be an ASAT test by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Frank Rose, who warned that ASAT weapons pose a direct threat to satellites and the information they provide. The PLA has been actively developing advanced missile and space technologies that threaten U.S. satellites and their strategic information. In 2007, the PLA took steps to include nuclear strategy talks with the Defense Department. The PLA proposed changing defense policy talks to a \"Strategic Dialogue\" involving nuclear policy. Concerns were raised about China's intentions and engagement in arms control during a summit in Beijing in 2009. In November 2009, President Obama reiterated the commitment made in 1998 with Hu Jintao not to target each other with nuclear weapons. The U.S. and China also expressed common interests in peaceful outer space use. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aimed to establish a strategic dialogue with China to prevent misunderstandings and ensure global stability. Kurt Campbell highlighted the need for improved military and nuclear dialogues with China. The U.S. proposed Defense Department officials brief the PLA on the Quadrennial Defense Review and Nuclear Posture Review, but the PLA did not accept. The Nuclear Posture Review called for a dialogue on \"strategic stability\" to enhance confidence and transparency. The U.S. urged China to initiate a dialogue on \"strategic stability\" for a more stable relationship. The U.S. urged China to initiate a dialogue on \"strategic stability\" for a more stable relationship, but the PLA has not agreed to further talks. Secretary Gates raised this concern with CMC Vice Chairman General Xu Caihou, and proposed a strategic dialogue in nuclear, space, and cybersecurity. The PLA agreed to \"study\" the proposal but issued a press statement before Gates met with General Jing. At the 3rd S&ED on May 9-10, 2011, the Defense and State Departments initiated the first Strategic Security Dialogue (SSD) with the PLA and Foreign Ministry, discussing cyber and maritime disputes. The Defense Secretary's 2011 report to Congress highlighted the PLA's focus on cyber warfare. The Defense Department issued the first Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace in July 2011. The National Counterintelligence Executive reported that China is the most active in economic espionage through cyber intrusions. The NSA has tracked cyber threats to groups connected to the PLA targeting U.S. defense programs. The PRC has a national policy of economic espionage in cyberspace, as noted by former high-ranking U.S. officials. China's cyber and space capabilities are part of its military modernization, according to Admiral Robert Willard. Despite denials from Defense Minister Liang Guanglie, U.S. officials have cited cyber activities originating from China. Concerns have been raised by Congress about China's cyber espionage to boost the PLA's power and economy. The Defense Department's report to Congress highlighted ties between PRC telecommunications companies and the government/PLA. The House Intelligence Committee warned of national security risks from using Huawei or ZTE products due to ties to the PRC government and PLA entities. Concerns about cyber threats were raised at the State Department, with Defense Secretary Panetta warning of a \"cyber Pearl Harbor.\" Mandiant's report pointed to cyber threats from the PLA's Unit 61398 in Shanghai, leading to growing concerns about China's cyber activities. The Administration raised concerns about China's cyber threats involving the PLA and provided Internet service providers with suspected IP addresses. The PLA denied supporting hacking but did not deny the activities of Unit 61398. The Administration now publicly raises concerns about cyber threats with China, including threats against national networks and critical infrastructure. The US Administration raised concerns about cyber threats from China, specifically mentioning threats against national networks and critical infrastructure. National Security Advisor Donilon and DNI Clapper highlighted cyber threats from China and Russia, calling them \"advanced cyber actors.\" President Obama discussed cyber threats with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and the Secretary of Defense's report to Congress mentioned cyber intrusions in 2012 attributed to the Chinese government and PLA. The US Administration raised concerns about cyber threats from China, specifically mentioning threats against national networks and critical infrastructure. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel expressed US concerns about cyber intrusions from the PLA at the Shangri-la Dialogue. Some skeptics, like Michael Chertoff, warned that diplomacy may not stop China's cyber threats. China showed some willingness to cooperate in cybersecurity, agreeing to a new Working Group on Cybersecurity in April 2013. During a summit in Sunnylands Retreat, CA, President Obama and Xi Jinping recognized the need for international rules in cybersecurity. However, complications arose with Edward Snowden's revelations of NSA surveillance in Hong Kong and China. President Obama distinguished between common intelligence collection and cyber theft by the Chinese government. China used Snowden's case to protest to the United States about \"cyber attacks,\" despite suspected surveillance against its own citizens. The White House warned of negative impact on U.S.-China relationship. Both sides held S&ED and Cyber Working Group meeting to discuss reducing risks in cyberspace. President Obama reiterated concerns about cyber theft of trade secrets. President Obama expressed concerns about cyber theft of trade secrets to Chinese officials, including disappointment over the handling of Snowden's case. Defense Secretary Hagel emphasized the need for cooperation in cyberspace, but the PLA accused the U.S. of hypocrisy. Despite meetings and briefings on cyber capabilities, there was no reciprocal action from the PLA. The PLA did not reciprocate with its briefing on cyber capabilities despite Defense Secretary Hagel's call for cooperation. Indictments were made against hackers from PLA's Unit 61398 for economic espionage. Another group of hackers from Unit 61486 was reported by CrowdStrike. The PRC suspended the Cyber Working Group after the indictments, and the Senate Armed Services Committee found successful intrusions by PRC government hackers into contractor systems. The PRC government successfully intruded into the computer systems of contractors for the Transportation Command (TRANSCOM). Despite the U.S. government's call for cooperation, China did not provide military cooperation in Operation Enduring Freedom against Al Qaeda. U.S.-PRC counterterrorism cooperation has been limited, with China mainly offering diplomatic support. Counterterrorism cooperation with China has been limited, with U.S. concerns growing over China's influence in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and its supply of weapons to conflict zones. Some caution against military cooperation with China due to human rights concerns and technology transfers to rogue states, while others see potential benefits for the U.S. relationship with China in the fight against terrorism. Senator Bob Smith and Representative Dana Rohrabacher expressed concerns about renewed military contacts with China in 2001. In 2004, Rand recommended a security management program with China, including counterterrorism. Concerns arose about U.S. support for security at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and cooperation with PLA and PAP. Sanctions were imposed on China after the Tiananmen Crackdown in 1989, restricting exports of defense articles/services. Presidential waivers were allowed. In 2004, U.S. departments, including Defense, provided security assistance for the Athens Olympics. In 2004, the Pentagon discussed security cooperation with China for the 2008 Olympics, but China declined assistance. In 2009, a non-lethal supply route from China to Afghanistan was proposed due to concerns about the route through Pakistan. In May 2009, Defense Secretary Gates expressed willingness for China's help in Afghanistan, despite stark differences on human rights. The U.S. considers China's Armed Forces' role in internal security, such as in Tibet and Xinjiang. In January 2010, the Army's 82nd Airborne conducted a joint patrol with a PAP unit in Haiti after an earthquake. In September 2014, President Obama led a coalition against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. National Security Advisor Susan Rice visited Beijing to discuss China's potential involvement in the coalition against ISIS. Despite no clear response from PRC officials, Xi Jinping did not mention the threat at a summit. The PLAN conducted naval exercises in Iran, and China was not included in the coalition. Additionally, China sentenced Uighur professor Ilham Tohti to life in prison for \"separatism.\" The PLA has assisted in resolving POW/MIA cases, showing cooperation in humanitarian efforts. In 2001, the Defense Department praised PRC's assistance in recovering remains from World War II. However, it took 16 years for the United States to secure PLA's cooperation in accounting for POW/MIAs from the Korean War. Despite improved relations, progress was only announced in 2008. In 1992, a report alleged that American military personnel captured in the Korean War were sent to a camp. American military personnel captured in the Korean War were sent to a camp in Harbin, China for experiments before being executed or dying in captivity. In 1992, the State Department raised the POW/MIAs issue with China, mentioning over 100 American POWs possibly sent to China from the Soviet Union. China denied receiving anyone from the Soviet Union on a list of 125 missing American military personnel from the Korean War. Senator Robert Smith disclosed in 1992 that American POWs captured in the Korean War were sent to China and did not return to North Korea. North Korean officials admitted that China operated POW camps in North Korea and detained Americans in China's northeastern region. Some American POWs may have been sent to the Soviet Union for further interrogations. Smith urged the U.S. government to press China for information on POWs despite China's denials. The Senate created the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs in 1991, chaired by Senator John Kerry, to seek information on POWs. Secretary of Defense Cohen visited China in 1998 to stress cooperation on POW/MIA cases. DPMO sought access to Chinese records on the Korean War in 1999. In 2003, DPMO Director Jerry Jennings visited China to further pursue access to archives. In 2004, China declassified over 10,000 files from 1949 to 1955, excluding wartime records. In 2005, DPMO acknowledged Chinese cooperation on Korean War cases as the \"greatest challenge.\" In 2005, Pentagon officials raised the issue again during a visit to Beijing with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. In October 2005, Pentagon officials raised the issue of accessing China's Korean War archives with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. General Guo Boxiong visited the US in July 2006 and agreed to open PLA archives on the Korean War. However, Secretary Gates reported in June 2007 that PLA cooperation with DPMO was limited despite promises. In February 2008, China agreed to allow access to PLA archives on the Korean War, but direct US access was not granted. The DPMO had to request searches by PRC researchers, with the PLA controlling and turning over acceptable records. In February 2008, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for POW/MIA Affairs Charles Ray signed an initial Memorandum in Shanghai with China, followed by a detailed memorandum in April 2008. Despite previous refusal, China agreed to cooperate for humanitarian reasons. The United States faced challenges in obtaining information on POW camps in North Korea run by the PLA. An agreement was reached for the DPMO to pay the PLA $75,000 semi-annually for research, with annual meetings and progress reports exchanged between the two sides. In mid-2009, the PLA provided initial information to the DOD on U.S. POW/MIAs from the Korean War after receiving $150,000. Progress has been made in cooperation since 2008. General Xu Caihou shared new insights with Defense Secretary Gates about a U.S. aircraft crash site in Guangdong province. The PLA also gave information on five aircraft crash cases in China and North Korea. The PLA Archives Department submitted its second annual report in 2010. The PLA Archives Department provided annual reports to the DOD on U.S. POW/MIAs from the Korean War, with a gap of five months between the first and second reports. The DPMO relied on the PLA's reporting for archival research, with a new technical arrangement signed in 2012 expanding coverage to include World War II, Cold War, and Vietnam War. The PLA submitted fourth and fifth reports, with the fifth report discussing investigations at Korean War sites. The PLA's investigations at Korean War sites involving U.S. aircraft crashes are documented in a record of mil-to-mil contacts, focusing on senior-level visits, strategic talks, exchanges, agreements, and training. The compiled record does not include a detailed list of all contacts, such as confidence-building measures, educational exchanges, disaster relief, and multilateral meetings. Security assistance is not provided due to U.S. sanctions on arms sales since 1989. Sources for this information include official statements, reports to Congress, documents, and news stories.
