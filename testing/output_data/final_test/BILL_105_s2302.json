    "content": "The Act is titled the \"American Indian Tort Liability Insurance Act\" and it pertains to American Indian tort liability insurance. Congress finds that the increasing interaction between tribal governments, tribal corporations, or individual members of Indian tribes with non-tribal individuals may lead to disputes, including claims against tribal entities for injury in tort, as recognized in Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc. (1998). The increasing interaction between tribal governments and non-tribal individuals may lead to disputes, including tort claims against tribal entities. To protect individuals, Indian tribes should maintain tort liability insurance and tribal immunity should not be used to deny claims under that insurance. The terms defined in this section include \"Indian tribe,\" \"Secretary,\" \"tribal immunity,\" and \"tribal organization.\" Additionally, \"tribal priority allocation\" is defined as an allocation to a tribal priority account. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of funds to tribal priority accounts by the Bureau of Indian Affairs for Indian tribes to establish program priorities and funding levels. It also amends Section 1362 of title 28, United States Code, to allow district courts jurisdiction over civil actions against Indian tribes for money damages caused by negligent acts. The curr_chunk discusses waiving tribal immunity for Indian tribes in cases of liability under state law and the requirement for tort liability insurance for tribes receiving funding. The insurance obtained under subparagraph (A) for an Indian tribe shall cover the governing body, tribal organizations, contractors, and employers of the tribe. Coverage becomes effective upon obtaining insurance. If an Indian tribe meets liability insurance requirements determined by the Secretary, additional coverage by the Secretary is not required. Under liability insurance obtained for an Indian tribe, tribal immunity cannot be used to deny claims for damages resulting from tort liability. The Secretary ensures each tribe has sufficient insurance coverage for tort liability. Initial insurance premiums for the tribe are funded as well. The Secretary ensures that Indian tribes have insurance coverage for tort liability. The tribe must make initial payments for insurance premiums, which may be adjusted through tribal priority allocations. Subsequent payments require verification of insurance coverage and premium payments by the tribe. The Secretary requires Indian tribes to have insurance coverage for tort liability. If a tribe fails to make required payments, their tribal priority allocation will be withheld until payments are made. District courts have jurisdiction over actions regarding the tort liability of covered Indian tribes. The Secretary mandates insurance coverage for tort liability of Indian tribes. District courts have jurisdiction over actions, and regulations will establish coverage amounts and premiums. The Secretary mandates insurance coverage for tort liability of Indian tribes under subsection (d)(3) and establishes a means to verify the amount, maintenance, and funding of insurance. Additionally, the Indian Tort Claims Procedure is amended in Part 6 of title 28, United States Code. CHAPTER 171A--INDIAN TORT CLAIMS PROCEDURE In Chapter 171A, the definitions of 'employee of an Indian tribe' and 'Indian tribe' are provided. The term 'employee of an Indian tribe' includes officers, employees, and individuals acting on behalf of the tribe. 'Indian tribe' is defined as per section 4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination Act. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act defines tribal immunity as the immunity of an Indian tribe from court jurisdiction and judicial review. Indian tribes are liable for the actions of their employees in tort claims, similar to private individuals or corporations, but are not liable for interest before judgment or punitive damages. The Indian tribe's liability for punitive damages in cases of death is replaced by liability for actual damages. The maximum liability for an Indian tribe is $500,000 per claim or $1,000,000 for multiple claims arising from the same incident. The Secretary of the Interior can propose legislation to increase these limits if deemed appropriate. Congress proposed legislation to waive tribal immunity for Indian tribes in cases relating to membership controversies, with exceptions and a waiver of tribal immunity as necessary to carry out the chapter. A clerical amendment was made to the table of chapters for title 28, United States Code. Indian Tort Claims Procedure is listed as section 171A with page number 2691."
