    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fairness and Incarceration Responsibility (FAIR) Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. Congress finds that violent criminals often serve only a portion of their sentences, leading to a significant number of serious crimes being committed by released offenders who then travel to other states to commit more violence. This pattern of early release impacts tourism, economic development, and public safety. The Act aims to hold States accountable for releasing violent criminals early, as it can impact various aspects such as tourism, economic development, interstate activities, and the policies of other States. The goal is to ensure that the consequences of releasing violent offenders are borne by the States themselves. SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR VIOLENT OFFENDER INCARCERATION GRANTS. Section 20103(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is amended to require states to implement a law providing victims of violent crimes with a Federal cause of action for the recovery of actual damages. Individual convicted of a crime of violence must have prior conviction for a different crime of violence, be released early from prison, and commit the subsequent crime before the original sentence would have ended. ELIGIBILITY FOR TRUTH-IN-SENTENCING INCENTIVE GRANTS. Section 20104 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is amended to increase the grant award percentage to 100 percent and require states to have a law allowing victims of violent crimes to sue for damages in federal court. The amendment to Section 20104 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 allows for enhanced penalties for individuals convicted of committing a subsequent crime of violence if they had a prior conviction for a different crime of violence, were released early from their sentence, and committed the subsequent crime before the original sentence would have ended. The Act and its amendments will take effect 3 years after enactment."
