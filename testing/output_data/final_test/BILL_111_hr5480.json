    "content": "The Act titled \"Ending Childhood Hunger Challenge Act of 2010\" introduces State Childhood Hunger Challenge Grants under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. The Act \"Ending Childhood Hunger Challenge Act of 2010\" authorizes the Secretary to award grants to States for innovative projects to end childhood hunger by 2015, considering child meal eligibility and food insecurity rates. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a Governor must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. The funds received must be used for a demonstration project to end childhood hunger, including enhancing benefits in Federal child nutrition programs. The Child Nutrition Act of 1966 and the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 aim to increase access to Federal child nutrition programs and improve coordination of resources to eliminate food insecurity. The Secretary will evaluate project applications based on selection criteria determined in consultation with other Secretaries. Applications submitted under subsection (c) must meet publicly disseminated criteria, including a description of the target population at risk of hunger, a commitment to rigorous methodologies, and a comprehensive strategy to reduce childhood hunger or improve food security for households with children. The comprehensive strategy to reduce childhood hunger includes improving the nutritional status of children eligible for free and reduced-price meals, forming partnerships with public and private stakeholders, and giving preference to projects with a 25 percent non-Federal match. The Secretary determines criteria for funding sources, and the Governor must collaborate with key stakeholders for demonstration projects. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for a comprehensive agenda to eliminate childhood hunger, including a collaborative planning process, an annual budget, specific performance goals, and an independent evaluation. Each Governor of a State receiving funding must adhere to these criteria. Each Governor of a State receiving funding must conduct an independent evaluation measuring the impact of activities on food insecurity, particularly among children. The evaluation includes preimplementation baseline and annual measurements using a scientifically valid methodology. The Secretary must report on the impact of the project on participation, food security, nutrition, and behavioral outcomes among children. Rigorous experimental designs, like random assignment, are used to determine effective activities in reducing food insecurity and hunger, especially among children. Reporting is required annually until the evaluation of the project is completed. The Secretary must report on the status and results of demonstration projects funded under this section to relevant committees. Evaluation results must be shared widely to promote successful strategies. Projects funded under this section cannot exceed 5 years in duration. No State may receive funds for more than 1 project under this section. Funds provided to a Governor shall be contingent on project plan implementation and progress towards performance goals. Projects involving the supplemental nutrition assistance program must be fully consistent to be funded. The project must be fully consistent with the requirements of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to be eligible for funding under this section. The Secretary must ensure that the project advances the goal of ending childhood hunger and preserves existing entitlements to nutrition assistance benefits and services. The project funded must align with the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, ensuring it does not restrict eligibility or reduce benefits for individuals, or transfer funding designated for specific programs to others. Funds under this section must align with specific acts such as the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, and the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983. Definitions include a child as a person under 18 and an eligible entity as a public or private not-for-profit agency. The term 'Governor of a State' refers to a Governor or an approved eligible entity. $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2011-2015 for this section."
