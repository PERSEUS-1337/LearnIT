    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act\". Congress finds that carbon monoxide is a deadly gas produced by burning fuel, leading to poisoning and potential death. Unintentional exposure from vehicles and fuel-burning appliances in homes causes over 400 deaths annually. Installing carbon monoxide alarms near sleeping areas can prevent fatalities, and Congress should promote their purchase and installation. Congress should promote the purchase and installation of carbon monoxide alarms in residential homes nationwide to enhance public health and safety. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"approved carbon monoxide alarm\" as a device meeting safety standards, \"carbon monoxide alarm\" as a device detecting the gas, \"Commission\" as the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and \"dwelling unit\" as a living space for humans. The term \"fire code enforcement officials\" refers to officials of a state or local government agency responsible for fire safety code enforcement. The term \"NFPA 720\" refers to the standard for the installation of carbon monoxide warning equipment in dwelling units issued by the National Fire Protection Association in 2008. SEC. 4. ADOPTION OF CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY RULES. The Commission must publish mandatory consumer product safety standards for carbon monoxide alarms and gas detectors within 90 days of this Act's enactment. These standards will take effect 180 days after publication. If these standards are revised, Underwriters Laboratories will notify the Commission for incorporation into the consumer product safety rule within 60 days. The Commission may amend consumer product safety standards for carbon monoxide alarms through rulemaking to ensure safe operation. Standards published by the Commission must be enforced under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Consumer product safety standards, including any revisions, must be enforced under the Consumer Product Safety Act. The Commission will conduct a study within a year to assess the need for additional languages on portable generator labels to warn consumers about carbon monoxide hazards. Additionally, a grant program for carbon monoxide poisoning prevention will be established. The Commission will establish a grant program to assist eligible States and local governments in carrying out carbon monoxide poisoning prevention activities by requiring approved carbon monoxide alarms to be installed in dwelling units according to NFPA 720. The Commission will award grants to States or local governments prioritizing applications that require carbon monoxide alarms in dwelling units with fuel-burning appliances or attached garages, serving vulnerable populations. The grant program prioritizes applications that require carbon monoxide alarms in dwelling units with fuel-burning appliances or attached garages, serving vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, or low-income households. Grant funds can be used to purchase and install approved carbon monoxide alarms in various facilities and train fire code enforcement officials on proper installation and enforcement. The grant program prioritizes applications for carbon monoxide alarms in dwelling units with fuel-burning appliances or attached garages, serving vulnerable populations. Grant funds can be used for training, education on carbon monoxide risks, and alarm use. Limitations on fund use include administrative costs and public outreach expenses. $2,000,000 is authorized for the Commission annually. The Commission is appropriated $2,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2011-2015 to carry out the grant program. Any unspent funds will be retained by the Commission. A report evaluating the grant program must be submitted to Congress each year. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 28, 2010."
