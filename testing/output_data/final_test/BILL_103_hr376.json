The Administrator will conduct a study within a year to review final regulations under the Act, including regulatory alternatives for safety and health benefits. The Administrator, in consultation with the Director of the National Academy of Sciences, will review contaminants listed under section 1412 of the Act for potential revisions based on their impact on human health and associated risk factors. The Administrator, in consultation with the Director of the National Academy of Sciences, will review contaminants listed under section 1412 of the Act for potential revisions based on their impact on human health, compliance deadlines, regulations, and proposed regulations for small public water systems. Upon completion of a study, the Administrator will submit a report to Congress with findings and recommended legislative changes to address funding needs for small communities and States to meet Act requirements. If necessary, regulations will be issued after consultation with States to manage risks associated with drinking water. The Administrator will implement a national primary drinking water regulation to protect human health without regard to subsection (b) if risks associated with drinking water justify immediate action. The Safe Drinking Water Act amends the definition of a public water system to exclude systems that rely only on surface water supplies, serve only seasonal rental residences, and serve 100 or fewer individuals. \"Seasonal\" refers to residences occupied less than 6 months during any calendar year."
