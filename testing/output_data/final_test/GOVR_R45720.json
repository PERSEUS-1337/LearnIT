This collaboration may include liaison, joint operations, basing rights, and training to enhance professionalism. The U.S. Intelligence Community collaborates with foreign intelligence services to expand intelligence coverage using the partner's resources and expertise. The Director of National Intelligence oversees these relationships, which are formalized through agreements. This report explores the history, risks, and benefits of traditional and nontraditional foreign intelligence partnerships with the U.S. The report discusses the risks and benefits of intelligence relationships with foreign partners, reflecting the strategic condition of the U.S. relationship with them. Congress is interested in understanding the nature and scope of these relationships. Congress has expressed confidence and reservations regarding the IC's relations with foreign intelligence services. They intervened to rebalance national intelligence collection with foreign partners when resources were reduced. Congress criticized the IC's ability to independently assess the credibility of foreign intelligence sources, citing the fabricated reporting on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Recently, Congress has shown concern about the vulnerability of foreign intelligence partners' telecommunications technology to penetration by hostile intelligence services. The United States has established intelligence liaison relationships with foreign partners through various means such as information exchange, basing rights, burden sharing, joint operations, and training. These relationships are mostly bilateral, with the United Kingdom being one of the oldest and most prominent partners. Additionally, the US IC also engages in multilateral relationships with NATO member states, Five Eyes partners, and intelligence organizations supporting coalition partners in operational theaters like Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. has developed intelligence partnerships with foreign allies over the past century, stemming from shared challenges like world wars, the Cold War, and counter-terrorism efforts post-9/11. These partnerships are based on trust and professional confidence, with most intelligence sharing occurring with allied countries or U.S. affiliated non-state actors. The U.S. has a long history of intelligence partnerships with foreign allies, based on trust and professional confidence. These partnerships provide benefits such as access to targets, corroboration of sources, and joint assessments. The cooperation dates back to World War I, with the British and French offering training and intelligence exchanges. During World War I, the British and French provided training and intelligence exchanges with the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) under General John Pershing. The United States, with an incipient intelligence capability, forged closer ties with allied governments leading up to World War II. The UK and U.S. navies began sharing naval intelligence in the 1930s, with a formal signals intelligence agreement signed in October 1942. During World War II, the British-U.S. communication intelligence agreement (BRUSA Agreement) established a division of labor for signals intelligence targeting Japanese, German, and Italian targets. This collaboration was crucial for the Allies' information dominance during the war. The UKUSA Agreement of March 1946 solidified U.S. intelligence partnerships with traditional allies, expanding signals intelligence cooperation beyond targeting Axis powers to include any country except the U.S., British Commonwealth, and British Empire. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand were later included as collaborating partners. The UKUSA Agreement of March 1946 expanded U.S. intelligence partnerships with traditional allies, establishing standards for classified information protection. The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was established in 1942 with UK assistance, enabling the U.S. to influence the development of other nations' intelligence agencies. This led to close bilateral partnerships, such as the establishment of the West German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) in 1946. The BND was established in 1946 by former Nazi intelligence head Reinhard Gehlen, who negotiated with the US to create an intelligence organization in postwar Germany. Gehlen leveraged his extensive agent networks and intelligence on the Soviet Union to secure US support for the autonomous German intelligence organization. The Gehlen Organization later became the BND in 1956 and remains a close partner of the US IC. The Mossad, like the Gehlen organization, provided the United States with information on the Soviet Union through its contacts in eastern Europe. The CIA also trained Mossad agents, and US relations with intelligence organizations of Japan, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan were influenced by mutual concern over the Soviet threat. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 led to closer ties between the CIA, Saudi Arabia's GID, and Pakistan's ISI for funding efforts. After the Cold War, former communist countries allied with the Soviet Union became NATO allies and intelligence partners of the United States. There was ambivalence about these new partnerships due to concerns about Russian penetration and intelligence sharing. After the Cold War, former communist countries allied with the Soviet Union became NATO allies and intelligence partners of the United States. In the aftermath of 9/11, the U.S. IC expanded its foreign intelligence liaison relationships as a major component of counterterrorist strategy to protect the U.S. homeland and allied states from terrorist attacks. The CIA has established Counterterrorist Intelligence Centers (CTIC) around the world to share intelligence on terrorism with partners, including nontraditional allies like Kurdish groups and traditional adversaries like Russia. The National Security Agency (NSA) is also involved in these centers to utilize signals intelligence for counterterrorist operations. The U.S. IC has found that nontraditional partners remain loyal to their own interests despite heavy inducement. Each period in the evolution of U.S. intelligence relations with foreign partners has presented challenges from necessary yet incompletely reliable partners. The post-Cold War era has seen efforts to forge or strengthen ties with allies old and new, expanding counterterrorism coverage through intelligence exchanges with nontraditional partners. Policy and authorities govern ties between the IC and foreign intelligence services. The policy and authorities governing ties between the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and foreign intelligence services are outlined in statute, executive orders, and intelligence directives. Intelligence Community Directive (ICD)-403 emphasizes that U.S. intelligence is a national asset to be protected and shared with foreign entities only when consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives. Sharing intelligence with foreign governments is done in accordance with U.S. law, national interest, and specific purposes. ICD-403 outlines the criteria for disclosing U.S. intelligence to foreign entities, considering the recipient's ability to protect classified information. In exceptional cases, intelligence may be shared even if safeguards are inadequate, as long as the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Intelligence Community Policy Guidance 403.1 provides further criteria for sharing classified intelligence with foreign entities. The criteria for disclosing U.S. intelligence to foreign entities are outlined in ICD-403, considering the recipient's ability to protect classified information. Intelligence may be shared if it aligns with U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives, provides benefits to the U.S., supports diplomatic, political, economic, military, or security policies, and aids intelligence or counterintelligence activities. Intelligence sharing agreements are formalized in MOUs between U.S. IC elements and foreign counterparts, but are not legally binding and can pose challenges for congressional oversight. The oversight of intelligence sharing agreements is a concern as elected officials lack visibility. The Department of Defense uses GSOMIA for military exchanges. These agreements provide formal frameworks for intelligence relationships, overseen by the DNI. The Assistant DNI for Partner Engagement (ADNI/PE) supports the DNI in intelligence matters related to national security and clandestine intelligence. Responsibilities include entering into intelligence arrangements with foreign entities, formulating policies, and coordinating intelligence activities among IC elements to further US national security objectives. The Director of the CIA is responsible for implementing the DNI's foreign intelligence engagement policy and coordinating relationships with foreign intelligence and security services, as specified in Executive Order 12333 and ICD-310. Overseas, the U.S. ambassador or Chief of Mission supervises Government executive branch employees in coordinating intelligence activities with foreign governments or organizations. The U.S. ambassador oversees Government executive branch employees and is kept informed about all activities in the country. The CIA Chief of Station manages intelligence programs in the embassy and coordinates with the Director of National Intelligence Representatives. The COS has day-to-day oversight of CIA and liaison activities in foreign countries. The CIA Chief of Station oversees all liaison relationships with foreign intelligence organizations, in accordance with DNI policy and DCI/COS guidance. Each element of the IC has statutory authority to conduct relations with foreign intelligence services based on their capabilities and focus areas. ICD-403 outlines the roles and responsibilities for disclosing classified intelligence to foreign entities. The Senior Foreign Disclosure and Release Authority (SFDRA) in each IC element designates Foreign Disclosure and Release Officer(s) (FDRO) to approve or deny requests for classified intelligence disclosure. The DNI can authorize disclosures requested by the National Security Council or in unique circumstances not covered by policy, and is the final decision-maker in resolving disputes on disclosure. Sensitive aspects of U.S. relations with foreign intelligence partners include the sharing of information on U.S. persons, which requires probable cause for involvement in illicit activities or national security threats. Counterintelligence shared by foreign partners must meet specific criteria for disclosure. The IC must follow guidelines for handling information shared with the United States on U.S. persons to protect privacy and civil liberties. Information is authorized based on standard or special collection techniques, with standard techniques involving routine acquisition of information on U.S. persons. The IC must follow guidelines for handling information on U.S. persons to protect privacy. Standard collection techniques are authorized by officials such as Chief of Station or Deputy Director of the CIA for Operations. Unevaluated bulk data may be obtained from a foreign intelligence service, requiring specific documentation by designated officials. Special collection techniques are defined as techniques conducted outside the United States targeting a U.S. person that would require a warrant for the same techniques conducted by the FBI inside the United States. Authorization and handling of this information is more restricted than for standard collection techniques, requiring exceptional handling as outlined in the Attorney General Guidelines implementing EO 12333. Requests for special collection on U.S. persons by a foreign intelligence service must go through approval by the Director of the CIA, U.S. Attorney General, and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Foreign partners can share intelligence on U.S. persons acquired through special techniques without a specific request, especially in cases of serious counterintelligence concerns targeting mutual adversaries like Russia or China. Exceptional handling is required when sharing information involving U.S. persons collected through special techniques. Foreign intelligence services provide significant intelligence to the United States, as seen in examples like France sharing counterterrorist intelligence post-9/11 and British intelligence offering assistance the day after the attacks. The U.S. IC also benefits from intelligence liaison with traditional adversaries and non-state actors on mutual interests. Intelligence sharing or collaboration is essential for national security. Intelligence sharing involves collaboration between intelligence bodies on national security and defense. Sharing finished intelligence reduces the risk of revealing specific sources. Trust is crucial for exchanging raw data, especially in urgent situations like warning of terrorist attacks. Trusted partners like the U.S., Five Eyes partners, France, Germany, Norway, and Japan engage in intelligence sharing. Intelligence sharing among the United States and its partners involves exchanging perishable information, such as indications of terrorist attacks, through secure channels like secure conferencing and phone calls. Attach\u00e9s from various departments regularly conduct exchanges with host-country counterparts to provide indications and warning of impending threats. Intelligence sharing between partner countries involves sharing proprietary intelligence to warn of impending threats. For example, in 1962, a CIA asset provided crucial information during the Cuban Missile Crisis, altering the course of the Cold War. In 2006, the UK's GCHQ shared intercepted information with the US. In 2010, Saudi Arabia shared intelligence with the US, UK, Germany, and UAE to intercept bombs targeting cargo planes. In 2017, Russia's FSB broke up an Islamic State-linked terrorist plot in St. Petersburg with a tip from the CIA. The Islamic State-linked terrorist cell planned to bomb Kazan Cathedral and other sites in St. Petersburg, Russia. Burden sharing and collaboration between the US, UK, and other allied intelligence services have been successful, with integrated personnel and divisions of effort in signals intelligence target areas. The close integration allows for seamless sharing of intelligence between countries. The United States utilized foreign intelligence partnerships to gather information on areas where they lacked coverage or resources, particularly after the Cold War. This strategy allowed for a second-hand understanding of global issues and supported counterterrorism operations post-9/11. Foreign partnerships are crucial for time-sensitive counterterrorism operations, but there is a risk of over-reliance if not balanced by national intelligence capabilities. Joint operations involve complementary abilities in intelligence collection or covert action between the United States and foreign partners. For example, the British Secret Intelligence Service tapped Soviet communications cables in Austria during the Cold War, with the CIA providing technical expertise to decipher intercepted messages. In 1953, the British lobbied the Eisenhower Administration for a joint covert action operation resulting in the overthrow of the Iranian government. Intelligence relations with foreign partners involve security arrangements and political clearance for establishing intelligence operations. During the Cold War, U.S. partners like Pakistan and Iran (under the Shah) allowed intelligence facilities and reconnaissance flights. The Shah's government in Iran permitted U.S. signals intelligence sites for military aid, aiding in collecting missile telemetry from the Soviet Union. The U.S. had intelligence liaison relationships with France for counterterrorist collaboration, involving the U.S., UK, Canada, Germany, and Australia. The French showed significant cooperation in targeting terrorists outside of Iraq and Afghanistan. U.S. drone facilities in Djibouti, Pakistan, and elsewhere have helped eliminate terrorist threats with support from host-country intelligence services. The CIA drone operations in Pakistan targeted various terrorist groups successfully with support from local intelligence services. Intelligence services have been used as diplomatic back channels to convey important messages to foreign governments, especially in situations where the US lacks diplomatic relations. The CIA has utilized intelligence services as diplomatic back channels to convey messages to foreign governments, including personal communications between the U.S. President and the North Korean leader. Despite risks and obstacles, strong intelligence relationships have endured differences in policy and lapses in security. The United States has faced challenges in intelligence cooperation due to policy differences and security lapses. Training foreign partners' intelligence services can be beneficial but also comes with risks. The CIA has historically established ties with foreign partners through intelligence training, such as with British and French mentors during World War I. Building relationships with German and Israeli intelligence services is cited as examples of strengthening strategic ties. The CIA has a history of reinforcing strategic ties with foreign partners through intelligence training, such as with Iran's Ministry of State Security and Egypt's General Intelligence Directorate. However, establishing close intelligence ties with fragile governments can lead to unforeseen risks, as seen with the Iraqi National Intelligence Service's involvement in Iraq's sectarian conflict and proxy fight between the US and Iran. Iran's involvement in an assassination campaign against the Sunni-dominant INIS in Iraq led to a rivalry with Iraq's Shia-dominant intelligence organization aligned with then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, under Iran's influence. The United States faces challenges in adhering to ethical standards and human rights when partnering with authoritarian regimes for intelligence sharing, especially in times of crisis. Authoritarian regimes can employ extensive population control measures and invasive intelligence collection methods, leading to information superiority and minimal use of force. The lack of control and accountability over foreign intelligence partners can undermine credibility. The U.S. faces criticism for engaging with partners with poor human rights records, leading to vulnerability. The CIA's policy is to refrain from exchanging intelligence with regimes that abuse human rights. The CIA is clear on behaviors it will not tolerate and has cut off relations with partners who abuse human rights. The U.S. IC has used foreign intelligence partnerships for unethical practices, such as black sites. President Bush granted the CIA authority to capture and detain individuals after 9/11. After 9/11, the CIA was authorized to capture and detain individuals who posed a threat to the US. The agency conducted detentions and interrogations at secret black sites using \"enhanced interrogation techniques.\" The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reported ten detention sites abroad, with media sources suggesting more. The Supreme Court ruling in Hamdan vs Rumsfeld ended the use of these techniques and led to the closure of the black sites. The CIA's black sites program, which involved detaining and interrogating individuals using enhanced techniques, ultimately led to embarrassment for the agency and the closure of the sites by 2009. The program also strained relationships with foreign intelligence partners due to sharing uncorroborated information and improper source vetting. Examples from Germany and Jordan highlight the risks of accepting intelligence from partner-controlled, improperly vetted sources, such as the case of Curveball from the German Federal Intelligence Service influencing the 2003 decision to invade Iraq. Lessons learned from this failure have since reduced the risk of similar incidents. Lessons learned from the historic failure to properly vet a foreign intelligence source have reduced the risk of similar incidents. Any intelligence organization can fall victim to accepting unreliable information from a trusted foreign partner. In December 2009, a source controlled by Jordan's General Intelligence Directorate blew himself up at a CIA facility in Afghanistan, killing seven CIA agents. The source, who claimed to have ties to al-Qa'ida, was not fully vetted despite offering to assist in locating al-Qa'ida's senior leadership. The investigation into the attack revealed that the attacker was not properly vetted despite providing verified information to the U.S. and Jordan. CIA Director Leon Panetta determined that information sharing with other intelligence services needed better management. The history of espionage and security breaches in intelligence agencies, including the Cambridge Five scandal in Britain and issues within the U.S. IC, highlight the importance of thorough vetting processes. The U.S. IC has faced problems with espionage and security breaches, with cases like Jonathan Pollard and Robert Kim spying for Israel and South Korea. Concerns have been raised about foreign partners purchasing vulnerable 5G technology, such as the warning against Germany buying from Huawei. The proposed Intelligence Authorization Act of Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019 (S. 245) would require consideration of the vulnerability of foreign telecommunications infrastructure when entering agreements with foreign intelligence services. Policy differences can create obstacles in intelligence sharing with partners who do not share democratic values. Non-Five Eyes allies may face challenges in intelligence sharing due to differences in values and privacy protections compared to the United States. Structured agreements and restrictions on information sharing can lead to limited and general assessments, hindering policy-makers' understanding of security issues. Since the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels in 2015 and 2016, European allies have improved tracking and sharing of air passenger name request (PNR) data with the United States to prevent terrorist attacks. Different values and assumptions can limit intelligence sharing between the United States and foreign partners, as seen in the strategic intelligence relationship with Saudi Arabia. The strategic intelligence relationship with Saudi Arabia was hindered by the Kingdom's slow recognition of terrorism threats and reluctance to cooperate with the United States. Despite citizen support for conflicts linked to the global jihadist movement, Saudi Arabia did not share vital information after the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing. Intelligence relations with foreign entities may not always result in direct reciprocity, with partners leveraging capabilities for benefits in other areas of the bilateral relationship. The United States had a strategic intelligence relationship with Pakistan, which included military assistance. Despite disagreements over support for militant groups, the relationship continued until the Trump Administration suspended security aid in 2018. Pakistan retaliated by ending counterterrorism intelligence cooperation. The Intelligence Community also has relationships with Russia, China, Syria, and Libya for mutual interests. Intelligence partnerships with adversaries like Russia pose risks of exposing U.S. sources and methods, as well as policy differences that can hinder benefits. While partnerships can expand intelligence reach, reliance on partners may be risky. The Intelligence Community's historical reliance on foreign liaison services has hindered its ability to develop its own human intelligence sources, leading to failures in understanding critical events like the overthrow of the Shah in Iran and the lead-up to 9/11. This excessive dependence on secondhand, fragmented information obtained through foreign partners has left the IC vulnerable to gaps in intelligence coverage. The U.S. intelligence community has faced challenges in developing its own human intelligence sources due to its historical reliance on foreign partners. This strategy has led to gaps in intelligence coverage and potential risks, especially in areas where the U.S. lacks its own assets. The benefits and hazards of these foreign intelligence relationships are not well understood or publicly known. The United States weighs the benefits and hazards of its foreign intelligence relationships, with Congress playing a unique oversight role. Congressional oversight of these relationships is challenging due to the passive nature of intelligence sharing and the difficulty in understanding foreign intelligence dynamics. Despite these challenges, these relationships are crucial for supporting U.S. national security objectives, making oversight by Congress essential."
