    "content": "Since 1954, the United States has been a key player in global food aid efforts, providing nearly $2.5 billion annually since 2006. The Food for Peace Act, originally known as Public Law 83-480, governs current U.S. food aid programs, aimed at reducing government stocks of surplus crops while addressing humanitarian and economic development needs. The United States has been involved in global food aid efforts since 1954, providing nearly $2.5 billion annually since 2006. U.S. food assistance goals have shifted towards emergency response and long-term agricultural development post-Cold War. However, the U.S. still relies on domestic purchases of commodities for its food aid programs, unlike other countries that use cash-based assistance. This reliance on in-kind food aid has raised concerns about inefficiencies and market distortions. Delivery of in-kind food aid into foreign countries is subject to requirements that may limit flexibility in responding to food crises. The U.S. food aid program is subject to strict requirements that may limit flexibility in responding to emergency food crises. These requirements include sourcing all agricultural commodities from the U.S., shipping at least 50% on U.S.-flag vessels, allocating a specific amount for non-emergency food aid, and specifying the form of food transfers. Both the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations have sought greater flexibility in the use of U.S. food aid funding. The U.S. food aid program faces limitations in responding to emergencies due to strict requirements. Administrations aim for flexibility in funding to provide cash-based assistance quickly and cater to cultural food preferences during international food crises. NGOs and some Members of Congress support these efforts, while U.S. commodity groups advocate for in-kind transfers. Some NGOs and maritime interests also back in-kind transfers and agricultural cargo preference requirements. The U.S. international food aid program consists of three main sections: a description of current programs, policy issues, and proposed changes. Food aid is provided through various programs by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service and USAID. Different agencies have jurisdiction over authorization, oversight, and appropriations. Average annual spending on U.S. international food aid programs has increased gradually over the past six decades. In recent years, new cash-based outlays have supplemented traditional program spending, pushing total U.S. international food aid program spending up slightly. When adjusted for inflation, total U.S. food assistance outlays peaked in 1964 and declined to a low in 1996 before reaching $2.5 billion in 2014. The Agricultural Act of 1949 permanently authorized the Section 416(b) program, the first large-scale U.S. international food aid program influenced by the Cold War. By the late 1940s, the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation accumulated substantial stocks of wheat and corn for commodity price support programs. The Section 416(b) program was designed to donate surplus government-owned commodities to foreign countries lacking buying power. USDA made surplus commodities available for donation through agreements with various organizations. Initially, donations supplemented food supplies in food deficit countries, but over time, they became a source of U.S. commodities for international food aid programs. The Section 416(b) program allows surplus commodities to be donated or sold for emergency and non-emergency activities. Administered by USDA, the program's utility depends on surplus CCC inventories and changes in federal price support programs. Congressional changes in the 1980s and 1990s affected the program's operation. The Section 416(b) program, inactive since FY2007 due to depleted government-owned grain stocks, allowed surplus commodities to be donated or sold for emergency and non-emergency activities. The Food for Peace Act (FFPA) authorizes U.S. international food assistance, shipping commodities to recipient countries for food distribution programs or monetization. FFPA, established in 1954, is reauthorized in subsequent farm bills with funding from annual agriculture appropriations bills. The Food for Peace Act (FFPA) authorizes U.S. international food assistance through various program areas with different objectives. Title I provides concessional sales of U.S. agricultural commodities for specific non-emergency food security projects, while Title II allows for the donation of commodities for emergency or non-emergency food needs. Title III, administered by USAID, provides government-to-government grants of U.S. agricultural commodities for monetization in least-developed countries. Title V, also administered by USAID, finances non-emergency activities under the Farmer-to-Farmer Program to provide technical assistance to farmers in developing countries. Title I funding has been phased out since the mid-1980s, while Title II has become the largest program for food aid. Since the late 1980s, Title II has become the primary source of funding for U.S. food aid shipments, accounting for 73% of total annual international food aid spending since 2000. The shift from Title I to Title II was influenced by international pressure to monitor and discipline food aid practices to avoid conflicts with trading partners. The United States shifted funding from Title I concessional sales to Title II grants in the mid-1980s. A Food Aid Consultative Group advises the USAID Administrator on food aid policy, established by the 1990 farm bill and reauthorized under subsequent bills. The 2014 farm bill added representatives from the processing sector to the FACG membership. The Food Aid Consultative Group (FACG) advises the USAID Administrator on food aid policy, including quality provisions and regulation handbook changes. Title I of the FFPA allows for sales of U.S. agricultural commodities on concessional credit terms to developing countries and private entities for monetization. Loan agreements under Title I may have repayment terms of up to 30 years with a grace period of up to 5 years. Title I of the FFPA allows for sales of U.S. agricultural commodities on concessional credit terms to developing countries and private entities for monetization. The local currency derived from such sales supports non-emergency food security and development projects. Title II provides for the donation of U.S. agricultural commodities to IOs and NGOs for emergency or non-emergency food needs. Funding for Title II programs is discretionary and subject to annual appropriations. Title II funding under the FFPA is discretionary and determined by annual appropriations bills. Funding averaged $1.9 billion annually over the 2008 farm bill period but decreased each year. In FY2014, $1.324 billion was spent on Title II activities. Emergency food aid has surpassed non-emergency aid since 2002, highlighting the divide in the use of U.S. international food aid. USAID targets emergency food aid to vulnerable populations. USAID provides emergency food aid to vulnerable populations in response to various crises through recipient governments, public or private agencies, and the WFP. Non-emergency food assistance involves multi-year development programs targeting chronically food-insecure populations, including monetization and direct distribution of food aid. Title II food aid is subject to annual appropriations and has decreased in funding over the years. The 2014 farm bill authorized up to $17 million annually for monitoring and assessment of non-emergency food aid programs. It also required USAID to prepare an annual report for Congress on fund allocation and usage by eligible organizations, with a focus on the rate of return on aid funds. Projects with rates of return below 70% are to be scrutinized, and $10 million was authorized for shelf-stable prepackaged foods. The 2014 farm bill increased funding for pre-positioning of non-perishable foods to $15 million annually, allowing USAID discretion in establishing additional sites based on assessments of need, technology, feasibility, and cost. This enables rapid response to emergency food aid needs both domestically and internationally. USAID pre-positions food aid to respond quickly to emergencies. PVOs and IOs submit proposals for Title II programs. Once approved, commodities are ordered for delivery. Eligible U.S. agricultural commodities are provided for selection based on local assessments of markets and needs. Partners identify commodities needed based on local assessments and schedule delivery. USDA procures commodities through open market tenders. Implementing partners arrange shipment from U.S. ports to recipient countries. In emergencies, USAID can access prepositioned food supplies. The 2014 farm bill emphasizes improving nutritional quality of food aid products. Title III of the FFPA allows for government-to-government grants of U.S. commodities to support long-term economic development in least developed countries. Implementing partners can monetize donated commodities to fund programs promoting economic development, food security, and infrastructure. Title IV created the Farmer-to-Farmer program, first funded in 1985. No funding request has been made for Title III activities since FY2002. The Farmer-to-Farmer program, funded by the 1985 farm bill, provides technical assistance to farmers in developing countries. Funding levels were increased in the 1990 farm bill and reauthorized in subsequent bills, including the 2014 farm bill which assigned minimum funding. The program does not provide commodity food aid but mobilizes volunteers to offer expertise. The Food for Progress program, authorized by the 1985 farm bill, is administered by USDA's FAS. It involves multi-year agreements with various organizations to monetize donated U.S. commodities in support of developing countries and emerging democracies. Qualifying countries must commit to agricultural policy reforms that incorporate free enterprise elements. Program activities focus on private sector development of agricultural infrastructure. The Food for Progress program, administered by USDA's FAS, supports developing countries and emerging democracies through practices like farmer training and agribusiness development. USDA purchases commodities from the U.S. market and ships them to recipient countries using CCC financing. The program requires a minimum of 400,000 metric tons of commodities annually, but actual purchases have averaged 212,600 metric tons since 2010. The program is limited to $40 million annually for freight costs. The Food for Progress program, administered by USDA's FAS, supports developing countries through farmer training and agribusiness development. The program is limited to $40 million annually for freight costs. In FY2014, programs involving 195,900 mt of U.S. commodities valued at $127.5 million were targeted through implementing partners in 10 developing countries. For FY2016, USDA announced eight international projects valued at $153.2 million under the McGovern-Dole IFECN program. The Food for Progress program, authorized through the 2014 farm bill, provides commodities to foreign countries with critical food needs. USDA partners with qualifying organizations to distribute commodities for direct feeding or local sale to support nutrition projects. Priority countries must show a need for improving domestic nutrition, literacy, and food security. In FY2014, the program provided 78,860 mt of commodities to 2.5 million beneficiaries in 9 developing countries. The LRP program, valued at $164.8 million, benefits 2.5 million beneficiaries in 9 developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Administered by USDA or USAID, cash grants are awarded to eligible organizations to purchase commodities in response to food crises. Authorized by the 2008 farm bill, the LRP Pilot Project was made permanent in 2014 with annual funding levels set at $80 million. The LRP program, initially funded by Congress, has faced challenges with annual appropriations. In response to emergencies, USAID received funding for LRP activities, which have been supported by EFSP funds since 2010. The LRP program aims to expedite food aid provision to vulnerable populations affected by crises and disasters by purchasing locally. This approach allows for quicker delivery and cost savings, but potential limitations include availability of staff and regional supplies. Activities must not significantly increase commodity costs for low-income consumers. USDA and USAID require commitments from eligible organizations to prevent restrictions. The USDA and USAID require commitments from eligible organizations to prevent the resale or misuse of eligible commodities procured for food aid. USDA may prioritize organizations involved in the McGovern-Dole IFECN program for LRP projects. The 2014 farm bill mandates USDA to report annually to Congress on LRP projects' implementation, costs, and impacts. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT) is a reserve of U.S. commodities or cash authorized under the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act of 1998, not a food aid program but a reserve of commodities or funds owned by the CCC. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT) is a reserve of commodities or funds owned by the CCC for use in FFPA programs to meet humanitarian food aid needs in developing countries. It replaced the Food Security Commodity Reserve and is administered under the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture. Reimbursement for released commodities can come from FFPA appropriations or direct appropriations. Since 1980, wheat has been the only commodity held in reserve by the CCC for ocean freight and related non-commodity costs. In 2008, USDA sold the remaining wheat in the trust and now holds only cash, which can be used for emergency food needs when FFPA Title II funds are unavailable. The BEHT was last used in FY2014 to purchase U.S. agricultural commodities for South Sudan. The Emergency Food Security Program (EFSP) provides grants for rapid response to emergency food security needs. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizes disaster assistance like EFSP, initiated by USAID in FY2010. EFSP was permanently authorized in 2016 under the Global Food Security Act, with funding of $2.79 billion for FY2017 and FY2018. USAID used IDA funds to finance EFSP activities, awarding $3.3 million in grants for cash-based food assistance from FY2010 to FY2015, mainly to Syria. Implementing partners include U.S. and foreign NGOs, cooperatives, and IOs. EFSP is used by USAID for emergency food security assistance when U.S.-purchased food aid is not timely or suitable due to local market conditions. The three main forms of assistance are local and regional procurement (40%), food vouchers (26%), and cash transfers (14%). Local and Regional Procurement involves purchasing food within or near the affected country, while cash transfers provide funds directly to those in need. Cash transfers involve distributing cash to disaster-affected people for purchasing essential food items. This can be done through physical or electronic transfers. Cash transfers are effective when the recipient population is widely spread out, during acute food crises, or for indigent populations. Food vouchers are provided by local vendors through paper or electronic coupons, which can be redeemed for payment from USAID. Food vouchers are useful for reaching populations in high-security risk areas. In emergencies, USAID can access up to 100,000 metric tons of prepositioned food in warehouses at U.S. Gulf ports and overseas sites to expedite response. USDA's CCC finances storage and distribution costs for commodities, including pre-positioned ones. USDA's Farm Service Agency serves as the buying agent for U.S. food aid programs, issuing tenders to sellers and freight providers for commodity delivery. The USDA's CCC finances storage and distribution costs for commodities, including pre-positioned ones, and transportation costs. USAID provides support for administrative costs to implementing partners through internal transportation, shipping, and handling funds and funding available through \u00a7202(e) of the FFPA. The 2014 farm bill expanded the portion of Title II \u00a7202(e) funds allocated to foreign program support and allowed for greater flexibility in the nature of that support. The Bellmon requirements, included in the FFPA, prohibit the use of U.S. commodities for food assistance under specific conditions to prevent spoilage or interference with domestic production. Cooperating sponsors must conduct a Bellmon analysis to ensure food aid monetization does not interfere with existing in-country conditions. The FFPA requires recipients of U.S. commodities to publicize that they are provided by the American people. USAID selects international freight shipping providers through a competitive process, with 50% of U.S. agricultural commodities financed under food aid programs required to ship via U.S. carriers. In November 1985, an amendment prohibited the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for activities that would encourage the export of agricultural commodities from developing countries competing with U.S. products. This followed USAID Policy Determination 71 in 1978, which required review of projects involving certain exports. Following the Bumpers Amendment, USAID issued Policy Determinations 15 in 1986, stating that they avoid supporting the production of agricultural commodities for export by developing countries that compete with similar U.S. exports. Exceptions include food-security activities, research benefiting U.S. producers, activities in indigent countries, and those recovering from conflict or crisis. Arguments for and against in-kind food aid versus cash-based assistance, along with related issues like agricultural cargo preference and monetization of non-emergency food aid, are discussed. Donors can provide international food assistance in two primary forms: in-kind, as commodities purchased in the donor country and shipped to a foreign country, or as cash transferred directly to the foreign country. Despite some growth in cash-based assistance, the United States primarily relies on in-kind transfers of domestically purchased commodities for international food aid. This is known as \"food aid tying\" and involves programs like FFPA Titles I, II, and III, the Food for Progress program, and the McGovern-Dole IFECN programs. The United States primarily relies on in-kind transfers of domestically purchased commodities for international food aid, representing 92% of the value of U.S. food aid during FY2006 to FY2013. Cash-based food assistance programs like local and regional procurement, food vouchers, and direct cash transfers have been used as alternatives. There has been ongoing debate on whether U.S. international food aid should be provided in the form of in-kind commodities or cash-based assistance. In the past decade, studies and reports have shown economic inefficiencies and market distortions with in-kind food aid compared to cash-based assistance. Questions have arisen about the best form of humanitarian aid in emergencies and the balance between in-kind and cash-based assistance. Cash-based food assistance has been used before, with the U.S. government providing $220 million in cash contributions to the WFP from 2001 to 2008. The U.S. government provided $220 million in cash contributions to the WFP for purchasing foreign-grown commodities. Cash and voucher programs of WFP significantly increased from $139 million to $1.37 billion in 2014, mainly due to the civil war in Syria. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami led to a shift towards cash-based food assistance, allowing for rapid and large-scale aid distribution. This success reinforced Europe's commitment to cash-based food assistance. Europe's commitment to cash-based food assistance has influenced Canada's international food aid policy. Major donor countries like Australia, Canada, and the European Union have shifted to cash-based aid for emergency response. Some countries, like Saudi Arabia and Norway, have always used cash-based assistance. The United States has also started providing food assistance in the form of cash or vouchers. Various organizations and trade partners advocate for transitioning to a cash-based system of food assistance. The USDA developed a successful LRP pilot project with $60 million in funding, which led to cost savings and improved food aid delivery. The 2014 farm bill made the pilot project a permanent LRP program with $80 million in annual funding, but it remains unfunded and unused. The program aims to address concerns about food quality, market disruption, and supply assurance. The 2014 farm bill amended food aid law to allow for more flexibility in using FFPA 202(e) funds, including cash-based assistance in recipient countries with existing Title II programs. Cash-based assistance through EFSP has been used since 2010, providing quicker food acquisitions and reaching difficult-to-access areas. Interventions like cash-based food assistance have proven crucial in responding to complex emergencies in Syria and the Philippines. Cash-based aid offers advantages over in-kind food aid, such as faster delivery times and lower costs. Research shows that cash-based assistance can reach people in need 11 to 14 weeks faster than traditional food shipments. In a 2001 report, GAO found that USAID's average cost recovery per taxpayer dollar expended on monetized in-kind food aid was 76%, while USDA's was 58%. Both USDA and USAID have proposed using Title II funds to purchase commodities near emergencies to lower delivery costs. Ocean freight rate fluctuations make it challenging for USDA and USAID to plan annual programming. A 2009 study by GAO showed that food aid obtained by the U.N.'s WFP using LRP reduced costs and improved delivery timeliness. WFP using LRP significantly reduced costs and improved delivery timeliness compared to USAID's food aid purchased and shipped from the United States. LRP was 34% less costly in sub-Saharan Africa and 29% in Asia, with over 100 days saved in aid delivery time for many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. USAID estimated that almost half of its food aid allocations in FY2006 went to transportation costs. In-kind food aid can disrupt local agricultural markets, leading to black market activity and price distortions. In-kind food aid can disrupt local agricultural markets in recipient countries, potentially violating international trade agreements. Local procurement of food aid can support local marketing channels, farmers, and align with local food preferences. Food vouchers and cash transfers offer flexibility in distribution, especially in rapid response situations or when recipients are widely dispersed. Cash transfers are useful for rapid responses, when people are spread out or security concerns exist. However, there are risks with cash-based food assistance, such as inducing inflation or not meeting nutritional needs in food-deficit regions. Local foods may not be adequate for vulnerable recipients, requiring importation of fortified foods. Limitations include availability of trained staff and regional market supplies. Concerns about cash-based assistance include potential misuse of funds for non-food items and undermining support for traditional in-kind donations. Local or regional procurement for food aid may lead to price spikes, affecting access to supplies. Reliability and quality of food supplies for local procurement programs are also questioned. Ocean transport for U.S. government-impelled cargoes, including food aid shipments, is permanently authorized. The Cargo Preference Act of 1954 requires 50% of U.S. food aid shipments to be on U.S.-flag vessels, leading to higher costs due to regulations and labor requirements. This is to maintain a viable U.S. merchant fleet with military-readiness capability. The Cargo Preference Act of 1954 mandates that 50% of U.S. food aid must ship on U.S. registered vessels, which must be privately owned, U.S.-flagged commercial vessels with a crew of at least 75% U.S. citizens. An amendment in the 1985 farm bill increased the cargo preference share to 75% and required reimbursement for excess ocean freight costs on U.S.-flag vessels. MARAD enforces ACP compliance. In 2012, the cargo preference share was reduced from 75% to 50% in the surface transportation reauthorization act (MAP-21, P.L. 112-141). The 2012 act also eliminated the reimbursement requirement for excess ocean freight costs on U.S.-flag vessels. The repeal of this provision was estimated to save $108 million annually or $540 million over the period FY2013-FY2017. In 2013, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 repealed the requirement for MARAD to reimburse USDA for excess freight costs on U.S.-flag vessels, saving about $75 million. The repeal of the cargo preference share reduction in the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 aimed to save $75 million annually. This provision would have reinstated the requirement for 75% of U.S. food aid to be shipped on U.S.-flag vessels, supporting the U.S.-flag merchant marine's essential sealift capability in wartime or emergencies. USA Maritime, representing shipper and maritime unions, argues that cargo preference for U.S. food aid exports helps maintain a strong merchant marine and supports economic activity. Critics claim that the preference increases shipping costs, reducing the volume of food aid provided. They also argue that preference requirements may delay food aid arrival compared to a competitive bidding process. Monetization involves selling U.S.-donated food aid commodities in recipient countries' local markets. Critics argue that cargo preference requirements for U.S. food aid exports increase shipping costs, reduce aid volume, and may delay arrival compared to competitive bidding processes. Monetization involves selling U.S.-donated food aid commodities in recipient countries' local markets through implementing partners like PVOs and cooperatives. It accounts for 60% of non-emergency food aid and is used to fund various development projects. Monetization of U.S. international food assistance involves large-volume sales, with targeted monetization being less common due to higher costs. Many view monetization as an inefficient cash transfer method, with a shift towards using in-kind commodities to generate cash for food security programs. The 1985 farm bill authorized monetization of food aid by PVOs and cooperatives to generate development funds. This included using at least 15% of FFPA Title II non-emergency food aid for monetization. Additionally, the bill required monetization for at least 5% of commodities distributed under Title II programs. Monetized funds could finance internal transportation, storage, or distribution of commodities. The bill also established the Food for Progress program, funded entirely by monetized food aid, for PVOs, cooperatives, IOs, and recipient-country governments. The 1990 farm bill expanded the use of FFPA Title II monetization funds for food-security-related projects, requiring at least 10% of non-emergency funds to be monetized. Subsequent bills increased this requirement to 15% and extended monetization to include the McGovern-Dole IFECN program. The Bellmon Amendment in the 1977 farm bill mandated a Bellmon analysis to ensure monetization does not hinder domestic production in recipient countries. Initially, CCC-owned commodities were used for food aid monetization. The Food for Peace Act of 1966 authorized the use of purchased commodities in the program, allowing the government to switch to buying commodities from the U.S. commercial market for monetization. USAID aimed for an 80% cost recovery but the 2002 farm bill eliminated this goal, requiring a \"reasonable market price\" for sales instead. Critics argue that monetization is inefficient in converting taxpayer dollars into development funding. Critics argue that monetization, converting taxpayer dollars into commodities for foreign markets, is inefficient and economically inefficient due to high costs involved in shipping and transactions. Studies show that switching to a cash-based approach can result in savings of 25% to 50%. Critics argue that monetization of food aid is inefficient and can distort markets by depressing prices and increasing volatility. This can discourage local producers and reinforce dependency on imported food assistance. Monetization may also impede commercial activity from other trading partners and exporters. Monetization of food aid can inject price volatility into markets, discouraging investment in the agricultural sector and making budget planning difficult. Despite legislation requiring assessments of food aid impact on local markets, USAID and USDA struggle to prevent adverse effects due to high monetization volumes and weak market assessments. Advocates argue that monetization can help meet long-term development needs in food-insecure countries. The Alliance for Global Food Security, consisting of 9 PVOs, supports monetization of food aid to address market constraints and increase commodity availability in recipient countries. Monetization in small volumes can benefit smaller traders, promote competition, and combat price volatility. CARE International announced in 2006 that it would stop monetization of food aid due to its inefficiency, high costs, and negative impact on local markets and food security objectives. Catholic Relief Services also opposes monetization of food aid but continues to use it as a last resort, aiming to replace it with cash funding. Most U.S. food aid consists of unfortified grains and legumes, with 25% in fortified blended foods. Advances in food science have improved the delivery of food aid. Advances in food science, including new formulations and products, have improved the capacity of food aid providers to deliver more nutritious foods to target groups. Concerns raised in 2011 about the nutritional quality and safety of U.S. food aid programs highlighted the need for greater attention to the nutritional content of food aid, especially in light of reduced budgets and high food prices. Delivery of more nutritional products to food aid recipients faces challenges due to the higher cost of specialized food products compared to general distribution feeding programs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that specialized food aid products, such as fortified blended foods (FBFs), are more expensive than general distribution feeding programs. The cost of a daily ration of FBFs ranges from $0.06 to $0.12, compared to $0.02 to $0.09 for traditional rations. However, U.S. food aid agencies struggle to effectively target these specialized products to those in need, leading to a recommendation for better guidance and evaluation by USAID and USDA. The Tufts report recommended that USAID should adopt new specifications for fortified blended foods (FBFs) and explore the use of new lipid-based products. The 2014 farm bill requires USAID to assess types and quality of agricultural commodities donated as food aid, adjust products to meet nutrient needs, test prototypes, and develop new program guidance for eligible organizations. The 2014 farm bill requires USAID to develop new program guidance for eligible organizations to improve matching of products to purposes, address nutritional efficiencies among long-term recipients of food aid, and evaluate the performance and cost-effectiveness of new food products and program approaches for vulnerable groups. Managers expect USAID to set verifiable goals, maximize public-private partnerships with food manufacturers, and establish multi-year procurement approaches for high-value products. The managers expect USDA and USAID to adopt clear guidelines for swift adoption of new products to capture research benefits. The U.S. primarily relies on in-kind food donations, while other donors have shifted to cash-based donations, causing concerns from international trade partners. The United States uses international food donations as part of a domestic supply-management, price-support policy, potentially supporting domestic prices and implementing an implicit export subsidy program. Other export nations are skeptical of U.S. food aid, contending that it interferes with commercial market activity and violates international trade agreements. In the 1950s, the U.S., Canada, and Europe donated or sold agricultural surpluses at subsidized prices to developing countries, acting as a de facto export subsidy. The international structure to harmonize food aid with international trade was established in response to concerns about the United States using food aid as an export subsidy. The Consultative Subcommittee on Surplus Disposal (CSSD) was created within the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) in 1954 to monitor the use of surplus disposal as food aid. This structure also included the World Food Programme (WFP), the Food Aid Convention (FAC), and multilateral trade negotiations that led to the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its legal texts governing international trade. The Consultative Subcommittee on Surplus Disposal (CSSD) established international guidelines for food aid to prevent it from being used as an export subsidy. The CSSD's Principles of Surplus Disposal and UMR concept aimed to ensure food aid was additional to commercial trade. However, these recommendations were non-binding and lacked enforcement. The World Food Programme (WFP) was created in 1961 to distribute food aid and is governed by an executive board with U.S. leadership. The World Food Programme (WFP) was established in 1961 with U.S. leadership. It has a staff of about 11,500 for distributing food aid. In 1967, major food aid donors created the FAC to ensure predictable and timely aid. The FAC is a treaty with legal obligations but lacks enforcement provisions. The Agreement on Agriculture of the WTO, resulting from the Uruguay Round in 1994, governs domestic support, market access, and export competition in the agricultural sector. Article 10 outlines rules for preventing circumvention of export subsidy commitments, including provisions for international food aid donors to ensure aid is not tied to commercial exports and is in accordance with FAO principles. The Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations in 2000 aimed to build on the achievements of the Uruguay Round in agricultural trade, focusing on limitations on domestic support, expanded market access, and controls on export competition. Food aid was a key issue, with the US favoring tied food aid programs and the EU proposing untied food aid while also considering eliminating direct subsidies for agricultural exports. The Ministerial Declaration in Hong Kong in 2005 aimed to discipline all forms of export subsidies, including food aid, to eliminate commercial displacement. The Doha Round produced a working text for future trade rules, proposing stricter regulations on international food aid, with a focus on untied cash-based aid. The United States has been a leader in global agricultural trade and trade negotiations for transparent standards in international commerce. The United States commits to international trade standards in the Food for Peace Act, ensuring food aid is based on need and benefits recipients without disrupting local markets. The United States aims to increase its food assistance to developing countries in line with the Agreement on Agriculture. There is a debate over how Title II funds should be used, with Administrations seeking flexibility for cash-based food assistance in crises, while Congress prefers purchasing U.S. commodities for distribution. The United States aims to increase food assistance to developing countries in line with the Agreement on Agriculture. There is a debate over how Title II funds should be used, with concerns about the close relationship between agriculture committees and vested interests in maintaining the status quo. Proposals have been made to shift authority over food aid programs to the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Both the previous and current Administrations have proposed changes to U.S. international food assistance, including modifications to FFPA Title II resources. Some Members of Congress have introduced bills proposing alterations to U.S. food aid programs, such as shifting select food aid authorities and eliminating certain requirements. The Bush Administration proposed using up to 25% of annual Title II funds for local food procurement in developing countries during emergencies to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness of U.S. food aid response. Local and regional purchases would only be made when speed is crucial, with U.S. grown food remaining the primary choice for meeting global needs. The Obama Administration proposed changes to U.S. international food assistance in its FY2014 budget request, including shifting funds from FFPA to USAID accounts, eliminating monetization, providing flexibility in procurement, and reducing cargo preference legislation. The Administration proposed reallocating funding from FFPA to USAID accounts in its FY2014 budget request. This includes shifting $1.1 billion to IDA for emergency food response, $250 million to DA for a Community Development and Resilience Fund, and $75 million to EFAC. Total funding for these programs would be $1.4 billion, $330 million, and $75 million respectively. The Administration proposed reallocating funding from FFPA to USAID accounts in its FY2014 budget request, including shifting $75 million to EFAC for emergency food assistance. USAID stated that the type of food assistance intervention depends on program goals, cost, and factors like food insecurity causes and local diet preferences. The proposed shifts aim to increase flexibility, timeliness, and efficiency in providing emergency food aid, reaching 2-4 million more people annually with equivalent funding. The proposed food aid reform includes options for local or regional procurement, cash-based assistance, and engagement with PVOs. USAID aims to allocate $330 million for emergency food assistance, ensuring at least 55% of the $1.4 billion requested for FY2014 is used for procurement and related costs of U.S. commodities. U.S. commodities will still play a significant role in purchases, especially for processed foods and bulk commodities. The Administration's food aid proposal includes $25 million in \"efficiency savings\" for the Maritime Security Program (MSP) to offset reduced U.S. food aid shipments. Critics of the proposal, including the Alliance for Global Food Security and the U.S. maritime sector, expressed concerns about increasing direct subsidies to the maritime sector. The Alliance, along with other supporters of the current food aid program, urged the President to continue the FFPA and other U.S. food aid programs in their current form. They recommended maintaining in-kind shipments and monetization, while also agreeing to use IDA funds for LRP or cash-based assistance as needed. Monetization was seen as beneficial for increasing economic activity and alleviating constraints on food supplies procurement. The Alliance recommended using USAID's Development Assistance funds to support FFPA Title II programs where monetization is not feasible. USA Maritime opposed changing food aid programs to cash-based, citing potential loss of support network. The 2014 farm bill made modest changes to international food assistance, but did not adopt broader FY2014 proposals. President's FY2015 budget requested up to 25% of Title II funding for cash-based interventions. USAID claimed cost savings and improved timeliness. The Administration proposed shifting Title II funds from shipping U.S. commodities to cash-based assistance to reach an additional 2 million people. The FY2015 budget requested up to 25% of Title II funding for cash-based interventions and an increase in annual MSP funds. Congress did not include these proposals in the FY2015 appropriations. The FY2016 budget repeated the proposed changes to U.S. international food aid. Title II funding will be available for cash-based interventions and annual MSP funds will increase by $25 million to offset reduced shipping for smaller U.S. food aid shipments. The Administration's FY2017 budget requested $1.35 billion in Title II funding, with 25% exempt for cash-based food assistance. Both House and Senate bills propose larger funding amounts for FY2017, but without the in-kind purchase exemption. Congressional jurisdiction issues were raised by the Administration's FY2014 food aid proposal. The authorizing legislation for food aid programs is currently under the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee in the Senate and the Agriculture Committee in the House. Appropriations jurisdiction lies with the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. There is a proposal to shift food aid funding to programs authorized in foreign assistance legislation, potentially changing the responsibility for appropriations to the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittees and authorizing legislation to the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Two bills were introduced during the 113th Congress to change U.S. international food aid programs (H.R. 1983 and S. 2421), but no action was taken. During the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to change U.S. food aid programs, but no action was taken. A bill introduced by Representative Royce and Ranking Member Bass aimed to alter food aid programs by eliminating monetization and the U.S.-only commodity purchase requirement. The bill would have transferred authority to the Foreign Assistance Act, allowing USAID greater flexibility in responding to foreign emergency situations. Additionally, the bill would have exempted FFPA Title II food assistance from cargo preference requirements. During the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to change U.S. food aid programs, but no action was taken. In June 2014, a bill proposed by Senators Corker and Coons aimed to eliminate monetization, cargo preference requirements related to FFPA food assistance, and the U.S.-only commodity purchase requirement. The bill sought to transfer Title II program authority to the Foreign Assistance Act, allocate 20-30% of funds for non-emergency assistance, and recognize the critical role of the Merchant Marines. The 113th Congress did not act on the bill. In February 2015, Senators Corker and Coons reintroduced the bill in the 114th Congress as S. 525. S. 525, reintroduced in the 114th Congress by Senators Corker and Coons, proposes changes to U.S. food aid programs. It aims to eliminate monetization, cargo preference requirements, and the U.S.-only commodity purchase requirement for FFPA Title II program activity. The bill allows for both in-kind and cash-based assistance, transferring program authority to the Foreign Assistance Act and USAID. S. 525 proposes changes to U.S. food aid programs, including lowering annual appropriations by $100,000 to $2.4 billion per fiscal year. The bill aims to increase efficiency in aid delivery, potentially reaching an additional 8-12 million people. It also retains a 20-30% allocation for non-emergency assistance and recognizes the critical role of the Merchant Marines in U.S. defense capability. The Global Food Security Act (GFSA) codifies the Feed the Future program into the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The program aims to reduce hunger, malnutrition, poverty, and food insecurity in developing countries. The GFSA allows flexibility in shipping U.S.-sourced commodities under FFPA Title II on cost-effective vessels, regardless of registry. The Global Food Security Act (GFSA) integrates existing U.S. agricultural development policies into a unified framework, continuing the Feed the Future program's global food security initiative. It directs the President to develop a Global Food Security Strategy (GFSS) by October 1, 2016, coordinating efforts of relevant federal departments and agencies. The GFSA grants coordinating authority to the President for the GFSS and includes provisions for in-kind food aid programs and other food-security-related programs. The Global Food Security Act (GFSA) authorizes appropriations for various food assistance programs under USDA, excluding them from the authority of the Global Food Security Strategy (GFSS). The GFSA also permanently authorizes the Emergency Food Security Program (EFSP) and allocates funds for FY2017 and FY2018 for State Department and USAID related programs. The Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961 authorized nearly $2.8 billion for humanitarian assistance under EFSP for FY2017 and FY2018."
