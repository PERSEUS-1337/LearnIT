    "content": "The Trump Administration has taken actions to revive the U.S. coal industry by rolling back Obama-era regulations. This includes repealing the coal valuation rule to potentially make coal production more profitable. Coal remains important in the U.S. energy supply, but the extent of its role is uncertain. Congressional action in the 115th Congress is also focused on coal-related rules. In the 115th Congress, legislative focus has been on assisting distressed coal communities and coal miner health benefits, as well as proposing coal leasing reform and preventing new coal projects. The U.S. has abundant coal and natural gas resources, but renewable energy costs are declining, leading to potential long-term growth in renewable energy capacity. Coal production in the U.S. has been declining due to competition from natural gas and global concerns over environmental impacts. The industry is facing challenges in penetrating overseas markets and transitioning to cleaner alternatives. Job losses in coal communities are a significant concern, prompting the need for new employment opportunities. Some emerging countries rely on coal for electricity, while developed countries like Canada and Europe shift towards renewable energy. China, the largest coal consumer, aims for a balanced energy strategy due to environmental concerns. U.S. coal operators must comply with various regulations, sparking debates on coal's role in energy needs. The future of domestic coal production remains uncertain. The future of domestic coal production in the U.S. is uncertain, with challenges such as volatile coal prices, regulatory frameworks, and competition from low-cost natural gas supplies. The industry faces financial health concerns and struggles to compete in the global export market. The future of domestic coal production in the U.S. is uncertain due to challenges like volatile prices, regulations, and competition from natural gas. The industry also faces financial health concerns and struggles in the global export market. The health, safety, and labor union issues associated with coal mining are significant. Appendices provide additional information on coal production, company profiles, and related CRS reports. The United States has the largest coal reserves. The United States has the largest coal reserves in the world, with about 255 billion short tons of recoverable domestic coal reserves. More than half of U.S. coal reserves are located in the West, with Montana and Wyoming accounting for 43% of total reserves. The top five producing states hold about 70% of U.S. coal reserves, with the U.S. government owning one-third of domestic coal reserves. The top three reserve owners in the U.S. coal industry account for about 44% of coal reserves. Coal production in the U.S. peaked in 2008 at 1.17 billion short tons before declining sharply in 2015 and 2016. Current data and projections suggest production will remain below 800 million tons in 2017 and 2018. The future looks bleak for U.S. coal mining, especially for underground eastern coal, as lower-cost Powder River Basin coal continues to dominate and Interior Region coal gains traction. Western coal production has increased from 53% in 2000 to 61% in 2015 and is expected to maintain its share. Coal production in the U.S. is expected to remain dominant, with Western coal increasing its share from 53% in 2000 to 61% in 2015. The Interior Region is projected to increase its production from 18% in 2015 to 28% by 2050. Long-term projections show a decline in coal production below 600 million short tons per year with the implementation of the Clean Power Plan. Labor productivity in coal mining has significantly improved over the years, with a doubling of production per employee hour from 1985 to 2000. Labor productivity in coal mining has more than doubled from 2.74 average production per employee hour in 1985 to 7.02 in 2000, especially in Western coal mines. Despite short-term gains in employment, the coal industry is not expected to reverse these production trends. Coal mining employment declined significantly from 1985 to 2015, with a similar pattern seen in the number of coal mines. The number of coal mines in the United States declined dramatically, with a decrease in coal mining firms as well. The average mine size and output per mine have increased. Employment losses in underground and surface mining operations were similar from 2010 to 2015. Coal consumption peaked in 2007 but fell below 900 million short tons in 2012. The EIA projects a decline in U.S. coal consumption, with levels expected to drop close to 500 million short tons in the long term. Factors contributing to this decline include societal concern for cleaner air, low natural gas prices, and advanced drilling techniques. Electric power generation remains the primary market for coal, accounting for about 93% of total consumption. The U.S. coal consumption is projected to decline, with electric power generation being the primary market for coal. Coal's share of the electricity generation market has decreased to 32%, with natural gas surpassing it in 2016. The EIA predicts renewables will capture 28% of the market by 2050. The coal industry is projected to decline in the U.S., with coal's market share falling to less than 20% by the end of the forecast period. Natural gas and renewable energy, particularly for power generation, are expected to replace coal. While coal prices may rise in the near term, natural gas is likely to continue increasing its share of the electricity market in the long run. One of the coal industry's challenges is to increase sales to overseas markets. The coal industry in the U.S. is facing a decline, with a focus on increasing sales to overseas markets to offset decreasing domestic demand. Coal exports have fluctuated in response to changes in global demand, with forecasts predicting a decline in the short term but a potential increase to 85 million tons annually by 2050. Challenges such as infrastructure limitations and global competition could hinder export growth, despite past increases aided by a weakened U.S. dollar. In 2011, U.S. coal exports exceeded 100 mst for the first time since 1992, peaking at 126 mst in 2012. Factors influencing future exports include the construction of export terminals and global demand for metallurgical coal. Metallurgical coal, primarily exported to Europe, accounted for 68% of U.S. total coal exports in 2016. PRB coal is mainly exported from Canadian terminals at Roberts Bank and Ridley Terminal. PRB coal producers are seeking a domestic export link to the Asian market through the Pacific Northwest. Three port terminal projects in Washington and Oregon faced permit denials or cancellations, hindering progress in exporting coal to Asia. The State of Washington denied the Millennium project a permit to build on state land, hindering coal export efforts to Asia. The coal industry in the United States is dominated by a few major producers, with the top five companies accounting for a significant portion of coal production. Peabody Energy Corp. and Arch Coal Inc. are the leading producers, with other major players including Cloud Peak Energy, Alpha Natural Resources, and Murray Energy Corp. Major acquisitions were made in 2011 in anticipation of market growth. The coal industry faced challenges in 2011 with major producers acquiring companies despite weak demand and prices. This led to a high debt load and overproduction, resulting in bankruptcy for many firms. Over 50 coal producers filed for bankruptcy in the past two years, with $19.3 billion in debt being reorganized. The top three producers (Peabody, Arch, and ANR) accounted for 42% of U.S. coal production in 2015. The top three coal producers (Peabody, Arch, and ANR) accounted for 42% of U.S. coal production in 2015. After emerging from Chapter 11, they plan to sell off some holdings. Critics question the long-term viability of the coal industry, but with reduced debt levels, larger firms are expected to be more profitable. Electric utilities seek diverse power generation options to minimize risk, but face EPA regulations on emissions. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a key coal R&D effort. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a leading coal R&D effort that shows promise for power generation if federal GHG emissions limits are enforced. Congress debates issues on coal production on federal lands, including balancing production with other resource values. Federal coal leases make up 40-42% of total U.S. coal production. Concerns include assessing coal value, determining fair market value, and government royalties. In 2013, GAO found inconsistencies in BLM's evaluation of federal coal leases, and DOI's Inspector General report suggested BLM may have violated Mineral Leasing Act provisions. The DOI Inspector General report found that BLM may have violated provisions in the Mineral Leasing Act by accepting below-cost bids for federal coal leases. A new rule for the valuation of coal was initiated by the Secretary of the Interior, with a proposed rule published in January 2015 and finalized in July 2016. BLM administers coal leasing on all federal lands competitively, following processes similar to oil and gas leasing. Federal coal leasing is based on Resource Management Plans and Forest Service Land Use Plans. The federal lands can be leased for coal production through regional coal leasing or leasing by application. Most new coal leasing is done by application. A study was conducted to assess federal coal resources and restrictions on their development, focusing on the Powder River Basin federal land and coal resources. The study evaluated the Powder River Basin (PRB) federal land and coal resources, finding that PRB contains 550 Bst, representing 58% of federal resources assessed and 88% of coal produced on federal lands. Leasing is prohibited on 591,000 acres in the PRB, with 5.9% of potential federal coal, while leasing is possible on 4.3 million acres, containing 84.3% of federal coal resources. Leasing is available under standard lease terms on 82,000 acres. President Obama announced a moratorium on federal coal leasing on January 16, 2016, to modernize the program. The Secretary of the Interior directed BLM to prepare a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) for a comprehensive review. Three leasing modernization options were presented by BLM, with support and opposition in Congress. The Obama Administration published a scoping report on January 11, 2017, as a prelude to the draft and final PEIS. The BLM discusses options for federal coal leasing, including fair return to the public, climate change, and community assistance. The Trump Administration lifted the moratorium on federal coal leasing, leading to concerns about impacts on coal communities and markets. Environmental groups and the Northern Cheyenne Indian Tribe filed a lawsuit to maintain the moratorium and ensure fair market value for coal leases. The public has raised concerns about the lack of competition and low bid levels for coal leases, as well as lease modifications that could bypass competition. The DOI published a final rule on federal coal valuation, reaffirming that the value of coal for royalty purposes should be based on the lease and gross proceeds from arms-length transactions. The DOI reaffirmed that coal valuation for royalty purposes should be based on the lease and gross proceeds from arms-length transactions. ONRR proposed changes to the valuation of non-arms-length coal transactions, aiming to eliminate current benchmarks and value coal based on gross proceeds minus allowable deductions. The implementation of coal valuation rules was postponed by ONRR in February 2017, and a separate announcement was made by the Trump Administration on April 3, 2017. The Department of the Interior repealed the coal valuation rule on August 7, 2017, effective on September 6, 2017. Coal is a fossilized remains of ancient plant life transformed into carbon-rich mineral deposits found in sedimentary rock strata. Coal mineral classification considers type, rank, and grade based on the plant life it originated from. Coal's type, rank, and grade are determined by the plant life it originated from and the degree of metamorphosis. Qualities like moisture, carbon, sulfur, and ash content affect its heating value as a fuel. Sulfur content is crucial due to emissions during combustion, regulated under the Clean Air Act. Western coal, low in sulfur and energy, is mainly used for power generation, while eastern coal is used domestically and exported for other purposes. Moisture increases shipping costs and decreases heating value. Minerals deposited with the plants that formed coal also play a role. Coal is classified based on type, rank, and grade determined by plant origin and metamorphosis degree. Sulfur content is crucial for emissions control. Western coal is low in sulfur and used for power generation, while eastern coal is exported. Minerals in coal create ash when burned. In the US, 69% of coal comes from surface mining and 31% from underground mining. Underground mining techniques include room and pillar and longwall methods, involving cutting, drilling, blasting, and loading processes. Surface mining, also known as \"open-pit\" or strip mining, involves blasting rock above the coal with explosives to remove overburden. This method uses electric shovels and draglines to uncover the coal seam for extraction. Surface mining, also known as \"open-pit\" or strip mining, involves uncovering and removing coal in long cuts, followed by backfilling and reclaiming land. Mountaintop removal mining is a form of strip mining that removes a coal seam from one side of a mountain to the other, typically in steep-terrain surface mining. Peabody Energy, the world's largest private-sector coal company, has dominated U.S. coal production for the past two decades. Peabody Energy has been the dominant force in U.S. coal production, growing from 11.5% in 1994 to 19.6% in 2015. The company operates multiple mines in the U.S. and Australia, with its most productive mines located in Wyoming. Peabody claims 6.3 billion tons of coal reserves, primarily thermal grade. However, the company has faced debt issues since its 2011 expansion into Australia, including the acquisition of Macarthur Coal for $5.1 billion. Peabody Energy, a major player in U.S. coal production, faced financial challenges after acquiring Macarthur Coal for $5.1 billion in 2011. By 2015, Peabody had $6.3 billion in debt and operational losses of $1.5 billion. The stock price plummeted from $79.35 to $2.07 per share by April 2016, leading to Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The reorganization plan aimed to reduce debt by over $5 billion, leaving $2 billion, and cover mine cleanups with $1.26 billion in third-party surety bonds. Arch Coal Inc., formed in 1997, operated 11 mines in the U.S. and had $2.6 billion in assets. Arch Coal, formed in 1997, operated 11 mines in the U.S. with $2.6 billion in revenue in 2015. The company faced financial challenges, with revenue dropping to $1.65 billion in 2016 and major losses from 2011-2016. Arch Coal filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2016, despite being the leading metallurgical coal producer in the U.S. and the second leading thermal coal producer. Cloud Peak Energy Inc. operates three surface mines in the PRB and was formed in 2008 after Rio Tinto Group spun off its ownership. The company did not file for bankruptcy protection. Cloud Peak Energy Inc., based in England, spun off its 48.3% ownership in 2010. By 2015, the company accounted for 8.4% of U.S. coal production with 1,400 employees, decreasing to 1,300 in 2016. Gross revenues dropped from $1.5 billion in 2011 to $1.1 billion in 2015. Cloud Peak avoided layoffs through transfers and attrition. No new mines are being developed due to current coal prices. The company believes 2017 will be better than 2016. Cloud Peak reduced self-bonding for reclamation to $10 million in 2016 from $200 million in 2015. Alpha Natural Resources, formed in 2002, acquired Pittston Coal Co. and made several acquisitions. Cloud Peak exports coal to the Asian market. Alpha Natural Resources (ANR), a subsidiary of the Brink's Co., underwent a series of acquisitions from 2003 to 2011, including Massey Energy Co. The Massey acquisition, financed with $7.1 billion in debt, expanded ANR's operations significantly. However, due to heavy debt and low coal demand, ANR filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 2015. After emerging from bankruptcy in July 2016, ANR reorganized into a smaller company with 18 mine operations and eight coal preparation plants in West Virginia and Kentucky. The reorganization discharged over $4 billion in debt, leading to the split of ANR into two companies\u2014Contura Energy and ANR. ANR spun off its PRB mine to ensure private bonding for reclamation. Murray Energy Corporation, founded in 1988 by Robert Murray, operates 12 active coal mines in the United States and Colombia with 6,000 miners. It is the largest privately held coal mining company in the United States. Murray acquired mines in the Illinois Basin, Northern Appalachia, and Utah, and invested in Foresight Energy, LP, and took over CONSOL Coal for $3.5 billion in 2013. Murray Energy did not file for bankruptcy. Murray Energy, the largest privately held coal mining company in the US, did not file for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's downgraded their credit rating to the lowest level. Financial stress was felt in the northern Appalachia region due to the Marcellus shale natural gas play. Murray warned of the impact on reliable, low-cost electricity in America as the coal industry declines. The curr_chunk provides information on various CRS reports related to the coal industry, including assessments of greenhouse gas emissions, the Clean Power Plan, stream protection rules, mountaintop removal mining controversies, and pension benefits for United Mine Workers of America retirees."
