    "content": "The conversion of scanned documents to digital forms is done using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to improve the quality of scanned documents and enhance the OCR output. A document enhancement pipeline is created using deep neural network based denoising auto-encoders to remove noise from scanned documents. The model is trained to work on different noise levels such as blurring and watermark noise. The success of extracting digital output from scanned documents is an active research area with various tools available in the market for this purpose. In this study, a neural network architecture called REDNET is adapted for denoising and restoring text document images. The method utilizes symmetric skip connections between convolutional and deconvolutional layers, offering advantages over traditional denoising techniques. The REDNET architecture used in this study includes 15 convolutional and 15 deconvolutional layers with skip connections. Filter sizes are mostly 3x3, except for the final decoding layer which is 5x5. The number of filters varies between 64 and 128, with ReLU activation function used throughout except for the final decoding layer. The study utilized a REDNET architecture with 128 filters and ReLU activation in most layers. The final decoding layer used a linear activation function. Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-4 was employed. The system denoises scanned documents with multiple pages by extracting patches instead of down-sampling to maintain image quality and augment the dataset. In this research, patch-level training was adopted to augment the dataset by extracting patches from images. Gaussian blur and box blur noise kernels were used to introduce noise on clean image patches. Watermark removal was addressed by dividing each document page into a grid and synthetically adding watermarks to patches. The solution to the watermark removal problem involves dividing document pages into grids and synthetically adding watermarks to each grid. This method increases the number of patches with watermarks and provides clean pairs naturally. The added watermarks vary in text, orientation, font, opacity, size, and color. Experimental setup details, including data used for training, are summarized in Table 1. Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and OCR performance metrics were used to measure improvement and effectiveness of noise removal by the trained model. The trained REDNET model effectively removes noise and watermarks from documents, as shown in Table 2 and Figure 2. OCR improvement was measured at 0.7% on real scanned contracts. Watermark removal results in Figure 3 demonstrate the network's ability to completely remove watermarks without distorting the original text. The trained REDNET model successfully removes watermarks from documents without distorting the text. OCR accuracy significantly improves after watermark removal, as shown in Table 2. The deblurring model achieved a PSNR of 34.52 dB for gray-level images and 50.24 dB for RGBA color patches. The network was tested on various levels of noise intensity and successfully removed both gray-level and color watermarks from text images. Ongoing research aims to develop a unified network capable of removing all types of noise. Research is ongoing to design a unified network that can remove all noise types from text documents, including image documents."
