    "content": "The federal Health Center Program awards grants to support outpatient primary care facilities for low-income individuals. Administered by HRSA within HHS, the program is authorized in Section 330 of the PHSA and supports community health centers, health centers for the homeless, health centers for public housing residents, and migrant health centers. Over 10,000 health center sites provided care to 24.3 million people in 2015, with the majority being community health centers serving low-income populations. Health centers, including community health centers, health centers for the homeless, health centers for public housing residents, and migrant health centers, serve low-income or disadvantaged populations. They are required to provide care to all individuals in their service area, regardless of ability to pay, and are located in areas with few healthcare providers or serve medically underserved populations. These centers are part of the health safety net, serving the uninsured, underserved, and Medicaid enrollees. Data from HRSA shows that most patients at health centers are uninsured or on Medicaid. The report provides an overview of the federal Health Center Program, describing health centers, their patient population, outcomes, and federal programs available to assist operations. It includes information on the federally qualified health center (FQHC) designation for Medicare and Medicaid payments. Additionally, there are two appendixes detailing FQHC payments and programs similar to health centers but not authorized in Section 330 of the PHSA. The federal Health Center Program provides grants to support outpatient primary care facilities serving low-income individuals. Section 330 of the PHSA authorizes grants for health centers, outlining program requirements and types of grants awarded. Health centers must provide services to the entire population in their service area. Health centers must provide services to the entire population in their service area, regardless of ability to pay. They must document residents' health needs, update service areas as needed, and meet various program requirements such as location, fee schedules, reimbursement collection, governance, specific health services, reporting, quality assurance, and provider licensing. These requirements apply to PHSA Section 330 grants. The PHSA Section 330 grant requires health centers to be located in medically underserved areas and serve underserved populations. In response to concerns raised by the GAO in 2012, HRSA implemented new oversight procedures and training for health centers to comply with program requirements. This CRS report describes the program's requirements but does not evaluate whether health centers meet them. Health centers must establish fee schedules based on local rates to cover costs. Sliding-scale fees are used to adjust charges based on income. Patients above 200% of the poverty level pay full charges, while those at or below 100% pay nominal fees. Insurance coverage may also apply. Health centers establish fee schedules based on local rates to cover costs. Sliding-scale fees adjust charges based on income, with patients at or below 100% of the poverty level paying nominal fees. Those with insurance coverage may be eligible for discounted services if the copayment would be greater than the discounted fee schedule amount. Health centers must enroll as providers in state Medicaid and CHIP plans and seek reimbursement from third-party payers. Health centers rely on reimbursements from third-party payers like private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, which make up 62.5% of their revenue. However, data shows that these reimbursements may not cover the full costs of providing care. For example, Medicaid only covers 82% of the costs incurred for Medicaid beneficiaries, and Medicare reimbursements are also below the actual costs per patient. In 2007, GAO found that nearly 70% of health center visits exceeded Medicare's payment limit. Medicare payment methodology has since changed, but it's unclear if the new rate covers all costs. Health center boards must have patient majorities, reflect demographics, and include community representatives with relevant expertise. Nonpatient board members must not have more than 10% of their income from the healthcare industry. The governing board of health centers must approve policies, budget, operating hours, management, and fee schedule. They must meet monthly, approve the director, grant applications, and ensure primary, preventive, and emergency health services are provided. Primary services are provided by physicians or extenders and include diagnostic and radiology services. Preventive services include well-child care, prenatal care, immunization, family planning, health education, and dental care. Health centers must provide emergency health services, additional necessary health services like behavioral and environmental health, and ensure care continuity for hospitalized patients by having physicians with admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Health centers must offer enabling services like translation, health education, and transportation for patients who have difficulty accessing the center. All services provided must be available to all patients regardless of payment source and at all service sites. Reporting to HRSA on patient demographics, services, staffing, utilization rates, costs, and revenue is required, along with having quality improvement and assurance plans in place. Health centers must report patient demographics, services, staffing, utilization rates, costs, and revenue to HRSA's UDS. They must also report on clinical outcomes such as immunizations, cervical cancer screenings, and BMI assessments. Quality improvement systems must be in place, including clinical services, management, and patient confidentiality assurances. Clinical directors conduct assessments to evaluate service quality. Health centers are encouraged to seek accreditation from AAHC or TJC, with HRSA supporting some costs. Providers must be licensed and maintain credentials, with physicians needing admitting privileges at relevant hospitals. Quality initiatives like care coordination are promoted, and providers must report patient demographics and clinical outcomes to HRSA. HRSA supports health centers in seeking accreditation from AAHC or TJC and encourages recognition as Patient-Centered Medical Homes. Health centers must maintain appropriate accounting systems, undergo annual financial audits, and comply with government grant requirements. HRSA awards various grants to health centers, including New Access Point grants for establishing new sites, Service Expansion grants for increasing patient numbers or services, Quality Improvement grants for accreditation efforts, Health Center Control Networks for electronic health record support, Capital Development grants for construction/renovation, and Planning Grants for non-health center entities. Planning Grants are available to entities that are not health centers to plan and develop health centers. Funds can be used for assessing health needs, developing community linkages, and connecting with health providers in the service area. Public and nonprofit entities can apply for Section 330 grants to operate health centers. Grants are awarded competitively based on service need and application merit, with funding priorities like rural-urban balance. Certain percentages of the budget support health centers serving special populations. The Health Center Program's budget must be allocated to support health centers serving special populations, including migrant workers, the homeless, and residents of public housing. Health centers must meet specific funding requirements, such as allocating percentages for different special populations and receiving special consideration for serving sparsely populated areas. The Health Center Program may adjust funding criteria to meet specific population percentage requirements. Grant recipients must use funds to supplement existing funding and compete for continued funding through a Service Area Competition after three years. Funding for multiyear projects is contingent on congressional appropriations and compliance with requirements. The Health Center Program's funding has increased significantly over the past decade, allowing for the establishment of more centers and serving more patients. The program received increased funding from FY2005 to FY2016, with a 200% increase from $1.7 billion to $5.1 billion. The expansion of the program began in 2002 under the George W. Bush Administration and continued during the Obama Administration, with additional funding provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Health Center Program's funding has increased significantly over the past decade, allowing for the establishment of more centers and serving more patients. The program received increased funding from FY2005 to FY2016, with a 200% increase from $1.7 billion to $5.1 billion. The expansion of the program began in 2002 under the George W. Bush Administration and continued during the Obama Administration, with additional funding provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The program's expansion continued under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, which provided $1.5 billion for construction, renovation, equipment, and health information technology. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 extended funding through FY2017, providing $7.2 billion to support health center operations. The ACA was enacted in 2010 to offset reductions in discretionary appropriations to the Health Center Program, leading to a significant increase in funding. The number of centers nearly doubled since FY2005, with funds mainly used for expansion. Health centers also receive revenue from reimbursements and other sources. Funding details from FY2005 to FY2017 are presented in Table 3. In states that expanded Medicaid under ACA, it makes up about half of health center revenue, compared to less than one-third in non-expansion states. In FY2016, Medicaid accounted for 42.2% of health center revenue, followed by Section 330 grants (21.7%), state/local/private funding (13.9%), and private insurance reimbursements (9.0%). The Health Center Program funds different types of health centers, each offering varying services and serving different populations. The section also discusses the locations of these health centers. The section discusses different types of health centers and the populations they serve. There are four types: community health centers, health centers for the homeless, health centers for residents of public housing, and migrant health centers. Community health centers serve the general population with limited access to healthcare, while the other types serve more targeted populations. Each type of center must provide specific services to their targeted population. Community Health Centers (CHCs) are required to provide primary health services to the general population. They receive the majority of Health Center Program grant funding, with 18.5% reserved for health centers serving special populations. Health centers for the homeless (HCHs) provide services to homeless individuals, targeting this generally uninsured population. Homeless Health Centers (HCHs) provide services to homeless individuals, including substance abuse and supportive services. They aim to connect individuals with emergency shelter, job training, and education. Grants support innovative programs for homeless children. HRSA allocates at least 8.7% of the Health Center Program budget to HCHs. Public housing health centers offer primary care to residents in public housing facilities. Public housing health centers were authorized in 1990 to provide primary care to residents in public housing. HRSA must allocate at least 1.2% of the Health Center Program budget to support these centers. Migrant health centers cater to migrant and seasonal farmworkers, with HRSA estimating care for over a quarter of this population. Migrant health centers cater to migrant and seasonal farmworkers, providing specific services like supportive services, environmental health services, accident prevention, and treatment of health conditions related to pesticide exposure. These centers may operate seasonally and receive at least 8.6% of the Health Center Program budget. In 2015, health centers served 24.3 million patients. Health centers served 24.3 million patients in 2015, mostly socioeconomically disadvantaged, uninsured, or underinsured. Majority have incomes at or below the federal poverty level, with a significant portion being racial/ethnic minorities. Nearly two-thirds of patients were minorities, double the U.S. population average. Demographic characteristics include age, race/ethnicity, and insurance status. Community health center locations are shown in Figure 1. Community health centers are the most numerous type of sites, with some operating multiple types in the same area. Research shows that they improve health outcomes, reduce costs, and increase access to care for underserved populations. Health centers focus on preventive care and managing chronic conditions to prevent disease and complications. Health centers focus on preventive care to improve health outcomes and reduce disease-related complications. Research shows that health center patients are more likely to receive preventive health services and screenings compared to non-health center patients of similar socioeconomic status. Additionally, health centers aim to increase prenatal care use in low-income pregnant women to reduce outcomes associated with infant mortality. HRSA has found that health centers have made progress in this effort, resulting in fewer low-birth-weight babies among health center patients compared to the national average. Health centers may lower healthcare costs by reducing emergency department visits, with treatment costs being significantly lower than in emergency departments. Counties with health centers show lower emergency room use, and individuals near health centers use emergency rooms less. Health centers educate patients on services offered and provide same-day and after-hours appointments to reduce emergency department use. They also help prevent unnecessary hospitalizations, particularly for ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Recent studies have shown that individuals with ambulatory care sensitive conditions in communities with health centers were less likely to be hospitalized. Health center patients enrolled in Medicaid also had lower hospitalization rates and emergency room visits compared to those not using health centers. Health center patients enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid had lower total spending compared to those receiving primary care outside of health centers. For Medicare patients, annual costs were 10% lower for health center patients. The median annual costs per Medicare beneficiary were 10% lower for health center patients compared to non-health center patients. For Medicaid beneficiaries, costs were 24% lower overall, with reductions in specialty care and inpatient care costs. Health center users also had 25% fewer hospital admissions. Studies have shown that patients receiving care at health centers with medical homes had 41% lower medical costs on average. National survey data indicated that health centers reduced costs by 24%, while a North Carolina study found health center users' annual healthcare spending was 62% less than similar patients. Health centers provide less costly health care compared to other outpatient settings, with reasons including discounted services through federal programs and providers working on a salaried basis, avoiding financial incentives for unnecessary tests or procedures. Health centers aim to reduce healthcare costs by providing care to underserved populations in areas with few providers, such as rural and inner city areas. They may lower costs by averting expensive emergency room visits, specialty care, or hospital stays, ultimately increasing healthcare access for underserved populations. Health centers serve diverse populations, including Hispanic, African American, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander patients. They increase access for underserved racial and ethnic groups and reduce health disparities by providing care to those who may struggle to access healthcare. Health centers are more likely to accept new patients, including those unable to pay for services, and their patients are often enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP. Patients enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP are commonly served by health centers, which are required to accept all patients regardless of insurance status. Recent research shows that Medicaid patients are more likely to get appointments at health centers compared to private practices. Health centers also increase the likelihood of low-income adults seeing a doctor. Studies have found that health centers perform better on certain quality measures compared to physician offices. Health centers provide quality care for managing chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, reducing hospitalizations and emergency visits for asthma. A study compared health center care to Medicaid managed care organizations on selected quality measures. The study compared health centers to Medicaid managed care organizations on quality measures for diabetes and blood pressure control. Two groups were identified: high performing health centers exceeding MCOs and low performing health centers below MCOs. More health centers were considered high performing (12%) than low performing (4%). Differences in population served and geographic location were noted, with low performing centers more likely to serve uninsured or homeless individuals and have less Medicaid revenue. The quality of health centers varies by location, with high-performing centers mainly in California, New York, and Massachusetts, and low-performing centers more common in southern states. Section 330 grants cover about one-fifth of operating costs, with additional federal assistance available for provider recruitment and financial support. Health centers can employ National Health Service Corps members for recruitment and retention, and they receive financial support as Federally Qualified Health Centers. Health centers, designated as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), receive cost-based Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. Medicaid provides over 40% of revenue for the Health Center Program. On average, health centers receive 44% of revenue from Medicaid reimbursements. They also get discounted prescription drugs, vaccines, and support from grants and loans. Located in medically underserved areas, health centers are automatically designated as health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) and are eligible for National Health Service Corps (NHSC) providers. The NHSC provides scholarships or loan repayments to health professionals working at specific facilities in HPSAs, with about half of Corps members serving in health centers. Some states may operate loan repayment programs for health professionals in state-designated shortage areas. Health centers can also obtain providers through J-1 visa waivers for foreign medical graduates practicing primary care in HPSAs. Health centers in HPSAs can recruit physicians through the J-1 visa waiver program. They can also enroll as Federally Qualified Health Centers to receive cost-based reimbursement rates from Medicare and Medicaid. Additionally, they are eligible for the 340B Drug Pricing program, which provides discounts on drugs. The 340B Drug Pricing program offers discounts on drugs for eligible facilities, saving $4.5 billion in FY2014. Health centers can also participate in the Vaccines for Children Program, providing free vaccines to low-income children. The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program enables health centers to provide vaccines at a lower cost to patients and the center. Health center employees are covered under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which protects them from medical malpractice lawsuits. Volunteers at health centers became eligible for FTCA coverage in 2016. The FTCA program paid 111 claims for health center employees in FY2015, totaling $93.8 million, providing financial support to health centers. Health centers receive financial support through grants from the Ryan White AIDS program to provide care for low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS. They can also apply for federally funded grant programs to improve rural health services. Federally funded grant programs aim to enhance rural health, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, support high-risk pregnant women, improve health professional training, and increase access to family planning for low-income families. Some programs are competitive grants under the PHSA, while others, specific to rural areas, may be administered by the USDA. Rural health centers may also benefit from USDA programs for equipment and broadband access, as well as resources from the General Services Administration for real estate needs. The federal government supports various facilities providing primary care to underserved populations, including school-based health centers and nurse-managed health clinics. These facilities have different requirements than those authorized in PHSA Section 330 and serve targeted populations such as American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, rural areas, mental health services, and specific populations. School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) are facilities located on or near school grounds that provide comprehensive primary health care services to students regardless of their ability to pay. SBHCs may be located at public, private, charter, or parochial schools and must be open during school hours. The ACA authorized separate grants for SBHC construction and renovation but did not appropriate funding for operation grants. Nurse-Managed Health Clinics (NMHCs) provide comprehensive primary care and wellness services to underserved populations. They offer services such as wellness, prenatal care, disease prevention, chronic condition management, and health education. ACA authorized grants to support NMHCs in PHSA Section 330A-1, with HHS awarding $15 million in FY2010 for 10 NHMCs. Grantees were required to submit a sustainability plan for operation after funding. Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) are licensed facilities that provide mental health services tailored to the needs of children, adults, and the elderly with serious mental illnesses. They also offer services to individuals discharged from inpatient treatment. Required services include emergency services, day treatment, psychosocial rehabilitation, and screening for admission into state mental health facilities. The ACA mandated that CMHCs provide less than 40% of their services to Medicare beneficiaries. No funding has been awarded for CMHCs since FY2010. CMHCs receive funding from states through SAMHSA block grants, HHS grants, and reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid. The Native Hawaiian Health Care System provides services to Native Hawaiians facing barriers to healthcare access. The Native Hawaiian Health Care System (NHHCS) faces cultural, financial, and geographic barriers to accessing healthcare services. It was authorized under the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988 and receives funding through the health center appropriation. In 2014, NHHCS provided medical and enabling services to over 12,000 people. Tribal Health Centers, operated by Indian Tribes, Tribal Organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations, receive funds from the Indian Health Service to provide healthcare services to American Indians or Alaska Natives. These centers are not subject to Section 330 requirements. Tribal health centers operated by Indian Tribes, Tribal Organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations receive funding from the Indian Health Service to provide healthcare services to American Indians or Alaska Natives. They are not required to seek payments or reimbursements from clients as services are provided free of charge to eligible individuals. These centers may be designated as Federally Qualified Health Centers and receive Medicare and Medicaid payments. Additionally, they may apply for funds under Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, but would be subject to additional requirements if they receive these funds. Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) are outpatient primary care facilities in rural areas that receive higher Medicare and Medicaid payments. They are similar to health centers but do not receive federal grants and may be operated by for-profit entities. Free clinics provide medical, dental, and behavioral health services to uninsured populations regardless of their ability to pay. Free clinics provide healthcare services regardless of ability to pay, funded by donations. They do not receive HRSA funding but can participate in the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program. FQHC look-alikes meet grant criteria but do not receive funding. HRSA and CMS designate them as eligible for certain programs. FQHC look-alikes are designated by CMS to access federal programs like NHSC and the 340B drug discount program. In 2015, 54 look-alikes served 709,293 patients, offering similar services to health centers but with more limited capacity. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics were established under PAMA to improve services in Medicaid in up to eight states. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, established under PAMA, are designated in up to eight states with specific staffing and operational requirements. The PAMA demonstration program occurred in two phases, with planning grants awarded to 24 states in the first phase to develop a Medicaid Prospective Payment System. The second phase, involving eight selected states, will begin by July 1, 2017, and last two years. The PAMA demonstration program involves Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics in up to eight states with specific requirements. The program occurred in two phases, with planning grants awarded to 24 states in the first phase. The second phase, involving eight selected states, will begin by July 1, 2017, and last two years. The FQHC designation for Section 330 grantees allows for higher Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements rates. The FQHC designation ensures Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements cover service costs, with Medicare payments to FQHCs increasing under the Affordable Care Act. Beginning FY2015, Medicare FQHC payments increased with the implementation of a prospective payment system by CMS. The ACA required changes to Medicare payments to FQHCs to better reflect their costs. CMS developed a PPS using cost reports and claims data. FQHCs are now paid based on actual charges or an encounter rate for services, with Medicare covering 80%. The encounter rate aims to cover 100% of visit costs, calculated without copayments. The new encounter rate for FQHCs nationwide reflects the type, intensity, and duration of services provided, with geographic adjustments. It covers 100% of visit costs without copayments, per-payment limits, or productivity adjustments. Rates are adjusted for initial Medicare and annual wellness visits, and are only paid once per day per facility, except for certain services. The new encounter rate for FQHCs nationwide covers all services, except for certain vaccines, at 100% of reasonable costs. The PPS base payment was updated by 1.8% using the FQHC market basket starting January 1, 2017. Medicare beneficiaries have different deductible and cost-sharing requirements at FQHCs compared to other settings. There are no copayments for preventive services at FQHCs. Medicare pays FQHCs for preventive services without coinsurance. The remaining services may be subject to coinsurance, with Medicare covering 80% of the cost after deducting the value of preventive services. If the value of preventive services equals or exceeds the total payment amount, Medicare covers the full cost. The Medicare PPS rule also eliminated the requirement for auxiliary services. The Medicare PPS rule removed the requirement for auxiliary services to be employees of the facility for FQHCs to bill Medicare. Medicaid uses a PPS to reimburse FQHCs based on predetermined per-visit rates. States adjust PPS payment rates based on services provided and receive federal matching funds. In 2015, approximately 25 states and the District of Columbia used the PPS to reimburse FQHCs, while 11 states used an alternative payment methodology (APM) and 12 states used a combination of both methods. States using APMs typically offer cost-based reimbursements to explore payment reform options for FQHCs. FQHCs must agree to receive the different rate, and states are required to supplement FQHCs that subcontract with Medicaid Managed Care Entities to make up any payment differences. The ACA did not include changes in this reimbursement structure. The ACA did not include changes in Medicaid FQHC reimbursement policy under the PPS or APM."
