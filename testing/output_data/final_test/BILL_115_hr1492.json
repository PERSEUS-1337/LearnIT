The practitioner must be licensed or permitted by the state where the substances are administered, and must limit the time of transport. Practitioners with a registration can transport and administer controlled substances for up to 72 hours, returning any unused substances to their registered location. Records of transportation and administration must be maintained at the practitioner's registered location. The Attorney General may deny or revoke a practitioner's registration based on specified criteria, excluding the exception in subsection 307(c)(1)(B).
