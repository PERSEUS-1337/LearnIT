    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Chesapeake Bay Restoration Enhancement Act of 2005\" and includes definitions. Section 117(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define the term 'Chesapeake Bay watershed' and 'Local Government Advisory Committee'. The Chesapeake Bay watershed includes the Chesapeake Bay and 36 tributary basins in multiple states, while the Local Government Advisory Committee consists of representatives from jurisdictions within the watershed. The term 'tributary strategy' refers to State-approved cleanup plans for 36 specific rivers in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. These plans aim to remove nutrient and sediment impairments from the Bay and its tidal tributaries. A 'tributary basin' is an area of land that drains into one of these tributaries and is managed through tributary strategies under this Act. SEC. 3. Implementation and monitoring grants amended to require signing of significant portions. SEC. 4. Reporting. Section 117 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require the Administrator to publish a detailed document each year listing completed projects in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Additionally, a 'tributary health report card' must be published annually to evaluate water quality based on data. The 'tributary health report card' evaluates progress in achieving nutrient and sediment reduction goals for each tributary basin based on monitoring data. The baseline for the report card is the tributary cap load allocation agreement dated December 2003. The report card includes an identification of the total allocation of nutrients and sediments for each basin. The tributary health report card evaluates progress in achieving nutrient and sediment reduction goals for each basin. It includes monitored and modeled quantities of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment reductions achieved, a ranking of progress made by each basin, and identification of principal sources of pollutants. The Administrator shall use monitoring data and data submitted under subsection (g)(1) to prepare the report card, taking into consideration the effects of drought and wet weather conditions on water quality parameters. Report cards will be distributed to appropriate committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, posted on the Internet, and paper copies will be distributed to the public. SEC. 5. ACTIONS BY STATES. Actions by States under Section 117 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act require specific information submissions from Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia regarding nutrient and sediment load allocations in tributary basins. The text discusses the requirements for States under Section 117 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, focusing on information submissions related to nutrient and sediment load allocations in tributary basins. It outlines the technologies, practices, and funding used to achieve reductions in pollutant sources, with consequences for failure to comply with the submission requirements. Amendments are also made to specific subsections within the Act. SEC. 6. PLANNING AND BUDGET REQUIREMENTS. Section 117 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include annual budget planning and reporting requirements for federal agencies involved in restoration activities. The Chesapeake Bay Restoration Enhancement Act of 2005 requires detailed reporting on funds used for restoration activities in the Chesapeake Bay, including the federal government's role and the specific involvement of each federal agency. The Chesapeake Bay Restoration Enhancement Act of 2005 mandates that Federal agencies in the Chesapeake Bay watershed support the achievement of Chesapeake Bay Agreement goals through their actions. The Chesapeake Bay Program is outlined in Section 7 of the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Enhancement Act of 2005. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include tributary strategies and ensure that signatories to the Chesapeake Executive Council approve and implement measurable goals for local government involvement in the Chesapeake Bay Program. The Chesapeake Executive Council and the Local Government Advisory Committee must establish measurable goals for local governments to achieve nutrient and sediment reduction goals within 120 days of the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Enhancement Act of 2005. The Administrator must consider funding priorities recommended by the Local Government Advisory Committee when preparing the annual budget for the Chesapeake Bay. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act now includes tributary strategies to support the Chesapeake Bay Program. The program aims to provide technical assistance and grants to local governments, nonprofit organizations, and individuals in the Chesapeake Bay watershed to implement tributary strategies and other projects that support Chesapeake Bay Agreement goals. This includes improving water quality towards achieving the Agreement goals. The small watershed grants program aims to support projects that align with Chesapeake Bay Agreement goals, including habitat creation, restoration, protection, and enhancement. Local governments should receive at least 40 percent of the total annual amount appropriated for the program. Priority recommendations from the Local Government Advisory Committee are taken into consideration, and recommendations from the committee are also considered. The government advisory committee evaluates grant requests for meeting tributary strategy goals. Wasteload allocations in tributary strategies for the Chesapeake Bay watershed will be treated as the functional equivalent of wasteload allocations for total maximum daily loads in permits. SEC. 8 amends Section 117(j) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act by updating years and including tributary strategies. SEC. 9 authorizes appropriations. SEC. 9 authorizes appropriations of $40,000,000 for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 for carrying out the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, with an additional $10,000,000 allocated for the small watershed grants program."
