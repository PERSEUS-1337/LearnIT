    "content": "The \"Competitive Service Act of 2015\" allows for additional appointing authorities for competitive service positions, enabling selection of individuals from a certificate of eligibles by appointing authorities other than the requesting authority within a specified period. The Competitive Service Act of 2015 allows appointing authorities to share certificates of eligibles for similar positions at the same grade level. Selection must be made in accordance with subsection (a) and may not require additional posting under section 3327. Before selecting an individual for a position, the appointing authority must provide internal notice, allow employees to apply for up to 10 business days, and review their qualifications. This does not override any collective bargaining obligations. Alternative ranking and selection procedures are outlined in Section 3319 of title 5, United States Code. An appointing official can select any applicant in the highest quality category or a merged category if fewer than 3 candidates are in the highest category. Other appointing officials can select applicants for positions in the same series and grade level as the original position. An appointing official can select applicants for positions at a similar grade level as the original position. The certificate of eligibles can be shared with another appointing authority if the announcement stated it may be used by another authority. Selection must follow specific requirements and can be made without additional posting. Before selecting, the other appointing authority must provide internal notice and adhere to any collective bargaining obligations. The appointing official must provide notice of available positions to employees of another appointing authority, allow up to 10 business days for applications, and review qualifications. Collective bargaining obligations still apply, and preference eligibles cannot be passed over unless specific requirements are met. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management must issue an interim final rule within one year to implement the amendments made by this section, ensuring that the requirements of section 3317(b) and 3318(c) are met. Additionally, a technical amendment replaces \"3318(b)\" with \"3318(c)\" in Section 9510(b)(5) of title 5, United States Code. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
