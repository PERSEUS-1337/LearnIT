    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 19620.2 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to allocate unallocated funds for capital projects at California fairs related to public health, safety, maintenance, emergencies, fair site changes, property protection, and facility enhancements. Any revenues deposited into the Fair and Exposition Fund per Section 7101.4 of the Revenue and Taxation Code will not go to fairs in Los Angeles County. These funds will only be allocated to state-designated fairs that provide specific working conditions for nonmanagement employees. This includes a 30-minute meal period for work periods exceeding five hours, unless mutually waived by the employer and employee. (B) An employee gets a second meal break of at least 30 minutes for shifts over 10 hours, unless it's less than 12 hours and mutually waived. Overtime is compensated at 1.5 times the regular rate for work over 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week, and at double the rate for work over 12 hours in a day or on the seventh day of the week. A portion of funds may be allocated to California fairs for operational support, primarily for fairs with limited revenue sources. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2022. Section 19620.2 appropriates unallocated funds from Section 19620.1 for capital outlay to California fairs for various projects related to public health and safety, maintenance, emergencies, physical changes to fair sites, property protection, and facility enhancements. Section 19620.2 appropriates unallocated funds from Section 19620.1 for capital outlay to California fairs for general operational support, primarily for fairs with limited revenue sources. This section will be effective on January 1, 2022. Additionally, Section 6453.1 in the Revenue and Taxation Code requires sellers to segregate gross receipts and sales prices when sales occur on state-designated fair properties. Section 7101.4 of the Revenue and Taxation Code adds provisions regarding the transfer of funds to California fairs for operational support. It specifies exceptions to tax laws for state-designated fairs and includes a repeal date of January 1, 2022. Section 6051.2, 6051.8, 6051.15, 6201.2, 6201.8, 6201.15, and 7101.3 revenues transfer 30% to Fair and Exposition Fund in State Treasury.
