    "content": "PointGrow is a novel autoregressive model that generates realistic point cloud samples from scratch or based on given semantic contexts. It uses self-attention modules to capture long-range interpoint dependencies, achieving satisfying performance in both unconditional and conditional point cloud generation tasks. Conditional PointGrow learns a smooth manifold of images for 3D shape interpolation and arithmetic calculations. Deep learning integration in point cloud processing has led to unprecedented accuracy in tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation. Existing research focuses on discriminative models rather than generative models. This paper introduces PointGrow, a generative model for synthesizing and processing point clouds. It utilizes an autoregressive architecture to generate points recurrently, handling the irregularity of point clouds. Two self-attention modules are introduced to capture long-range relations for realistic point cloud samples. PointGrow is a generative model that uses a dedicated self-attention module to aggregate long-range information during point generation. It also learns a smooth manifold of images for interpolation and arithmetic calculations on image embeddings. Unlike traditional 3D generative models, PointGrow builds upon an autoregressive architecture suitable for point cloud generation. PointGrow is a generative model with a self-attention module for point cloud generation. It captures long-range dependencies between points to create realistic 3D shapes. The model enables unsupervised feature learning and can generate diverse point cloud samples with high resolution. The PointGrow generative model with a self-attention module aims to assign a probability to each point cloud by factorizing the joint probability of points. The conditional probability distribution of each coordinate is modeled using a deep neural network, with points sorted in the order of z, y, and x for generation in a \"plane-sweep\" manner along the primary axis. The softmax discrete distribution outperforms mixture models for implicitly continuous data. Discrete point coordinates are obtained by scaling point clouds to [0, 1] and quantizing them. Using 200 values balances generative performance and minimizing artifacts. Advantages of discrete coordinates include simplified implementation, flexibility in approximating distributions, and preventing mass generation outside the range. Context awareness enhances model inference, such as obtaining global features for semantic segmentation tasks. The model utilizes Context Awareness (CA) operation to aggregate context information dynamically for point features in semantic segmentation tasks. Self-Attention Context Awareness (SACA) operations are proposed to determine weights for aggregating point features, with SACA-A operation associating local and \"semi-global\" information. The SACA-A operation in semantic segmentation tasks aggregates local and \"semi-global\" information by concatenating input features and \"semi-global\" features. This is followed by passing them through a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) to compute self-attention weights for each point. The self-attention weight encodes context changes for each point, which are then used to calculate weighted features and generate context features sequentially. The SACA-B operation in semantic segmentation tasks computes self-attention weights for each point feature by sharing the \"semi-global\" feature after the CA operation. This allows for the calculation of context features sequentially, encoding the importance of each point feature under a common context. The self-attention weights in the model encode the importance of each point feature under a common context. The network architecture includes branches for conditional coordinate distributions, with points sampled based on estimated softmax probabilities. Input points are masked to prevent the network from seeing ungenerated information. During training, all context features are available to estimate coordinate distributions. The network architecture includes branches for conditional coordinate distributions, with points sampled based on estimated softmax probabilities. Input points are masked to prevent the network from seeing ungenerated information. Coordinate distributions can be estimated in parallel, but point cloud generation is a sequential procedure. The additional condition, h, affects the coordinate distributions by adding biases in the generative process. In this study, the network architecture involves conditional coordinate distributions for point cloud generation. The framework was tested on ShapeNet dataset, ModelNet40, and PASCAL3D+. The ShapeNet dataset consisted of 17,687 CAD models across 7 categories, with a split ratio of 0.9/0.1 for training and testing sets. ModelNet40 contains CAD models from 40 categories. ModelNet40 and PASCAL3D+ datasets are used for further analysis in point cloud generation. Unconditional PointGrow models are trained separately for each category to generate point clouds. The autoregressive architecture in PointGrow accurately predicts categorical representations without semantic information during training. The autoregressive architecture in PointGrow abstracts high-level semantics from unaligned point cloud samples. Evaluation on Fidelity and Diversity shows inconsistency between negative log-likelihood values and visual quality of point cloud generation. Comparison of baseline models CA-Mean and CA-Max reveals that CA-Max gives lower log-likelihood values but less visually plausible results. The comparison of classification accuracy between different unsupervised methods on the ModelNet40 dataset is shown in Table 2. Our models, SACA-A and SACA-B, achieve accuracy scores of 85.8 and 84.4 respectively. A user study was conducted to evaluate generation quality in terms of fidelity and diversity. The study compared CA-Max, CA-Mean, and PointGrow (implemented with SACA-A) based on randomly selected generated airplane and car point clouds. In a user study, CA-Mean is preferred over CA-Max, and PointGrow (implemented with SACA-A) is favored for fidelity and diversity. Evaluation on semantics preserving involved training on original meshes and testing on generated point clouds using PointNet BID16 classifier. The study compares PointNet BID16 with 3D-GAN BID26 and latent-GAN BID0 for shape classification. Results show CA-Mean performs similarly to GAN-based methods. SACA-A model outperforms existing models in the first task, while SACA-A and SACA-B perform similarly in the second task. Feature representations are evaluated using symmetric functions before SACA operation. The study compares PointNet BID16 with 3D-GAN BID26 and latent-GAN BID0 for shape classification. SACA-A model achieves the best performance, while SACA-B model performs slightly worse. Shape completion is also possible with the model, generating multiple shape predictions from initial points. The study compares PointNet BID16 with 3D-GAN BID26 and latent-GAN BID0 for shape classification. SACA-A model achieves the best performance, while SACA-B model performs slightly worse. Shape completion results generated by PointGrow are plausible but different from the original ground truth point clouds. The model works only when the input point set is given along the primary axis, more investigation is needed for partial point clouds from other directions. The proposed model is trained on multiple shape categories to generate plausible point clouds. However, there are some failure cases where shapes exhibit mixed geometric properties. Image conditions are used to constrain the point cloud generation process to match 2D projections. The model is trained on the ShapeNet dataset and optimized along with other components. The trained model is tested on real images from the PASCAL3D+ dataset to demonstrate its generalizability. The PASCAL3D+ dataset presents challenges with noisier visual signals not encountered during training. Quantitative evaluation is done by calculating mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) with ground truth volumes, focusing on 3D volumes with more than 500 occupied voxels. PointGrow is a generative model that can synthesize realistic and diverse point clouds with high resolution. It uses a furthest point sampling method to select 500 points to describe the shape and aligns them to their nearest voxels. The model achieves above-par performance on conditional 3D shape generation by combining embedded image condition vectors with different weights. The final shapes contain geometrical features from the operands. PointGrow utilizes autoregressive architecture to encode surface information of point clouds for synthesizing 3D shapes. It incorporates self-attention modules to capture long-range dependencies between points and enables unsupervised feature learning for low-data recognition tasks. Additionally, PointGrow learns a smooth image condition manifold allowing for 3D shape interpolation and arithmetic calculations."
