    "content": "The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) aims to ban all nuclear explosions. It was opened for signature in September 1996, with 178 nations signing and 144 ratifying as of February 2008. To enter into force, 44 nations with nuclear reactors must ratify it; currently, 35 have ratified and 7 have signed. The United States signed the treaty in 1996 but the Senate rejected it in 1999. International support for test ban treaties has been strong, while U.S. opinion has been divided. Most U.S. Presidents have sought agreements to limit testing, with efforts dating back to the Eisenhower Administration. The Nixon, Ford, and Reagan Administrations negotiated nuclear test ban treaties with the Soviet Union, with the Carter Administration seeking a CTBT but not pursuing it. The George H.W. Bush Administration concluded negotiations on verification protocols, which were approved by the Senate in 1990. President Bush also implemented a nine-month moratorium on nuclear testing starting in October 1992. President Clinton extended the moratorium on nuclear testing, opting for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of zero yield and unlimited duration in 1995. The George W. Bush Administration continued the moratorium but did not pursue the CTBT. U.S. interest in the CTBT has fluctuated, with a resurgence after 9/11 and concerns over nuclear proliferation from countries like Iran and North Korea. Calls for nuclear disarmament, including ratification of the CTBT, have been made by prominent figures. The Administration is also pursuing the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) to reduce the need for nuclear testing. The CTBT has been a topic of debate, with some advocating for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) to reduce nuclear testing. International pressure for the treaty continues, with discussions in the U.N. General Assembly and the 110th Congress. Opinions on the treaty vary, reflecting differing views on security, nuclear weapons, nonproliferation, disarmament, and international relations. Some opponents seek to revoke the U.S. signature of the treaty. Some opponents want to revoke the U.S. signature of the CTBT to maintain nuclear weapons expertise and credibility, while some supporters see value in the treaty for nonproliferation and monitoring nuclear testing. Others view the CTBT as a step towards nuclear weapons abolition. The CTBT is viewed on a continuum with varying opinions on its impact on weapons development and nuclear proliferation. Supporters see value in the treaty for nonproliferation, while opponents question its effectiveness. The report aims to provide information to help assess whether the U.S. is better off with or without the CTBT, focusing on its impact on U.S. security, deterrence, monitoring, and verification. During the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union engaged in an arms competition, with dynamic strategies and programs. Scores of examples could be listed, such as submarines carrying ballistic missiles and deeply buried bunkers. Despite these efforts, the competition resulted in a rough balance. During the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet Union had dynamic nuclear strategies, resulting in rough parity. Deterrence was widely supported in the U.S. as the best alternative, with differing views on seeking superiority or maintaining a minimum deterrent. Congress backed forces for deterrence against the Soviet Union, seen as sufficient for deterring other threats. During the Cold War, nuclear testing served various purposes such as weapons development, safety, and maintaining skills in weapons science. With the end of the Cold War, the U.S. faced uncertainty with new threats. R. James Woolsey highlighted the shift from a predictable adversary to a jungle of unpredictable dangers. Despite this change, there is still some agreement on the need for deterrence. Despite the end of the Cold War, there is still agreement in the United States on the need for a nuclear deterrent. Experts suggest that a force of 500 operationally deployed warheads would be sufficient for deterrence, with an additional 400 to 500 warheads for flexibility. The Administration's Nuclear Posture Review of 2001 also emphasized the continued need for U.S. nuclear forces. The 2001 Posture Review emphasized the importance of U.S. nuclear forces for deterrence in a post-Cold War world. Questions arise about who needs to be deterred, by what threats, and what weapons are necessary for credibility. The dynamic nature of deterrence may require constant weapons development to address evolving threats. Weapons development may be necessary to address evolving threats and maintain deterrence capabilities. Questions arise about the adequacy of existing nuclear weapons in deterring North Korea and Iran, as well as the relevance of nuclear forces in deterring terrorists. The report also considers the implications of the CTBT and nuclear testing on the maintenance of U.S. nuclear weapons facilities and skilled personnel. The nuclear weapons enterprise, managed by the National Nuclear Security Administration, must consider if existing weapons can be maintained without testing, if new weapons are needed for deterrence, and if additional safety features are necessary to prevent terrorist threats. The National Nuclear Security Administration manages the nuclear weapons enterprise, which includes DOD agencies. The ability to maintain this enterprise without nuclear testing has been a long-standing issue. In 1963, the Joint Chiefs of Staff supported the LTBT with four safeguards, including an aggressive underground nuclear test program and the ability to resume atmospheric testing promptly. President Kennedy's assurance to observe these safeguards was crucial for Senate approval. The safeguards for nuclear testing have been observed over time, with modifications made as needed. Various nuclear test limitation treaties were negotiated between 1974 and 1990. The Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment mandated a moratorium on nuclear testing in 1992, leading to discussions on achieving a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). President Clinton extended the moratorium multiple times in response to the prospect of a permanent halt to testing. Congress and the President took steps to mandate a Stockpile. President Clinton announced his decision to seek a zero-yield CTBT in 1995, conditioning it on six safeguards including the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) and the ability to resume nuclear test activities if necessary. In the 1999 CTBT debate, concerns were raised about the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) as a key component of the U.S. nuclear weapons enterprise. Former officials questioned the program's maturity and ability to maintain existing weapons without testing. Some argued that testing is essential to ensure the functionality of nuclear weapons for deterrence. In the 1999 CTBT debate, concerns were raised about the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) and its ability to maintain nuclear weapons without testing. Former officials questioned the program's maturity and the potential loss of expertise with an indefinite-duration CTBT. Senator Olympia Snowe expressed doubts about unproven SSP methods. Senator Olympia Snowe and Senator John Warner expressed doubts about the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) and the reliability of unproven methods. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Secretary of Energy Richardson provided assurances about funding for nuclear weapons laboratories and the capability to test if needed. Secretary of Energy Richardson stressed the President's ability to withdraw from the treaty if confidence in the safety of nuclear weapons is not certified. Senator Carl Levin emphasized the importance of regular certification for the treaty's safeguards. President Clinton's safeguards have been in place since 1999, including the Stockpile Stewardship Program and facilities for scientists. The Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) has made significant progress under NNSA, with supporters citing its ability to sustain the safety, security, and reliability of the stockpile without underground testing. SSP has developed advanced computer models, powerful computers, the world's largest laser, and conducts nonnuclear experiments. Its surveillance program identifies and corrects warhead issues through the Life Extension Program (LEP). Life-extended W87 warheads have been successfully maintained. The Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) has made progress in sustaining the safety and reliability of the stockpile without underground testing. Life-extended W87 warheads have been certified for use. Richard Garwin believes confidence in existing nuclear weapons will increase with time. NNSA is planning to modernize the nuclear weapons. The Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) has made progress in sustaining the safety and reliability of the stockpile without underground testing. NNSA is planning to modernize the nuclear weapons production complex. SSP received about $42.2 billion for FY2001-FY2007, with current appropriations of $6.3 billion for FY2008 and a request of $6.6 billion for FY2009. Concerns exist among CTBT opponents regarding the lack of nuclear tests to validate stewardship tools, leading to uncertainty about the safety and reliability of the stockpile. Critics question the validity of computer models in predicting nuclear explosions, arguing that past test results do not guarantee future outcomes. Concerns are raised about the aging workforce in the nuclear weapons program and the decline in doctoral degrees in nuclear science. The decline in doctoral degrees in radiochemistry and nuclear chemistry at U.S. universities is concerning, with only 4 degrees earned in 2003 compared to 33 in 1968. Critics raise issues with the Stockpile Stewardship Program and the halt in U.S. nuclear weapon pit production in 1989. Ambassador Linton Brooks and John Foster express concerns about the increasing uncertainty in certifying warhead remanufacture and the need for new world-class tools in understanding nuclear weapon performance. The U.S. nuclear weapon production has been halted since 1989, leading to atrophied capabilities. Lack of underground tests since 1992 poses risks to stockpile safety and reliability. Life Extension Programs are needed to refurbish aging warheads, introducing risks of \"birth defects.\" Supporters claim readiness for nuclear testing, but opponents argue skills and equipment are declining without actual tests. The capability to test declines as skills atrophy, procedures become outdated, and equipment falls into disuse. Safeguards D and E do not deal with SSP. The U.S. withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 may make the prospect of withdrawal from the CTBT appear more credible. Testing was essential during the Cold War for both the United States and the Soviet Union to develop new weapons. In the 1999 debate, arguments over the treaty and deterrence played a minor part, with both sides agreeing on the importance of maintaining the nuclear deterrent. Opponents argued that without testing, it would be impossible to do so. The debate in 1999 questioned the reliability of the stockpile without testing. Supporters of the treaty believed America would maintain a safe nuclear deterrent. General Shelton confirmed unanimous support from top military leaders for the Treaty, ensuring a credible nuclear deterrent and safe stockpile. Support has continued for the nation to keep nuclear weapons since 1999. Supporters of the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program and the Life Extension Program (LEP) argue that their approaches will reduce the need for nuclear testing. However, some believe that testing is necessary for ensuring the safety and reliability of current warheads. RRW, a funded program since FY2005, aims to improve the reliability and longevity of existing weapons. The RRW program aims to replace some W76 warheads on Trident II missiles with WR1 warheads designed for post-Cold War requirements. Funding for RRW was eliminated in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act, leaving its future uncertain. NNSA claims RRW will reduce the need for testing by increasing confidence through design margins. The design of the WR1 warheads aims to meet post-Cold War requirements with added margin as a key goal. Confidence in the design is supported by past nuclear testing of similar components. Concerns have been raised by NNSA and its labs that repeated Life Extension Programs (LEPs) may introduce defects and make it harder to maintain reliability, potentially requiring nuclear testing in the future. The W76 LEP aims to replicate Cold War stockpile warheads, but concerns arise about potential defects in life-extended warheads due to challenges in replicating components and manufacturing processes precisely. Supporters of LEP question the high confidence provided by RRW, as birth defects or reliability issues are expected in new warheads. The uncertainty lies in whether these unreliabilities would be greater than those in existing warheads due to age. Supporters of Life Extension Programs (LEP) argue that current warheads have been tested extensively over the years, with a test base of 1,000 yield tests conducted during the era of nuclear testing. They question the need to replace tested devices with untested Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRW) and believe that LEP can maintain the reliability of existing warheads without further testing. LEP supporters also point out that the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) has been successful in addressing emerging issues, suggesting that replacing current warheads with RRWs may not be necessary. Supporters of Life Extension Programs (LEP) argue that current warheads have been extensively tested, with a test base of 1,000 yield tests conducted during the era of nuclear testing. They believe LEP can maintain the reliability of existing warheads without further testing. Some doubt the reliability of both LEP and Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRW), with concerns about untested RRWs and small changes undermining confidence in LEPs. SSP has enabled political assessments rather than technical evaluations. Critics argue that the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) has only allowed for political assessments, not technical ones, as its tools were never validated with nuclear tests. They believe that nuclear tests are necessary to ensure the reliability of both Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRW) and Life Extension Programs (LEP). The debate includes views that RRW may need testing more than LEP, LEP may need testing more than RRW, or that confidence in both RRW and LEP can only be assured through testing. One view suggests a mixed LEP-RRW force with a few current weapon types retained and the rest replaced with RRW types. Critics argue that maintaining existing weapons through LEP misses the point of deterrence. Current nuclear warheads have limitations due to their high yield designed during the Cold War. The United States may refrain from using weapons with high yield due to concerns about civilian casualties. Opponents of the treaty argue that current warheads' radiation output limits their effectiveness in destroying key targets like hardened bunkers. The United States may avoid using high-yield weapons to prevent civilian casualties. Critics argue that current warheads' radiation output hinders their ability to destroy deeply buried bunkers or key communications nodes. Some believe that new nuclear weapons with tailored designs may be necessary for specific missions, requiring testing to ensure their effectiveness. The 9/11 attacks raised concerns about nuclear terrorism and the link between nuclear weapons and deterrence of rogue states and terrorists. The Nuclear Posture Review of December 2001 emphasized the need for greater flexibility in nuclear forces and planning. US nuclear forces must still be capable of holding a wide range of target types at risk, despite the decline in the number of weapons needed. US nuclear forces require the capability to hold a wide range of target types at risk. The credibility of the US deterrent is seen to be enhanced by an ongoing underground nuclear test program, according to Vice Admiral Robert Monroe. Supporters of the CTBT argue that current nuclear weapons are sufficient for deterrence, as no adversary would risk their effectiveness. The norm against the use of nuclear weapons since 1945 makes their actual use unlikely, despite their capabilities. Current nuclear weapons have been argued to deter Russian or Chinese nuclear attacks, with U.S. conventional forces also deterring threats from other nations. Adversaries could potentially counter new U.S. nuclear capabilities, as weapons to destroy chemical or biological weapons could be defeated by placing them deep underground. Earth penetrator weapons may not reach these hidden weapons, making them difficult to locate. U.S. intelligence struggles to locate underground sites due to various defense tactics. Congressional actions suggest limited support for testing new weapons. Safety, security, use control, and denial are key aspects of surety in warhead protection. During the Cold War, nuclear testing was routine, ensuring the incorporation of surety features in warhead design. In 1999, CTBT opponents argued for new surety features in U.S. warheads, potentially requiring nuclear testing for implementation. Siegfried Hecker testified in 1997 on the necessity of adding surety features through testing. In 1997, Siegfried Hecker, then Director of Los Alamos, testified that a CTBT would hinder safety improvements for warhead safety. Robert Barker highlighted safety deficiencies in nuclear weapons, while Secretary of Energy Richardson stated that the stockpile was safe and reliable despite the lack of nuclear testing. The need for new surety features in U.S. nuclear weapons was debated, with some arguing for increased safety measures in light of the threat of terrorism post-9/11. Sidney Drell presented safety improvements in 1999, but the Department of Defense showed little interest in implementing them. Bailey and Barker emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety, security, and invulnerability of U.S. nuclear weapons. In the aftermath of 9/11, the importance of surety in U.S. nuclear weapons has increased. The prompt response to the threat of terrorist attacks has been costly, with added physical security measures. It is argued that incorporating use-denial features could lessen the burden on guard forces and enhance deterrence. The potential for terrorists to seize and use U.S. nuclear weapons for attacks is a significant concern, making it challenging to deter them effectively. In the aftermath of 9/11, the importance of surety in U.S. nuclear weapons has increased. Enhanced surety features are hoped to deter attacks by creating an unacceptable consequence, with the potential to defeat them if they occur. Livermore argues that surety features can be added without testing, essential for obtaining them through the RRW design. CTBT supporters dismiss enhanced surety as an argument for testing, believing current weapons are safe enough. The debate over the need for additional surety features in U.S. nuclear weapons continues, with some arguing that current weapons are safe enough and that new features could be costly to implement. Critics believe that testing is not necessary to enhance surety, while opponents of the CTBT advocate for more surety in light of the terrorist threat. They maintain that current warheads are not as secure as they could be and that testing is essential to increase their surety. The debate over the need for additional surety features in U.S. nuclear weapons continues, with some arguing that testing is necessary to enhance surety. Monitoring and verification are key aspects of the debate on nuclear test bans, with monitoring involving looking for indicators of nuclear tests and verification focusing on compliance with treaty obligations. Treaty opponents raise doubts about monitoring capability and claim that evasion capability is improving. The CTBT focuses on effective verification of treaty compliance through monitoring systems. Monitoring provides data, while verification assesses compliance. Nations determine violations, with monitoring, military value of tests, and detection thresholds being interconnected. The CTBT focuses on effective verification of treaty compliance through monitoring systems. Tests above 0.1 kiloton had significant military value, but the threshold of detection was 10 kilotons. CTBT opponents argue the detection threshold is high and military value is low, while supporters claim the opposite. The treaty bans certain activities, discusses monitoring technologies and their capabilities, considers advantages of clandestine testing, and the risks of cheating. The 1999 public debate on ratification did not delve into the technical aspects of monitoring the CTBT. The CTBT focuses on effective verification of treaty compliance through monitoring systems. Scientists have made advances in detection capability since 1999, with reports favoring the treaty. Despite few rebuttals to technical progress claims, CTBT opponents have developed arguments for future debates. The treaty's basic obligation is to prohibit nuclear weapon test explosions. The CTBT does not define \"nuclear explosion,\" leading to concerns about undetectable low-yield tests. Critics debated whether the treaty prohibits very low yield tests, with some citing Russian intentions to continue hydronuclear tests. Senator Richard Shelby highlighted the differing definitions of zero between Russia and the U.S. The CTBT prohibits all nuclear explosions, regardless of yield or location. Critics raised concerns about Russia conducting low-yield tests, but officials clarified that the treaty bans any nuclear test explosion. Ambassador Ledogar emphasized the comprehensive ban on all nuclear explosions. Some critics questioned if Russia truly committed to a comprehensive ban on all nuclear explosions, including low-yield tests. However, the record of negotiations confirms that Russia, along with other P-5 members, did commit to this ban. The public record of statements by high level Russian officials confirms their commitment to a comprehensive ban on all nuclear explosions, including low-yield tests. The issue of thresholds and determining permitted activities under the CTBT remains unresolved. The CTBT leaves it to individual State Parties to decide if a test exceeding zero yield violates the Treaty. Monitoring for compliance has always been a challenge, especially for underground tests. The LTBT banned tests in the atmosphere, space, and underwater due to detection difficulties. Detection and evasion of underground tests are the focus of this section. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) establishes a monitoring system, including the International Monitoring System (IMS) and on-site inspections (OSIs) for detecting nuclear tests. The treaty aims to ensure compliance with the prohibition of nuclear explosions. The CTBTO established a Preparatory Commission to implement the IMS and IDC for monitoring nuclear explosions. The IMS includes 321 stations worldwide for monitoring seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound, and radionuclide signals. 50 seismic stations are primary, providing real-time data to the IDC, while 120 are auxiliary stations. As of November 26, 2007, the CTBTO had certified 37 primary seismic stations, 76 auxiliary seismic stations, 10 hydroacoustic stations, 37 infrasound arrays, 47 radionuclide stations, and 9 radionuclide laboratories. The United States operates the U.S. Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS) through the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), which is a global network of nuclear event detection sensors. The USAEDS, operated by the United States through AFTAC, utilizes various sensors for nuclear explosion monitoring, including seismic stations and detectors on satellites. While USAEDS focuses on U.S. concerns, the International Monitoring System (IMS) maintains a global detection network to prevent any nation from feeling singled out. IMS provides data to all signatory states, including the U.S., and some nations may find IMS data more credible than USAEDS data. The International Monitoring System (IMS) provides data to all signatory states, including the U.S., and some nations may find IMS data more credible than USAEDS data. IMS, along with academic institutions and national governments, operate thousands of seismic stations worldwide, which may feed information to IMS on an ad hoc basis. There is general agreement that IMS will be able to detect nuclear explosions effectively. The International Monitoring System (IMS) provides data to signatory states, including the U.S., and operates seismic stations worldwide. IMS is expected to detect most nonevasive tests at 1 kiloton or less, with a detection threshold for underground tests significantly better than 1 kiloton. The 2006 North Korean nuclear test, with a yield less than a kiloton, was detected by IMS and non-IMS stations. Seismology has been used for decades to detect earthquakes and explosions, with difficulty in differentiating between conventional and low-yield nuclear explosions. Various techniques, such as seismic arrays, help extract more information from seismic waves. Seismic waves, including teleseismic waves, travel long distances and can be detected by various techniques. Shear waves and pressure waves generated by earthquakes and explosions differ in appearance on a seismogram, providing clues to the type of event. Regional seismic waves are now used to differentiate between earthquakes and explosions. Regional seismic waves are used to differentiate between earthquakes and explosions, observed up to 2,000 km away. The direction and magnitude of these waves can help determine the event's location and yield. The CTBT limits OSI areas to 1000 sq. km, with critics mentioning \"decoupling\" as a method to evade seismic detection. Critics of the CTBT point to \"decoupling\" as a way to avoid seismic detection by setting off blasts in underground cavities to muffle seismic signals. A 1966 experiment in Mississippi showed that a 0.38 kiloton explosion appeared much smaller on seismic readings. Larry Turnbull of the CIA stated that constructing large cavities to contain nuclear explosion debris is feasible and cost-effective. The feasibility of a nuclear device containing debris in salt and hard rock is discussed, with the scenario of cavity decoupling evasion deemed credible for underground CTB monitoring. The National Academy of Sciences report highlights difficulties in conducting decoupled tests, stating that larger explosions cannot be reliably hidden if the yield exceeds 1 or 2 kilotons. Critics argue that decoupling could still be concealed. Kathleen Bailey and Robert Barker reject the claim that earth and rock removal would indicate decoupling. CTBT advocates argue that the example from India is not valid for detecting decoupling. A decoupled test would require excavation of far more material, such as a cavity 37 meters in radius. Opponents of CTBT argue that decoupling could still be concealed. The volume of material for a non-decoupled 3-kiloton test is 1,327 cubic meters. CTBT opponents suggest that excavation could be hidden from satellites by removing material when satellites are not overhead or moving it underground in existing tunnels. Aqueous excavation in salt domes could also be used. Iran's salt domes pose challenges for seismic detection. Supporters of the treaty highlight advances in seismological monitoring, including the International Monitoring System (IMS) providing real-time data from seismic stations worldwide. The International Monitoring System (IMS) provides real-time seismic data to the International Data Center, with stations in inaccessible areas like Iran. Regional seismic stations are crucial for detecting low-yield tests and decoupling, as they enhance the ability to detect cavity decoupling compared to teleseismic waves. Regional stations have proven more valuable than expected, improving the IMS's ability to locate and characterize seismic events. The IMS benefits from auxiliary stations for identifying seismic events like earthquakes or explosions by picking up specific seismic waves. Having many seismic stations complements IMS stations and increases data availability. Other signatures, such as event depth and location, help differentiate between earthquakes and explosions. The CTBTO Preparatory Commission states that IMS stations detected the North Korean nuclear test of 2006, locating it to under 1000 square km. Seismologists identified characteristics of the event as an explosion, including impulsive onset of compressional waves and weak peaks indicative of shear waves, distinguishing it from an earthquake. Critics point to weaknesses in seismic monitoring for detecting clandestine nuclear testing at shallow depths. Seismic signals can be influenced by local properties of the Earth's crust, affecting the apparent yield of a nuclear device. Yield calculation from seismic waves may not accurately reflect the actual yield due to various factors. An evader could exploit this knowledge to select a test site. The State Department notes the importance of having close-in seismographs around nuclear test sites like Novaya Zemlya and Lop Nor to improve detection of smaller events and determine their nature and origin time. Iran's extensive experience in drilling for oil near salt domes raises concerns that they could easily create cavities for decoupling nuclear tests. Critics argue that Iran's seismic activity could allow them to mask test signals during earthquakes, but others believe it would be difficult to hide the signals completely. Don Linger, a Senior Scientific Advisor, suggests that other techniques can reduce seismic signals from underground nuclear tests. Don Linger, Senior Scientific Advisor, Advanced Systems Concepts Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, explains how conducting underground nuclear tests in hard rock geology regions with previous tests can weaken seismic signals through geologic preconditioning. This technique involves fracturing the surrounding rock, which absorbs more energy and attenuates the seismic signal. This was observed in experiments using chemical explosives conducted by the U.S. Departments of Defense. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency conducted tests in Kazakhstan and Novaya Zemlya from 1993 to 2002 to muffle seismic signals of clandestine tests. Geologic preconditioning involves fracturing rock to weaken seismic signals, while radiation spectrum tuning reduces radiation coupling of nuclear devices to the ground. This technology is well understood by the testing community. The radiation spectrum of nuclear explosives can affect seismic signals. Different energy spectra can produce varying seismic signals. Geologic preconditioning may benefit certain countries with existing cavities from nuclear tests. Opponents question the effectiveness of this argument. Seismic monitoring arguments include concerns about detecting lower-yield tests and the increased number of seismic events to analyze. Improved seismic detection and data analysis capabilities help rule out most events as possible explosions. Improved seismic detection and data analysis capabilities can rule out most events as possible explosions. Critics argue that low-yield explosions have military significance, as seen in the North Korean test of October 2006. Radioactive noble gases like argon-37 and xenon-133 are of special interest in detecting underground nuclear explosions. The Automated Radioxenon Sampler/Analyzer used by IMS detects radioactive xenon isotopes released from underground nuclear explosions. This system can pinpoint the source of the release by analyzing atmospheric conditions and comparing data to background levels. Upon entry into force of the CTBT, IMS aims to have 80 radionuclide stations worldwide, with 40 capable of monitoring radioactive noble gases. Sixteen laboratories will analyze the data collected. The CTBTO PrepCom states that monitoring radioactive noble gases can distinguish between materials from a nuclear reactor and a nuclear explosion. The presence of noble gases can indicate an underground explosion. Supporters cite the 2006 North Korean nuclear test as evidence of noble gas monitoring's value. An IMS radionuclide system in Canada detected elevated levels of xenon-133 two weeks after the test, aiding in source identification. Analysts used data from Chalk River Laboratories to link xenon-133 release to the DPRK event. Opponents argue that containment methods can prevent noble gas detection. Donald Barr suggests deep burial and gas blocking techniques can limit noble gas seepage. CTBT supporters argue that containing noble gases after an underground nuclear explosion is challenging due to their ability to rise to the surface through faults or fractures. Experimental data suggests that noble gases can escape, especially during low barometric pressure. However, opponents point out that the experiment used surrogate gases, not argon and xenon. The decay of argon-37 to chlorine-37 limits the window for surface detection, and timing a challenge inspection to coincide with weather fronts may be necessary. The timing of challenge inspections, including weather fronts, is crucial for detecting underground nuclear explosions. Fallout analysis has been key in identifying nuclear tests, leading to treaties like the LTBT in 1963. The LTBT was established in 1963 due to worldwide protests against fallout. CTBT supporters argue that containing radioactive debris from nuclear tests is challenging, as various factors like geologic features, soil types, and burial depth affect containment. Despite experience with underground tests, radioactive material was still released in U.S. tests until 1970. Supporters believe it would be difficult for countries like Russia or China, and especially first-time testers, to confidently contain clandestine tests. CTBT opponents argue that countries like Russia and China, with test experience, could confidently contain nuclear tests. They cite the U.S.'s post-Baneberry test actions to improve containment. Even nations without test experience could learn from open literature to enhance containment by burying devices deeper and selecting suitable test sites. Treaty supporters highlight Soviet nuclear test data as evidence. The treaty's supporters point to Soviet nuclear test data at Novaya Zemlya to show containment difficulties. Of 30 tests from 1971 to 1990, 10 vented gases offsite, 7 vented onsite, 1 vented gases and debris offsite, and 10 were contained. Opponents argue for improved containment, noting 10 of 16 tests vented offsite from 1971 to August 1978, and 6 vented onsite only from September 1978 to 1990. This technique was developed in the early 1990s for studying ground deformation around earthquakes using satellite-borne radar. InSAR is a technique using satellite radar to study ground deformation around earthquakes. It can detect movements of less than 1 cm, works day or night, and can see through clouds. It has been used to monitor oil and gas reservoirs and measure stability of retaining walls. The CTBT permits the use of InSAR technology for monitoring underground nuclear tests. InSAR can detect depressions caused by tests, localize suspicious sites, and discriminate between earthquakes and explosions. It complements other monitoring techniques and can guide an OSI. InSAR technology can distinguish between earthquakes and explosions by analyzing ground deformation patterns. It can help locate decoupling cavities and its wide availability could strengthen a request for an OSI. Critics argue that InSAR requires before-and-after images to detect subsidence accurately, limiting its effectiveness for smaller nuclear tests. The State Department highlights limitations in using InSAR technology for detecting subsidence after nuclear tests. While various agencies have InSAR systems and data libraries, rugged terrain and terrain shadowing can lead to uncovered areas. Before images need to be recent for accurate comparisons, and natural factors can affect the terrain, making the before image unusable. Subsidence may also occur years after the test, making existing data libraries insufficient without specific tasking. The State Department notes limitations in using InSAR technology for detecting subsidence after nuclear tests. Critics argue that subsidence could occur too late to aid an OSI, while supporters believe InSAR can deter evasion by forcing deeper burial and the use of smaller nuclear devices. The CTBT supporters argue that national technical means like satellite photography and communications intercepts can detect pre-test activities, allowing for inspections. CTBT opponents acknowledge satellite capabilities but argue that some activities may appear normal, while others can be hidden to evade detection. The treaty and a protocol provide for on-site inspections by international inspectors. The treaty and protocol allow for on-site inspections (OSIs) by international inspectors to search for evidence of a nuclear explosion. Detailed procedures are outlined for authorizing and conducting inspections, balancing the need for thoroughness with concerns about revealing military secrets. The Senate debate on OSIs in 1999 focused on the difficulty of securing Executive Council permission for inspections. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick questioned the council's competence in making technical decisions related to the treaty, highlighting the lack of nuclear experience among council members. Senator Richard Shelby expressed concerns about the process being challenging. The Senate debate in 1999 highlighted the political nature of bodies involved in OSI decisions. Senator Richard Shelby doubted the possibility of obtaining a 30-vote supermajority, while Senator Joseph Biden believed it was achievable due to self-interest. Concerns were raised about how treaty provisions could impact inspection success, with opponents arguing some provisions hinder effectiveness. The protocol limits inspection team size and duration, raising concerns about technical qualifications of inspectors. The availability of qualified inspectors affects OSI timeline. The protocol allows for specific inspection techniques but not new ones, which may be a concern with advancing technologies. Inspections require a progress report within 25 days, with continuation subject to council approval. The protocol permits one 12-hour overflight using limited equipment unless agreed otherwise by the inspected state. The State Department notes that a State Party conducting a test will try to evade detection and restrict the use of detection technologies during an OSI. The inspected state has the final say on access for the inspection team, especially in sensitive areas where equipment may be shrouded and measurements limited. Access to sensitive facilities is granted if the inspection team proves the need credibly. The inspection team must demonstrate the need for access to buildings and structures credibly to the inspected State Party. Supporters of the treaty believe that the inspection provisions strike a balance between finding evidence of clandestine tests and protecting sensitive facilities. They argue that the provisions benefit the United States and other nations by facilitating inspections. Inspectors are selected based on expertise and experience, with the ability to inspect a 1,000 square kilometer area. Supporters of the treaty believe that the inspection protocol allows for various technologies to be used, including visual observation, environmental sampling, and seismic monitoring. Inspectors may also drill for samples and analyze them with highly sensitive techniques. The Executive Council can approve inspections, which may last up to 25 days, but termination is unlikely unless a majority vote disapproves. Supporters of the treaty believe that gaining approval for inspections by a supermajority is unlikely after 25 days. Technical aspects of On-Site Inspections (OSIs) have been a topic of discussion for over 50 years, with clues such as disrupted vegetation, radioactivity, and road displacement being key indicators of a nuclear test. The most conclusive evidence of a nuclear test is radioactive debris obtained by drilling into the radioactive zone. The technical capability to support On-Site Inspections (OSIs) has improved over the years, with advancements in satellite imagery, seismic data analysis, and InSAR technology. These tools help in detecting human activity, distinguishing earthquakes from explosions, and narrowing down search areas for radioactive isotopes. Despite challenges in finding conclusive proof of clandestine nuclear tests, drilling into radioactive zones remains a key method. OSIs face challenges in finding conclusive proof of clandestine nuclear tests, as drilling into underground cavities to retrieve radioactive debris is difficult. The size of the cavity created by an explosion varies based on yield, geology, and burial depth, potentially resulting in surface craters. Practical problems may arise, but detection of xenon-133 and argon-37 could provide evidence of a test within 50-80 days for a 1-kiloton explosion. Detection of argon-37, a noble gas isotope unique to underground tests, poses challenges for On-Site Inspections (OSIs). The procedure involves extensive air sampling, noble gas separation, and shielding samples from ambient background for accurate measurements. This process may be difficult to execute in the field, hindering the ability to provide conclusive proof of clandestine nuclear tests. CTBT advocates believe that On-Site Inspections (OSIs) can serve as a deterrent against clandestine nuclear tests by making it harder for nations to evade detection. Critics argue that careful evasion tactics could undermine the effectiveness of OSIs. Critics of the CTBT argue that evasion tactics could undermine the effectiveness of On-Site Inspections (OSIs) by making it difficult for nations to request them, as they may not be confident in locating a test or even knowing if one occurred. Additionally, critics believe that the U.S. monitoring system may have capabilities that it is unwilling to reveal, allowing evaders to avoid detection. Furthermore, opponents of the treaty suggest that nations could learn the capabilities of the International Monitoring System (IMS) by conducting test explosions and observing the IMS response, ultimately leading to a focus on evasion tactics rather than compliance. Critics of the CTBT argue that the provision for On-Site Inspections (OSIs) could be exploited by evaders to claim innocence based on the absence of a request or unsuccessful inspection. Robert Monroe, former Director of Defense Nuclear Agency, emphasizes the challenges of addressing verification issues in an unclassified environment, stating that adversaries could use advancements in sensor technology to improve their nuclear weapons capabilities while avoiding detection. Potential adversaries are prioritizing improving evasion techniques for their nuclear weapons in absolute secrecy to avoid detection. The U.S. intelligence community is the only organization countering them, with highly classified information on evasion improvements. An unclassified study may focus on verification improvements but not evasion, leading to a false belief in CTBT verification capabilities. The author, with extensive experience in nuclear weapons, believes evaders have an advantage in undetected testing and expect it to improve. Supporters of the treaty argue that unclassified information, such as data from seismometers worldwide, can help reveal clandestine nuclear testing. While technical monitoring has its limitations, human intelligence can be unreliable due to disinformation and incomplete information. Basing conclusions on the absence of evidence may be misleading. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's quote \"the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\" is discussed in the context of nuclear testing treaties. Supporters argue that monitoring capabilities are sufficient for verification, while critics present scenarios that could undermine verification efforts. One such scenario, decoupling, is mentioned, along with two others that could pose challenges to detecting clandestine nuclear tests. Robert Barker, former Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy, suggests a scenario where a nation could conduct a nuclear test in a remote ocean area, ensuring that the test remains undetected and unattributed by using materials from different nations to confuse the origin of debris. This would allow the testing nation to analyze the test performance without being positively identified. The National Academy of Sciences study discusses the challenges of attributing a nuclear test, especially if conducted underwater or in the atmosphere. Donald Barr, a retired Los Alamos radiochemist, believes it is nearly impossible to disguise the signatures of a nuclear explosive detonation. It is virtually impossible to disguise the signatures of a nuclear explosive detonation due to the broad range of fission products and actinide radionuclides produced instantaneously. Any attempt to tamper with these distributions would be detected through radiochemical data analysis and comparison with U.S. test data. Critics argue that attribution relies on matching radioactive material samples, while supporters believe detection of nuclear test debris would trigger immediate investigation efforts. Debris from a nuclear test would prompt a global effort to attribute the test, with the list of potential testers being small. Supporters argue that multiple tests are needed for confidence in a warhead design, while opponents believe one successful test may be enough. It is possible to conceal test signatures by conducting a nuclear test in a large underground cavity to avoid detection. Deep burial in Earth's surface could hide nuclear test activity from satellite detection. Use of a mine as a cover story for human activity and to conceal excavation material. Access to IMS data could aid in evasion techniques. Containment can fail due to unknown geology factors. Satellite photography may reveal suspicious activity, and evaders may not know U.S. monitoring capabilities. The growing archive of background noise and technical progress in monitoring reduce the threshold for evaders to feel confident of success. Evaders with little nuclear test experience may not have a precise estimate of weapon yield, making it harder to evade detection. Supporters argue that the treaty would make evasion more difficult, while concerns remain about the verifiability of the zero yield test ban. The treaty's zero yield test ban is difficult to verify, as tests below a certain level are undetectable. This could allow countries like Russia to develop new nuclear weapons. Former Secretaries of Defense and experts have expressed concerns about the military advantages of undetected testing at low yield levels. Subkiloton nuclear testing is seen as potentially useful for certain nuclear designs. The value of subkiloton nuclear testing for certain designs was highlighted in a 1995 report by the JASON defense advisory group. Testing under a 500 ton yield limit could allow studies critical for achieving full primary design yield. Bruce Tarter of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory stated that 500 tons would be the minimum nuclear test yield of value for validating tools used to assess weapon performance. Low-yield weapons are considered more valuable now for new or current nuclear powers, even within the 1 to 2 kiloton range. The NAS report states that one to two kilotons can be significant for proliferators, who can now accurately deliver such low yields with commercially available technology. Low yield underground tests of devices with tons to hundreds of tons yields can be scaled up to strategic yields, posing a challenge for detection. This could impact the US security posture, especially considering its nuclear umbrella for allies. The US provides a nuclear umbrella to allies like South Korea, Japan, and Turkey to deter attacks. Russia has developed low yield \"clean\" nuclear weapons, drawing on past Soviet technology. China may also be developing low-yield weapons. US nuclear weapons are mostly high yield from the Cold War era. This could impact US security posture, especially regarding its allies. The Russian inventory of low yield tactical nuclear weapons could challenge the credibility of the U.S. nuclear umbrella with its asymmetry. This could potentially lead to nuclear nonproliferation as U.S. allies may feel pressured to develop their own nuclear weapons. Supporters of the treaty argue that low-yield weapons may not significantly impact the strategic balance, citing the abundance of nuclear weapons of various yields in the nation's arsenal. General James Cartwright stated that while he would consider supporting the development of low-yield weapons in response to a \"grave\" threat, he has not seen such a scenario to date. Cartwright's priority is not reduced yield but to improve accuracy to the point where conventional weapons can replace nuclear ones. Evasion scenarios could be linked to weapons development, with low yield tests providing data for weapons design. Decoupled tests could aid in designing fission weapons, and conducting atmospheric tests in remote areas could develop higher-yield weapons while avoiding detection. Alternatively, if a nation is given a weapon design, a single full-yield test could be sufficient. The NAS report suggests that low-yield tests are of little value for weapons development, with tests up to 1 to 2 kilotons potentially concealable. Tests up to 20 kilotons are unlikely to be concealed and could be used for proof-testing fission weapons or for eventual development of low-yield weapons. The NAS report suggests that tests above 20 kilotons could not be concealed and could be used for developing boosted fission and thermonuclear weapons. Nations with more test experience could make progress in weapons programs through covert testing, but the threat posed by their existing nuclear weapons is already significant. CTBT supporters argue that the United States has advanced significantly in its nuclear capability through SSP, despite differences in approach with Russia. They believe that the U.S. nuclear weapons program is in a better position compared to Russia or China, even with the possibility of clandestine testing. The NAS report highlights the limited benefits of clandestine nuclear testing under a CTBT regime, stating that the risks of cheating would need to be carefully weighed. The worst-case scenario of clandestine testing within monitoring constraints is seen as less threatening to U.S. security interests compared to the risks posed by sophisticated nuclear weapons in the hands of multiple adversaries under a no-CTBT regime. In the 1999 debate, the focus was on the feasibility of successful cheating in nuclear testing and the potential military gains. Little attention was given to the risks of being caught, which is crucial for evaders to consider. Possible alternative scenarios are discussed, suggesting that there may be few consequences for clandestine testing under the CTBT regime. The U.N. could take action or delay based on inconclusive evidence. Further research is needed in this area. The 1999 debate focused on the feasibility and potential gains of cheating in nuclear testing, with little consideration for the risks of being caught. Possible scenarios suggest few consequences for clandestine testing under the CTBT regime, with the U.N. possibly imposing sanctions or nations withdrawing from the treaty to conduct tests openly. The nuclear nonproliferation regime aims to prevent nuclear proliferation, which is a major security threat. Nations may choose clandestine testing to avoid detection and sanctions, as withdrawing from the treaty could lead to penalties. Experts agree that nuclear proliferation, especially by terrorists, poses a significant risk to the United States. The nuclear nonproliferation regime, consisting of treaties and agreements like the NPT, aims to prevent nuclear proliferation. However, concerns arise due to North Korea's nuclear test in 2006 and Iran's nuclear program potentially leading to weapon development. Many nations are expected to start nuclear power programs, raising concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation. There are worries about unsecured nuclear weapons in Pakistan and the potential for another proliferation network like A.Q. Khan's. The threat of terrorists obtaining nuclear weapons is also a concern. The CTBT is supported as a way to promote nonproliferation. The CTBT is supported as a means to slow proliferation and as a step towards nuclear disarmament. Opponents argue that the treaty would weaken deterrence and that nonproliferation and disarmament are not linked. Greg Mello emphasizes that the nonproliferation value of U.S. CTBT ratification depends on other U.S. policies. The CTBT's nonproliferation value depends on how it is implemented, with concerns that ratifying the treaty while maintaining a nuclear arsenal could be seen as a double standard. Merely having the CTBT is not enough to improve foreign relations, as true progress would involve freedom from nuclear deterrence. The CTBT's impact on nuclear nonproliferation may not be significant, as the United States has made progress in this area without ratifying the treaty. The argument is that the strategic balance still favors the US, regardless of whether other countries have tested nuclear weapons clandestinely. The CTBT supporters argue that the treaty would contribute to nuclear nonproliferation by making specific technical advancements. Richard Garwin testified that nuclear weapons can be built without testing, but doubts about their performance will always remain. He compared the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs to a two-stage thermonuclear bomb tested in 1957, highlighting the importance of testing in advancing nuclear capabilities. General John Shalikashvili emphasized the importance of the CTBT in limiting nuclear capabilities. The treaty would prevent countries like India, Pakistan, and China from certain nuclear developments, reducing the risk of nuclear proliferation. Treaty supporters argue that the IMS would complement U.S. monitoring systems to enhance nuclear nonproliferation efforts. Garwin argued that China would need to test to develop new weapons, as acquiring secret information on thermonuclear weapons cannot be turned into deployable weapons without forbidden tests under the CTBT. CTBT opponents believe a strong nuclear force is crucial for nonproliferation, with the U.S. \"nuclear umbrella\" reassuring allies and reducing their need for nuclear weapons. The United States has extended security assurances to 31 countries, including NATO nations, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Israel. NATO documents emphasize the importance of the strategic nuclear forces of the Alliance, particularly those of the United States. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reaffirmed the US commitment to meeting its deterrent and security commitments to Japan after a North Korean nuclear test in 2006. Minister Aso emphasized Japan's reliance on the Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States for defense, reaffirmed by Secretary Rice. Secretary Rumsfeld reiterated the U.S. commitment to South Korea under the Mutual Defense Treaty, including the nuclear umbrella. CTBT opponents stress the need to maintain the credibility of the nuclear deterrent through ongoing efforts. Robert Barker highlighted the importance of confidence in the effectiveness of the nuclear deterrent for sustaining credibility. Opponents believe the U.S. nuclear deterrent must adapt to changing threats to maintain credibility. Concerns have been raised about the deterioration of the nuclear weapons program and the outdated stockpile of weapons designed for the Cold War. The need for transformation from massive retaliation to addressing modern threats is emphasized. The U.S. nuclear weapons program, designed for the Cold War, is aging and becoming irrelevant. The nation's nuclear infrastructure has deteriorated, with no new weapons designed, tested, or produced. Testing is seen as necessary to restore confidence in the U.S. nuclear deterrent and reduce the risk of proliferation. According to Robert Monroe, the aging Cold War nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal are no longer effective in deterring proliferating adversaries who have hidden their facilities underground. To be credible deterrents, new weapons with high accuracy, low yields, and tailored outputs are needed, requiring nuclear testing. CTBT supporters argue against developing new weapons, fearing it will hinder nuclear nonproliferation efforts. Former Senator Sam Nunn emphasized the importance of modernizing the U.S. nuclear deterrent to address current threats. Former Senator Sam Nunn and former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown expressed concerns about the push for new low-yield nuclear weapons and designs, warning that it could complicate nonproliferation efforts and alienate allies. Nunn emphasized the need to modernize the U.S. nuclear deterrent to address current threats. CTBT supporters believe in a world without nuclear weapons to prevent proliferation, while opponents see no connection between nonproliferation and disarmament. CTBT opponents do not see a logical linkage between nonproliferation and disarmament. They argue that supporters are misinterpreting Article VI of the NPT to imply a binding legal obligation for nuclear-weapon states to give up nuclear weapons. Supporters argue that the CTBT is a necessary step towards nonproliferation and disarmament, citing commitments made by the United States and other nuclear-weapon states in 1995 and 2000. The NPT allows for review conferences every five years, with the 1995 conference deciding to extend the treaty indefinitely through a controversial package of decisions. The 1995 and 2000 commitments by nuclear-weapon states emphasized the importance of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) for nonproliferation and disarmament. The 2000 NPT review conference highlighted the urgency of achieving universal ratification of the CTBT without delay. These commitments were crucial in securing the indefinite extension of the NPT and a successful outcome of the conference. The international community overwhelmingly supports the CTBT, with 178 nations signing and 144 ratifying the treaty. The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution stressing the importance of its earliest entry into force. The treaty is closely linked to nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament, as stated by representatives from Japan and Nigeria. The CTBT has widespread international support, with 178 nations signing and 144 ratifying the treaty. The final declaration of the conference emphasized the importance of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Gen. John Shalikashvili highlighted the link between the CTBT and nuclear nonproliferation, stating that non-ratification complicates efforts to strengthen safeguards. The Test Ban Treaty is crucial for non-proliferation efforts, supported by key figures like George Shultz and Henry Kissinger. Linking disarmament goals with practical steps is seen as a bold initiative that aligns with America's moral values. Without bold actions, the vision of a nuclear-free world may not be perceived as realistic or urgent. Initiating a bipartisan process with the Senate to achieve ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is crucial for non-proliferation efforts. Failure to observe the disarmament end of the bargain may undermine cooperation on nonproliferation. Margaret Beckett warns that efforts on non-proliferation will be undermined if nuclear weapon states abandon their commitment to disarmament. The importance of disarmament lies in maintaining international support for non-proliferation efforts, as failure to do so may allow Iran and North Korea to shift blame for their nuclear ambitions onto nuclear weapon states. The moderate majority of states, crucial allies in non-proliferation, urge further action to prevent this scenario. The NPT is crucial and should not be left solely to \"groupies\" with disconnected agendas. Success in the 2000 review was due to diplomatic efforts by the Clinton Administration. CTBT opponents argue that many nations rely on the U.S. nuclear umbrella and do not need their own nuclear weapons. The NNWS are the main beneficiaries of the NPT, creating inequality between NWS and NNWS. The International Security Advisory Board emphasizes the importance of U.S. assurances, including the nuclear umbrella, in preventing nuclear proliferation. They warn that reducing this umbrella could lead to increased proliferation in East Asia and the Middle East. Opponents argue that U.S. nuclear forces already play a significant role in nonproliferation efforts and question the necessity of the CTBT for this purpose. The U.S. has taken many steps to counter proliferation since 1999, including initiatives like the Proliferation Security Initiative and UN Security Council Resolution 1540. Efforts have been made to secure nuclear weapons in Russia, combat nuclear terrorism, and engage in talks with North Korea. Despite Senate rejection of the CTBT, opponents argue that U.S. nonproliferation efforts have not been hindered. The State Department highlights U.S. actions over the past 20 years in disarmament. The U.S. has made significant progress in disarmament over the past 20 years, including dismantling thousands of nuclear weapons, converting fissile material for civil reactors, and providing threat reduction assistance to the former Soviet Union. Despite opposition to the CTBT, opponents argue that these efforts can continue without ratification. The concept of nuclear abolition is seen as unrealistic due to the large number of existing weapons. Former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and former Director of Central Intelligence John Deutch argue that the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons is counterproductive and unrealistic. They believe that nuclear weapons play a role in deterrence and contribute to U.S. security and international stability. The opponents of the CTBT see the treaty as unenforceable and doubt the ability of the international community to effectively disarm. They point to past conflicts and difficulties in imposing sanctions on countries like Iran as reasons for their skepticism. Supporters of nuclear disarmament argue that while there is no technical means to verify the number of warheads possessed by China and Russia, norms and sanctions can still have an impact. They point to examples like South Africa, Argentina, and Brazil giving up nuclear weapon programs, as well as Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus relinquishing nuclear weapons when they became independent states. However, they acknowledge that nuclear disarmament is a long-term goal and not something that can be achieved quickly. The United Kingdom, for instance, plans to maintain its submarine-based nuclear deterrent despite ratifying the CTBT. Supporters of nuclear disarmament believe in setting disarmament as a goal and taking steps towards it, such as ratifying the CTBT. They argue that a resumption of U.S. nuclear testing could lead to a proliferation cascade, with countries like Russia, China, and Iran conducting tests in response. This could pose a threat to global security and lead to increased tensions. In a scenario where multiple nations feel the need for nuclear programs to deter threats, the risk of nuclear war and terrorism would increase significantly. Supporters question the necessity of nuclear testing, pointing out that many countries have ratified the CTBT, including Japan, South Korea, EU members, and most NATO countries. Members of NATO, excluding the United States, have ratified the CTBT, linking nonproliferation and the treaty. The CTBT is seen as crucial for maintaining the nuclear nonproliferation bargain and upholding commitments to reduce nuclear weapons. U.S. ratification could pressure other non-ratifying states like China, India, Egypt, Israel, and Iran to clarify their nuclear policies. The U.S. moratorium on nuclear testing since 1992 is seen as compliance with the NPT's Article VI, supporting nonproliferation. Supporters argue for ratifying the CTBT, believing it would influence other countries to do the same and improve chances for the treaty's entry into force. The CTBT offers a permanent and legally binding commitment to end nuclear testing, with supporters urging the United States to ratify the treaty for positive ramifications on arms control and disarmament. The 2007 Conference emphasized the importance of the treaty's entry into force for global security. The CTBT aims to end nuclear testing, with supporters highlighting the treaty's on-site inspection provisions as a deterrent to nuclear weapons programs. Opponents question the effectiveness of ratifying the treaty, citing past Senate rejection and the requirement for \"Annex 2\" states to ratify for it to enter into force. The CTBT aims to end nuclear testing, with key Annex 2 states like China, the US, and North Korea potentially ratifying the treaty. Indonesia is likely to ratify, but a Middle-East Grand Bargain would be needed for Israel, Egypt, and Iran to follow suit. India's decision to ratify the CTBT hinges on various factors, including China's commitment and Pakistan's stance. The possibility of a Middle East agreement involving Egypt, Iran, and Israel is uncertain, especially if Israel remains unwilling to ratify the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state. Israel's reluctance to ratify the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state since 1970 raises doubts about its willingness to ratify the CTBT. Despite other pressing Middle East issues, U.S. ratification of the CTBT could provide leverage to encourage other nations to join. Supporters believe U.S. ratification would demonstrate a commitment to multilateralism and help secure international cooperation. The CTBT aims to 'stop' proliferation and 'prevent' the improvement of arsenals, emphasizing the rule of law, binding commitments, multilateralism, verification, and transparency. Even if some Annex 2 states do not ratify, the international community could pressure non-members not to test and impose sanctions if they do. U.S. ratification could mobilize support against testing nations, with President Reagan setting conditions for U.S. approval. The treaty's supporters believe U.S. involvement is crucial for its success. The United States is urged to ratify the CTBT, with supporters arguing that conditions for its approval have been met. Opponents point out the lack of verifiable reductions in nuclear warheads and verification in the Moscow Treaty. Despite confidence-building programs with Russia since 1982 and the disappearance of the Soviet Union, there has been no verifiable reduction in nuclear warheads. Russia continues to modernize its nuclear forces, raising concerns about potential threats from China, Iran, and others. Opponents argue that Russia could conduct clandestine tests to gain a military advantage due to monitoring limitations and knowledge gained from Soviet tests. The importance of the nuclear umbrella for deterrence, nuclear nonproliferation, and new sources of international instability like rogue states and nuclear terrorism are highlighted. In the post-Soviet era, there are concerns about the effectiveness of confidence-building measures and the need for a strong nuclear deterrent to address evolving threats. Suggestions to modify the CTBT include a treaty allowing withdrawal after 10 years, permitting low-yield tests, or conducting tests before ratifying a zero-yield CTBT. However, there is disagreement among nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states on these proposals. The Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment to the FY1993 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act allowed for nuclear tests from July 1993 to September 1996, but they were not conducted. Testing before ratifying a zero-yield CTBT would provide valuable data for the United States, including validating weapon fixes, assessing RRW designs, validating computer models, and benefiting from technical advances since 1992. The technical advances in the broader economy since 1992 could impact U.S. testing, potentially leading to testing by Russia and China. Critics fear that resumed U.S. testing, even if limited, could jeopardize the CTBT. The Senate may need to consider alternatives in any future debate on the treaty. CTBT supporters may offer new safeguards or an RRW-CTBT package to secure Senate ratification, but these alternatives may not be sufficient. Some opponents argue that RRW lacks political support and confidence without nuclear testing. If the treaty is reconsidered by the Senate, these alternatives may need to be considered. In considering arms control treaties, it is important to assess the overall benefits and risks involved for each state party. Various criteria need to be taken into account, such as the ability of the United States to maintain the safety and reliability of its nuclear weapons without testing, the necessity of new weapons for deterrence, and the balance between monitoring and evasion. This comprehensive evaluation is crucial rather than making a decision based on one isolated criterion. The current balance between monitoring and evasion in arms control treaties is crucial. As monitoring technology improves, the shift in this balance over time is uncertain. The confidence of evaders and monitors in their abilities is a key factor. The likelihood of cheating by Russia, China, and other nations could impact deterrence and regional stability. The international community faces questions regarding the consequences of cheating on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the impact of U.S. ratification on nuclear proliferation, and the necessity of U.S. movement towards nuclear disarmament for nonproliferation efforts. The U.S. moratorium on nuclear testing is being questioned in terms of its long-term balance with the CTBT. The likelihood of the U.S. exiting the moratorium, the impact of ratifying the CTBT, and the possibility of the treaty entering into force are all key considerations. Technical and geopolitical developments since 1999 may warrant a reconsideration of the treaty. The debate over the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) has been shaped by various criteria accumulated over the past fifty years. New criteria are added while old ones remain, influenced by perceptions on issues like the actions of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, the value of treaties for nuclear proliferation, and the role of U.S. nuclear weapons in international relations. Despite differing assessments, key figures like Members of Congress and Secretaries of Defense have conflicting views on the CTBT. In 1946, Representative Louis Ludlow introduced a resolution to cancel atomic bomb tests and seek a ban on atomic bombs. The Oppenheimer Panel recommended approaching the Soviets on control before testing the H-bomb in 1952. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru proposed a 'standstill agreement' on nuclear explosions in 1954. In 1957, President Eisenhower and Soviet Chairman Bulganin began correspondence on a nuclear test ban. Negotiations for a CTBT continued for years, with deadlock over on-site inspections. The Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 spurred negotiations, leading to the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, banning nuclear testing in the atmosphere, space, and underwater. The Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) was signed on August 5, 1963, banning nuclear testing in the atmosphere, space, and underwater. The treaty aimed to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons and prevent the contamination of the environment by radioactive substances. The Joint Chiefs of Staff supported the treaty but conditioned their approval on four safeguards to maintain U.S. nuclear capabilities. President Kennedy assured Senate leaders of the safeguards outlined by the Joint Chiefs to maintain U.S. nuclear capabilities, addressing concerns about the Limited Test Ban Treaty. This assurance played a crucial role in securing Senate support for the treaty. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) was ratified by the Senate in 1969 and entered into force in 1970. It involved a bargain between nuclear weapon states (NWS) and non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS) to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The central agreement was that NWS would keep their nuclear weapons but not assist NNWS in acquiring them, and NNWS would not develop nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) involved an agreement between nuclear weapon states (NWS) and non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS) to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. NNWS were concerned about NWS having nuclear weapons indefinitely, so Article VI was included to emphasize the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. Other provisions included safeguards for compliance and the right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) allowed for peaceful nuclear explosions for all parties, with conferences every five years and a 25-year review conference to discuss the treaty's continuation. While not banning nuclear testing, the treaty emphasized the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. The Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT) and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty (PNET) were signed in 1974 and 1976, respectively, between the United States and Soviet Union to achieve the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests. TTBT banned underground tests over 150 kilotons, while PNET extended this limit to peaceful nuclear explosions to prevent weapon tests under the guise of peaceful purposes. Article I of the TTBT required both sides to observe a 150-kiloton threshold starting in March 1976. The US initially had limited experience with underground tests when the LTBT was negotiated in 1963. Safeguard C called for maintaining the ability to conduct atmospheric tests if necessary for national security or if the treaty was violated. By 1971, the value of underground testing had become clear. In 1971, Carl Walske highlighted the importance of the test program in gaining knowledge about warhead vulnerability and the effectiveness of missile systems. President Ford redefined Safeguard C in 1976 to maintain the capability for nuclear testing if necessary for national security. President Carter pursued a CTBT instead of seeking Senate approval. President Carter pursued a CTBT rather than seeking Senate approval for the TTBT and PNET, leading to negotiations with the US, UK, and Soviet Union. Despite almost resolving all issues by 1979, strong opposition within the Administration led to a US position for the treaty to expire after three years unless renegotiated. The SALT II ratification debate overshadowed CTBT negotiations in 1979 and 1980, continuing at a low level until the end of the Carter Administration. President Reagan declined to reopen CTBT negotiations, citing concerns about monitoring the TTBT and PNET. In 1986, the House and Senate included provisions limiting nuclear testing in their defense authorization bills. The House proposed a one-year moratorium on nuclear tests over 1 kiloton, while the Senate called for ratification of the two treaties and resumption of CTBT talks. A compromise was reached during a summit meeting between President Reagan and President Gorbachev, where Congress accepted the Senate provision in exchange for Presidential assurances. President Reagan agreed to inform General Secretary Gorbachev that if the Soviet Union agrees to essential verification procedures for nuclear testing treaties before the 100th Congress convenes, he will seek Senate ratification. If not, ratification will still be pursued with appropriate reservations. President Reagan plans to work with the Senate to draft reservations to ensure treaties are verifiable before taking effect. He intends to propose immediate negotiations with the Soviet Union on limiting and ending nuclear testing once verification concerns are addressed. Verification protocols for TTBT and PNET were negotiated in 1987 and ratified by the Senate in 1990. The Senate ratified treaties in 1990 with safeguards for nuclear testing and technology programs to maintain deterrent capabilities. The United States shares a special responsibility with the Soviet Union to continue bilateral Nuclear Testing Talks for further limitations on nuclear testing, including a verifiable comprehensive test ban. In 1992, an amendment was attached to the FY1993 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act by Senators Mark Hatfield, James Exon, and George Mitchell. The FY1993 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act amendment, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, prohibited underground nuclear tests between September 1992 and July 1993. It allowed fewer than 20 tests between July 1993 and September 1996 under certain conditions and halted U.S. nuclear tests after September 1996 unless another nation conducted a test. The last U.S. test was in September 1992, and the Stockpile Stewardship Program was established in FY1994. The Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) was created to maintain US nuclear weapons capabilities, including enhanced computing, non-nuclear experiments, and new facilities. Legislation required annual reports to Congress on weapon safety and security. Congress also prohibited funds for atmospheric nuclear testing, stating the US no longer needed that capability. In November 1993, the United Nations General Assembly approved a resolution for negotiation of a CTBT. The Conference on Disarmament began negotiations in 1994 with a focus on the CTBT. The 1995 NPT conference was crucial as NNWS parties saw the CTBT as essential for disarmament. Some NNWS argued for a CTBT as a symbol of a nondiscriminatory NPT regime, where NWS would give up the ability to develop new warheads. Others saw NPT extension as their last leverage for a CTBT, while some believed anything less than indefinite extension would undermine global security. The NPT was extended indefinitely during the Review and Extension Conference, with decisions made without a vote. The package included strengthening the treaty's review process, a resolution on the Middle East, and goals for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. The CTBT negotiations were urged to be completed by 1996, adding urgency to the process. President Clinton extended the nuclear test moratorium multiple times. President Clinton extended the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell nuclear test moratorium several times, starting in 1993. In August 1995, he announced the decision to negotiate a true zero yield comprehensive test ban (CTBT). This decision was conditioned on six safeguards, including the SSP and modern laboratory facilities. The CTBT was completed in August 1996, opened for signature on September 24, 1996, and signed by President Clinton. The Senate declined to ratify it in October 1999. The international community continues to push for the CTBT for nuclear nonproliferation. The international community has linked the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) to nuclear nonproliferation and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The NWS emphasized the importance of making the CTBT a universal, verifiable treaty for its early entry into force. The 2000 NPT review conference reaffirmed the importance of halting nuclear weapon test explosions and called for efforts to ensure the CTBT's ratification for disarmament and nuclear disarmament commitments. The Bush Administration opposed ratification of the CTBT and maintained a test moratorium. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reiterated this stance in 2007, stating that the Administration does not support the treaty. The 2005 NPT review conference ended in failure as the US focused on Iranian and North Korean nuclear issues, while nonnuclear states called for nuclear powers to reduce their arsenals. The United States has resisted international pressure to ratify the CTBT, despite calls for nuclear powers to reduce their arsenals. Five conferences have been held to facilitate the treaty's entry into force, with the most recent one in September 2007. The US did not send a delegation to the conference, and in 2006, 59 foreign ministers urged all states to sign and ratify the CTBT for nuclear disarmament and prevention of proliferation. The CTBT has been supported by the U.N. General Assembly, with the United States opposing it. As of March 2008, 178 nations had signed the treaty, with 144 ratifying it, including key countries needed for its entry into force. France, Russia, and the United Kingdom have ratified it, while China and the United States have signed but not ratified."
