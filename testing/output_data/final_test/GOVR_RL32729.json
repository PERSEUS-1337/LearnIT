Many parents support government regulations to limit such content on TV, and the use of the V-chip to control children's viewing. The V-chip is a tool that allows parents to control their children's television viewing by blocking programs based on ratings. It reads an electronic code transmitted with the TV signal and is used with a programming rating system. All new TVs sold in the US since 2000 must have the V-chip. There were criticisms of the initial ratings system developed in 1996-1997. An expanded ratings system was adopted in response to concerns from groups like the National Parent-Teacher Association. The law mandated a ratings system for TV programs similar to the one for movies by the MPAA. The industry was urged to create a voluntary ratings system within a year, conveying information on sexual, violent, or indecent content for parents. After initial opposition, media executives met with President Clinton in 1996 to develop a TV ratings system due to political pressure. Industry executives, led by Jack Valenti, proposed six age-based ratings in December 1996. The ratings began appearing in January 1997. The TV ratings system, implemented in January 1997, displays ratings at the start of programs and in TV guides. Ratings are assigned by the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board, consisting of industry members and non-industry advocates. News and sports programs are not rated, and local affiliates can override ratings. Critics called for a more detailed \"S-V-L\" system to provide information on why a program received a certain rating. The television industry agreed to a revised ratings system on July 10, 1997, which added designators for sex, violence, language, and suggestive dialogue. The FCC approved the revised ratings system on March 12, 1998, along with V-chip technical standards. The FCC created a V-chip Task Force in May 1999 to ensure blocking technology availability and ratings transmission. A February 2000 survey found most networks were encoding ratings, with NBC and Black Entertainment Television not using S-V-L-D indicators. The FCC released a report on the impact of violent programming on children, stating that exposure to media violence can increase aggressive behavior in children. The report also noted skepticism towards viewer-initiated blocking and mandatory ratings as effective solutions for parental supervision. The V-chip was found to be of limited effectiveness in protecting children from violent television content. Cable operator-provided parental controls were deemed insufficient for widespread use. The FCC report found that the voluntary TV ratings system is ineffective in protecting children from violent television content. Congress could define excessively violent programming, but it must be narrowly tailored and in line with legal precedent. The industry could voluntarily reduce the amount of violent programming viewed by children, such as implementing a family-friendly hour during prime time. The FCC report suggested various solutions to protect children from violent television content, including implementing a family hour during prime time and allowing consumers to choose their programming through a la carte options. Congress was directed to examine the availability of advanced technologies to enhance child-safe viewing. The FCC is tasked with examining advanced blocking technologies within 90 days to enhance parental control over objectionable video or audio content transmitted through various communication devices. The goal is to develop the next generation of parental control technology that can filter content independently of ratings and improve a parent's ability to protect their child. The FCC released a report on advanced blocking technologies and parental empowerment tools on August 29, 2009. The report highlighted the market for these technologies but noted a lack of data in key areas like awareness and usage levels. Educational programs could help increase awareness and adoption of parental control technologies, which vary greatly among different media platforms and providers. The FCC issued a second NOI on October 23, 2009, to explore issues related to protecting children and empowering parents in the digital age. They asked about children's use of electronic media, benefits and risks, and ways to maximize benefits while minimizing risks. The FCC also sought additional data and studies on these issues. The FCC issued a second NOI in 2009 to explore issues related to protecting children and empowering parents in the digital age. They asked about children's use of electronic media, benefits and risks, and ways to maximize benefits while minimizing risks. The NOI seeks comment on the effectiveness of media literacy efforts for children and how the FCC can assist with online safety efforts. Discussions at the FCC have been ongoing since 2011 about updating the ratings system. No legislative action has been taken on the V-Chip in Congress. President Bush signed the \"Child Safe Viewing Act of 2007\" into law in 2008, requiring the FCC to examine advanced blocking technologies. The FCC is required to examine advanced blocking technologies for parents to use on various communication devices. Hearings were held in the 110th Congress on the impact of violent television programming on children and the limitations of the V-chip. The House Committee discussed advertising for junk food aimed at children and the V-chip's inability to screen out undesirable content. The Kaiser Family Foundation conducted research on the impact of media violence on children and the effectiveness of the V-chip and television ratings for parental control. A majority of parents are concerned about children being exposed to inappropriate content, with many attributing sex and violence in the media to young people's behavior. Parents are increasingly worried about the Internet's influence, and most support government regulations to limit sex and violence on TV during early evening hours. The study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that parents are more concerned about inappropriate content on TV than in other media, with 32% citing TV as their biggest concern. Half of parents use TV ratings to guide their children's viewing, but only 15% use the V-chip for parental control, despite 61% finding it very useful. The Kaiser Family Foundation study found that parents are concerned about inappropriate TV content, with 63% favoring new regulations to limit sex and violence during early evening hours. 55% of parents want ratings displayed more prominently, and 52% believe cable TV should adhere to the same content standards as broadcasters. Most parents find TV ratings useful, with 38% finding them \"very\" useful. Many parents find TV ratings useful, but a significant number do not understand the ratings guidelines. For example, a study showed that only 28% of parents knew what the rating TV-Y7 meant, and 12% understood the rating FV. Vicky Rideout from the Kaiser Family Foundation highlighted the lack of understanding among parents regarding TV ratings and the V-chip. Some groups have questioned the effectiveness and legality of the V-chip and TV ratings. Some organizations questioned the usefulness and legality of the V-chip and TV ratings after the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Opposition has decreased over time, and controversies over inappropriate live broadcasts did not reignite it. The V-chip and ratings system can block objectionable content when used together, but they are not foolproof. The Child Safe Viewing Act addressed many issues raised by critics. The Child Safe Viewing Act addressed issues with the V-chip, but educating parents about its use remains a challenge. A 2004 KFF study showed low awareness and usage of the V-chip, with only 42% of parents using it. However, those who did found it useful, indicating that increased knowledge could improve parental control over children's viewing. Increasing parental awareness of the V-chip through public service announcements, educational materials, and online resources could enhance parental control over children's television viewing without the need for new legislation. Funding may be required initially for these efforts. The Kaiser Family Foundation conducted a survey on media and public policy in Fall 2004. Children Now provides frequently asked questions about the V-chip. PSV Ratings, Inc. commissioned a study on media ratings systems in Spring 2003. The Federal Communications Commission offers information on the V-chip."
