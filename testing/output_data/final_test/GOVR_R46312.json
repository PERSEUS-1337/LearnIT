    "content": "Forests play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering carbon through photosynthesis and releasing it through respiration. Trees store carbon in their plant tissue above and below ground. When trees die, carbon is released into the atmosphere or stored in the soil. The carbon stored in forests can be released quickly through combustion or slowly through decomposition. Woody biomass may continue to store carbon even after death, depending on decomposition times or if it's harvested for use in products. The forest's carbon balance changes with growth, death, and decomposition. If more carbon is released than sequestered, the forest emits CO2; if more is sequestered, it acts as a sink. The forest's role as a source or sink of CO2 depends on time and spatial scales. In a forest ecosystem, carbon is stored both above and below ground in living and nonliving forms. All parts of a tree contain carbon, with varying proportions depending on species, age, and growth pattern. The U.S. EPA reports forest carbon in seven categories, detailing how carbon is stored and moves within the ecosystem. The international guidelines for measuring and accounting for carbon in forests include reporting carbon in seven different pools, such as aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, deadwood, forest floor litter, and soil carbon. These pools represent the various forms in which carbon is stored within the ecosystem. The EPA categorizes soil into mineral and organic types, measuring forest carbon in various pools including harvested wood products at different stages of use. These products, like paper and furniture, were once part of the forest ecosystem and may end up in waste disposal sites. Products from the forest ecosystem end up in landfills, releasing stored carbon over time. Carbon is stored in different forest ecosystem pools for varying durations. Factors like climate, hydrology, and forest age affect carbon turnover. Carbon can remain in soil for years to millennia. The amount of carbon stored in different pools varies. The forest carbon pools are categorized in various ways for research purposes, such as aboveground versus belowground, living and nonliving, or dead pools. This helps in understanding how activities impact carbon flow between the ecosystem pools. Some pools can be further classified into smaller categories, like carbon stored in trees versus understory plants. Deadwood pools can be divided into standing dead and downed dead to reflect their importance in different forest types. See Table 1 for terminology and classifications used in this report. Forests vary in carbon sequestration and release due to factors like climate, hydrology, and nutrient availability. Tropical forests store over half of global forest carbon, with a relatively even distribution between living and dead biomass. Boreal forests, on the other hand, store about one-third of global forest carbon. Forests globally store significant amounts of carbon, with boreal forests accounting for around 29% of the total forest area and one-third of the global forest carbon. Most carbon in boreal forests is in belowground dead pools, mainly in the soil. Temperate forests store the least amount of forest carbon and represent the smallest area, with carbon evenly distributed between living and dead pools, mostly in the soil. The carbon balance in tropical, temperate, and boreal forests is influenced by different factors. The forest carbon cycle involves sequestration of atmospheric carbon through vegetative growth and its release back into the atmosphere when vegetation decomposes or during wildfires. Carbon flows between the atmosphere and forest carbon pools through processes like photosynthesis, respiration, combustion, and decomposition. Factors like precipitation and temperature influence decomposition rates. Trees can stand for years after death before releasing carbon to the atmosphere and soil. Trees can stand for years after death before falling and decaying. Human activities like timber harvests remove carbon from the forest ecosystem, storing it in harvested products that eventually release carbon back into the atmosphere. The difference between carbon sequestration and release determines if a forest is a net source or sink of carbon. Forest ecosystems act as a net sink for carbon, absorbing it from the atmosphere. Carbon dynamics in forests are influenced by disturbances, which can be anthropogenic (such as timber harvests) or ecological (like weather events or wildfires). The type, duration, and severity of disturbances impact carbon cycling, often leading to tree mortality and changes in carbon fluxes. Land cover changes may also result from disturbances. Disturbances in forests can impact carbon fluxes and stocks, leading to tree mortality and changes in carbon cycling. Land cover changes post-disturbance can have varying effects on the forest carbon cycle, with some being more permanent like deforestation. The impacts of disturbances on the forest carbon budget occur over different temporal and spatial scales. Disturbances in forests can impact carbon fluxes and stocks, leading to changes in carbon cycling. The onset of disturbance effects can be immediate or delayed, affecting photosynthesis and carbon sequestration. Initially, forests may emit carbon, but over time, carbon impacts will reverse as forests regenerate, leading to increased carbon uptake and storage, known as legacy effects. Forest carbon stocks in the United States have been increasing due to legacy effects from past disturbances. Disturbances in forests, such as wildfires, can have lasting effects on carbon dynamics. Forest carbon stocks are influenced by disturbances at different spatial scales, with varying impacts on different stands within a forest. This spatial and temporal variability helps maintain relative balance in forest carbon stocks over large areas. Disturbances in forests, like wildfires, can impact carbon dynamics. Forest carbon stocks are generally stable over large areas and time scales if sites are reforested. However, an increase in disturbance frequency and severity could lead to lower sequestration rates and reduced carbon stocks. Interactions between disturbances, such as drought making trees more vulnerable to insects or wildfires, can further impact the forest carbon cycle. Timber harvests are the main contributor to carbon loss in the United States forests, accounting for the majority of the 1% annual loss from aboveground biomass. Other disturbances like wildfires, storms, bark beetles, and drought also contribute to carbon loss, but research on the impacts of insect infestations and disease is limited. The effects of disturbances on soil carbon are not well understood, leading to potential underestimation of their impacts on the forest carbon budget. Timber harvests are a planned management activity that transfers carbon from the forest ecosystem to other pools, impacting the forest carbon budget. The carbon in harvested wood products will eventually be released, with varying lifecycles based on end-use. Some carbon remains on-site as deadwood or litter, which will decompose and release carbon into the atmosphere. Timber harvests also have the potential to degrade soils, releasing more carbon. End-uses of harvested wood products include lumber, paper, panels, and energy purposes. Wood products such as lumber, paper, panels, and energy sources release carbon into the atmosphere through combustion. When discarded, wood products may take years to decompose, releasing stored carbon. In the United States, most wood products end up in landfills, where decomposition can take decades. Some carbon may persist indefinitely in partially decomposed wood products. Harvesting and transportation emissions are not included in the carbon flux calculations. Wildfires release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases through combustion, transferring carbon from living to dead pools. The severity of the fire affects tree mortality and post-fire recovery, with more wildfires occurring in the eastern US but larger ones in the West. Wildfire frequency and size have been increasing, especially in the western United States. Other ecological disturbances, such as insect and disease infestations, wind events, and droughts, also impact forest carbon dynamics by transferring carbon from live pools to dead pools and releasing it into the atmosphere over time. The effects of insect and disease infestations on carbon vary, with some leading to widespread tree mortality and changes in forest composition, while others primarily result in defoliation, increasing forest litter and reducing carbon uptake without significant loss of carbon stocks. Insect and disease infestations, wind events, and droughts impact forest carbon dynamics by transferring carbon from live pools to dead pools and releasing it into the atmosphere. Defoliation weakens trees, making them more susceptible to other disturbances. Little research is available on the carbon-related effects of insect and disease infestations, and the impacts of specific insects are not accurately estimated. Wind events like hurricanes can uproot trees, increasing deadwood and forest litter, potentially leading to wildfires. Ice storms have similar effects. Droughts are prolonged events with direct and indirect impacts on forest carbon cycling. Droughts can weaken trees, reducing carbon uptake and leading to mortality. They can also prolong regeneration or shift species mix, exacerbating other disturbances. Site regeneration after a disturbance affects the long-term carbon cycle impact. Reforestation mitigates effects, but land-use changes can have significant and lasting impacts on the carbon cycle. Land-use changes, such as deforestation and afforestation, can have significant impacts on the carbon cycle by causing the loss or sequestration of carbon. Deforestation results in the sudden loss of aboveground carbon and a gradual loss of belowground carbon, while afforestation converts non-forestland to forestland, increasing carbon sequestration potential. Deforestation can occur through deliberate human intervention or naturally, hindering the succession of tree species. Afforestation involves converting non-forestland to forestland, leading to increased ecosystem carbon storage and sequestration. It can occur through human intervention or natural ecological succession. Globally, forest area has been declining since the 1990s, with most losses in tropical forests and gains in temperate forests. In the United States, afforestation often happens on abandoned cropland previously forested. Forest area in the US has been expanding for decades but is now stabilizing, with variations at regional and state levels. The trend of forest area in the United States has been stable for several decades, mainly due to afforestation. However, in 2018, more land was converted out of forest use than into forest use. Deforestation is primarily driven by development or conversion to grassland, while grassland conversion to forestland is the largest contributor to afforestation. Data on carbon storage and flux in U.S. forests are provided, along with a discussion on the methodology used for estimation. The methodology used to estimate and measure forest carbon in the United States is primarily derived from EPA's annual Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks for 2020. The data provided in this report are intended to complement the understanding of carbon dynamics in U.S. forests and will not be updated in accordance with the annual Inventory publication. Future iterations of the Inventory may result in different stock and flux estimates due to constantly refined estimation methodologies. EPA's annual Inventory describes the forest carbon accounting methodology specific to their data collection process. The EPA's annual Inventory, published since the early 1990s, fulfills reporting commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Federal agencies, including the USDA, contribute data to the Inventory, with forest carbon figures based on data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program. The Inventory measures carbon figures derived from forestland area and stocks, with flux measured by changes over time. It includes all land uses in the US, such as forestland, agricultural lands, grasslands, wetlands, and settlements. Changes like grasslands converting to forestland are captured in the LULUCF sector for 20 years. Forests make up one-third of the sector but have the most area. This report focuses on carbon stocks and fluxes associated with forestland, which make up one-third of the sector and have the most carbon stocks. The Inventory includes managed forestland that meets specific criteria, excluding urban areas and woodlands. Unmanaged land is inaccessible to society. The Inventory focuses on carbon stocks and fluxes in managed forestland designated for timber harvests and fire protection in the U.S. It excludes forestland in Hawaii and U.S. territories from carbon estimates. Carbon flux is reported for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land (FRF) and Land Converted to Forest Land (LCF) categories. Land area estimates are derived from FIA data and other sources. The Inventory focuses on carbon stocks and fluxes in managed forestland designated for timber harvests and fire protection in the U.S. It excludes forestland in Hawaii and U.S. territories from carbon estimates. Carbon flux is reported for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land (FRF) and Land Converted to Forest Land (LCF) categories. FRF captures carbon flux from existing forestland, while LCF captures flux from land converted to forestland within the past 20 years, including afforestation. Land area data on forestland converted to other uses are captured in the respective new land-use category in the LULUCF sector. Estimates of carbon stocks are based on forestland area combined with site-specific estimates of forest carbon primarily collected through the FS's FIA Program. The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program in the United States collects remote sensing and field data from established research sites to assess forest health. Data includes tree measurements, downed deadwood, litter, and soil variables. The data collection process involves classifying land cover, selecting forest plots for data collection, and gathering forest health data from a subset of plots. The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program in the United States collects data on understory vegetation, deadwood, woody debris, and soil attributes through annualized sampling. Conversion factors and models are used to calculate carbon content for each ecosystem pool, based on species-specific equations and internationally accepted methodologies. These factors relate easily collected field data to more challenging data, such as aboveground and belowground carbon estimates. The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program in the United States collects data on various ecosystem pools to estimate carbon content. This includes belowground biomass, soils, litter, deadwood, and harvested wood products (HWPs). Conversion factors and models are used to calculate carbon content, with adjustments for factors like decomposition rates and import/export of HWPs. The Inventory reports annual greenhouse gas emissions and removals in terms of CO2 equivalents.

Conversion factors and models are used to calculate carbon content, with adjustments for factors like decomposition rates and import/export of HWPs. The Inventory reports annual greenhouse gas emissions and removals in terms of CO2 equivalents, measuring net flux by comparing annual differences in forest carbon stocks and carbon sequestered as land converts to forestland.

U.S. forests stored 58.7 billion metric tons (BMT) of carbon in 2019, with the majority stored in forest ecosystem pools and the remainder in the product pool. Forest soils contained the largest pool of carbon. Since 1990, U.S. forest carbon stocks have increased by 10%, with forest soils containing the largest pool of carbon at 54% in 2019. Nearly all forest pools have gained more carbon, except for litter and soil pools which have remained stable. U.S. forests have been a net carbon sink, absorbing more carbon than they release. Approximately one-third of the United States is forested, with varying characteristics such as location, climate, vegetation type, and disturbance histories. U.S. forests vary in carbon density across different regions, with the Pacific Northwest and Great Lakes regions having the highest carbon density. The distribution of carbon across forest pools differs between regions, with the Pacific Northwest storing most in living biomass and the Great Lakes region storing most in soil. Other regions like New England, the Great Plains, and the Southeastern Coast store most of their carbon in soil, while the forests along the Appalachian Mountains store most in live biomass. In the Rocky Mountains, carbon is stored in live biomass and deadwood/litter pools. Alaska has significant carbon stocks, mainly in the soil, across various biomes. Carbon flux is the annual change in carbon stocks, with negative values indicating a net carbon sink. In 2018, U.S. forests were a net carbon sink, sequestering 774 MMT CO2 equivalents. This offset approximately 12% of the gross GHG emissions from the United States that year. Most of the carbon accumulation was on existing forestland, with aboveground biomass accounting for 58% of the flux. The carbon flux into different pools in U.S. forests reflects net carbon accumulation from the atmosphere. Soils store significant amounts of carbon, but the annual flux is minimal. U.S. forests gained 211 MMT of carbon between 2018 and 2019, a 0.3% increase to the total forest carbon stock. Forests have been a net carbon sink over the time series (1990 to 2018). Forests in the U.S. have been a net carbon sink, with the amount of carbon sequestered varying annually due to disturbance activity, particularly wildfires in Alaska. The Inventory includes estimated emissions from wildfires, reporting 170 MMT CO2 equivalents in 2017. Annual forest carbon emissions show significant variability. In 2017, forest carbon emissions were 170 MMT CO2 equivalents, with significant variability due to wildfire activity. Forest management involves balancing multiple objectives, including carbon sequestration. Strategic approaches include increasing forestland area, maintaining carbon stocks, and using more wood products. Increasing forest area can help maintain or increase forest carbon stocks and provide various co-benefits like watershed protection and wildlife habitat. However, it may require substantial resources and economic tradeoffs. The effectiveness and potential co-benefits of this approach vary based on site-specific characteristics. Increasing forest area could require economic tradeoffs, such as income loss from reduced agricultural production in areas of increased afforestation. Managing forests to maximize tree growth potential and restore degraded forests can help maintain or increase forest carbon stocks. Activities like extending time between timber harvests and implementing harvesting methods to protect remaining trees and soils can also improve forest resilience to ecological disturbances. These efforts may necessitate substantial resources and economic investment. Increasing the use of wood products as an alternative to carbon-intensive materials like steel or fossil fuels could have net impacts on the carbon balance, but may require significant technological advances. A full lifecycle accounting of products would be necessary to determine the carbon benefits. However, this approach could lead to increased economic activity and wood product innovation, potentially impacting forest management activities and overall carbon storage potential. One of the challenges in implementing strategies for carbon benefits is determining if activities are reversible and if changes in land management in one area could offset changes in another area (leakage). Ecological factors and ownership changes on private lands can also affect the permanence of carbon benefits. The concept of additionality is crucial in determining if carbon benefits would have occurred anyway. Uncertainty remains regarding the future impact of climate change on forests, with the consensus that U.S. forests will likely continue to act as a carbon sink, but this may diminish over time and even reverse in some scenarios. Regional variations could see forests becoming carbon sources at times. Forests may act as carbon sources due to interrelated effects of climate change, such as increased CO2 promoting growth but also causing drought. Uncertainty surrounds the future extent of U.S. forests, with potential for carbon loss if forest area decreases. If forest area expands, U.S. forests could sequester more carbon. The carbon flux associated with U.S. forests is small relative to the carbon stored, but they offset 12% of GHG emissions in 2018. If forests sequester less carbon in the future, they could become a source of GHG emissions, impacting the nation's carbon balance and global carbon cycle. Various international standards define forest resources, with some definitions edited for clarity. These standards include documents from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Panel on Climate Change, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Forest Service."
