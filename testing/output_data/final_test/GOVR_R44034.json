    "content": "The United States aims to support a stable, democratic, and prosperous Pakistan that combats religious militancy. This is a key foreign policy focus post-9/11, with interests in regional terrorism, Afghanistan stability, nuclear proliferation, Pakistan-India tensions, democratization, human rights, and economic development. Pakistan's status as a haven for extremist groups and possession of a large nuclear arsenal makes it a top security concern globally. The U.S. has worked on Pakistan's economy and security forces. Pakistan has received over $20 billion in U.S. foreign assistance since 2001 to boost its security forces. Despite some successes, the country still faces militancy, terrorism, domestic insecurity, and weak economic growth. In 2009, the 111th Congress endorsed a policy for strategic ties with Pakistan through economic aid for all strata of society. However, by 2011, the relationship faced crises leading to talk of a \"divorce\" between the two countries. The deteriorating relationship between the US and Pakistan led to increased scrutiny of foreign aid due to doubts about Islamabad's commitment to combating terrorism. Congressional members are divided on whether to cut off aid completely or take a more punitive approach. Concerns were heightened after the revelation of Osama bin Laden's presence in Pakistan, raising questions about the effectiveness of providing significant assistance to a government that may not be a reliable partner. In 2011, U.S. officials criticized Pakistan's military and intelligence services for maintaining links with extremist groups. Some top U.S. enemies are believed to be in Pakistan. In June 2014, Pakistani military launched offensives against militant groups in FATA, boosting confidence in their cooperation with stabilizing Afghanistan. The November 2014 visit of Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff to Washington, DC marked an improved atmosphere in cooperation with stabilizing Afghanistan. The bilateral Defense Consultative Group met to review ongoing Pakistani military operations and the security transition in Afghanistan. In January 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry met with Pakistani officials to review progress in various working groups, including the creation of a new group on education, science, and technology. Pakistan's agreement to ban the Haqqani Network was a notable outcome of the engagement with the US in 2015. Any further hardening of Pakistan's stance on peace with India could hinder South Asian regionalism and US efforts to connect India with Central Asia. This could lead to India developing Iran's Chabbahar port to bypass Pakistan, potentially straining US relations and reinforcing the rivalry between India and China. Islamist extremism and militancy have plagued Pakistani society since 2007, with various armed insurgencies and Islamist terrorist groups becoming more intertwined and supportive after 2009. The Taliban Shura of Mullah Omar is believed to be in Quetta and Karachi, while the Haqqani Network operates from North Waziristan and Kurram agencies. There is a growing trend of militants directly attacking Pakistani security institutions, raising concerns about the potential presence of the Islamic State in Pakistan. The Pakistani government has suffered significant losses in the \"war on terror\" since 2001, with over 50,000 casualties and a financial cost of $78 billion. A deadly terrorist attack on a school in Peshawar in December 2014 resulted in 148 deaths, including 132 children. The attackers, linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, targeted the school in retaliation for Pakistani military operations. This incident, labeled \"Pakistan's 9/11,\" sparked outrage domestically and internationally, with President Obama condemning the act and pledging U.S. support for Pakistan's counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. reiterated its commitment to support Pakistan in counterterrorism efforts, anticipating a crackdown on TTP militants. Analysts doubt a significant change in state policies due to Pakistan's history of differentiating between \"bad\" and \"good\" militants. The Pakistani state struggles with addressing domestic and transnational terrorism, hindered by legal and judicial challenges, lack of resources, and security threats to law enforcement officials. Critics argue against an overemphasis on military operations in response to terrorism. Pakistan's leaders are criticized for focusing on military operations over law enforcement in response to terrorism. The police forces are deemed low quality, corrupt, and lacking in resources. The National Counterterrorism Authority (NACTA) is seen as ineffective, with bureaucratic debates over its mandate. The National Internal Security Policy (NISP) unveiled in 2014 received no funding support. The \"Protection of Pakistan Bill\" expanded law enforcement powers in 2014. The Pakistani government expanded law enforcement powers in response to terrorism, including lifting a moratorium on executing convicted terrorists and establishing military courts. Human Rights Watch criticized the executions as \"vengeful blood-lust\" and raised concerns about the overuse of anti-terrorism laws. The Pakistani army deployed a large number of troops in western Pakistan for military operations. The Pakistani army has deployed 150,000 troops in western Pakistan to combat militancy, resulting in the displacement of 3 million people. US assessments of Pakistan's military efforts have been discouraging, with difficulties in the \"holding\" and \"building\" phases of operations. Operation Zarb-e-Azb was launched to end the TTP insurgency through negotiations in 2013. In February 2014, talks to defuse insurgency in Pakistan failed after a terrorist attack on Karachi airport by TTP militants. The military then launched \"Operation Zarb-e-Azb\" against terrorists in North Waziristan, claiming success in clearing 90% of the area and eliminating over 1,200 militants. Media restrictions hinder independent verification of these claims. The Haqqani Network leaders fled to Afghanistan before U.S. operations, which aimed to disrupt the group. Drone strikes in Pakistan have decreased since 2010, with only 22 reported in 2014. The Obama Administration argues that the strikes are important in degrading Al Qaeda. The Obama Administration argues that drone strikes in western Pakistan are important in degrading Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, but critics say it violates international law and creates new militants. Debate reignited in April 2015 after civilian hostages were accidentally killed in a strike. Analysts believe Afghan stability depends on cooperation with Pakistan and improving relations between Islamabad and Kabul. The U.S. government and independent analysts agree that as long as Afghan Taliban forces have sanctuary in western Pakistan, the Afghan insurgency will persist. The United States views Islamabad as a crucial partner in ensuring Afghan stability as it winds down military operations in Afghanistan. Pakistan's security establishment, fearing encirclement by India, sees the Afghan Taliban as a friendly anti-India element. Concerns arise over Pakistan's alleged support of the Afghan Taliban, a group it previously backed. Leaders in Afghanistan and India are wary of this support. The report on security and stability in Afghanistan highlighted positive trends in combating Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan and foreign fighters. However, it expressed U.S. frustration with Pakistan's support of Afghan- and Indian-focused militants, which undermines regional stability. Pakistan uses proxy forces to counter India and influence Afghan government decisions. The Pentagon's October report highlighted Pakistan's support for Afghan-focused insurgents, who find sanctuary on the Pakistani side of the Durand Line. This dynamic has led to a reverse infiltration of militants into eastern Afghanistan. Tensions between Islamabad and Kabul persist, with Pakistan now criticizing Afghan forces for failing to intercept militants fleeing from Pakistan's operations in the FATA. Tensions between Islamabad and Kabul persist due to Afghanistan not recognizing the Durand Line as a legitimate border. Afghan officials accuse Pakistan of supporting Taliban fighters. Former Afghan President Karzai distrusted Pakistan and turned to India for support. Current Afghan President Ghani seeks to accommodate Pakistan's interests despite deep distrust. In November 2014, the new Afghan president visited Islamabad to improve bilateral relations with Pakistan. Both sides were positive about forging a warmer relationship, with President Ghani requesting stronger cooperation in training and border management. Ghani also withdrew the previous request to purchase Indian weapons. This effort is crucial due to the impending departure of foreign troops from Afghanistan and concerns about a power vacuum. The long-standing rivalry between Pakistan and India, marked by wars and border skirmishes, hinders regional stability. The United States supports peace efforts between the two nuclear-armed countries to prevent open conflict and improve relations, crucial for success in Afghanistan. Pakistan faces an existential threat on its eastern front, leading to tensions with India. Prime Minister Sharif's attendance at Modi's inauguration in 2014 signaled a potential thaw in relations, but issues persist, with the Pakistani Army hindering trade and dialogue efforts. In August, the ambassador to New Delhi met with Kashmiri separatists, but Prime Minister Modi canceled planned talks, halting the peace process. The downturn in relations was seen as orchestrated by the Pakistani military, with other factors at play. In February 2015, India agreed to resume peace talks, possibly encouraged by the Obama Administration. The new Indian foreign secretary visited Islamabad, described as an ice-breaker with a cordial atmosphere. The visit by Jaishankar to India's South Asian neighbors was not seen as a bilateral exercise by New Delhi. Tensions arose over the possibility of Islamabad inviting separatists from India-held Kashmir to a National Day parade, highlighting the fragile relationship. The Mumbai Terrorism Trial revealed India's demand for Pakistan to take action against the Lashkar-e-Taiba group responsible for the 2008 attack. India has been hesitant to resume peace talks until the LeT leadership is brought to justice, particularly Hafiz Saeed. Pakistani officials claim they lack sufficient evidence to act against the group. In 2009, Pakistani authorities charged seven men for planning the Mumbai raid, including Zaki ur-Rehman Lakhvi. The trial's delays have raised skepticism about Pakistan's commitment. In 2014, the proceedings were repeatedly postponed, with lawyers for the prosecution citing security concerns. New Delhi was outraged when Lakhvi was granted bail, prompting immediate action by Pakistani officials. The separatist violence in India's Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir state has decreased significantly since the 1990s peak and is currently at its lowest point. Cross-border firing along the Line of Control intensified in August 2014, leading to fears of escalation and potential collapse of a 2003 ceasefire agreement. Pakistani and Indian leaders accused each other of unprovoked attacks, prompting the U.S. State Department to urge further dialogue between the two governments. The U.S. State Department encourages India and Pakistan to engage in further dialogue on Kashmir. China has a strong relationship with Pakistan, providing arms and investments, including the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to boost economic connectivity. China's Belt and Road initiatives aim to enhance economic connectivity with regions to the west, including Pakistan. Chinese President Xi Jinping signed a 20-point Joint Statement with Prime Minister Sharif, committing $34 billion in investment and $12 billion in loans for infrastructure projects. Counterterrorism cooperation is also a focus, as China is concerned about extremism spilling over into its territory. Islamabad is increasingly reliant on Beijing as U.S.-Pakistan ties deteriorate. Pakistan's reliance on China for military and diplomatic support hinders India's regional ambitions. U.S. concerns about the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal persist due to the history of illicit nuclear proliferation. Despite improvements, there are ongoing worries about unauthorized leakage of nuclear know-how or technologies. Pakistan's development of short-range, nuclear-armed missiles in response to India's military doctrine has raised concerns about crisis stability. Democracy in Pakistan has faced challenges with power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs, but recent elections have shown positive signs of democratization. Since the May 2013 elections, Nawaz Sharif and his PML-N party have been criticized for their perceived lack of progress in governance and for being too focused on one family. Sharif's ruling style is seen as autocratic and detached, with little reform in Pakistan's governance system. Political unrest in 2014 saw peaceful protests staged. In August 2014, political protests by supporters of opposition figures Imran Khan and Tahir-ul-Qadri disrupted the capital city, weakening Prime Minister Sharif's government. Analysts noted coordination between the military and protest leaders. Sharif struggled to control domestic security, leading to concerns about extra-constitutional changes. The US supported Pakistan's constitutional and electoral process, backing Sharif as Prime Minister. Pakistan's economic challenges include high inflation, unemployment, food, and energy shortages, causing economic anxiety for civilian leaders. The growth rate has been declining since 2005, hindering development. Power and water shortages disrupt business operations and agriculture. Corruption is a major obstacle, affecting investment rates and public confidence. Repayment of IMF loans is a concern. Pakistan's federal budget faces constraints due to the repayment of $18 billion in IMF loans, with low revenue generation and tax collection issues. The US is Pakistan's largest trade partner, with exports worth $3.7 billion in 2014, mainly in textiles. Pakistani leaders aim to improve access to Western markets. Pakistan aims to improve access to Western markets through exports, particularly in the textile sector. The country faces human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and violence against journalists. Islamabad is lobbying for reduced tariffs on textile exports. Blasphemy laws in Pakistan protect Islamic beliefs and objects from insult, but are criticized for being discriminatory and arbitrary. The State Department notes restrictions on religious freedom in Pakistan, with the country being identified as a \"Country of Particular Concern\" for severe violations of religious freedom. Sectarian attacks in Pakistan target Shia and Ahmadi minority communities, with Ahmadis facing legal discrimination and violence. Anti-Christian persecution, although less common, spiked in 2015 with two church bombings in Lahore. Pakistan receives significant U.S. foreign assistance post-9/11. Pakistan has been a major recipient of U.S. foreign assistance post-9/11, receiving over $18 billion from FY2002-FY2015. This includes $10.5 billion in economic and humanitarian aid, and $7.6 billion in security-related aid. Additionally, Pakistan has received around $13 billion in Coalition Support Fund payments for its support of U.S.-led military operations in Afghanistan. Aid flows decreased in 2011 due to strained bilateral relations, but saw a slight increase in 2013. The Administration requested $794 million for Pakistan aid in FY2016, a 10% decrease from the previous year. In 2013, the U.S. re-engaged with Pakistan, leading to agreements on security and economic initiatives. The $1.5 billion annual nonmilitary aid under the \"Kerry-Lugar-Berman\" authorization ended in FY2014, with decreasing appropriations since FY2010. Conditionality on U.S. aid to Pakistan now includes cooperation on nuclear nonproliferation and counter-improvised explosive device efforts. The United States has shown commitment to combating terrorist groups in Pakistan, with security forces not interfering in political or judicial processes. Economic support includes nearly $8 billion in Economic Support Funds since 2001, with additional aid for civilian and humanitarian purposes. This assistance has funded various USAID programs. In recent years, USAID has funded programs in key sectors like energy, economic growth, stabilization, health, and education in Pakistan. U.S. funds have been used to build dams for new power generation and improve transparency to combat corruption. Accomplishments include irrigating farmland, improving maternal and infant health, and boosting literacy. Many projects face security concerns, especially in the FATA region. The U.S.-Pakistan security ties were restored after the 1990 aid cutoff due to Pakistan's role in the U.S.-led anti-terrorism campaign. The United States allowed commercial sales for Pakistan to refurbish its fleet of F-16 fighter aircraft. Major military grants included various combat aircraft and weapons systems. The U.S.-Pakistan Defense Consultative Group discussed military cooperation, security assistance, and anti-terrorism. The forum continued under the Obama Administration. The U.S. has provided Pakistan with missiles, self-propelled howitzers, and a missile frigate, causing tensions with India and concerns about technology security. Coalition Support Reimbursements have totaled $13 billion since 2001, supporting Pakistani military operations and troops in the field. The U.S. has provided Pakistan with military equipment and financial support through Coalition Support Reimbursements. Questions for Congress include ideal levels of foreign assistance, allocation between economic and security aid, conditions on assistance, and national security interests. Questions for Congress include whether to continue authorizing the Pentagon to provide Pakistan with \"Coalition Support Fund\" reimbursements, the progress of Pakistan's military operations against militants, suspicions of Pakistan's military and intelligence services maintaining links with insurgent groups, the legitimacy and effectiveness of U.S. UAV strikes in Pakistan, and the role of Congress in oversight of this program. The questions for Congress regarding Pakistan include efforts to combat religious extremism, effectiveness of military supplies, roles in stabilizing Afghanistan, Pakistan-India relations, China's influence, democratization, and U.S. ally status. The Pakistani government's actions to protect human rights and religious minorities, along with the potential benefits of reducing tariffs on Pakistani textile imports to the United States for economic development, are key considerations for strengthening democratization in Islamabad."
