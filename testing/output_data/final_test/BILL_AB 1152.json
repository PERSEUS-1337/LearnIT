The Civil Code limits liability for deficiencies in residential construction. Condominium conversions are not affected by this title. Regarding water issues, doors and windows must prevent water from passing through unintended areas. Systems like windows and doors must have moisture barriers to prevent water intrusion. Windows, patio doors, deck doors, and their systems must prevent excessive condensation from causing damage. Roofs, roofing systems, chimney caps, and ventilation components should not allow water to enter the structure. Decks, balconies, exterior stairs, and their systems must prevent water from passing into adjacent structures. Foundation systems, slabs, decks, balconies, exterior stairs, and their systems must prevent water or vapor from entering the structure to avoid damage or limitations on flooring materials. Hardscape elements installed during original construction must not cause water or soil erosion to damage the structure or other building components. Exterior siding and walls must be installed to prevent water from entering the structure or bypassing moisture barriers. This includes components like pot shelves, columns, and plant-ons, as well as framing, flashings, and internal wall cavities. (11) Stucco, exterior siding, and walls must prevent excessive condensation from causing damage to other components. \"Systems\" include framing, substrate, flashings, trim, wall assemblies, and internal wall cavities.\n(12) Retaining and site walls with drainage systems should not allow unintended water to pass through moisture barriers, causing damage. This does not apply to areas designed for water flow.\n(13) Retaining walls and site walls should only allow water flow in designated areas.\n(14) Plumbing, sewer, and utility systems must not leak. (15) Plumbing, sewer, and utility lines must not corrode to impede system lifespan. (16) Sewer systems must allow designated sewage flow. (17) Waterproofing systems for showers and baths must prevent water leaks into walls and flooring. (18) Ceramic tile systems must deflect water to prevent damage. (b) Foundations, load-bearing components, and slabs must be free of significant cracks or displacement. Foundations, load bearing components, and slabs must comply with government building codes for structural safety, chemical deterioration, earthquake, and wind load resistance. Soils and retaining walls must not cause damage to the structure. Soils and engineered retaining walls must not compromise the structural integrity of the building. Structures must adhere to fire protection regulations, including the construction of fireplaces and chimneys to prevent fire hazards. Electrical and mechanical systems must be constructed to avoid fire risks. Plumbing and sewer systems should function properly without impairing the structure's use. Electrical systems must also operate correctly. No legal action can be taken for violations more than four years after close of escrow. Exterior pathways, driveways, hardscape, sidewalks, and patios must not have significant cracks or displacements. Stucco, siding, and other exterior finishes should also be free of cracks. Manufactured products like windows, doors, roofs, plumbing fixtures, and appliances must be installed properly to ensure their useful life. No legal action can be taken for violations more than four years after close of escrow. Manufactured products must be installed properly to ensure their useful life. If no useful life representation is made, the period should be no less than one year. Damage to a manufactured product due to a violation of standards is a recoverable element of damages. This does not limit recovery for damage to other building components caused by a manufactured product during its useful life. Heating and air-conditioning requirements for buildings are specified in California regulations. Heating must maintain room temperatures at specific levels based on the date of installation. Air-conditioning must meet size and efficiency criteria outlined in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. Attached structures must comply with noise transmission standards set by government building codes. Irrigation systems and drainage must not damage landscaping. Untreated wood posts should not be in contact with soil to prevent decay. Time limits apply for taking action on these issues. (9) Steel fences must prevent corrosion and be installed properly. Legal action must be taken within four years of close of escrow.\n(10) Paint and stains should not cause building surface deterioration for the specified time by manufacturers. Legal action must be taken within five years of close of escrow.\n(11) Roofing materials must be installed to prevent falling debris.\n(12) Landscaping systems should survive for at least one year. Legal action must be taken within two years of close of escrow.\n(13) Ceramic tile and backing must be installed securely to prevent detachment. Dryer ducts must be installed according to manufacturer requirements, with a limitation of legal action within two years of close of escrow. Structures must not pose public health hazards, as determined by authorized officials. The definition of \"structure\" and \"designed moisture barrier\" is provided in the Civil Code. The \"actual moisture barrier\" and \"unintended water\" are defined terms in the Civil Code. \"Close of escrow\" is defined as the date of the close of escrow between the builder and the original homeowner, or the date of substantial completion for claims by an association.
