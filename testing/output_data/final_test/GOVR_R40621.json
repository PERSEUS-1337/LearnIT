    "content": "Producers, consumers, and Members of Congress are interested in the link between farm prices and retail prices for food products, especially since 2006. Farm commodity prices have surged to record highs in 2008, 2011, 2013, and 2014, affecting wholesale and retail prices. Retail prices have remained stable or slightly decreased despite farm price fluctuations, sparking questions from various groups and Congress about the relationship between farm and retail prices. This report examines the factors influencing U.S. food prices from farm to consumer, including the lag in retail price response to farm price changes, the farm share of retail prices, and data sources for market decisions. The report analyzes the factors affecting U.S. food prices from farm to consumer, including price transmission, measurement of food costs, and retail price stickiness. It also investigates farm-to-retail price linkages for major commodities during the 2006-2013 period. The marketing chain from farm to retail customer adds various costs to the price of raw agricultural commodities, including labor, transportation, processing, storing, and retailing fees. The farm share of the market price decreases as the commodity moves through the chain. The marketing chain for retail food products varies in costs depending on processing levels and retail outlets. The consumer's food dollar is divided into the farm-value share and the value-added marketing share. The farm-value share of consumer food expenditures has decreased significantly over time, from 41% in 1950 to 17.4% in 2013. This indicates that U.S. farmers are receiving a smaller portion of what consumers pay for retail food products. However, this does not necessarily mean that marketing costs are too high or that farmers' well-being has declined. Marketing services expand based on consumer demand, which can vary for various reasons. The demand for more marketing services has increased due to various reasons. Consumer food expenditures in the U.S. have grown significantly, with a large portion of the increase attributed to price inflation rather than an increase in food volume. The marketing bill has risen substantially, indicating growth in costs for services like transportation, processing, and retailing. On the other hand, the farm value of consumer food expenditures has also increased. The farm share for at-home-food expenditures has remained stable, while the farm share for away-from-home-food expenditures has decreased significantly since 2000. Total consumer food expenditures have increased from $32.7 billion in 1970 to nearly $180 billion in 2013, with the market-value-added component of away-from-home-food expenditures rising faster than for at-home-food expenditures. The farm share for at-home-food expenditures has remained stable, while the farm share for away-from-home-food expenditures has decreased significantly since 2000. Annual estimates of farm share and marketing spreads are presented for selected food subgroupings and individual food products. The farm share varies among different food products, with foods requiring more processing giving farmers a smaller portion of the shopper's dollar. For cereals and bakery products, the farm share was just 8.3% during the 2007 to 2009 period due to the substantial processing involved. Cereals and bakery products undergo extensive processing before being packaged and shipped to retail outlets, incurring high shipping, advertising, and retailing costs. In contrast, eggs require minimal processing but involve significant crating and handling. Farm shares for eggs, beef, and broilers are relatively high, while dairy and pork have lower farm shares. The farm shares for dairy and pork are lower compared to beef and eggs, indicating more processing and marketing for the former. Fresh fruits and vegetables also have lower farm shares, suggesting increased importance of handling and shipping processes. Highly processed food items have significantly lower farm shares than minimally processed products. For example, minimally processed eggs have a farm share of 57.9%, while more processed ice cream has a lower farm share. The estimated farm share for citrus fruit products like grapefruit, oranges, and lemons ranges from 12% to 19%, indicating substantial handling and shipping costs in their final retail prices. The marketing bill series calculates the difference between the retail price and farm value, including all costs associated with getting the commodity from the farm to the consumer. The farm share measures proceeds of farm commodity sales tied to a food dollar expenditure and sold to non-farm establishments, excluding double counting. The marketing bill represents the market value added to farm commodities in a food dollar expenditure. Changes in consumer buying habits, such as dining out more or purchasing highly processed foods, can impact the national aggregate marketing bill. Since 1950, the U.S. marketing bill has grown from 59.1% to 82.6% of consumer food spending in 2013. This bill covers the cost of processing, energy, packaging, transportation, and retailing to get food products to consumers. The farm share, estimated at 17.4%, represents the proceeds of farm commodity sales in a food dollar expenditure. The national marketing bill provides insight into how these expenditures are divided among different marketing inputs. The major industry group components of the marketing bill (Figure 7) and their respective marketing-bill shares are listed and described below: Farm and Agribusiness (10.5%), Food Processing (15.5%), Packaging (2.6%), Transportation (3.3%), Wholesale Trade (9.2%). These industry groups are establishments grouped together by type of product or service provided. The curr_chunk provides a breakdown of different industry sectors contributing to the U.S. food supply, including Wholesale Trade, Retail Trade, Foodservice, Energy, Finance and Insurance, Advertising, and Other services. These sectors encompass various establishments and subcontracting entities. The curr_chunk explains how value added is recorded as income to primary factors in the food dollar accounts, including salary and benefits (48.6%) and property income (36.7%). This income is generated by assets used to produce and market products purchased from other establishments. In 2013, half of every food dollar expenditure went to the salary and benefits of domestic workers, slightly more than a third was spent as property income, and the remainder was split between the U.S. government (as output taxes) and imports from international sources. The farm-to-retail price spread is the difference between the farm share of a food product's price and the retail price. Price is the primary mechanism linking various levels of the market system, with changes in farm-to-retail prices originating from farm prices, marketing inputs, and retail prices. Understanding these price linkages involves measuring and analyzing the factors influencing them. The farm-to-retail price spread is determined by calculating the farm share of a food product's price and then analyzing the price spread at different stages of the market chain. Changes in consumer preferences drive the food marketing system to adjust services and prices to meet demand. The price transmission between consumer food products and farm prices is influenced by the mix of services and prices involved in the transformation process. The farm share of the retail price and market competitiveness play key roles in understanding this relationship. The more value added between the farm and consumers, the less impact a change in farm price will have on the retail price, especially for highly processed food products. Retail prices of food products are less responsive to changes in farm commodity prices for highly processed items like meat. The share of marketing inputs in retail products has been increasing over time, reducing the impact of farm price changes. Price transmission is quicker and more complete in competitive markets with many buyers and sellers. In competitive markets with many buyers and sellers, prices are more responsive to changes in market conditions. Concerns have been raised about excessive market power in food product markets, leading to scrutiny of market structures and their impact on farm-to-retail price linkages. Various factors make measuring the farm-to-retail price spread challenging. The farm-to-retail price spread is complex due to the diverse uses of agricultural commodities like corn, soybeans, sorghum, and wheat. Demand for these commodities comes from various markets such as food, livestock feed, and industrial uses, creating competition for agricultural output. The non-food uses of U.S. agricultural output, including biofuel production, have expanded rapidly in recent years, weakening the price linkage between retail products and farm commodity prices. The U.S. food distribution network has also evolved, with the growth of various outlets like big box stores, online delivery services, and ready-to-eat sections in grocery stores, increasing the complexity of pricing structures. The evolution of the U.S. food distribution network has led to increased complexity in pricing structures, with grocery stores offering more convenience through prepared meals. This shift has reduced the farm share of retail prices and weakened the price response to changes in farm commodity prices. Vertical price transmission plays a key role in transmitting changes in farm prices along the marketing chain. Price transmission along the marketing chain involves the adjustment of farm prices as they move downstream to retail and upstream to farm. Economists focus on three components: magnitude (extent of pass-through), speed of adjustment, and asymmetry in response to price shocks. This report focuses on asymmetry in price transmission, specifically on adjustment differences between price rises and declines. It illustrates how a price rise at the farm level can transmit faster and more fully to the retail level compared to a price decline. The report illustrates asymmetric price transmission, showing that a price rise at the farm level transmits faster and more fully to the retail level compared to a price decline. For example, a 50% farm price shock leads to a 10% retail price decline over a six-month period, with most of the pass-through occurring in the fourth and fifth months. This asymmetry means consumers may not fully benefit from farm price reductions, while processors and retailers could benefit from \"sticky\" retail prices. The report discusses asymmetric price transmission, where a price rise at the farm level is quickly and fully passed on to the retail level compared to a price decline. This asymmetry results in \"sticky\" retail prices, benefiting processors and retailers while consumers may not fully benefit from farm price reductions. The phenomenon of asymmetric or \"sticky\" retail prices can exist even without abnormal market power. Empirical evidence supports the asymmetry between farm and retail prices, but the specific nature of price pass-through remains inconclusive. The relationship between farm and retail prices is still inconclusive. Economic analysis suggests that changes in farm prices usually lead to changes in retail prices, with retail prices responding asymmetrically and with time lags. Retail food prices are perceived to adjust faster to increases in farm prices than decreases. The general perception is that retail food prices are \"sticky,\" following commodity prices upwards rapidly but falling back slowly. Policymakers are concerned about imperfect price transmission due to market power and oligopolistic behavior. Economic theory suggests that retail price stickiness is inversely related to retail competition, but there are exceptions noted by economists. Economists have identified exceptions to retail price competition, limiting adjustments to downward farm prices. Asymmetric price transmission doesn't always indicate excessive market power. Factors like consumer behavior and store strategies can lead to price stickiness, influencing grocery purchase decisions beyond just retail prices. Consumer shopping patterns, wealth levels, and local retail prices all contribute to lower price responsiveness by consumers. This allows retail outlets to maintain higher prices without losing market share. Consumers may be reluctant to find cheaper alternatives when prices rise, due to search costs. Retail inventory management and large inventories purchased during high commodity prices can lead to sticky prices. This can result in a time lag between farm and retail price changes as stores work through their inventory. Retail stores may take time to adjust prices due to high inventory levels purchased at higher prices, known as sticky prices. This delay, referred to as \"menu cost,\" includes the expenses of changing prices and the risk of confusing customers with frequent adjustments. The decision to lower prices depends on the potential increase in sales outweighing the cost of updating price labels. Market price uncertainty also plays a role in determining if a price change is permanent. Market price uncertainty can influence retail price strategy, leading to asymmetry in retail and farm price movements. Retailers may be hesitant to lower prices during volatile commodity and energy price periods, fearing costs may rise quickly. This results in \"sticky\" retail prices, where consumers only partially benefit from lower commodity prices. In contrast, farm prices respond quickly to market conditions. Farm prices respond quickly to market conditions as agricultural markets are competitive. Farmers have little control over selling prices but can decide when to sell. Concerns arise over how increased input costs affect prices - passed on to consumers, back to farmers, or absorbed by food processors. The time period is crucial in evaluating cost incidence. Economic theory suggests short-term sensitivity of food prices to input cost changes. In the short run, food prices are more sensitive to input price changes due to time needed for behavioral adjustments. In the long run, firms and consumers have more time to adjust, mitigating effects on consumer prices. Some firms may exit the industry or adjust input mix to find cheaper alternatives. In the short run, food producers and consumers are limited in their response to unexpected input price changes, as wholesalers and retailers are unable to adjust quickly. In the long run, firms and consumers have more time to substitute among food products to obtain their nutritional needs at the lowest cost. Some firms may adjust their input mix or seek out increased supplies of the more expensive input via imports or expanded domestic production. Certain characteristics of farm commodities play a role in price transmission between the farm and retail consumer. Livestock production has a cyclical pattern due to biological constraints, leading to lag time in price adjustments. Annual crops have seasonal patterns influenced by storability, while perishable products have shorter shelf life and show strong seasonal price variations. Prices for perishable products exhibit strong seasonal patterns and are susceptible to volatile swings based on near-term conditions. Long-term price formation is more influenced by producer behavior rather than current supplies. On the demand side, food products like meat and turkey have seasonal demand patterns, with meat demand increasing in the summer months and turkey demand spiking during Thanksgiving and Christmas. During the 2006 to 2009 period, there were wide variances between low farm and high retail prices, indicating potential discrepancies in pricing strategies by food retailers. During 2006 to 2009, variances between low farm and high retail prices raised concerns of price gouging by food retailers. Retail grocery competition makes large-scale price manipulation unlikely. Consumers may misinterpret retail price responsiveness due to time lag in farm-to-retail price adjustments. \"Loss leader\" items can further distort consumer perceptions of price transmission. The final section examines farm-to-retail price linkages for major commodities since 2006, followed by comparisons of price data for select retail food products. Price indexes for food groups are presented visually to show farm, wholesale, and retail price movements. National aggregate price indexes are included in Figure 12. In 2008, farm commodity prices rose to record highs due to tight supplies and other factors. This trend repeated in late 2010, early 2011, late 2012, and early 2014, leading to higher retail food prices. However, these farm price increases were short-lived, eventually reversing direction. Prices for farm commodities rose to record highs in 2008, but eventually declined, giving back much of the original rise. Retail prices leveled off or declined slowly relative to the initial price increase. The spread between food-at-home CPI and PPI for consumer foods is used to gauge grocer margins. Retail price changes vary widely by commodity and market, with most prices staying within a narrow range to maintain competitive sales. The food marketing system's value is largely independent of farm prices, with consumer prices remaining steady or rising despite farm price declines. Agricultural productivity gains have led to a historical decline in farm prices, exemplified by the steady decrease in corn prices from the late 1940s to 2006. Major market-shifting factors since 2006 include increased demand for corn due to federal biofuels incentives and China's soybean import surge. Since 2014, normal weather has helped farm production catch up with demand, lowering commodity prices. Despite technological gains, the food marketing bill has risen rapidly in nominal dollars and slowly in real terms. Farm share has declined for most foods, widening farm-to-consumer price spreads due to increased importance of general inflation components like energy and labor. Inflation factors like energy and labor have become more significant in retail food prices. Charts compare farm, wholesale, and retail price indexes for major food groups. Farm and wholesale prices show larger movements than retail prices, with retail prices peaking after farm prices, except for egg prices. The curr_chunk discusses how retail prices peak after farm prices, except for egg prices, and how retail prices are highly correlated with farm prices for food products with identifiable farm commodities. The data includes figures comparing national average farm prices and U.S. city average retail prices. Retail prices typically change direction in response to farm price changes with a slight lag."
