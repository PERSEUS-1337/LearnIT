    "content": "The \"Protecting American Lives Act\" defines key terms and ensures that if any provision is deemed invalid, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. It also addresses information sharing regarding criminal aliens. Section 642 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 is amended to update references to the Department of Homeland Security, change \"may\" to \"shall\" in subsection (a), and clarify law enforcement activities in subsection (b). It now includes notifying the Federal Government about inadmissible and deportable aliens. The amendment to Section 642 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 addresses the presence of inadmissible and deportable aliens encountered by law enforcement personnel. It prohibits government entities from issuing policies that violate Federal law or restrict compliance with Federal law. Compliance by States or political subdivisions with Federal law is emphasized. States with laws prohibiting law enforcement officers from assisting Federal immigration enforcement will lose funding under certain programs. Annual determinations will be made regarding eligibility for funds. The Secretary of Homeland Security annually determines which States or political subdivisions are not compliant with laws prohibiting assistance to Federal immigration enforcement. Non-compliant jurisdictions are ineligible for Federal financial assistance for at least one year. The Secretary of Homeland Security certifies compliance of jurisdictions to receive funds. Funds not allocated due to non-compliance are reallocated. States and political subdivisions must provide information about apprehended aliens to the Secretary in a timely manner. The Secretary of Homeland Security must be provided with identifying information about aliens in custody for inadmissibility or deportability. An annual report on compliance is required, and non-compliant states will be determined and reported to Congress. Reimbursement for costs incurred by states or political subdivisions is mandated. Law enforcement officials are not required to provide this information. Law enforcement officials from a State or political subdivisions must provide information to the Secretary of Homeland Security regarding crime victims or witnesses, and may report or arrest them. SEC. 4. CLARIFYING THE AUTHORITY OF ICE DETAINERS. The Secretary is required to execute lawful writs, process, and orders issued by the United States. States or political subdivisions that refuse to comply with DHS detainers will lose funding allocated under specific programs. The \"Cops on the Beat\" program and other law enforcement grants fall under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. States or political subdivisions complying with DHS detainers are immune from civil actions brought by aliens. Congress believes DHS has probable cause when issuing a detainer for inadmissible or deportable aliens. SEC. 5 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to increase the minimum sentence for illegal reentry to not less than 5 years. This applies to various subsections, including imprisonment for different offenses related to illegal reentry."
