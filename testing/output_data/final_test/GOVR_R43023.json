    "content": "The federal government's authority is derived from the Constitution, including Congress's power to enact criminal laws in specific instances. Congress is explicitly granted the authority to define and punish counterfeiting, piracy, felonies on the high seas, offenses against the law of nations, and treason. The Constitution grants Congress the authority to enact criminal laws, including the power to define and punish specific offenses such as counterfeiting, piracy, and treason. While Congress has broad powers, there are limitations on its criminal law enacting authority, such as restrictions on punishment for treason outlined in Article III. The Constitution grants Congress the authority to enact criminal laws, including defining and punishing offenses like counterfeiting, piracy, and treason. Limitations on this authority include prohibitions on ex post facto laws, abridgment of freedom of speech, and federalism constraints. Recent cases illustrate the boundaries of Congress's power under various clauses of the Constitution. The Necessary and Proper Clause grants broad power to Congress to enact laws that are 'convenient or useful' for carrying out its constitutional authority. Recent Supreme Court decisions have provided differing interpretations of the scope of this clause, with questions raised about Tenth Amendment limits on congressional authority. The Supreme Court has granted certiorari in Bond and Kebodeaux regarding the limits of congressional authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause. In Comstock, the Court addressed the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. 4248, which allows for the civil commitment of federal inmates deemed mentally ill and sexually dangerous. The Court did not directly rule on whether this statute was a necessary and proper means of executing the Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court in Comstock confirmed that Section 4248 is a necessary and proper means of exercising federal authority to create criminal laws, punish violators, and maintain security. The Court emphasized that a statute cannot be \"proper\" if it is constitutionally prohibited or inconsistent with the Constitution. The Supreme Court in Comstock upheld Section 4248 as necessary and proper for federal authority in criminal laws. The Court considered five key factors in its decision, including the breadth of the Necessary and Proper Clause and federal involvement in mental health. The Fifth and Ninth Circuits interpreted these factors differently. The Ninth Circuit interpreted the Comstock considerations differently in cases involving federal sex offenders. The Fifth Circuit found the Necessary and Proper Clause insufficient to support the application of SORNA to a fully discharged federal sex offender. In contrast, the Ninth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion for a federal sex offender still under supervised release. The case of Kebodeaux, a 21-year-old soldier court martialed for engaging in consensual sex with a 15-year-old, was central to the interpretation of SORNA. Kebodeaux and Elk Shoulder were convicted under 18 U.S.C. 2250(a) for failing to register under SORNA after moving to different locations. The Fifth and Ninth Circuits differed in their interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause in relation to challenges to SORNA. The Fifth and Ninth Circuits differed in their interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause in relation to challenges to SORNA. The Fifth Circuit acknowledged Congress's broad authority, while the Ninth Circuit found SORNA to be rationally related to an enumerated power. The Comstock Court compared the civil commitment statute to existing federal mental-health statutes, while the Ninth Circuit likened SORNA to federal parole, probation, and supervised release laws. The Fifth Circuit considered SORNA historically novel compared to probation and supervised release. The Fifth Circuit disagreed with the Ninth Circuit on the application of SORNA, believing that custodial responsibility for those soon to be released differs from those released long ago. This difference prevented the Fifth Circuit from classifying SORNA's registration demands as punitive. The Fifth Circuit disagreed with the Ninth Circuit on the application of SORNA, as it viewed SORNA as less accommodating than the Comstock statute. SORNA does not supplant state systems and only applies criminal penalties to state or federal sex offenders who travel in interstate commerce. Unlike the Comstock statute, SORNA does not give state authorities the option to substitute state discretion for federal authorities. The Fifth Circuit disagreed with the Ninth Circuit on the application of SORNA, as it viewed SORNA as less accommodating than the Comstock statute. SORNA does not give state authorities the option to substitute state discretion for federal authorities. The Fifth Circuit concluded that SORNA, as applied to Kebodeaux, exceeded Congress's authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Bond decision addressed federalism concerns regarding congressional authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact treaty implementing legislation. Mrs. Bond was convicted of using a chemical weapon and argued that Congress lacked the constitutional authority to bring her case to federal court. The Supreme Court reversed the Third Circuit's decision in the \"the mill\" assault case, allowing Mrs. Bond to challenge her conviction on federalism grounds. The court had to determine the extent to which federalism limits congressional authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause to implement a United States treaty, as seen in Missouri v. Holland. The Holland Court considered the validity of the statute under Article I, Section 8 as a necessary means to execute Government powers. A treaty may be invalid if it exceeds Treaty Power authority, an express limitation in the Constitution, or an implicit constitutional limitation. The Migratory Bird Treaty was deemed within Treaty Power and did not violate any constitutional prohibitions. The Holland Court addressed concerns about the Tenth Amendment and concluded that the treaty was not forbidden by it. The Holland Court compared state and federal claims regarding the Migratory Bird Treaty. Missouri's claim was weak as wild birds have no permanent habitat in the state. The federal interest was substantial, requiring national action to protect the food supply. The treaty was found to be valid under Article I, Section 8 and not forbidden by the Tenth Amendment. The Constitution mandates the Government to act when a food supply is threatened and our forests and crops are at risk. The treaty and statute must be upheld, as argued in the Third Circuit. Mrs. Bond accepted the validity of the Chemical Weapons Convention but challenged congressional authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The court, bound by Holland's precedent, upheld the treaty's validity and the statute as necessary to execute federal powers. The court upheld the validity of the statute as a necessary means to execute government powers, rejecting the argument that it disrupts the balance of power. Mrs. Bond's case was seen as a questionable use of prosecutorial discretion, trivializing the concept of chemical weapons. A concurring panel member criticized the decision and hoped for Supreme Court review, which has been accepted. The Court accepted the case for review regarding the Belfast decision on whether Congress's treaty implementing authority is limited by due process. Belfast was convicted of overseas violations of the Torture Act, arguing that it exceeded congressional authority under the Treaty Power and Necessary and Proper Clauses. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Torture Act as a valid exercise of congressional power. The Torture Act was deemed a valid exercise of congressional power under the Necessary and Proper Clause, as it aligns with the provisions of the CAT. Despite the violations occurring overseas, there was minimal threat to state law enforcement interests. The Constitution limits congressional authority for the protection of U.S. citizens. Belfast argued lack of notice due to the absence of CAT ratification in the nation where the torture occurred, but the court disagreed. The issue of structural limitations did not arise. The Interstate Commerce Clause grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among states, with foreign nations, and with Indian Tribes. This power allows Congress to enact statutes regulating the channels of interstate commerce and protecting instrumentalities of interstate commerce. This authority has been affirmed in various court cases such as United States v. Lopez, United States v. Morrison, and Gonzales v. Raich. Congress has the power to regulate activities related to interstate commerce, such as outlawing the destruction of aircraft or theft from interstate shipments. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress cannot force states to enforce federal programs, as seen in cases like New York v. United States and Printz v. United States. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Commerce Clause does not allow Congress to regulate activities without a direct relation to commerce, as seen in cases like Lopez and Morrison. However, Congress can regulate intrastate activities that impact interstate commerce, such as in the case of marijuana cultivation. Business justices found that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's individual mandate exceeded Congress's power under the Interstate Commerce Clause. The Kebodeaux court also ruled that the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act went beyond Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause. In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, a limitation on congressional power was suggested regarding penalizing the failure to engage in commerce. This limitation was related to the individual mandate feature of the Affordable Care Act, which requires healthy individuals to obtain insurance or pay a penalty. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's individual mandate requires individuals to obtain insurance or pay a penalty. The Supreme Court found that the mandate is a valid exercise of Congress's constitutional taxing power, but some Justices stated that the Commerce Clause does not provide sufficient authority for its enactment. Chief Justice Roberts and others noted that regulating commerce does not include requiring individuals to engage in commerce. The dissenters also argued that the mandate regulates the failure to maintain minimum essential coverage, which they believe exceeds Congress's authority. The dissent in the case argued that regulating the failure to maintain minimum essential coverage exceeds Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause. The Fifth Circuit in Kebodeaux also rejected the suggestion that the application of the statute in question exceeded Congress's Necessary and Proper powers. The Fifth Circuit in Kebodeaux ruled that Congress lacked the authority under the Commerce Clause to require fully discharged former federal sex offenders to register when relocating within a state. The court found that the justifications for this requirement were too broad and infringed upon state criminal law prerogatives. Additionally, the court determined that the application of the statute in question resembled the regulation of non-economic activity in previous cases, rather than regulating quintessentially economic activity. A disagreement has arisen in lower federal appellate courts regarding the application of Lopez Interstate Commerce Clause standards to the Foreign Commerce Clause. The Ninth Circuit previously stated that the Foreign Commerce Clause could be defined without reference to Lopez standards, while the Third Circuit recently questioned this approach. The Second Circuit avoided the issue by using statutory construction in a case involving an American expatriate living in Cambodia. Clark was convicted under 18 U.S.C. 2423(c) for engaging in commercial sexual activity with children under 18 in Cambodia. The Ninth Circuit held that his conduct fell within Congress's Foreign Commerce Clause authority, despite his argument that it exceeded its limits. A dissenting panel member disagreed, stating that the Foreign Commerce Clause should not allow regulation of all commercial activities post-international travel. Weingarten, an American expatriate, was convicted for sexually abusing his daughter during international travel. He argued that the statute on unlawful sexual activity during foreign commerce exceeded congressional authority. The Second Circuit ruled that the statute did not apply to travel between foreign countries without a nexus to the United States. The court's decision in Pendleton's case upheld Congress's constitutional authority to punish noncommercial overseas sexual activity under the Foreign Commerce Clause. The Third Circuit found that the facts satisfied the \"channels of commerce\" standard established in Lopez, allowing Congress to prevent such behavior. The Third Circuit held that Congress has the authority to prevent illicit sex tourism using the channels of commerce. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 allows prosecution of American expatriates for engaging in unlawful sexual conduct overseas without proving travel in foreign commerce. This expands the scope of punishment for illicit sexual conduct committed by U.S. citizens or permanent residents abroad. The Bellaizac-Hurtado court's interpretation of the Law of Nations Clause limits Congress's ability to define and punish offenses. The scope of the Piracy Clause remains uncertain under the Dire court's construction. Congress has more legislative freedom under the High Seas Clause, as seen in cases under the MDLEA and DTVIA. Bellaizac-Hurtado and co-defendants were arrested in Panama for possessing 760 kilograms of cocaine on an unflagged vessel, leading to indictments under the MDLEA. The Bellaizac-Hurtado court's interpretation of the Law of Nations Clause limited Congress's authority to define and punish offenses. The court ruled that congressional power under the Law of Nations Clause did not extend to prohibiting drug trafficking in another nation's territorial waters. The court emphasized that an offense must be contrary to customary international law to fall under the law of nations. The Bellaizac-Hurtado court ruled that drug trafficking did not constitute an offense against the law of nations as it was not recognized as contrary to customary international law. Despite nations endorsing treaties to suppress drug trafficking, evidence showed that many did not feel legally obligated to do so. The court's interpretation limited Congress's power under the Law of Nations Clause. The Supreme Court decision suggests that Congress's power under the Law of Nations Clause may be more robust in certain contexts. The High Seas Clauses cases primarily involve the MDLEA and DTVIA. Lower federal courts concluded that Congress had the authority to enact the MDLEA to punish offenses on the high seas. The DTVIA cases continue this reasoning, with Ibarguen-Mosquera convicted of operating an unflagged vessel. Ibarguen-Mosquera was convicted of operating an unflagged, semi-submersible vessel in international waters in violation of the Drug Trafficking Vessel Interdiction Act (DTVIA). He argued that DTVIA exceeded congressional authority and violated due process, but the court upheld the conviction citing Congress's authority under the High Seas Clause and due process limitations on reaching foreign nationals in international waters. Saac was also convicted under DTVIA. The court upheld convictions under DTVIA for Ibarguen-Mosquera and Saac, citing Congress's authority under the High Seas Clause. The court also found Cardales-Luna guilty under MDLEA for drug trafficking on the high seas. The court upheld convictions under DTVIA for Ibarguen-Mosquera and Saac, citing Congress's authority under the High Seas Clause. Cardales-Luna was found guilty under MDLEA for drug trafficking on the high seas, satisfying MDLEA's \"vessel within the jurisdiction of the United States\" requirement. Judge Torruella contended that the application of MDLEA to Appellant constitutes an ultra vires extension of Congress's legislative powers to foreign territory, with no nexus to the United States. The court upheld convictions under DTVIA for Ibarguen-Mosquera and Saac, citing Congress's authority under the High Seas Clause. Dire was convicted of piracy under 18 U.S.C. 1651 following his participation in an armed attack on a U.S. Navy frigate that he believed to be a merchant ship. The Fourth Circuit acknowledged that Congress has the constitutional authority to define and punish piracy. Section 1651 outlaws piracy \"as defined by the law of nations.\" The Supreme Court has set limitations on Congress's use of the Spending Clause, stating that conditions on federal grants must be related to the federal interest in national projects or programs. Congress cannot use its spending power to coerce state participation. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot use its spending power to coerce state participation in federal programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's attempt to condition Medicaid funds on state participation was deemed coercive and unconstitutional. Congress can incentivize but not compel states to participate in federal programs. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot coerce states into participating in federal programs through the use of its spending power. The Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was deemed beyond the scope of Congress's power. Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Breyer and Kagan, highlighted the issue of coercion in their opinion. The case did not involve a criminal statute, but it raised questions about the limits of Congress's power in enacting laws. The Fourth Circuit upheld the conviction of a foreign DOD contractor in Afghanistan for assault resulting in serious bodily injury under MEJA. Brehm argued that Congress had no authority to outlaw altercations between foreign nationals outside the US, but the court found that the Military Clauses and Necessary and Proper Clause provided constitutional authority. Due process was not violated as Brehm had fair notice that his assault could lead to prosecution."
