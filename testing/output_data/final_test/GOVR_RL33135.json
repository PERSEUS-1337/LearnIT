The Global Fund's board includes representatives from donor and recipient governments, NGOs, the private sector, and affected communities. The organization began operations in January 2002 with a small Secretariat in Geneva. The Global Fund is not an agency but a \"financial instrument\" to mobilize resources for disease control. Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs) bring stakeholders together to prioritize and submit grant applications. Principal Recipients, like health ministries or NGOs, are responsible for implementation. Grants are reviewed by experts and overseen by a Local Fund Agent. Grant-making occurs in announced \"Rounds.\" The Global Fund operates in \"Rounds\" to allocate funds for new grants, ensuring projects are not interrupted due to lack of funding. PEPFAR was launched in 2003 by President George W. Bush, building on previous international AIDS projects by the US government. PEPFAR, authorized in May 2003, consolidated AIDS efforts under a Global AIDS Coordinator. Randall Tobias, former Eli Lilly CEO, was appointed by President Bush. The initiative pledged $9 billion over five years for 15 countries, channeled through the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative. Additionally, $5 billion was allocated for bilateral AIDS programs in 105 countries and $1 billion for the Global Fund, totaling $10 billion in new funding. PEPFAR and the Global Fund have been criticized for the slow pace of scaling up efforts to combat the global AIDS pandemic, but both are claiming success. PEPFAR aims to support treatment for 2 million HIV-infected people by 2008, prevent 7 million new HIV infections, and provide care for 10 million people affected by HIV/AIDS. As of March 2005, PEPFAR was supporting antiretroviral therapy for over 235,000 AIDS patients in focus countries. OGAC estimates that in FY2004 it reached 120 million people in the focus countries with prevention messages on abstinence and faithfulness, and provided 96 million condoms for high-risk behavior programs. The Global Fund had approved 316 grants in 127 countries by July 2005, putting 220,000 patients on HIV therapy, testing 2.5 million people, and supporting 397,000 orphans. Overlapping programs supported by both PEPFAR and the Global Fund had an estimated 63,000 patients in 2004. The Global Fund estimated needing $3.3 billion in 2006. The Global Fund estimated needing $3.3 billion in 2006 and 2007 to cover existing grants. Donors pledged $3.7 billion in 2005, but additional pledges are needed to fund new grants. The Board approved 26 grants costing $382 million, with 37 more costing $344 million pending pledges in 2006. The Global Fund estimated needing $3.3 billion in 2006 and 2007 to cover existing grants. Donors pledged $3.7 billion in 2005, but additional pledges are needed to fund new grants. The Board approved 26 grants costing $382 million, with 37 more costing $344 million pending pledges in the first half of 2006. If sufficient pledges are not received by the end of June 2006, the grants will be denied final approval. The United States made initial contributions totaling $275 million from appropriations for FY2001 and FY2002. For FY2003 through FY2005, the Administration requested $200 million annually, but Congress provided more than requested each year. A $200 million request is in keeping with the PEPFAR promise of $1 billion over five years, but for FY2006, the Administration raised its request to $300 billion. House and Senate versions of FY2006 appropriations would again provide more for the Global Fund than requested. In FY2004, $87.8 million of the Global Fund appropriation was not provided due to legislative limits on U.S. contributions. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations legislation directed these funds to be provided in FY2005, subject to the 33% proviso. The Senate-passed Foreign Operations bill for FY2006 included $100 million transferred from the Economic. The Foreign Operations bill for FY2006 includes $100 million transferred from the Economic Support Fund. The U.S. pledged $600 million for 2006 and 2007 at a pledging conference in London, with the final amount to be determined by Congress. The U.S. contribution represents 16% of the total pledges for the two years. America's European partners pledged $1.6 billion, with the U.S. contributing $600 million for the Global Fund in FY2006. The Global Fund and PEPFAR are seen as partners in the fight against AIDS, with the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund being a strategic priority. The two programs work together as part of the Administration's global strategy against the epidemic. The Global Fund and PEPFAR are partners in the fight against AIDS, with the U.S. contributing strategically. U.S. cooperation with the Global Fund has been significant, with key figures like Tommy Thompson and Ambassador Tobias involved. This partnership represents a major U.S. policy investment in the Global Fund. The Global Fund, in partnership with PEPFAR, plays a crucial role in fighting AIDS globally. The U.S. contributes significantly to the Global Fund, leveraging its investment to mobilize resources for AIDS relief outside focus countries. Through collaboration with local organizations, the Global Fund enhances treatment and relief efforts within focus countries. Many feel that the Global Fund complements PEPFAR objectives by building indigenous institutional capacities through local partnerships. PEPFAR bilateral programs provide emergency assistance in heavily affected countries where local institutions struggle. Both organizations work closely together, emphasizing cooperation at the local level. The Global Fund and PEPFAR emphasize cooperation at both local and headquarters levels. USAID provides technical assistance to CCMs for Global Fund proposals. Future collaboration may involve U.S. AIDS experts monitoring Global Fund projects. Some suspect U.S. officials are not entirely satisfied with the Global Fund's impact. Some believe that the Global Fund's strained relationship with the U.S. may stem from past decisions and anti-multilateral sentiments within the Administration. Criticisms of Fund operations in 2004 led to doubts about U.S. support. The Global Fund's relationship with the U.S. has improved with increased cooperation, symbolized by a $300 million request in FY2006. However, U.S. contributions remain a point of contention, with Fund supporters urging an increase to encourage other donors to do the same. The one-third rule governing U.S. contributions is seen as a benchmark for other donors, who are expected to provide two-thirds of the funding. States would need to contribute $2.3 billion in FY2006 and FY2007 combined to meet the Global Fund's $7 billion need, instead of the $600 million pledged by Ambassador Tobias. The U.S. has been the largest contributor to the Global Fund, contributing nearly twice as much as all other donors combined. There is debate over whether the U.S. should increase its contribution further, with some arguing that the U.S. has already been generous. The United States is exceeding its initial promise of $1 billion over five years for PEPFAR. There was criticism at the Bankok meeting regarding U.S. funding for the Global Fund, with the U.S. not fulfilling a request for a $1 billion annual contribution. The U.S. remains the largest contributor to fighting the global pandemic through both the Global Fund and PEPFAR. The United States contributes 45.4% of funds for international AIDS programs, ranking third in funding when adjusted for Gross National Income. Donors are falling short of the $14.9 billion needed to fight AIDS in 2006, with only $8.9 billion likely to be provided. Other donors are urged to increase their contributions. The United States contributes a significant amount to international AIDS programs, ranking third in funding when adjusted for Gross National Income. There is a debate over the one-third rule governing U.S. contributions to the Global Fund, with calls for an increase in funding from advocacy organizations and editorials. Other donors are urged to increase their contributions to meet the $14.9 billion needed to fight AIDS in 2006. Some argue for an increase in U.S. funding to the Global Fund to show leadership in the fight against AIDS. They praise the Fund's multilateral approach and contrast it with PEPFAR's bilateral efforts. Supporters believe the Global Fund contributes to institution-building in developing countries, benefiting governance and growth. Many support the Global Fund as the primary U.S. response to the pandemic, citing its effectiveness in battling communicable diseases. They prefer it over PEPFAR's programs due to perceived restrictions. Some question the effectiveness of abstinence-until-marriage programs and worry about the impact of the prostitution pledge on NGOs working with key HIV vectors. Ambassador Tobias rescinded a requirement for NGOs funded through the Global Fund to sign the pledge in 2005. Opponents of increasing U.S. contributions to the Global Fund argue that PEPFAR's bilateral efforts are superior, emphasizing the involvement of experienced U.S. agencies like USAID and CDC. They believe PEPFAR's field spending, directed by personnel at U.S. embassies, results in better coordination. PEPFAR's involvement with local institutions is seen as beneficial for building capacity and improving governance in focus countries. Supporters argue that the program's restrictions reflect U.S. values and have gained domestic political support for significant funding. Some PEPFAR advocates believe that Global Fund programs have faced difficulties, leading to arguments against larger contributions. The Global Fund's oversight mechanisms have been effective in suspending grants in Ukraine and Uganda due to mismanagement, with supporters viewing this as an incentive for recipient countries to improve grant management. Grants to Ukraine have been resumed with conditions for governance improvements. Uganda is implementing changes to improve grant management for Global Fund grants. The ongoing debate between advocates for the Global Fund and PEPFAR bilateral programs is seen as unfortunate, as both are making important contributions in the fight against AIDS. Some believe that the Global Fund should receive resources without taking away from bilateral efforts. The United States has already contributed significantly to the Global Fund. The United States' contribution to the Global Fund may face challenges in meeting its objectives for AIDS treatment and prevention. Leveraging larger contributions from other donors is difficult due to finite resources available under appropriations bills. Executive branch agencies tend to prioritize bilateral programs over multilateral ones, despite supporting both. The Global Fund faces challenges in receiving adequate funding from the United States, as executive branch agencies prioritize bilateral programs over multilateral ones. Advocates suggest increasing the budget request to Congress for Foreign Operations and/or Labor/HHS to allow for a larger contribution to the Global Fund, but this may be difficult due to concerns over the federal deficit and high levels of spending on other priorities. Some advocates argue for repealing legislative provisions limiting the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund to avoid future fund withholding. Others suggest retaining the provision as an incentive for other donors. A concerted effort to persuade other countries to increase their contributions is also proposed. U.S. officials may highlight their bilateral efforts against AIDS under PEPFAR to justify their contribution levels. Some suggest that Secretary of State Rice and President Bush should advocate for the Global Fund, while skeptics question if other countries would contribute more without a U.S. increase. Ambassador Tobias urged non-government sources to donate, and music events like Live Aid could raise funds. The global effort to end world poverty drew over a million people worldwide, with limited contributions to the Global Fund from non-government sources. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has donated $150 million, while corporations, individuals, groups, and events have contributed smaller amounts. There is a debate on the untapped potential for larger donations and the need to boost Global Fund resources to combat the Global AIDS pandemic effectively."
