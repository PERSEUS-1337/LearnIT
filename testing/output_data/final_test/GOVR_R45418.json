    "content": "The Federal Pell Grant program, authorized by the Higher Education Act of 1965, is the largest source of federal grant aid for undergraduate students, providing $29 billion to 7.2 million students in FY2017. Pell Grants are need-based aid and make up a significant portion of federal, state, and institutional undergraduate grant aid. The program's discretionary authority was extended through FY2018 under the General Education Provisions Act. The report provides descriptions of key elements of the Pell Grant program, recipient demographics, award levels, program costs, and funding. It explains the award process, eligibility requirements, and funding streams. Additionally, historical award amounts are included in the appendices. The Pell Grant program overview includes student eligibility, award rules, and application process. Grants are provided to financially needy undergraduates without repayment. Applicants must submit the FAFSA for consideration. The FAFSA calculates the expected family contribution (EFC) for postsecondary education expenses. Applicants receive a Student Aid Record (SAR) and institutions receive an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR). Pell Grants are portable aid that follows students to eligible institutions. The Pell Grant program provides aid to eligible students based on their EFC, enrollment rate, and cost of attendance. Students must meet requirements for enrollment in an eligible program at an eligible institution to qualify for the grant. To qualify for a Pell Grant, students must be enrolled in an eligible program at an eligible institution, have a high school diploma, meet citizenship requirements, maintain satisfactory academic progress, not be in default on a Title IV student loan, and have repaid any fraudulently obtained Title IV funds. Students may be disqualified for unusual enrollment history or drug convictions while receiving HEA Title IV aid. Pell Grant eligibility requirements include not having completed a bachelor's degree, being enrolled in a non-foreign institution, demonstrating financial need, not being incarcerated, and not being subject to civil commitment after a sexual offense. Students with significant intellectual disabilities must be accepted for enrollment. Students with significant intellectual disabilities must be accepted for enrollment in a comprehensive transition and postsecondary program. Pell Grant awards are determined based on need and EFC, with the neediest students receiving the highest awards. Awards decrease as need decreases or EFC increases, and are prorated for less-than-full-time attendance. Pell Grants are awarded without consideration of other financial assistance. The Pell Grant is the foundation of federal need-based aid in a financial aid package, awarded without regard to other aid. Other federal aid is added after the Pell Grant is awarded. The award year starts on July 1 and ends on June 30. The academic year is determined by the institution and requires a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time. The academic year for Pell Grant eligibility requires a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time. Each educational program establishes its academic year with at least two payment periods. The discretionary base maximum award for AY2018-2019 is $5,035. The discretionary base maximum award for Pell Grants is determined by laws and funding availability. The mandatory add-on award is set by the Higher Education Act (HEA) and has remained at $1,060 since AY2018-2019. Statutory provisions previously adjusted the mandatory add-on amount for inflation annually, but now it remains constant. The total maximum Pell Grant award amount is the sum of the discretionary base maximum award and the mandatory add-on award. The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is used to determine eligibility for need-based aid. The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is crucial in determining eligibility for federal need-based aid. The EFC calculation varies for dependent and independent students, with the lowest EFC being $0. Independent students are typically 24 years old or meet specific criteria outlined in the Higher Education Act. The EFC is based on family and financial information provided on the FAFSA. Students with an EFC higher than the maximum Pell Grant or their Cost of Attendance (COA) may not qualify for federal aid. Students who apply for federal student aid and meet certain qualifications automatically receive a zero Expected Family Contribution (EFC) of $0. Qualifications are based on income thresholds and meeting specific criteria. Dependent and independent students with dependents can qualify for a zero EFC if their adjusted gross income (AGI) is below $25,000 for AY2018-2019 and meet additional criteria such as receiving means-tested benefits or being a dislocated worker. Independent students without dependents must also meet specific criteria to qualify for a zero EFC. For Pell Grant eligibility, students may qualify for a zero Expected Family Contribution (EFC) if their parent or guardian died in military service after 9/11 in Iraq or Afghanistan. If not eligible for an automatic zero, students can still qualify for a calculated zero EFC based on the full formula. The Cost of Attendance (COA) includes tuition, fees, and other educational expenses for a full academic year. The Cost of Attendance (COA) is the total sum of tuition, fees, allowances for books, supplies, transportation, room and board, and dependent care costs. Institutions may use average costs for students. The scheduled award for Pell Grant is the maximum aid a full-time student can receive, calculated based on COA and Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The Pell Grant award is based on the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and the Total Maximum Pell Grant. The annual award amount is determined by the student's enrollment rate, with different schedules for full-time, less than full-time, and part-time students. The Pell Grant award amount is based on the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and enrollment rate. The minimum Pell Grant award is 10% of the total maximum award, which for AY2018-2019 is $610. To qualify for a Pell Grant, a student's EFC must be no more than 90% of the total maximum award, which for that year was $5,486. In AY2018-2019, a student with $6,095 EFC would not qualify for a Pell Grant. Pell Grants are disbursed in installments over the academic year, with the annual award amount divided among each payment period. Students may receive up to 1\u00bd scheduled Pell Grants in an award year. In AY2018-2019, a student with $6,095 EFC would not qualify for a Pell Grant. Pell Grants are disbursed in installments over the academic year, with the annual award amount divided among each payment period. Students may receive up to 1\u00bd scheduled Pell Grants in an award year. To maintain eligibility for Pell Grant aid, a student must be enrolled at least \u00bd-time in a payment period after receiving most or all of the scheduled award in previous payment periods of the award year. Pell Grant lifetime eligibility is capped at 12 full-time semesters or six scheduled awards. Pell Grant eligibility used at a closed school where the student did not graduate is not counted towards the lifetime cap. An eligible institution for Pell Grant program must meet specific criteria and can be public or private. Their role includes verifying student information, calculating and disbursing awards, and maintaining records. Pell Grant disbursements are based on award rules and credited to student accounts. The Pell Grant program disburses funds to institutions based on award rules, with remaining funds going directly to students for living expenses. Institutions receive an administrative cost allowance. The program reaches 39% of undergraduates, aiming to improve access to higher education for financially needy individuals. In recent years, the number of Pell Grant recipients has declined from almost 9.5 million in AY2011-2012 to over 7.5 million in AY2015-2016. Pell Grant awards are heavily dependent on EFC levels, with recipients primarily being low-income individuals. In AY2016-2017, 95% of Pell Grant recipients had a family income at or below $60,000, with independent recipients generally having lower income than dependent ones. Some Pell Grants go to mid- and high-income families, but these awards are smaller and often given to dependent students with multiple family members in postsecondary education. Pell Grant recipients may attend different types of institutions compared to non-recipients. Pell Grant recipients, especially independent students, tend to attend private for-profit institutions more than those not receiving Pell Grants. The disparity may be due to for-profit institutions targeting low-income students. Most undergraduates, whether Pell Grant recipients or not, attend public four-year or two-year institutions. The Pell Grant is a key federal need-based aid for financially needy undergraduates, with the total maximum grant serving as a gauge of support. Pell Grant recipients attend public four-year or two-year institutions, and other financial aid does not affect Pell Grant eligibility. The maximum grant has fluctuated relative to average educational costs at different types of institutions from AY1973-1974 to AY2016-2017. The total maximum Pell Grant has fluctuated relative to average educational costs at different types of institutions from AY1973-1974 to AY2016-2017. In AY2016-2017, the total maximum grant covered approximately 58% of the average base educational costs at public two-year institutions, 30% at public four-year institutions, 23% at private two-year institutions, and 14% at private four-year institutions. Published tuition, fees, and room and board have consistently risen more rapidly than average prices in the economy for a number of years. The Pell Grant is a key component of federal student aid, intended to support students with financial need. In AY2015-2016, 16% of Pell Grant recipients relied solely on the grant for aid, while 34% did not receive other Title IV aid funds. Most recipients also participate in other student aid programs. For those with a zero Expected Family Contribution (EFC), the average percentage of cost of attendance covered by the Pell Grant, loans, and total aid package varied by family income. In AY2015-2016, Pell Grant aid covered 27.1% of the cost of attendance for recipients, with all loan sources covering an additional 20.3%. On average, total aid from all sources supplied 62.9% of the cost of attendance for Pell Grant recipients. The report reviews Pell Grant program funding trends, funding sources, and procedures, highlighting the program's quasi entitlement nature and potential surplus or shortfall of discretionary funding. Funding for the Pell Grant program is exempt from appropriation levels. The Pell Grant program is funded through discretionary and mandatory funding streams. Discretionary appropriations are the primary source for award amounts, with a portion funded through mandatory appropriations. Funding for the program is exempt from sequestration. The Pell Grant program is funded through discretionary and mandatory funding streams. Discretionary appropriations provide the main funding for award amounts, while mandatory appropriations fund add-on award amounts. Annual discretionary appropriation bills are the primary source of funding, with funds typically available for use for two fiscal years. Funds for FY2018, for example, are available for obligation from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2019. The Pell Grant program receives funding from both discretionary and mandatory sources. The funds are available for two fiscal years, allowing for flexibility in operation. Various legislative acts have amended the Higher Education Act to provide additional mandatory appropriations to supplement discretionary funding. These mandatory funds can be used to cover program costs alongside annual discretionary appropriations. The Pell Grant program receives funding from both discretionary and mandatory sources. Mandatory funding can be used to supplement or replace discretionary funding, with permanent mandatory appropriations established by the SAFRA Act. The amount provided each year is based on actual costs, as shown in Table 5 for FY2012 through FY2021. The Pell Grant program receives funding from both discretionary and mandatory sources. Recent mandatory appropriations have been offset by savings from federal student loan programs. Mandatory appropriations provided for the program have been offset by savings in other aspects of the Pell Grant program. Mandatory appropriations are available permanently to fully fund the add-on award amount. The Pell Grant program receives mandatory appropriations to fund add-on award amounts, which are available permanently. It operates as an appropriated entitlement, with funding based on benefit and eligibility criteria established in law. The Pell Grant program is primarily funded through discretionary appropriations, not an entitlement. Statutory benefit and eligibility criteria have been adjusted in the past to align with appropriations. Annual Pell Grant appropriations are based on cost estimates and policy considerations, leading to potential surpluses or shortfalls that can accumulate over time. The Secretary of Education must notify Congress if funds are insufficient to meet all entitlements. The Secretary can address a funding shortfall in Pell Grants by reallocating funds from recent appropriations to cover previous award year costs. Economic and statutory changes can lead to misalignment between estimated program costs and actual expenditures. This can result in surpluses or deficits in funding levels over a 10-year period. The annual funding shortfall or surplus in Pell Grants is accounted for using discretionary funding. Congress may adjust appropriations based on previous year's surplus or shortfall. Table 6 shows a high cumulative shortfall of $9.569 billion at the end of FY2010 and a surplus of $11.082 billion at the end of FY2013. The FY2010 cumulative shortfall in Pell Grants was turned into a surplus by increased funding levels and decreased expenditures, resulting in a surplus of $11.082 billion by FY2013. However, this surplus has decreased to an estimated $7.410 billion by the end of FY2018. Despite generally higher expenditures, annual funding has remained around $23 billion since FY2014. Persistent or high funding shortfalls, like in FY2010, are seen as fiscally irresponsible, as they lead to debt that must eventually be paid off. The federal government adopts legislation to control spending, with 302(b) allocations set for each appropriations bill. These allocations determine the maximum discretionary amount that can be spent. Resolving a Pell Grant program shortfall may lead to difficult decisions due to the need to balance discretionary appropriations within the established allocations. The federal government adopts legislation to control spending with 302(b) allocations. Resolving a Pell Grant program shortfall may lead to difficult decisions about reducing discretionary funding for other programs. Various measures have been taken over the years to address funding shortfalls in the Pell Grant program, including modified budget scoring, reductions in student awards, recipient caps, and supplemental appropriations. The Secretary of Education had authority to reduce awards in response to funding shortfalls until 1992. Subsequent appropriations legislation continued to provide the Secretary with reduction authority until 2001. In FY2002, legislation no longer provided the Secretary with reduction authority for the Pell Grant program. In FY2006, Congress established a rule to prevent funding shortfalls, ensuring that the full estimated costs are covered by the appropriation of new discretionary budget authority. This rule applies to the scoring of the Pell Grant program by the Congressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) equates budget authority to levels in appropriation bills for discretionary programs. Congress cannot fund new programs or increase existing program funding below Pell Grant requirements due to scoring rules. However, estimating program costs poses challenges, with costs based on maximum award levels and program participation estimates. The scoring rule requires Congress to reconcile previous appropriation levels with updated program obligations annually. The Pell Grant program costs have been managed by reducing award levels, modifying award rules, eligibility criteria, and EFC calculations. Changes such as eliminating year-round Pell Grants and increasing the qualifying minimum award amount have helped reduce the number of recipients and students eligible for financial aid. The threshold for an automatic zero EFC was increased in AY2012-2013 to reduce the number of students receiving it. Legislation has amended student eligibility for HEA Title IV aid programs, temporarily eliminating aid for new students without a high school diploma from 2012 to 2014. Supplementary appropriations have been provided to address funding shortfalls, often by generating savings in the Direct Loan program. During periods of expansionary fiscal policy, appropriations have been increased through acts like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. A funding surplus presents opportunities to invest back into programs like the Pell Grant or pursue other policy priorities. Various approaches exist for investing the surplus, with the assumption that program costs will eventually utilize the surplus as the population and participation grow. During periods of expansionary fiscal policy, appropriations have been increased through acts like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This surplus funding can be used to increase Pell Grant award levels and student eligibility, such as through modifying statutory provisions and reauthorizing year-round Pell Grants. These changes aim to increase the number of students eligible for Pell Grants and other need-based financial aid programs. The surplus funding from appropriations acts can be used to increase Pell Grant award levels and student eligibility. The surplus may also be used to fund other programs or reduce a budget deficit. A portion of the surplus may be rescinded in an appropriations act, as seen in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. Pell Grant program costs are affected by the number of eligible students, total maximum award amount, and award rules. The total maximum award amount for Pell Grants is determined by annual appropriations and the Higher Education Act. Program costs are influenced by factors like the number of eligible students, economic conditions, and legislative changes. The Congressional Budget Office provides estimates of program costs, which have decreased from AY2012-2013 to AY2016-2017 but are expected to increase in the future. The number of Pell Grant recipients decreased from AY2012-2013 to AY2015-2016, despite an increase in the total maximum award amount. This decline is attributed to a reduction in undergraduate enrollment in postsecondary institutions. Program costs are expected to rise after AY2016-2017 due to an estimated increase in Pell Grant recipients and the awarding of year-round Pell Grants. The CBO baseline does not consider potential changes in the maximum Pell Grant award after the AY2018-2019 increase. Appendices provide historical data on Pell Grant awards, recipients, program funding, and funding shortfalls/surpluses."
