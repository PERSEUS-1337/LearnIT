    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Rural Health Care Equity Act of 2010\" includes revisions to the practice expense geographic adjustment under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amends the practice expense geographic adjustment for 2010 and subsequent years under the Social Security Act. The employee wage and rent portions of the practice expense geographic index will reflect half of the difference between costs in different fee schedule areas and the national average for services furnished during 2010. The practice expense geographic adjustment under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for 2011 involves employee wage and rent portions reflecting a quarter of the difference between costs in various fee schedule areas and the national average. Hold harmless provisions apply to the geographic adjustment factor in fee schedule areas. The practice expense geographic adjustment factor for services in 2010 or 2011 shall not be reduced below the geographic adjustment factor for the area for that year. The Secretary will analyze methods for establishing practice expense geographic adjustments and evaluate data on operating costs for medical practices. The analysis will evaluate the feasibility of using actual or reliable survey data on operating costs of medical practices in different fee schedule areas, including office rents and staff wages. It will also assess the office expense portion of the practice expense geographic adjustment. The Secretary will analyze the determination of office expenses in local markets, weights assigned to categories in the practice expense geographic adjustment, and exclude any non-actual or survey data. This analysis will lead to revisions for 2012 and subsequent years by January 1, 2012. The Secretary will adjust the practice expense geographic adjustment by basing office rents on occupancy costs, including fixed office expenses in the 'other' category, and making appropriate weighting changes in other categories. The Secretary will adjust wages for medical office personnel based on reliable data, independently of other adjustments, in a budget-neutral manner. If the analysis is not completed, adjustments will be made for subsequent years. The Secretary will adjust wages for medical office personnel based on reliable data for 2012 or later years in the same manner as for 2011. Repeal of a provision increasing Medicare reimbursement for frontier states under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."
