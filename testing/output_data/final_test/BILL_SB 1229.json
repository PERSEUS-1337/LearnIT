    "title": "SB 1229",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds and declares the following: The federal Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-273) amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow individuals to safely dispose of pharmaceutical controlled substances to prevent abuse and accidental ingestion. Individuals, referred to as \"ultimate users,\" can deliver pharmaceutical controlled substances to another person for disposal according to regulations set by the United States Attorney General. The DEA issued regulations in 2014 for the secure disposal of controlled substances, allowing various entities to collect and dispose of these substances. The intent of the Legislature with this act is to expand disposal options for controlled substances. The act encourages federally authorized entities to maintain secure drug take-back bins for prescription drug consumers' convenience and public health. It limits liability for entities meeting certain standards and aligns with DEA regulations for controlled substance disposal. Section 1714.24 is added to the Civil Code for this purpose. Section 1714.24 of the Civil Code defines \"collector\" as entities authorized by the DEA for controlled substance destruction. \"Compensation\" refers to funds from customers for secure drug take-back bins, excluding reimbursement from other sources. \"Home-generated pharmaceutical waste refers to unwanted medications, including pills, liquids, and inhalers. \"Maintains\" involves hosting a secure drug take-back bin. \"Pharmaceutical\" encompasses prescription and over-the-counter drugs, excluding Schedule I controlled substances. \"Secure drug take-back bin\" is a regulated collection receptacle.\" Any collector with a secure drug take-back bin is not liable for harm resulting from maintaining the bin, as long as they comply with state and federal laws for proper disposal of home-generated pharmaceutical waste. The collector must notify law enforcement and local health departments about the secure drug take-back bin, ensure it is monitored, post clear signage, and limit public access to monitored hours. (6) Inspect area around secure drug take-back bin for tampering, maintain logs for two years with date, time, and employee initials. Logs can be combined with state or federal regulations. Retain records for minimum of two years. (7) Notify law enforcement of any suspected tampering, theft, or loss of controlled substances within one business day. Notification must be made within one calendar day if collector has daily business hours. (8) Notify local law enforcement and the DEA Registration Unit when discontinuing voluntary collection of controlled substances. No requirement to have a drug take-back bin on premises."
