The \"Indian Contracting and Federal Land Management Demonstration Project Act\" aims to expand contracting opportunities for Indians with the Federal Government, encourage Indian and tribal contracting for Federal land management, promote innovative strategies for land management, accommodate access to Indian sacred land, and respect religious beliefs and sacred sites. The Act aims to protect Indian sacred land from significant damage. The Act includes provisions for tribal procurement contracting and reservation development. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act is amended to allow Indian tribes to request contracts for services that the Secretary of the Interior would otherwise procure from private-sector entities. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act allows Indian tribes to request contracts for services from the Secretary of the Interior, ensuring that the intended beneficiary tribes receive the services. The applicant tribe must provide assurances to the Secretary and enjoy the same rights as beneficiary tribes under the Act. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act allows tribes to request contracts for services from the Secretary of the Interior. If a beneficiary tribe wants to contract with an applicant tribe, they must notify the applicant tribe and the Secretary. The contract between the applicant tribe and the Secretary will end within 180 days of receiving the notice. SEC. 4. INDIAN AND FEDERAL LAND MANAGEMENT DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. Section 403 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act is amended to include the Indian and Federal Land Management Demonstration Project, defining terms like Federal land and project. The Indian and Federal Land Management Demonstration Project, established under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, allows Indian tribes to conduct activities related to Federal land management, such as surveys, analyses, and land protection. The Secretary of the Interior oversees this project. The Indian tribe or tribal organization can participate in the project for the maintenance, protection, or cultural significance of land. The Secretary will select at least 12 eligible tribes to participate over 2 fiscal years, and eligibility requires a formal request and financial demonstration. To participate in the project, Indian tribes or tribal organizations must demonstrate financial stability, show significant use of relevant land units, and complete a planning phase before entering into any contracts. Indian tribes or tribal organizations selected for the project must complete a planning phase within 1 year, including legal and budgetary research, and internal tribal planning. The Secretary will negotiate contracts with eligible tribes or organizations for planning, conducting, and implementing the project. The Indian tribe or tribal organization is responsible for planning, conducting, and administering programs related to archaeological, anthropological, and cultural surveys, as well as identifying and protecting culturally significant land. Time limit for contract negotiation is 90 days after notification to the Secretary. After completing the planning phase, the Indian tribe or tribal organization notifies the Secretary to initiate negotiations for a contract, with implementation starting by October 1 of the following fiscal year. The contract entered into under this paragraph may have a term of up to 5 fiscal years, and the provisions of this Act relating to declination and appeals of contracts apply. Administration of contracts includes the inclusion of certain terms upon request. At the request of an Indian tribe or tribal organization, agreements under this Act can be included in a contract with mutually agreed terms. The provisions in the contract have the same force and effect as under the Act, regardless of any contrary laws. The contract entered into under this Act allows for a single-agency audit report to be filed in accordance with title 31, United States Code. Federal employees transferred to an Indian tribe or tribal organization will not be separated from Federal service. An intergovernmental personnel action may be utilized. Intergovernmental personnel action can transfer supervision of a Federal employee to an Indian tribe or tribal organization. Transferred employees receive priority placement for available positions within their respective agency. Funding and payments for contracts are also addressed. The contract for transferring administrative responsibility to an Indian tribe or tribal organization must ensure that funds are provided by the Secretary equal to what would have been spent on the program. The Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization may jointly determine the payment schedule for grants. Planning grants of $100,000 are provided to assist in completing the planning phase and preparing for contracting. The Indian tribe or tribal organization may carry out responsibilities without applying for a grant. No tribe or organization may receive more than 1 grant under this provision. Appropriations are authorized as necessary for implementation. The Secretary must submit a detailed report to Congress on the project within 90 days after December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2006, including a project description, findings, and cost-benefit analysis."
