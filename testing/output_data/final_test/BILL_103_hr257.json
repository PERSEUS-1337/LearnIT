The Congress finds that the cost of medical care is increasing, leading to financial difficulties for Americans. In 1988, millions lacked health insurance or were underinsured, creating high levels of uncompensated care. There is a significant need for basic medical services, especially as the population ages. Long-term health care insurance is inadequate, with the average cost of a year-long stay in a facility being $25,000. The medical care system for American veterans is inadequate, with high costs of medical care and a need for tort reform to reduce expenses. There is a shortage of essential services like prenatal and well-baby care, leading to excessive spending on end-of-life procedures instead of preventative measures. The current issues in healthcare include the need to improve federal income tax incentives for employer-paid group health insurance, regulate self-insured healthcare coverage for adequate protection, address concerns about Medicare solvency due to low payment rates for physicians, and tackle inadequate healthcare in rural areas leading to hospital closures. The \"Health Care Crisis Policy Commission\" is established by this Act to address current healthcare issues such as improving tax incentives for employer-paid health insurance, regulating self-insured coverage, addressing Medicare solvency concerns, and tackling inadequate healthcare in rural areas. The Commission will study the escalating costs of medical care and health insurance in the US, explore alternatives for uninsured individuals, evaluate private sector options for health insurance, review future demands on the healthcare system as the population ages, and assess long-term care costs. The Commission will also examine the costs of long-term care, evaluate the VA health care system, investigate medical malpractice liability reforms, review prenatal and well-baby care impact on healthcare costs, study tax incentives for employer-sponsored health insurance, and research self-insured businesses in healthcare coverage. The Commission will evaluate health insurance coverage regulations, rural healthcare delivery, Medicare financial stability, financing options for alternative healthcare systems, and incentives to improve healthcare efficiency and quality. The Commission will investigate areas related to the efficient and cost-effective delivery of health care, in addition to improving the quality of care. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP.
