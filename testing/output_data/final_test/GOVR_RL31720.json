    "content": "In the first session of the 110th Congress, energy policy remains a key legislative issue following the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 disrupted oil production and refining capacity, leading to high prices. Global and domestic oil demand has stayed strong, putting pressure on production capacity. The phaseout of MTBE and a renewable fuels mandate in EPACT have added to the challenges. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the phaseout of MTBE have all contributed to high gasoline prices in the United States. Oil prices spiked in 2004 due to increased global demand, limited refining capacity, and Hurricane Ivan disrupting production in the Gulf of Mexico. The surge in oil prices in 2005 was driven by factors such as growing international demand, limited refining capacity, and supply disruptions caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. This sustained increase in prices for over five years marked a departure from historic trends, leading to coined terms like \"demand destruction\" to describe reduced consumption. This period of volatility highlighted the dependence of the U.S. economy on affordable and abundant energy sources. The surge in oil prices in 2005 was driven by growing international demand, limited refining capacity, and supply disruptions from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Despite coined terms like \"demand destruction,\" overall oil demand remained resilient, increasing from 78 million to 84 million barrels daily between 2001 and 2005. OPEC's efforts to maintain or boost production had short-term effects on crude prices, while tightness in refined products was due to insufficient refining capacity in the U.S. before the hurricanes. The hurricanes in 2005 exacerbated pressures on product prices, tightening supply and introducing uncertainty about crude supply. In 2006 and 2007, various factors contributed to a fragile energy supply and price climate. Despite concerns about the nation's energy policy, the United States has adopted several distinct policy approaches over the years. This report discusses major policy approaches and provides a conceptual framework for categorizing energy policy. The enactment of EPACT in response to energy issues, policymakers acknowledge minimal short-term price relief but emphasize encouragement of domestic oil and gas production, conservation, and alternative fuel initiatives. Congress faces the decision of additional policy response amidst ongoing pressure on oil price and supply. Over the past 30 years, the U.S. has shifted energy policy from federal government reliance to market dependence in response to unstable oil prices and supply. In the aftermath of the Arab oil embargo in 1973, government intervention was sought to address rising refiner acquisition costs for imported crude oil. Federal price controls kept domestic production costs lower, leading to increased imports. Fuel economy standards were implemented in the late 1970s to reduce gasoline consumption, while government-funded research focused on conservation efforts. In 1979, a second supply interruption was caused by the fall of the Shah of Iran, leading to reduced Iranian oil flow. Deregulation of oil prices began in 1975 but was gradual. Gasoline prices were still controlled during the Iranian revolution, resulting in long lines at U.S. gas pumps. President Reagan accelerated deregulation upon taking office in 1981. President Reagan accelerated the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) schedule for price decontrol in 1981, leading to a more market-oriented energy policy. High crude oil prices from 1978 to 1982 resulted in a decrease in U.S. petroleum consumption, with more substitution of fuels, efficient oil consumption, and price-induced conservation. Non-OPEC nations increased oil production, allowing for supply diversification. OPEC responded by increasing production in the mid-1980s, causing a plunge in world oil prices. In the U.S., refiner acquisition cost for imported oil dropped significantly. In the late 1980s, the refiner acquisition cost for imported oil fell from $27/barrel to $14/barrel. Prices remained low until a spike in oil prices in 1990-91 due to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. This led to a cut-off of 4.3 million barrels per day from world markets, causing oil prices to exceed $28 by late August and reach $36/bbl in September 1990. In response to the crisis, Western and Middle Eastern nations found common ground, recognizing the interdependence of oil-producing and oil-consuming nations. OPEC nations increased production to make up for lost supply, as they realized that high oil prices could jeopardize long-term demand for their oil. During the oil crisis of 1990-91, nations boosted production to offset lost supply, coordinated strategic stock releases, and saw prices fall after UN approval for force against Iraq. Efforts were made to promote conservation, energy efficiency, and alternative energy sources. This followed significant spending on alternative energy and efficiency technologies after the oil shocks of the 1970s. In the early 1980s, energy efficiency was promoted as a form of demand-side management to reduce the need for new power plants. Industries re-engineered processes to save energy, but mixed results were seen due to lower fossil fuel prices. Short supply episodes raised concerns about the lack of a consistent energy policy. The period from 1973 to 2004 showed general price and supply stability with occasional disruptions. During periods of stability and declining prices for conventional fuels, energy policy struggled to maintain courses that could protect against future supply disruptions and price volatility. This uncertainty hinders investment in alternative fuels, energy efficiency technologies, and higher-cost conventional fuel production outside the Middle East. The high costs in the US compared to the Middle East, along with local regulations and opposition to energy projects, create challenges for investment. The possibility of changes in US energy policy due to supply tightness in the Middle East is a key consideration for future debates in Congress. Balancing energy supply while considering other policy goals is a complex issue. Balancing energy supply with other policy goals is a complex issue, involving debates on how to reduce gasoline consumption without disrupting the economy or lifestyle. The debate over energy policy has led to a wide range of proposals, categorized into affecting either the supply or demand for energy products. Energy policy debates focus on balancing supply and demand for energy products in the short and long term. In 2001, President Bush emphasized long-term solutions over immediate relief for consumers facing high energy prices. The administration's plan aimed to address the nation's energy problems with comprehensive, action-oriented policies. In 2001, President Bush emphasized long-term energy solutions through comprehensive policies. Short-term reassurance was provided to markets and consumers, but demands for immediate energy price reduction persisted. The debate over energy legislation lasted until the enactment of EPACT in 2005. Policy initiatives varied between short-term actions like oil drawdown from the SPR and long-term measures such as tax incentives for new drilling technologies. Proponents of drilling in ANWR argued for increased domestic crude supply in the future. The text discusses long-term energy policy initiatives, including raising the federal gasoline tax and increasing corporate average fuel economy standards. It also mentions the indirect impact of energy policy on fuel prices and the role of tax policy in directly addressing energy prices. Short-term policies to affect fuel supply include adjusting excise taxes, using strategic reserves, and implementing programs like LIHEAP to assist families impacted by high energy prices. Some argue that high prices can encourage market supply, while federal policy should focus on those most affected by price increases. Supply and demand dynamics play a role in energy pricing. The current context of energy policy debates in the US revolves around the appropriate federal role in addressing high energy prices. External events, weather, and supply and demand dynamics all impact energy markets. Congress can require studies before implementing policy changes. Policy makers are considering whether market inefficiencies or government intervention is needed to address problems in the energy sector. Critics argue that government regulations have led to inefficiencies, such as the Clean Air Act requirements for regional gasoline formulations. Despite improved energy efficiency, growth in petroleum consumption in the US has increased oil imports as domestic production declines. The increase in oil imports due to growing demand from the Far East has put pressure on spare oil production capacity. Despite increased OPEC production, it has not been able to lower crude oil prices as in the past. The delicate political balance among OPEC nations can affect oil production decisions and market control. Shortages and price spikes in some regions are worsened by deficiencies in the nation's energy infrastructure. Some question the concentration of refining capacity in Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas. The nation's refining capacity in Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas needs additional development to address problems with gasoline supply and home heating oil stocks since 2000. Environmental regulations, community sentiment, and economic uncertainty impact the industry's investment decisions. Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and profitability also play a role in shaping policymakers' debates on refinery revitalization and approval processes. The shift to a more market-oriented energy policy includes additional measures for refinery revitalization and streamlining approval processes. Geopolitical developments and the rise in crude oil prices since March 1999 are factors influencing energy issues for policymakers. Tax policy also plays a role in these areas. The OPEC oil ministers increased crude production in response to lobbying by the United States, setting a price band of $22-$28 per barrel. However, prices continued to rise, reaching over $70/bbl in 2006. Demand growth, both internationally and domestically, led to increased imports of crude and refined products. Gasoline prices spiked in mid-2006 due to rising crude prices, increased demand, and a shift towards manufacturing. The rising prices for crude, resumption in demand, and a shift towards distillates manufacturing slowed gasoline stock additions. Fuel specification changes in 2005 and the ultra-low sulfur diesel program in 2006 added pressure to the gasoline supply system. The elimination of MTBE affected ethanol supply and prices, while OPEC's influence on oil prices highlighted the concentration of oil supply in the Middle East. The US now depends on imported oil for about 60% of its total consumption. Dependence on imported oil is around 60% of total consumption. Limited prospects for reducing this without economic hardship. Modest increases in production or demand reductions can lower oil price spikes. Attention on Clean Air Act standards for gasoline. Refineries must meet federal requirements. MTBE expiration led to higher ethanol prices and supply shortages. Regional variations affect gasoline supply fungibility. Gasoline supply loses fungibility due to regional variations, making distribution more complex. Temporary relaxations of standards were implemented post-2005 hurricanes to improve production and distribution. Foreign refineries supplying the U.S. market do not follow regional formulations, leading to calls for harmonization of standards to lower prices. Critics argue harmonization may compromise air quality and clean air objectives. Proponents argue for exploring the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil production to reduce vulnerability to international supply disruptions. Alaskan oil production has declined, leading to concerns about rising transport costs on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Opponents raise environmental concerns but point to technological advances in drilling to minimize surface disturbance. Opponents of exploring the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil production argue that while technological advances have reduced surface disturbance during exploration and extraction, significant environmental risks remain during production and transportation. They question the value of these risks, especially if the estimated oil resources in ANWR are at the lower end, providing only a modest increase in supply. Some opponents believe that the pristine ecology and habitat of ANWR should not be disturbed under any circumstances, regardless of potential benefits. The debate over exploring the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil production continues, with proponents failing to gain congressional authorization during the 109th Congress. The broader issue of access to public lands for energy exploration is a significant component of the national energy debate, with disagreements over the potential resources on federal lands and the impact of land-use restrictions. The Bush Administration recommended examining impediments to energy exploration on public lands, while a report by the Department of Interior suggests this may not be a significant problem. The Department of Interior report indicates that the alleged problem of energy exploration on public lands may not be significant. Natural gas consumption in the US has been encouraged for the past decade, leading to higher prices due to increased demand and competition for gas supplies. Natural gas prices fluctuated from $2.00 per mcf in 1999 to $8.00 per mcf in 2001, with further increases in 2003 and 2004. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita disrupted production, leading to a loss of 1.5 mbd of crude oil and 10 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Prices briefly exceeded $15/mcf in December 2005 but dropped to under $10/mcf in January 2006. The wellhead price averaged above $6 in late 2006. Tanker-borne imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are a potential source of additional gas. The 108th Congress approved an $18 billion loan guarantee for the construction of a pipeline in Alaska North Slope with large proven reserves of natural gas. The blackout of 2003 highlighted the need for infrastructure improvements in the electricity industry to encourage competition in the generation sector. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 aims to address congestion in transmission lines and lack of investment in infrastructure in the electricity industry. It includes provisions for transmission companies to acquire rights-of-way through eminent domain and for FERC to promote market transparency in wholesale power markets. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 addresses transmission line congestion and infrastructure investment in the electricity industry. Proposals suggest establishing an electronic information system for wholesale electric energy availability and prices. Concerns exist about potential loss of state authority. The Bush Administration aims to remove barriers to coal use in power generation and promote cleaner-burning coal technologies. Discussions also focus on the roles of natural gas, coal, renewables, and nuclear energy in future electricity generation. The energy policy debate revolves around cleaner-burning coal technologies, renewable energy standards, incentives for nuclear energy, and the balance between supply and conservation-oriented policies. Environmental groups question opening ANWR for leasing when improving motor vehicle fuel economy could save a comparable amount of oil. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act established new car fuel economy standards in 1978. The current Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards set in 1978 are 27.5 mpg for cars and 20.7 mpg for light-duty trucks, including SUVs. Proposals to raise these standards have been controversial, with Congress prohibiting changes since 1996. A study by the National Academy of Sciences suggested that significant fuel consumption reductions could be achieved within 15 years using existing technologies. The study on fuel economy and vehicle safety complexity was debated by NAS panel members. Price hikes during energy supply shortages led to energy efficiency improvements, but some argue that further gains may be limited. The Reagan Administration focused on market-oriented energy policy and R&D, while the Bush Administration recommended reviewing funding and performance. The Bush Administration recommended a review of energy efficiency research and development funding for performance-based research in public-private partnerships, acknowledging the complexity of energy policy decisions in the face of unpredictable future developments. Challenges persist for policymakers in addressing energy policy decisions amidst unpredictable future developments."
