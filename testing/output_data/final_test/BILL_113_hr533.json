    "content": "The \"Land Management Workforce Flexibility Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends personnel flexibilities relating to land management agencies in the United States Code by adding a new chapter 96. The Land Management Workforce Flexibility Act defines 'land management agency' to include specific departments like the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. It also allows for competitive service and time-limited appointments for employees in these agencies. Employees in land management agencies under time-limited appointments can compete for permanent positions if they meet certain criteria, including serving for at least 24 months without a break of 2 years and maintaining acceptable performance levels. Employees in land management agencies under time-limited appointments meeting specific criteria can compete for permanent positions with the same or similar duties in the same agency. This includes being appointed initially through open, competitive examination and serving for at least 24 months without a 2-year break. Employees under time-limited appointments in land management agencies can qualify for permanent positions with similar duties if they meet specific criteria, including serving for at least 24 months without a 2-year break and maintaining acceptable performance levels. Employees eligible for conversion under this subsection will have priority given to preference eligible veterans. If multiple employees have equal priority, placement will be determined through competitive procedures. Those selected or converted become career-conditional employees, acquiring competitive status upon appointment. These provisions apply to time-limited employees separated for reasons other than misconduct or unacceptable performance. The provisions of this chapter apply to separated employees in time-limited positions. An agency meets its obligation by notifying the individual before filling a successor permanent position. Time-limited appointments include temporary and term appointments. The Office of Personnel Management will create necessary regulations. Personnel flexibilities related to land management agencies are covered in section 9601."
