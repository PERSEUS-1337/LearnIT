    "content": "The \"Save our Bays Act\" aims to reduce non-point source pollution in estuaries by promoting investments in soil restoration, stormwater retention, impervious cover reduction, and native plant buffers. This Act also introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code to address non-point source pollution. The tax code allows a credit for non-point source pollution planning and implementation. The planning credit is $500 for developing a plan certified by the County Soil Conservation District. The implementation credit is based on the cost of implementing the plan. The non-point source pollution plan implementation credit is the lesser of the amount paid for implementing the plan to mitigate pollution on eligible property certified by the County Soil Conservation District or $2,500. Eligible property is real property located in a designated estuary of national significance with non-point source pollution. Each noncontiguous parcel of real property is treated separately. No double benefit is allowed for expenses related to a non-point source pollution plan. Expenses for a taxpayer in a taxable year are reduced by amounts received in the same calendar year. The taxpayer can elect to not apply this section for a taxable year. The credit allowed for property subject to depreciation is treated as part of the general business credit. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall be treated as a credit allowable under subpart A. This section does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020. Additionally, the non-point source pollution credit is included as part of the general business credit. Sec. 30E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 establishes a non-point source pollution credit. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey must evaluate the effectiveness of this credit annually and submit a report to Congress with recommendations. Committees specified in this paragraph include the Committee on Ways and Means, Committee on Natural Resources in the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Environment and Public Works, Committee on Finance in the Senate. Amendments made by this section apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2015."
