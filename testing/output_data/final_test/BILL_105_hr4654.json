    "content": "The \"Asthma Act\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The \"Asthma Act\" outlines key findings regarding the rising prevalence of asthma in the US, affecting 14.6 million Americans, with 4.8 million under 18. Pediatric asthma rates have increased by 72% since 1984, affecting all ethnic groups, especially African American and Hispanic children. Asthma is the third leading cause of preventable hospitalizations, with 1.6 million ER visits in 1997. It accounts for 17% of pediatric ER visits and can be life-threatening if not properly managed. Most asthma-related deaths are preventable, yet they continue to rise in the U.S. In 1994, 5,487 children died from asthma, a six percent increase from 1993 and double the number in 1979. Asthma costs the U.S. over $12 billion annually, with rising prevalence leading to higher costs in the future. Early recognition, proper diagnosis, treatment, patient education, and public health interventions are key in controlling asthma. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) emphasizes the importance of aggressive medical treatment and patient education to improve asthma management. Despite extensive knowledge on effective strategies, current federal policy and funding for asthma education, treatment, and management are inadequate. Additional federal support is needed to increase awareness of asthma as a chronic illness, its symptoms, and environmental factors affecting the disease. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) stresses the need for aggressive medical treatment and patient education to enhance asthma management. Additional federal support is required to raise awareness of asthma as a chronic illness, its symptoms, and environmental factors affecting the disease. Education programs are essential to teach patients how to better manage asthma. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program emphasizes the importance of medical treatment and patient education for better asthma management. Additional federal support is needed to raise awareness about asthma as a chronic illness and its environmental factors. Education programs play a crucial role in teaching patients how to manage asthma effectively. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program is set to receive an additional $5,000,000 in funding annually from 1999 to 2003 to expand the program. A coordinating committee will submit a report to Congress on the scope of the asthma problem in the United States. The coordinating committee will report to Congress on the scope of asthma in the US and recommend ways to improve federal asthma-related activities. The Secretary of Education or a designee will be part of the committee. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will focus on asthma-related activities as mandated by Section 4. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is authorized additional funding of $5,000,000 annually from 1999 to 2003 for expanding public health surveillance activities related to asthma and providing information and education to the public. Collaboration with states is required to determine asthma incidence, prevalence, and prevent health consequences. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is authorized additional funding for expanding public health surveillance activities related to asthma and providing information and education to the public, including through public service announcements. SEC. 5. Grants for community outreach on asthma information, education, and services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may grant funds to nonprofit entities for community outreach projects providing asthma information, education, and referrals to health programs. Preference is given to projects in communities identified by the applicants. The Secretary of Health and Human Services authorizes grants for community projects targeting asthma in underserved areas with low-income residents. Applicants must evaluate project effectiveness, and $5,000,000 is allocated annually from 1999 to 2003 for this purpose. SEC. 6. Action plans of states regarding asthma; financial incentives for children's health insurance program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will carry out a program to encourage states to assist children with asthma. If a state plan under the Children's Health Insurance Program meets requirements, the Secretary will provide a grant to support these activities. Matching funds are required for the costs. The Secretary may provide a grant to states for asthma programs if they agree to contribute non-Federal funds amounting to at least 50% of the costs. Contributions can be in cash or in-kind, excluding Federal assistance. The Secretary will publish criteria for determining satisfactory State plans for asthma programs. Technical assistance will be provided to States for developing plan provisions. $5,000,000 is authorized for funding from 1999 to 2003. Local educational agencies are required to develop action plans regarding asthma. The Secretary of Education may provide grants to local educational agencies for asthma-related activities at elementary and secondary schools in low-income communities. The Secretary of Education may provide grants to local education agencies and State public health officials to develop programs improving asthma management in schools. Programs must follow guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency. Activities may include working with hospitals, clinics, advocacy groups, and hiring school nurses. The Secretary of Education may authorize local educational agencies to use Title I funds for asthma management programs in schools, including purchasing equipment, hiring nurses, training personnel, simplifying medication access, and other related activities.

Funding of $5,000,000 authorized annually for asthma management programs in schools from 1999 to 2003. Congress encourages hospitals to provide asthma education to patients and families upon discharge, establish telephone services for information, and communicate with primary health providers. Managed care organizations should promote asthma clinical guidelines, collect data, and offer education to patients and families. Congress emphasizes the importance of promoting asthma diagnosis and management guidelines in all federal, state, and local activities. Collaboration with medical, educational, and environmental organizations, as well as advocates for those affected by asthma, is recommended."
