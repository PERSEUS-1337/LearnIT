    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Cybersecurity Standards for Aircraft to Improve Resilience Act of 2016\" or the \"Cyber AIR Act.\" It includes definitions for key terms. In this Act, a \"covered air carrier\" refers to an air carrier or foreign air carrier as defined in title 49, US Code. A \"covered manufacturer\" is an entity that manufactures aircraft or electronic systems for aircraft. A \"cyberattack\" is unauthorized access to aircraft systems wirelessly or through a wired connection. The term \"critical software systems\" refers to software systems that can impact aircraft control. An \"entry point\" is the means by which signals can be sent or received to control an aircraft system or maintenance system. SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF CYBERATTACKS BY THE AVIATION INDUSTRY. The Secretary of Transportation must require air carriers and manufacturers to report cyberattacks on aircraft systems to the FAA. The FAA will use this information to enhance regulations and notify relevant parties of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities in aircraft systems, maintenance, or ground support systems are a concern that must be reported to the FAA for regulatory enhancements and notification to relevant parties. Incorporation of cybersecurity into requirements for air carrier operating certificates and production certificates is addressed in Section 4. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with other agencies, must create regulations within 270 days of the Act's enactment to include cybersecurity requirements for air carrier operating and production certificates. This includes protecting aircraft electronic systems from cyberattacks. The regulations require isolation measures to separate critical software systems, periodic evaluation for security vulnerabilities, and updating measures based on evaluations. Annual report on cyberattacks on aircraft systems and maintenance and ground support systems. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration must submit an annual report to Congress on attempted and successful cyberattacks on aircraft systems and maintenance or ground support systems. The report includes the number of cyberattacks, system targeted, effects on aircraft safety, and measures taken to counter or mitigate the cyberattacks. The annual report to Congress on cyberattacks on aircraft systems and maintenance or ground support systems must include details on the number of cyberattacks, systems targeted, effects on aircraft safety, measures taken to counter or mitigate the attacks, recommendations for prevention, analysis of vulnerabilities, and suggestions for improving regulatory oversight. The report should be submitted in unclassified form, with the possibility of a classified annex. SEC. 6. MANAGING CYBERSECURITY RISKS OF CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. The Commercial Aviation Communications Safety and Security Leadership Group will evaluate cybersecurity vulnerabilities of broadband wireless communications equipment for consumer use on aircraft operated by covered air carriers. The group is responsible for addressing cybersecurity risks from malicious use of communications technologies on board aircraft. The Leadership Group will develop methods to prevent cyberattacks on aircraft using consumer broadband wireless equipment. They will also require security measures to be implemented by air carriers, manufacturers, and service providers. A report must be submitted annually to Senate and House committees. The House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure report focuses on preventing cyberattacks using consumer broadband wireless equipment on aircraft operated by covered air carriers. The report requires security measures to be implemented by air carriers, manufacturers, and service providers. It must be submitted annually in unclassified form, with the option to include a classified annex."
