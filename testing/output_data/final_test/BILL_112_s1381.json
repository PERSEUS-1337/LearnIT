Lyme disease is a common illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by infected ticks. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent serious health problems like heart, neurological, eye, and joint issues. Lyme disease accounts for 90 percent of all vector-borne infections in the United States, but ticks also spread other diseases like anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and tularemia. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported over 38,000 confirmed and probable Lyme disease cases in 2009, with an 84 percent increase in incidence over the past decade. Multiple diseases in one patient make diagnosis and treatment more challenging. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a significant increase in Lyme disease cases, especially among children aged 5 to 14 years. The persistence of symptoms in many patients without reliable testing complicates diagnosis and treatment. Establishment of a Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish the Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee to advise on interagency coordination, communication, and collaboration efforts to address tick-borne diseases. The Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee ensures interagency coordination, represents diverse scientific viewpoints in public health policy decisions, advises Federal agencies on priorities related to tick-borne diseases, and reviews treatment guidelines for diverse views. The Secretary appoints voting members to the Committee, including 4 members from the scientific community, 2 representatives of tick-borne disease organizations, and 2 health care providers. The Secretary appoints members to the Committee, including individuals with acute and chronic tick-borne diseases, patient representatives, State and local health department representatives, and national health organizations. Members must represent diverse scientific perspectives. The Secretary appoints members to the Committee with diverse scientific perspectives. Ex officio members from various Federal agencies are designated as nonvoting representatives overseeing tick-borne disease activities. The Assistant Secretary of Health is designated as one of the co-chairpersons. The Committee appointed by the Secretary includes a public co-chairperson serving a 2-year term. Members serve 4-year terms and vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Committee holds public meetings at least twice a year, with notice provided to the public. The Committee meets at least twice a year with additional meetings as needed. Meetings are conducted as required by law. A report must be submitted annually, detailing the Committee's functions, members, and activities. The Committee meets regularly, with a report submitted annually on its activities and recommendations. Appropriations are authorized for expenses incurred by the Committee, with no voting member being a permanent salaried employee. Federal activities related to the diagnosis, surveillance, prevention, and research of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases are outlined in Section 4. The Secretary, in consultation with various federal agencies and the Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee, is responsible for coordinating all federal programs related to Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. This includes conducting or supporting activities such as developing diagnostic tests. The Secretary is responsible for coordinating federal programs related to Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. This includes developing sensitive diagnostic tools, improving testing efficiency, and evaluating emerging diagnostic methods. Surveillance and reporting activities aim to determine disease prevalence and feasibility of new developments. The curr_chunk discusses the feasibility of developing a reporting system for physician-diagnosed cases of Lyme disease that do not meet CDC surveillance criteria and creating a national uniform reporting system. Prevention activities include providing access to information on tick-borne diseases and increasing public education on Lyme. The curr_chunk focuses on expanding public education and physician education programs related to Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. It includes initiatives such as increasing information access points for the public and publishing annual reports to educate health professionals on the latest research. The curr_chunk focuses on clinical outcomes research for Lyme disease, including establishing research objectives for the long-term course of illness and determining the effectiveness of different treatment modalities. The curr_chunk authorizes appropriations for research, prevention, and education on Lyme and other tick-borne diseases for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The curr_chunk authorizes appropriations for research, prevention, and education on Lyme and other tick-borne diseases for fiscal years 2012 through 2016, including reports on these diseases. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on activities related to Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, including significant developments, assessments, and recommendations for further research and education. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on research gaps, progress in diagnostic tools, public awareness initiatives, and the Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee's annual report and recommendations."
