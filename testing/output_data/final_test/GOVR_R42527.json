    "content": "Following a major disaster, a local government's financial capacity may be severely undermined by a decrease in revenues, impacting its ability to maintain public services and afford necessary expenditures. Revenue shortfalls can lead to job cuts and downsizing of the government, as seen in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina. Displacement of the population or disruption of key economic activities like tourism can contribute to revenue loss. Local governments often face restrictions on borrowing for operational expenses, leaving them with limited options to make up for lost revenue. The Community Disaster Loan (CDL) Program, managed by FEMA, provides loan assistance to local governments to help overcome revenue loss after a disaster. This program is crucial for local governments to continue providing essential services and compensate for revenue shortfalls. The CDL program, authorized by the Stafford Act, allows loans to local governments after disasters to help them maintain essential services despite revenue loss. The program is managed by FEMA and aims to assist entities like special districts and school boards. The CDL program, managed by FEMA, provides loans to local governments after disasters to help maintain essential services despite revenue loss. FEMA has the authority to cancel loan repayments if the local government's revenue is insufficient to meet its operating budget for three fiscal years following a disaster. The program's purpose has remained consistent since its inception, with some variations in statutory and regulatory provisions over time. The CDL program, managed by FEMA, provides loans to local governments after disasters to help maintain essential services despite revenue loss. The program's purpose has remained consistent since its inception, with variations in statutory and regulatory provisions over time. The loan program began in 1974 and saw significant changes in 2000 with a $5 million cap on loan size. Loans before 2005 are known as \"traditional\" community disaster loans (TCDLs), while loans after 2005 are referred to as \"special\" community disaster loans (SCDLs) for local governments impacted by specific disasters. FEMA established regulations for SCDLs similar to TCDLs. The 2008 CDLs were governed by new statutory and regulatory guidelines that altered eligibility, size, and forgiveness criteria. These loans had different provisions compared to traditional CDLs and special CDLs. The majority of provisions in the Community Disaster Loan Program are consistent across all sets of loans, with unique provisions highlighted through comparative analysis. The report compares traditional CDLs, special CDLs, and 2008 CDLs, focusing on loan forgiveness provisions. It offers empirical data on loan distribution and forgiveness by government types. The report does not audit FEMA's loan administration. The CDL Program is relevant to Congress due to ongoing debates on disaster assistance costs. Recent FEMA management decisions have faced criticism. Recent program management decisions by FEMA regarding the Community Disaster Loan Program have sparked criticism from the public and Members of Congress. Congress may consider expanding, eliminating, or amending the program before issuing more loans. Approximately $1,615 million in principal was offered to local governments through the program, with $1,326 million borrowed. FEMA has cancelled around $896 million of the borrowed amount. The program has been used infrequently by local governments compared to other disaster assistance programs. A total of 249 loans were issued to 200 local governments under 26 disaster declarations from 1974 to 2010. From 1974 to 2010, FEMA issued a total of 249 loans to 200 local governments under 26 disaster declarations. The program is used infrequently compared to other disaster assistance programs, with loans being issued following specific disasters like floods in Illinois in 1993, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, and Hurricane Ike in 2008. No loans were issued after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, earthquakes, or major hurricanes like Floyd in 1999 and Isabel in 2003. The Community Disaster Loan program is underutilized, with limited loans issued from 1999 to 2005. Reasons for this include lack of awareness, eligibility restrictions, unattractive loan terms, cumbersome application procedures, and limited overall need for the program. The Community Disaster Loan program has limited demand due to factors such as lack of awareness, eligibility restrictions, unattractive loan terms, and cumbersome application procedures. The program rules have seen clarification and specificity added over the years, with core policies established in 1979. The Community Disaster Loan program, unlike other Stafford Act programs, is funded through the Disaster Assistance Direct Loan Program account. Funds for the program are typically appropriated through emergency supplemental bills. The Community Disaster Loan program is funded through the Disaster Assistance Direct Loan Program account, typically through emergency supplemental bills. Funds for the program have been treated as \"no year\" funds and are available until expended. The program is subject to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, which changed the accounting method for measuring the cost of federal direct loans and loan guarantees. The subsidy rate for the CDL program is calculated by CBO in each appropriation, with varying amounts of loans issued per appropriated dollar. For example, in P.L. 109-88, $750 million in budget authority supported $1 billion in loans at a 75% subsidy rate. In P.L. 110-329, $98.15 million was appropriated for the CDL program, supporting loans not to exceed $100 million at a 98.15% subsidy rate. The Office of Management and Budget provides subsidy rate estimates in the annual budget report, but loans have not been issued by FEMA since 2009. The CDL program subsidy rate is high at 93.95% due to the high cancellation rate. The report outlines the regulations governing traditional community disaster loans issued from 1988 to 2005 and post-2005 loans. These rules will continue to govern future loans unless Congress mandates changes or FEMA revises regulations. The report classifies all loans made through the CDL program as \"traditional\" from inception to 2005. There were 64 traditional loans issued between 1976 and 1998, with four loans issued in response to tornadoes in 2007. Local governments must meet three requirements to be eligible for a loan under Section 417 of the Stafford Act. FEMA's eligibility criteria for traditional loans under the Stafford Act restrict loans to local governments in designated disaster areas. Local government is broadly defined, allowing various governmental bodies to apply. U.S. territories are treated as single eligible entities. Ineligible entities include those legally barred from federal debt or using debt for operating expenses. The distribution of community disaster loans by type of local government entity is shown in Table 5. TCDLs can be approved for a local government in the fiscal year of the disaster or the following year. Only one TCDL is allowed per local government for a single disaster. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 prohibits issuing a loan to a local government in arrears on a previous community disaster loan. FEMA uses two factors to determine substantial loss in tax or revenue for financial assistance eligibility. FEMA uses two factors to determine substantial loss in tax or revenue for financial assistance eligibility. The first factor is the impact on essential municipal services, while the second factor is a projected 5% loss in total revenue for the fiscal year of the disaster or the following year. FEMA regulations include eight factors to assess the need for financial assistance, such as municipal insolvency risk and available liquid assets. The eligibility criteria for financial assistance from FEMA include factors like available cash to cover losses and existing debt ratio of the local government. These regulations are consistent across different types of loans and are designed to assess the financial health of the government. FEMA has a formal application process where the state reviews and validates the application before approval by the Governor's Authorized Representative. The application requires the local government to self-certify that it meets eligibility terms. The local government must meet eligibility terms, provide financial reports, and have the state co-sign the promissory note for a FEMA loan. If the state cannot sign, collateral security is required. These requirements were added in 1988 to ensure repayment due to some local governments not repaying loans in the past. After the regulatory loan cancellation and appeal process, FEMA staff noted instances where states were unwilling to co-sign loan applications with local communities. In such cases, local governments provided collateral security or withdrew their applications. FEMA reviews if a government experienced a 5% revenue loss in the fiscal year of the disaster or the following year. Local governments must provide extensive evidence of predicted revenue loss with the help of contract staff. FEMA does not consider voluntary revenue reductions as legitimate for loan eligibility. Applicants can explain financial need in a formal letter. FEMA presumes need unless evidence contradicts eligibility. FEMA reviews and notifies loan acceptance. FEMA informally pre-screens communities for CDL eligibility during disaster recovery. Anecdotal evidence suggests local governments may lack revenue loss to justify loan. Financial standing does not determine loan approval. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) imposed a $5 million cap on traditional community disaster loans to reduce financial costs of disaster assistance. This cap was intended to prevent extremely large loans, like the $127.2 million loan to the Virgin Islands after Hurricane Marilyn in 1995, from being issued and cancelled. The $5 million cap has been controversial since its inception. The $5 million cap on traditional community disaster loans has been controversial since its inception. Efforts to remove the cap, including a bill introduced after 9/11, have failed. The cap was waived for specific disaster loans, but remains in place for future loans unless Congress stipulates otherwise. The cap restricted the size of some 2008 disaster loans and was in effect for loans issued in 2007. FEMA regulates loans for disasters issued to local governments based on projected financial needs. The loan size is determined by calculating projected revenue loss and disaster-related expenses over a three-year period. The SAFE Port Act increased the loan size limit to 50% of a local government's annual operating budget in the fiscal year of a disaster. The CDL program allows for increased loan size if a government's revenue loss equals or exceeds 75% of its annual operating budget. However, no government, including those affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, has met this threshold. FEMA sets interest rates for CDLs based on the five-year Treasury rate at the time of execution. The interest rate on CDLs is typically higher than municipal bonds due to federal tax exemptions. Localities with strong credit ratings may prefer private credit markets, while weaker ones may opt for traditional CDLs. The average interest rate for all TCDLs is 6.59%. FEMA obligates the total loan amount, but disbursements are based on a defined schedule or need. FEMA rarely denies disbursement requests from local governments for loan funds, as long as they are justified by financial evidence. The funds must be used to perform governmental functions, either existing or expanded to meet disaster-related needs. FEMA allows local governments to pass loan proceeds to private non-profits providing government services. The funds from FEMA loans must be used for governmental functions and cannot be used for capital improvements or to match other federal assistance programs. FEMA has approved 68 loans to different local governments totaling $284.1 million, with only $236 million borrowed. Monitoring is done through annual reports and disbursement requests. The FEMA loans borrowed by local governments can be cancelled if revenues are insufficient to meet operating budgets, including disaster-related expenses. FEMA forgives interest on cancelled principal amounts and uses regulations to determine cancellation. Auditing firms analyze the community's operating budget for forgiveness evaluation. FEMA cancels loans for local governments based on auditing firms' analysis of the operating budget. Local governments must submit a cancellation application through their state GAR and FEMA Regional Administrator before the loan expiration date. FEMA requires extensive financial documents for review listed in 44 C.F.R. 206.366(c)(1). FEMA evaluates local governments' financial situation for loan cancellation based on financial documents and a written narrative provided by applicants. The evaluation process includes determining if a cumulative operating deficit exists in the three fiscal years after a disaster, with no loan cancellation possible without it. FEMA associates the deficit with either a disaster-related revenue loss or an increase in unreimbursed expenditures. After evaluating local governments' financial situation for loan cancellation, FEMA determines the amount of deficit caused by a disaster. The total disaster-related deficit is then calculated, and FEMA may cancel an equivalent amount of loan principal owed by the local government. This process is explained in the rulemakings for Special Community Disaster Loans (SCDLs) and is challenging to implement in practice. The process of implementing Community Disaster Loans is complex due to various interpretations of operating budgets, revenues, and disaster-related expenses. FEMA's regulations on interpreting these terms for TCDLs are discussed, and applicants can appeal if denied loan cancellation. Appeals must be submitted within 60 days of denial, and all decisions are final. FEMA defines \"operating budget\" as the actual revenues and expenditures published in the local government's financial statements. FEMA defines \"revenues\" for Community Disaster Loans and provides guidelines on their calculation. The operating budget of a local government is adjusted for deficits before a disaster, and funds are only meant for operating expenses, not capital expenses. Transfers from operating to capital budgets are added back to the operating budget. FEMA uses pre-disaster revenue rates for undamaged property in its calculation for loan cancellation, preventing governments from reducing revenues to inflate loan sizes. This regulation aims to maintain consistency in revenue calculations and property appraisals. FEMA may reduce taxes and fees on damaged property and credit revenue loss from lower appraisals. UDREs, such as expenses for government services, may be included in loan cancellation calculations. Expenses not eligible for forgiveness include debt service, major repairs, and capital projects. The Community Disaster Loan (CDL) program provides financial assistance to local governments for disaster-related expenses. Expenses eligible for coverage under other federal assistance programs are ineligible to prevent double dipping. CDLs have a normal term of five years, with repayment due at the end of the term. FEMA may consider extensions based on the local government's financial condition, with a maximum total term of 10 years. In extenuating circumstances, an additional loan may be issued after the first 10 years, allowing for a second 10-year repayment period. The Community Disaster Loan (CDL) program provides financial assistance to local governments for disaster-related expenses. CDLs have a normal term of five years, with repayment due at the end of the term, extendable up to 10 years based on financial condition. In case of default, FEMA may request administrative offset or refer the loan to the Department of Justice for enforcement. The total dollar amounts and percentage rates of cancellation for CDLs are displayed by government type. 46.4% of loans were partially forgiven, with an average of 38.9% of principal cancelled by FEMA. In addition to normal loan cancellations, FEMA forgave $21 million of a $50.1 million loan to the U.S. Virgin Islands, with the remaining balance cancelled through legislation in 2001. In 2001, FEMA forgave $21 million of a $50.1 million loan to the U.S. Virgin Islands. The following year, Congress transferred funds to FEMA to cancel the remaining $27 million in principal and $17.5 million in interest on the loan. This was done to alleviate the financial burden caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The 109th Congress passed emergency supplemental appropriations to assist with Hurricane Katrina, including the Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-88) transferring $750 million to the Disaster Assistance Direct Loan Program account. The CDL Act of 2005 allocated $750 million for special loans to local governments, with an additional $1 million for administrative expenses. FEMA approved loans totaling $1 billion under this act. The Emergency Supplemental of 2006 transferred $278.8 million to support an additional $371.733 million in direct loans for communities affected by hurricanes. In 2005, $750 million was allocated for special loans to local governments, with an additional $1 million for administrative expenses. FEMA approved loans totaling $1 billion under this act. The Emergency Supplemental of 2006 provided $278.8 million for an additional $371.733 million in direct loans for hurricane-affected communities. FEMA approved loans totaling $271 million, leaving $101 million unused. The loans from both laws are called special community disaster loans (SCDLs), each with slightly different provisions for issuance and administration by FEMA. The purpose of the SCDLs was slightly different than the purpose of the TCDLs. The initial funds for loans were allocated to assist local governments in providing essential services. The purpose of the loans varied between Traditional Community Disaster Loans (TCDLs) and Special Community Disaster Loans (SCDLs), with TCDLs focusing on financial assistance for governmental functions after a major disaster, while SCDLs aimed to provide essential services. FEMA noted the use of \"essential services\" in SCDL regulations, reflecting a different approach compared to TCDLs. The CDL Act of 2005 established Special Community Disaster Loans (SCDLs) for local governments to provide essential services. FEMA's regulations limited the use of SCDL proceeds to core municipal operating functions, excluding entities like recreational districts. The difference between \"essential services\" and \"governmental functions\" impacted eligibility for SCDLs, but the practical implications beyond this restriction are unknown. Many local governments could have applied for SCDLs under various disaster declarations. The full $1 billion in Special Community Disaster Loans (SCDLs) from the Emergency Supplemental of 2006 went to governments in Louisiana and Mississippi under major disaster declarations for Hurricane Katrina. Eligibility for these loans was limited to the 2005 hurricane season, resulting in only governments in these two states applying for and receiving the loans. Governments in Alabama, Florida, and Texas could have also applied but did not. FEMA interpreted that the loans had to be issued by September 30, 2006, the end of FY2006. The Emergency Supplemental of 2006 provided $1 billion in Special Community Disaster Loans (SCDLs) to governments in Louisiana and Mississippi for Hurricane Katrina. The loans had to be issued by the end of FY2006, causing time pressure due to the late disaster declarations. The stipulation of one loan per disaster was removed to accommodate multiple loan appropriations by the 109th Congress. FEMA anticipated high demand for loans and allocated amounts equitably to eligible applicants. The CDL Act of 2005 allocated loan amounts to local governments affected by hurricanes, prioritizing those providing essential services. Some communities received additional loans to meet their full eligibility amount. The Act removed the $5 million cap for loans, allowing for larger loan sizes. The CDL Act of 2005 removed the $5 million cap for loans to local governments affected by disasters. Loans could reach 50% of the operating budget if a 25% revenue loss was projected. FEMA maintained limits on loan size based on revenue loss and disaster expenses. Under the CDL Act of 2005, FEMA issued a total of 136 loans to Louisiana and Mississippi. Additional loans were issued under the Emergency Supplemental of 2006, but it is unclear which loans were issued under which law. Loans are available to governments that have suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues. Under the CDL Act of 2005, FEMA issued loans to Louisiana and Mississippi. The Emergency Supplemental of 2006 allowed local governments to receive loans for up to 50% of their operating budget if they suffered a 25% loss in tax revenues due to hurricanes. Special districts like hospitals, ports, and airports had difficulty meeting this standard. FEMA set the interest rates on the loans based on U.S. Treasury rates. FEMA allowed interest rates on loans to be reduced for applicants demonstrating financial hardship. The reduced rate was based on the U.S. Treasury's five-year maturity rate plus one percent, adjusted and rounded, then reduced by half. All loans were released with this lower interest rate. The average interest rate for 157 approved SCDLs was 2.86%. A total of 157 separate SCDLs were approved for 109 local governments in Louisiana and Mississippi, with $1,270 million approved in principal. $1,040 million was borrowed, with 129 loans used by 92 local governments. FEMA issued 53 special disaster loans exceeding $5 million. The CDL Act of 2005 provided loans exceeding $5 million to local governments in Louisiana and Mississippi, with the largest being $120 million each to the City of New Orleans. The loans were not subject to cancellation under a unique provision, causing controversy among lawmakers. The CDL Act of 2005 provided loans exceeding $5 million to local governments in Louisiana and Mississippi, with the largest being $120 million each to the City of New Orleans. These loans were initially not allowed to be cancelled, leading to legislative efforts to repeal this provision. Ultimately, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 allowed for the cancellation of these loans. FEMA initiated a rulemaking process in response to the Supplemental of 2006 to allow for the cancellation of SCDLs. The interim rule, released in October 2005, initially did not allow for SCDLs to be cancelled. After a change in law in May 2007, FEMA proposed a rule in April 2009 for the possible cancellation of SCDLs, which was criticized for the 22-month delay in rulemaking. The proposed rulemaking for the cancellation of SCDLs was released in April 2009, approximately 18 months ahead of the five-year maturity date for the loans. The rule aimed to amend existing SCDL rules by adding cancellation regulations similar to traditional community disaster loans since 1988. FEMA considered changes to the cancellation procedures but ultimately found the existing regulations effective and easy for borrowers to comply with. The final rule for SCDL cancellation was issued in January 2010, nine months before the loans' maturity date. FEMA made five changes to the regulations based on 68 comments received in response to the proposed rule. These changes included altering property tax revenue loss evaluation for cancellation applications, making loan cancellation more likely in certain circumstances. FEMA clarified property revenue loss evaluation for SCDL cancellation applications, assuming decline related to disaster unless proven otherwise. Definitions of \"revenues\" and \"operating expenses\" were clarified based on existing standards. Different FEMA positions would rule on cancellation applications and appeals. FEMA clarified property revenue loss evaluation for SCDL cancellation applications, assuming decline related to disaster unless proven otherwise. Different FEMA positions would rule on cancellation applications and appeals within the same management chain. A specific timeline of 60 days was provided for the cancellation review process, allowing local governments to submit financial data for three full fiscal years or 36 calendar months following a disaster. FEMA reiterated efficient procedures for loan cancellation used for TCDLs, successfully applied after previous hurricanes. After hurricanes Andrew (1992) and Marilyn (1995), local governments often received multiple SCDL loans from FEMA. Despite being issued under different laws, FEMA conducted a single cancellation review process per government, regardless of the number of loans. The process included clarified definitions, flexible handling of property tax losses, and a set timeline for application review. FEMA conducted a definitive timeline for application review and appeal process with the help of a private accounting firm to assist local governments in the cancellation application process. After calculating disaster-related operating budget deficits, FEMA cancelled an equal amount of money from the total principal owed by each local government, loan by loan. For example, if a local government had $20 million in forgivable deficit with two loans, FEMA would cancel the full principal and interest of one loan and $5 million from the other. FEMA canceled the full principal and interest of the first loan and $5 million of the principal and associated interest from the second loan. Controversy arose over FEMA's decisions to cancel community disaster loans, with many local governments appealing the initial decisions. The financial audit procedures used by FEMA to calculate the cancellable amount of a loan were contentious, aiming to apply standard practices and accounting methods to avoid confusion. Senator Mary was involved in addressing these issues. The Accounting Standards Board aimed to avoid confusion by standardizing FEMA's cancellation procedures. Senator Mary Landrieu and the Louisiana legislative auditor raised concerns about ambiguities in FEMA's treatment of revenues and expenditures, leading to inconsistencies in the review of cancellation applications. Some suggested that FEMA's procedures unfairly penalized governments with slashed budgets, despite ongoing recovery efforts and revenue shortages. Communities were still recovering from revenue shortages. Vice President Biden's comments in a speech in St. Bernard's Parish, LA, on January 15, 2010, increased attention on the cancellation of SCDLs. Some perceived his remarks as a promise that the SCDLs would be cancelled. The appeal and adjudication process for special loan cancellation continues, with 17 loans issued to 10 different local governments still in appeal as of June 15, 2012. Loans under appeal were categorized by their financial status, with four already partially cancelled. Multiple loans were often issued to a single local government entity, but FEMA conducted one cancellation review per local government. For evaluating overall cancellation rates, loans issued to local governments should be combined or treated separately based on the reason for issuance. Lack of information hinders analysis based on suggested categories, so default treatment is as separate loans. The analysis of SCDLs shows that 59.7% were partially forgiven, with an average of 54.1% of principal cancelled. A total of 68.9% of principal was cancelled. Proposed legislation may reopen the cancellation process for remaining loans. The proposed legislation would allow FEMA to review and possibly cancel remaining special community disaster loans (SCDLs) issued to local governments. The deadline for submission of revised cancellation applications is April 30, 2014, with FEMA required to make determinations and resolve appeals by April 30, 2015. There are 71 special loans issued to 54 different local governments that could be reviewed with new procedures. Approximately $324.1 million in principal and $52.3 million in interest from special community disaster loans could be cancelled under new procedures. This includes $28.2 million already repaid by local governments to FEMA, which could be reimbursed. Proposed changes would require FEMA to exclude certain revenues in the cancellation review process. The proposed change to FEMA procedures would exclude certain revenues in the General Fund dedicated to special districts or other purposes. It would also include disaster-related capital expenses, debt-servicing expenses, and sick/leave pay as \"disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character.\" These changes would impact how FEMA implements its cancellation process for special community disaster loans. FEMA may consider extending the timeframe for disaster loan cancellations to three, five, or seven fiscal years after the disaster declaration. It is uncertain if FEMA will consistently apply this option to increase or decrease cancellation rates. Evaluation of loans under different time periods may result in varying cancellation amounts. FEMA may need to decide whether to review each loan under each time period or continue using the standard three fiscal year period. The new procedures would allow local governments to choose the period that results in the least, median, or most operating budget deficit, affecting the total amount of principal to be cancelled. They would have until September 30, 2035 to repay the remaining principal and interest not cancelled, extending the repayment period from 20 to roughly 30 years. It is uncertain how the new procedures will impact existing cancellation rates for SCDLs, but rates may increase, especially if FEMA evaluates each loan under the most beneficial time period for the applicant. The Senate Appropriation Committee's draft of the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 includes a provision requiring the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force to evaluate the impact of Sandy on local and state budgets and the effectiveness of the CDL program in addressing budgetary impacts. The Task Force will assess the CDL program, including loan size limitations and FEMA's regulations. The Senate Appropriation Committee's draft of the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 requires the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force to evaluate the impact of Sandy on local and state budgets and the effectiveness of the CDL program. This includes analyzing loan size limitations and FEMA's regulations. The Task Force must provide recommendations on potential legislative amendments within 90 days of enactment. Controversy surrounds the Special Community Disaster Loans (SCDLs) due to perceived differences in cancellation rates compared to Traditional Community Disaster Loans (TCDLs). Without a full audit, it is challenging to accurately assess this perception. Statistical measures show varying cancellation rates between TCDLs and SCDLs. The cancellation rates of Traditional Community Disaster Loans (TCDLs) were lower than Special Community Disaster Loans (SCDLs), with TCDLs having a lower percentage of loans fully cancelled or partially cancelled. TCDLs also had lower forgiven principal amounts per loan on average. However, TCDLs had a higher cancellation rate in terms of total dollar amount of principal cancelled. Overall, the data does not conclusively show fair or consistent application of regulations and procedures by FEMA in either loan category. The unique disaster and financial circumstances surrounding each loan make aggregate assessments of the loan categories only provide a broad indication. In 2008, Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, along with historic flooding in Iowa, led to the passing of the Disaster Relief and Recovery Supplemental Appropriations Act. The act allocated $98.15 million to the CDL program through the Disaster Supplemental of 2008. This funding aimed to subsidize gross obligations for disaster recovery efforts. The CDL program was appropriated $98.15 million in the Disaster Supplemental of 2008 to subsidize direct loans up to $100 million. Two subsequent laws in the 111th Congress established unique conditions for eligibility and loan size specific to disasters in 2008. FEMA has not issued new regulations in response to these provisions. ARRA revised the 2008 CDLs by creating unique provisions for loan size and restricting them to applicants impacted by disasters in 2008. The Supplemental of 2009 provided an exemption for local governments in Texas affected by Hurricane Ike, changing eligibility regulations based on loss of revenue. FEMA typically uses the fiscal year of the disaster or the following fiscal year to determine loss for loans. The law altered eligibility regulations for local governments in Texas affected by Hurricane Ike, allowing FY2010 to be included as a base period for revenue loss evaluation. Multiple loans were issued under the Hurricane Ike declaration, with some communities receiving additional loans under special provisions of ARRA. In ARRA, Congress increased the potential size of loans for local governments from 25% to 50% of the prior year operating budget, removing the $5 million cap. A government could receive a larger loan if they suffered a projected loss of at least 25% in tax revenues. Only one additional loan was issued under this provision, allowing a local government to exceed the 25% operating budget threshold. Several governments reached the $5 million cap. FEMA approved 24 loans to 23 separate local governments in 3 different states. Of the $60.6 million approved, local governments have borrowed approximately $49.7 million so far. Table 10 summarizes the amount of loans issued by government type through the 2008 legislative exemptions. Neither ARRA nor the Supplemental of 2009 contained any unique provisions altering the ability of the 2008 CDLs to be cancelled under Section 417(c)(1) of the Stafford Act. FEMA intends to review the forgiveness of 2008 CDLs using traditional rules, not SCDL rules. New definitions for terms like \"operating expenses\" and \"revenue\" may be used for future evaluations. 2008 CDLs are now eligible for cancellation after reaching the three-fiscal-year mark since the disaster on October 1, 2011. Loans have until five years after the promissory note date to apply for cancellation, with the earliest maturity date being January 26, 2014. Applying early for cancellation may be incentivized due to interest on the loans. In 2014, local governments may benefit from early cancellation of loans to avoid accruing interest. The average interest rate for these loans is 1.89%. The community disaster loan program is underutilized compared to other disaster assistance programs, but controversies arise when loans are cancelled. Congress may need to address policy issues and options to potentially increase or decrease disaster assistance provided through the program. Congress may need to address policy issues and options to potentially increase or decrease disaster assistance provided through the community disaster loan program. Eligibility criteria for the program include suffering losses from a major disaster and a substantial loss of tax revenue. Various options for changing core components of the program, such as eligibility, use, size, and loan cancellation, are discussed. The community disaster loan program has eligibility criteria that include suffering losses from a major disaster and a substantial loss of tax revenue. FEMA has regulations outlining eligibility, but Congress could alter these conditions to change the program's scope and efficiency. Crafting a one-size-fits-all regulation for the broad group of local government entities may be challenging due to their different operating budgets and revenues. Congress could consider restricting loans only to a higher level of government jurisdiction, such as states impacted by disasters, to then disburse the funds to local governments as needed. Loans could also be made at the county or parish level, following the Stafford Act's disaster declaration criteria. This approach has been proposed in legislation before, aiming to address the challenge of interpreting government accounting standards across jurisdictions. Proposed legislation suggests restricting loans to higher government jurisdictions like states, potentially increasing loan sizes to match. Congress may limit eligibility to general purpose municipal governments, excluding special districts and school boards to simplify the program. This could impact essential services provided by these excluded entities. Shifting disaster loan program eligibility to higher government jurisdictions could improve efficiency and transparency, but may pose challenges for local governments currently eligible. The federal government may impose stricter guidelines for disaster loans than FEMA's current procedures, potentially reducing transparency on how funds are spent. Congress could adjust eligibility criteria, such as the requirement for a 5% revenue loss to qualify for a loan, and modify loan size provisions based on expected revenue loss. Congress could potentially adjust eligibility criteria for disaster loans, making provisions from the Emergency Supplemental of 2006 permanent. This would restrict loans to governments experiencing a 25% loss in tax revenues. Developing objective eligibility requirements for disaster assistance may be challenging due to varying financial situations and disaster impacts. Congress could consider changing the program to eliminate eligibility requirements related to substantial loss in revenue and demonstrated need for assistance. Loans could be offered to any local government in a declared disaster area, allowing them to self-select for the loan program based on their own determination of need. Loan size could still be restricted by a formula determined by the federal government or by the local government itself. The local government could determine the loan size within reasonable boundaries. Eliminating eligibility requirements could impact loan demand. Legislative revisions could adjust interest rates or loan cancellation standards. Only one major policy change has occurred in the program's history regarding fund usage. FEMA excludes capital expenses or matches for other assistance programs under \"essential services\" or \"government functions.\" Congress may consider amending the use of loan funds by local governments to include capital projects not eligible for disaster assistance. This could help rebuild infrastructure and stimulate the recovery process, potentially restoring tax revenues. However, this may expand the program's original focus on government services. The proposal suggests expanding the use of loan funds for capital projects not eligible for disaster assistance, potentially increasing loan demand and size. Congress may consider restricting loan funds to specific government functions to avoid redundancy with existing programs. Loan sizes are currently capped by law and regulations. In various iterations of the program, loan sizes have been capped at $5 million or a percentage of the recipient local government's operating budget. FEMA has restricted loan sizes based on a formula considering projected revenue loss and disaster-related expenses. Congress could revise methods for determining loan size to control costs and assistance offered. Strict dollar caps provide predictability, but may be viewed as inequitable to larger local governments. One alternative to dollar limits on loan sizes for local governments is to establish a formal need calculation formula based on FEMA's model. This could involve defining disaster-related expenses, projecting revenue losses, or using expert accountants to determine the loan amount based on predicted expenditures. This approach would remove caps on loan sizes and provide a more equitable distribution of assistance. Expert accountants can determine the local government's financial needs objectively, capturing factors like disaster devastation more effectively. Congress may consider different proposals to increase or decrease loan cancellations, potentially converting loans to grants and increasing federal costs. Eliminating loan cancellation provision for State and Local Government Disaster Loans (SCDLs) could reduce program costs to taxpayers and administrative burdens for governments. It may also prevent misuse of funds by local governments without genuine need. Eliminating loan cancellation provision for State and Local Government Disaster Loans (SCDLs) could reduce program costs to taxpayers and administrative burdens for governments, preventing misuse of funds by local governments without genuine need. Congress could consider allowing loans to be cancelled up to a certain percentage of the initial principal to provide some benefit to financially struggling local governments while constraining costs to federal taxpayers. Changing the metrics used to determine loan forgiveness by FEMA could also be considered. The current statutory standard for loan forgiveness by FEMA is based on whether a local government's revenues are \"insufficient\" to meet their operating budget after three fiscal years. Critics argue that this penalizes governments that try to cut costs in a fiscally prudent manner post-disaster. One alternative metric Congress could consider is evaluating the actual loss of revenue during the three-year fiscal period. One alternative metric Congress could consider is evaluating the actual loss of revenue of a local government during the three-year fiscal period, regardless of whether revenues were sufficient to meet the operating budget post-disaster. This could simplify the process by removing FEMA from evaluating post-disaster budgetary decisions. However, it may lead to the possibility of providing unnecessary assistance to local governments. Another option is to have an independent panel of experts evaluate the disaster recovery progress objectively. The local government's disaster recovery progress could be evaluated by an expert panel, which may recommend loan forgiveness to FEMA if services are still impacted. Congress could consider fully canceling loans and creating a grant program instead. This approach was used in a grant program established in 1970, which had similar eligibility requirements to the current loan program. The President was allowed to make grants to local governments that suffered property tax revenue loss due to a major disaster. Congress may replace the loan program with grants based on lost revenue. A grant program could provide immediate relief without additional debt, but may cost more per dollar of aid. Converting to a grant program could benefit more local governments. Converting the current loan program to a grant program could benefit more local governments by providing immediate relief without additional debt. Congress could also consider a hybrid grant and loan program, offering grants for revenue loss within certain thresholds and loans for the remainder of the need. Balanced budget procedures prevent some local governments from having their loans cancelled by FEMA. The proposal suggests converting the disaster loan program into a hybrid grant and loan program, similar to the Rural Communities Facilities Program managed by USDA. This would involve modifying the current appropriation account and potentially funding it through the Disaster Relief Fund. Managing a hybrid program and financing it through appropriations are important considerations. The CDL program provides financial assistance to local governments facing revenue loss. Congress may reconsider this aid due to the availability of other disaster assistance programs or concerns about violating federalism principles. Congress could end the program by cutting appropriations or eliminating its authorization in the Stafford Act. Congress could consider alternative programs to the CDL program for local government revenue loss post-disaster, such as promoting business or tourism return. Reviewing existing programs like the Small Business Administration's Disaster Loan Program may ensure private businesses' needs are adequately addressed."
