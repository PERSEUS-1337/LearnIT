    "content": "Prior to the 20th century, children from working-class families were often employed in various jobs such as street trades, industrial homework, mines, factories, and agricultural labor. Regulation of child labor in the 19th and early 20th centuries was driven by economic, humane, and social concerns. Child workers were seen as a source of low-wage labor competing with adults, leading to lower wages and living standards. In addition to health and safety risks, inadequate rest hindered children's education and overall well-being. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, child labor was opposed by various groups due to its negative impact on children's education and future employment opportunities. Figures like Samuel Gompers and \"Mother\" Jones advocated for child labor reform, while organizations like the National Consumers League and social workers campaigned against it. This led to the establishment of the National Child Labor Committee in 1904. The National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) was established in 1904 to end the exploitation of children in the workplace, focusing on regulating child labor at the state level and addressing challenges in various industries like mines, factories, and street trades. Industrial homework by children, particularly in tenement sweatshops, posed difficulties in enforcement due to adverse conditions and unrestrained working hours. Reformers saw child labor and industrial homework as interconnected issues, believing that federal intervention was necessary to prevent employers from exploiting loopholes in state regulations. In 1906, legislation was introduced to prohibit the employment of children in factories and mines. In 1907, legislation (P.L. 59-41) authorized the Secretary of Commerce and Labor to investigate and report on the conditions of child workers in the US. This led to a detailed survey published in 19 volumes between 1910 and 1913. Congress then focused on addressing child labor issues, but the best approach was not immediately clear, leading them to move in three different directions. In 1916, new federal child labor legislation was introduced by Senator Robert Owen and Representative Edward Keating, but the U.S. Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in 1918. Congress then turned to its taxing power as an indirect approach. In response to the Supreme Court declaring previous child labor legislation unconstitutional, Senator Atlee Pomerene proposed a 10% tax on industries employing children in violation of age and hours standards. The tax penalty aimed to offset any competitive advantage from child labor. Despite being a form of child labor legislation, it was hoped to gain Court approval. However, the Supreme Court ruled the Pomerene Act unconstitutional in 1922. This led to discussions among labor leaders and advocates, resulting in a proposal for a constitutional amendment granting Congress the right to regulate child labor. The group proposed a constitutional amendment in 1924 to allow Congress to regulate child labor. Despite initial optimism, support waned for various reasons unrelated to child labor. The amendment remained unratified in 1937, leading Congress to consider the Fair Labor Standards Act. Children's advocates were divided on federal action to end oppressive child labor from 1906 to the New Deal era. In 1932, leaders shifted focus from a constitutional amendment on child labor to state action due to doubts on ratification. However, by 1933, child labor abuses were rampant across states, exploiting children with no pay and evading laws. State legislation was ineffective in stopping these abuses, leading to a breakdown of wage scales. In 1933, after widespread child labor abuses and the breakdown of wage scales, Congress passed the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The act aimed to encourage fair competition in industries through the development of codes that included minimum wage standards, overtime pay, and the elimination of child labor. However, the NIRA was later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935. The NIRA and AAA were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. In an effort to salvage labor standards, the government implemented restrictions on items produced by child labor or under unsafe conditions in tenements through the Public Contracts Act of 1936. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was passed in response to the Walsh-Healey Act and the Beet Sugar Act, with child labor provisions added late in the process at the urging of Grace Abbott. President Roosevelt combined wage and hour measures with child labor regulations to make the bill more appealing, leading to the FLSA becoming federal law. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was passed in 1938 with child labor provisions, but it did not fully address the issue of child labor. Historian Jeremy Felt believed that the act served as a deterrent and educational force, but children were still employed where useful. Enforcement of the FLSA in the early 1940s found it difficult to eradicate illegal child labor, especially in industries with industrial homework. The Department of Labor (DOL) eventually banned industrial homework in certain garment-related fields by the mid-1940s, leading to a decrease in abusive child labor practices. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was passed in 1938 with child labor provisions, aiming to protect children from oppressive labor practices. The act has been amended over the years to set conditions for child employment and prohibit certain types of work. The Department of Labor (DOL) has refined the administration of the act through rulemaking processes. Employers are prohibited from using oppressive child labor in commerce or goods production, with specific hazardous occupations restricted for persons under 18 years of age. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets minimum employment age at 16, with exceptions for 14 to 16-year-olds in non-oppressive work. The Secretary of Labor determines hazardous or detrimental work for children. The FLSA excludes children not involved in interstate commerce activities. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets minimum employment age at 16, with exceptions for 14 to 16-year-olds in non-oppressive work. Children not involved in interstate commerce activities are excluded from FLSA regulations. Certain exemptions exist for children employed by parents or in street trades like newspaper delivery. Departmental regulations were changed in the mid-1990s to allow 14 and 15-year-olds to work in sports-attending services at professional sporting events. Youth and child employment in agriculture is treated differently from nonagricultural employment. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), child employment in agriculture is treated differently from nonagricultural employment. Manufacturing and mining work are considered too hazardous for individuals under 18, with the Secretary having the authority to designate other hazardous work. Hazardous Occupations Orders (HOs) are issued to regulate such work, with exceptions for apprentices and student-learners. Higher standards prevail in case of conflicts between HOs and other laws. Currently, there are 17 Hazardous Occupations Orders (HOs) in place for nonagricultural employment, addressing specific hazardous occupations such as work with explosives, meat-processing machines, forest fire fighting, and logging. Additionally, there are 11 HOs for agricultural employment. The Department of Labor proposed a rule in 2011 to expand hazardous occupations in agriculture, but later announced a reconsideration due to concerns about the parental exemption. The Department of Labor (DOL) announced on February 1, 2012, that it would reconsider the parental exemption in child labor laws. On April 26, 2012, DOL withdrew the proposed rule. Enforcement of child labor laws is primarily complaint-driven by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD). Child advocates raise concerns about the difficulty of enforcement, especially in cases of migrant farmworkers. Some suggest nonparental oversight of child labor to address academic and health-related issues. The Department of Labor enforces child labor laws with systems of work permits and penalties for illegal employment of child workers. Employers face fines up to $10,000 for willful violations, and minimum fines were increased in 2010. Violating child labor laws can result in fines of $8,000 per minor under 12 and $6,000 per employee aged 12 or 13. The minimum penalty for illegally employing children ages 12 or 13 is now $6,000 per employee, with a maximum penalty of $11,000 per minor. A civil penalty of up to $50,000 can be assessed for each child labor violation resulting in serious injury or death, doubling to $100,000 for willful or repeated violations. Despite efforts to address child labor through legislation and enforcement, instances of young children working in hazardous conditions still persist. In May 1961, a conference in Washington, DC addressed the issue of inadequate opportunities for youth employment and delinquency. The summary report highlighted a 17.1% unemployment rate for youth aged 16 to 21, with a higher rate for minority youth. The report emphasized the significance of this issue in terms of societal changes and the prevalence of youth dropping out of school. The report highlighted the increasing youth unemployment rate, especially for those with limited education, leading to a migration of young people to cities in search of work. Policy analysts proposed various solutions, but there was little consensus on how to address the serious problem. Despite the challenges, many youths continued to seek employment, with a significant number finding work even at a young age. The Department of Labor reported that about a fourth of 15- to 17-year-old youths were employed during school months, with one-third working during the summer. Significant variations in employment status were observed based on race and ethnicity, with white youths having higher employment rates than black and Hispanic youths. Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan proposed updating child labor policy in July 1982. The Administration proposed updating child labor policy in 1982, aiming to open more job opportunities for 14 and 15-year-olds, extend their work hours, revise hazardous job standards, and simplify employer certification. The proposal faced criticism from Representative George Miller but was defended by Wage/Hour Administrator William Otter citing support from young persons, parents, and potential employers for more flexibility in child labor regulations. Employers are urging flexibility in child labor regulations to allow 14- and 15-year-olds to be more easily employed. The Reagan Administration's plan to relax child labor restrictions on young teenagers in food-service outlets has generated both support and protest. The Reagan Administration's proposal to relax child labor regulations for 14- and 15-year-olds in food-service outlets sparked outrage and protests from various groups. Despite speculation and delays, a final revision never materialized, leading to ongoing hearings in Congress on child labor issues. In the 1980s and 1990s, Congress held hearings on child labor, but no major legislation was passed. In 1987, Labor Secretary William Brock formed a Child Labor Advisory Committee chaired by Linda Golodner. The committee found that child labor was not a priority at the Department of Labor and faced bureaucratic delays in implementing recommendations. By 1989, the committee's suggestions had reached the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. In 1989, Elizabeth Dole's appointment as Secretary of Labor led to increased focus on child labor issues. William Brooks was appointed as Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards and tasked with addressing child labor violations. A GAO report highlighted the need for better data on young workers and injuries. Departmental initiatives and investigations aimed to improve the situation. In early 1990, a special task force on child labor was formed within DOL to revise hazardous work orders and penalties for violations. Operation Child Watch was launched for compliance inspections, leading to changes in penalty structure and enforcement policy. Representative Don Pease expressed both support and concerns about DOL's initiatives. In 1990, Representative Don Pease advocated for legislative reform regarding child labor, criticizing the Bush Administration's reliance on occasional events and crackdowns. The Advisory Committee's status was uncertain, with no meetings held since early that year. Secretary Dole announced her retirement, and Brooks resigned. In 1994, the Clinton Administration proposed a review of child labor regulations. In 1986, Senator Dan Quayle proposed relaxing child labor laws to allow 14- and 15-year-olds to work as bat boys or bat girls for baseball teams. Congress mandated a study on the issue, but it eventually died out. In 1993, the issue resurfaced when a 14-year-old was prevented from being a bat boy for the Savannah Cardinals. Labor Secretary Robert... Labor Secretary Robert Reich suspended enforcement of work hours requirement for children of 14 and 15 years old, allowing them to work late at sporting events. Regulations were changed in spring 1995, but questions remained about the appropriateness of late work hours for young individuals. Labor Secretary Robert Reich suspended work hour requirements for 14 and 15-year-olds, allowing them to work late at sporting events. Some in the restaurant industry argued against exempting the sports industry from time restrictions. Hazardous Occupations Order No. 12 prohibited individuals under 18 from loading waste paper into industrial paper balers and compactors due to safety concerns. Karen Keesling from DOL's Wage and Hour Division emphasized the risks involved in operating such equipment. In response to safety concerns, legislation was introduced to allow minors under 18 to operate baling/compacting machinery if safety standards were met. The National Grocers Association supported the legislation, while the Child Labor Coalition and trade unions opposed it. The legislation was eventually signed into law, permitting 16 and 17-year-olds to load waste materials. The legislation was revised to allow 16 and 17-year-old workers to load materials into scrap paper balers and paper box compactors meeting safety standards. Concerns remained about the adequacy of protection for young workers. Hazardous Occupations Order No. 2 restricted certain motor vehicle operations for workers under 18, with strict guidelines and limitations in place. Representative Mike Kreidler raised questions about the definitions of terms like \"occasional and incidental\" employment-related driving. In April 1994, legislation was introduced to modify HO 2 to allow young persons to drive for work. Despite endorsements from automobile dealers, the bill faced opposition from the Department of Labor and child advocacy groups. Legislation was reintroduced in July 1997 as the Drive for Teen Employment Act, but ultimately did not pass in the 104th Congress. The legislation proposed to allow persons 17 years of age to engage in limited professional driving, under specified safety conditions and with certain limitations, but would still prohibit such activity by persons under 17. The Combest bill, as amended, was signed by President Clinton on October 31, 1998 ( P.L. 105-334 ). Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA) introduced H.R. 2342, the Children's Act for Responsible Employment of 2013, which would raise the minimum age for driving from 14 to 16. H.R. 2342, or CARE Act of 2013, aims to raise the minimum age for youth employed in agriculture from 14 to 16 and for hazardous occupations from 16 to 18, aligning it with nonagricultural occupations. This bill would also prohibit youth under 18 from working in hazardous nonagricultural occupations. H.R. 2342 aims to raise the minimum age for youth employed in hazardous occupations in agriculture to 18, aligning it with nonagricultural occupations. The bill would also prohibit youth from working in hazardous occupations on a farm owned by a parent. H.R. 2342 aims to raise the minimum age for youth employed in hazardous occupations in agriculture to 18, aligning it with nonagricultural occupations. The bill would also prohibit youth from working in hazardous occupations on a farm owned by a parent and remove exemptions for child labor laws on small farms. It would establish penalties for violations of child labor laws, including criminal penalties for repeated or willful violations resulting in death or serious injury of employees under 18. H.R. 2342 aims to raise the minimum age for youth employed in hazardous occupations in agriculture to 18. Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard introduced H.R. 2234, which is the same as H.R. 2342, in the 112th Congress. The legislation would prohibit the employment of persons under 18 in agriculture, except on farms owned and operated by their parents. The legislation aims to raise the minimum age for youth employed in hazardous occupations in agriculture to 18. It would repeal a section allowing waivers for hiring persons ages 10 and 11 for hand harvesting of crops. The bill increases penalties for child labor law violations and requires reporting of work-related injuries for persons under 18 in agriculture. It also prohibits employment of persons under 18 in occupations with pesticide exposure protection. In the 110th Congress, various child labor bills were introduced, including H.R. 2637, the Child Labor Protection Act of 2007. This bill aimed to increase penalties for violations of child labor provisions and establish a maximum civil penalty for violations causing death or serious injury. The Child Labor Protection Act of 2007 proposed a penalty of $50,000 for violations causing death or serious injury to employees under 18, with potential doubling for repeated offenses. Senator Norm Coleman introduced S. 1598 with similar penalties, referred to the HELP Committee. Senator Olympia Snowe's amendment to H.R. 493 included provisions from H.R. 2637/S. 1598. Senator Snowe's amendment, which included provisions from H.R. 2637/S. 1598, was approved by the Senate with a vote of 95 in favor. President George W. Bush signed the measure into law on May 21, 2008, becoming P.L. 110-233. Senator Tom Harkin introduced S. 1614, known as the Child Labor Protection Act of 2007, proposing increased penalties for child labor violations under the FLSA. The CARE Act of 2007, introduced by Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, aims to enforce child labor provisions of the FLSA with criminal penalties. Unlike the previous CARE Act of 2005, it does not call for additional inspectors or amend the WIA law for youth activities. Representative Bruce Braley introduced the Child Labor Safety Act to increase civil penalties for violations of child labor provisions. The bill also raises penalties for violations causing death or serious injury to employees under 18. Criminal penalties may be imposed for violations, with a maximum fine of $50,000 or imprisonment for up to six months. The bill was referred to the Committee on Education and Labor in September 2008. The Child Modeling Exploitation Prevention Act (H.R. 1142) was introduced by Representative Mark Foley to address children engaged in modeling on Internet sites. Parents and individuals encourage young girls to display themselves online for viewers who pay a fee. Representative Foley highlighted the deceptive nature of this activity, emphasizing the need for protection. Representative Foley introduced H.R. 1142 in the 109th Congress to prevent exploitive child modeling, defining it as the use of children under 17 for financial gain without marketing a product or service. This legislation aimed to protect children from inappropriate modeling activities online. The legislation introduced in the 109th Congress aimed to prevent exploitive child modeling by defining it as the use of children under 17 for financial gain without marketing a product or service. It proposed fines and imprisonment for violators and was part of a larger effort to restructure child labor components of the FLSA. In the 109th Congress, the Youth Worker Protection Act (H.R. 2870) introduced comprehensive changes to child labor laws. It defined a \"minor\" as someone at least 14 years old or younger with permission to work. The bill ensured minors between 16 and 18 years old were not employed in hazardous or detrimental occupations and required a work permit with specified provisions. The Youth Worker Protection Act in the 109th Congress introduced changes to child labor laws, defining a \"minor\" as someone at least 14 years old with permission to work. The Act required a work permit with specified provisions including personal details, parental consent, school certification, employer information, type of work, and expiration dates. The Secretary of Labor would prescribe a unified model for work permits containing information about the child worker, parental consent, school status, employer details, and age limitations. The Youth Worker Protection Act in the 109th Congress introduced changes to child labor laws, defining a \"minor\" as someone at least 14 years old with permission to work. The Act required a work permit with specified provisions including personal details, parental consent, school certification, employer information, type of work, and expiration dates. The designated state agency may revoke a work permit if the minor is not in compliance with school attendance requirements or is adversely affected by the employment. Hours allowable for work by minors and notification requirements for serious work-related injuries were also specified in the bill. The bill in the 109th Congress introduced changes to child labor laws, requiring a work permit for minors aged 14 and above. The designated state agency must collect statistical data on work permits and work-related injuries, reporting annually to the Secretary of Labor. The bill also prohibited employing minors in youth peddling and set enforcement requirements and penalties. Additionally, it raised the age for employment in agriculture outside of school hours to twelve years old. The bill aims to raise the age for employment in agriculture outside of school hours from twelve years of age to fourteen years of age. It also standardizes the standard for employment in hazardous agricultural work and eliminates the employment of children under 18 years of age in certain hazardous occupations. Additionally, the Secretary of Labor is directed to revise Hazardous Occupations restraints in specified industries within 24 months of the enactment of the bill. The bill directs the Secretary of Labor to review and update Hazardous Occupations Orders within specified timeframes. This includes prohibiting minors from certain types of employment and reviewing work conditions that may be harmful to minors. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress with proposed regulations. H.R. 2870 was referred to the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, but no action was taken. Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard introduced H.R. 3482, the Children's Act for Responsible Employment of 2005, which aimed to revise Section 13(c) to restrict young persons under 16 from hazardous agricultural work, with exceptions for family employment. The bill aimed to restrict young persons under 16 from hazardous agricultural work, with exceptions for family employment. It repealed a section allowing waivers for minors aged 10 and 11 to work in crop harvesting. Penalties for violations were increased, and employers were required to report serious work-related injuries or deaths of workers under 18. Failure to report could result in a civil penalty of up to $7,000 per violation. Additional inspectors could be employed to enforce the regulations. The bill aimed to enforce compliance with child labor laws by adding 100 inspectors. It also addressed pesticide exposure for child workers and amended the Workforce Investment Act to allocate funds for youth activities in farmworker programs. The Safe at Work Act (H.R. 4190) introduced by Representative Rosa DeLauro aimed to enforce child labor laws by prohibiting advance notice of investigations and requiring a study on violations. The Comptroller General's study examined enforcement actions resulting from inspections and investigations, comparing violations in large and small businesses. Representative Tom Lantos introduced the Youth Worker Protection Act, including a provision prohibiting the employment of minors in youth peddling. Concerns have been raised about the welfare of young persons engaged in certain types of outside sales work. Outside sales work can involve selling items on the street or traveling with a sales team for extended periods. There are concerns about the risks young persons face in such roles, prompting questions about age limits and working hours. Public policy debates surround the employment of children in street sales, especially in unfamiliar or rough neighborhoods. The employment of young workers in outside sales raises questions about working hours, transportation safety, housing, off-hours behavior, and medical care. There are also concerns about the employment relationship between the workers and their supervisors, as well as the ultimate responsibility for their well-being and wages. The employment of young workers in outside sales raises questions about responsibility, wages, employment records, and policy considerations regarding age restrictions and work acceptability. In May 1985, Representative Ron Wyden introduced legislation to establish a National Clearinghouse on Fraudulent Youth Employment Practices due to concerns about exploitative door-to-door selling groups targeting young people. He highlighted fraudulent sales practices and urged action to protect youth from dangerous employment practices. In November 1985, hearings were held by the House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights regarding unlawful practices in youth employment. The Reagan Administration acknowledged issues such as child labor violations, minimum wage violations, and abuse of child workers. However, there was division on whether legislative action was necessary, with some suggesting that state and local authorities could be more effective in addressing the problems. In November 1999, Senator Kohl introduced S. 1989, the Traveling Sales Crew Protection Act, following hearings on youth employment abuses in the 1980s. The Department of Justice deemed existing statutes sufficient to address the issue, and previous legislation on the matter had not progressed further. Senator Kohl introduced the Crew Protection Act after a fatal auto accident in Wisconsin involving a driver with a suspended license. He highlighted the mistreatment of workers by traveling sales crews who violate labor laws as they move from state to state. Despite previous efforts, no action was taken in Congress to address these abuses. Kohl introduced new legislation in the 107th Congress (S. 96) to regulate traveling sales crews. Senator Kohl introduced legislation (S. 96) to regulate traveling sales crews, specifically targeting individuals under 18 years of age engaged in door-to-door sales. The bill outlined registration requirements for employers and supervisors, obligations regarding housing, transportation, wages, insurance, and enforcement. Despite being referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), no action was taken. Senator Kohl introduced S. 2549, a bill to regulate individuals under 18 years of age engaged in door-to-door sales, prohibiting them from being away from their permanent residence for more than 24 hours. The bill was passed by the Senate but died in the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. In the 109th Congress, child labor reform proposals were introduced by Representative Lantos and legislation to permit employment of young persons in sawmilling and woodworking facilities was introduced by Representative Pitts and Senator Specter. The bills were directed to the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections where they remained without further action. A hearing on the Pitts bill was conducted by the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. The House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections discussed the hazards of work in sawmills and woodworking machinery for individuals under 18 years old, which violates Departmental Hazardous Occupations Orders. The Amish community resists laws that interfere with their traditional lifestyle, including compulsory education beyond 8th grade. With fewer opportunities for farming, they are exploring other options for their children's work. The Amish community has clashed with the Department of Labor over child labor laws, seeking amendments to allow their sons to work in sawmills and woodworking plants under Amish supervision. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to accommodate their practices since the 105th Congress. Legislation was introduced in Congress to allow Amish youth to work in places with machinery processing wood products if they are members of a religious sect prohibiting education beyond 8th grade. The House passed the legislation, but the Senate did not act on it. Constitutional concerns were raised about giving special treatment to the Amish. The legislation proposed in Congress aimed to allow Amish children to work in wood processing establishments after 8th grade. Questions were raised about the suitability of such work for children under 18 and who should decide on appropriate employment for 14-year-old Amish children. The legislation also raised concerns about strengthening the ties of Amish children to their community. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services conducted an oversight hearing on the employment needs of Amish youth, with Representative Mark Souder supporting exemption for Amish children to work in industrial jobs at age 14. This raised questions about the appropriateness of federal involvement in facilitating employment for Amish youth. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services held a hearing on the employment needs of Amish youth. Representative Mark Souder supported exempting Amish children to work in industrial jobs at age 14. There was a debate on amending the FLSA to allow Amish youngsters to work in mills and woodworking plants. Senator Specter proposed S.Amdt. 420, but Senator Kennedy opposed it citing safety concerns in sawmills. Senator Kennedy and Senator Specter engaged in a brief debate regarding legislation to permit Amish youth to work at age 14 in wood processing plants. Senator Kennedy agreed to conduct an open hearing on the issue of safety for prospective workers. Senator Specter then withdrew his proposed amendment. Legislation was introduced in both the House and Senate, but no action was taken. The bills of the 108th Congress aimed to exempt youth from federal child labor laws by imposing certain standards, including being at least 14 years old. The legislation proposed in the 108th Congress aimed to exempt Amish youth aged 14 and older from federal child labor laws, allowing them to work in wood processing plants under certain conditions. These conditions include being supervised by an adult relative or member of the same religious sect, wearing personal protective equipment, and being protected from potential hazards in the workplace. Concerns were raised about the adequacy of safeguards and the enforcement of precautions in the absence of frequent Department of Labor inspections. The Subcommittee on Workforce Protections conducted a hearing on H.R. 1943 regarding exempting Amish youth from federal child labor laws to work in wood processing plants under certain conditions. Chairman Charlie Norwood emphasized the importance of respecting the religious beliefs of the Amish community, while Representative Pitts criticized the Department of Labor for threatening their lifestyle and religion. Representative Mark Souder reviewed proposed safeguards. Representative Mark Souder and Christ K. Blank support exempting Amish youth from federal child labor laws for wood processing, citing religious freedom and the importance of instilling Amish values. However, Nicholas Clark raises concerns about hazardous working conditions in sawmilling and woodworking industries. Nicholas Clark raised concerns about exempting Amish-owned sawmills and woodworking firms from child labor laws, citing constitutional issues, equity, and the safety of Amish children. He argued that while these industries provide employment for Amish adults, they are not safe or constitutional for Amish children. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations bill, H.R. 2673, included language similar to the Amish child labor bill, allowing youth aged 14-17 exempt from compulsory school attendance to work in wood processing businesses under safety provisions. The House and Senate approved the conference report on the Amish child labor provision, with the Senate voting 65 yeas to 28 nays. The President signed the measure into law on January 23, 2004 (P.L. 108-199). Senator Specter highlighted the importance of the legislation to the Amish community and culture. The legislation regarding Amish child labor was signed into law on January 23, 2004, with Senator Specter emphasizing its importance to the Amish community's freedom of religion and educational practices."
