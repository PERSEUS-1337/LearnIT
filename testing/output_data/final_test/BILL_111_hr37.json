    "content": "The Act titled \"Systematic Foreclosure Prevention and Mortgage Modification Act\" establishes a plan for preventing foreclosures and modifying mortgages. The Act establishes a foreclosure prevention and mortgage modification program. It includes paying servicers $1,000 per modified loan and sharing up to 50% of losses for re-defaulted loans. Eligible borrowers must have owner-occupied properties, and government loss sharing is available after 6 payments. A net present value test is required. The Act establishes a foreclosure prevention and mortgage modification program. Participating servicers must conduct a systematic loan review and apply a standard net present value test to determine loan modifications. The test compares the expected net present value of modifying past due loans to foreclosing on them, ensuring affordability based on a 31 percent borrower mortgage debt-to-income ratio. The Act establishes a foreclosure prevention and mortgage modification program. Participating servicers must conduct a systematic loan review and apply a standard net present value test to determine loan modifications. Failure to do so may result in disqualification from the program. Modifications can include reducing interest rates, forbearing principal, extending the term to maturity, or other similar changes. Additionally, for \"underwater loans\" with loan-to-value ratios above 100 percent, the government loss share percentage will decrease from 50 percent to 20 percent as the loan-to-value ratio increases. Loss sharing will not be available if the loan-to-value ratio is too high. The simplified loss share calculation for the foreclosure prevention program involves determining the difference between the net present value of the modified loan and the recoveries from refinancing, short sale, or real estate owned sale. Interim modifications are allowed, and a de minimis test is used to exclude certain cases from loss sharing to reduce administrative costs. The loss sharing guarantee for loan modifications requires a minimum 10 percent reduction in monthly payments and terminates after 8 years. The Federal Government will cover costs of the program, and the FDIC Chairperson can make modifications as needed. Regulations will be implemented to prevent evasions of the program. The FDIC Chairperson has the authority to modify the foreclosure prevention program to maximize effectiveness. A progress report must be submitted to Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment, including findings and recommendations for further action."
