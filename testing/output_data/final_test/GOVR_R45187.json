    "content": "Pension plans are a form of deferred compensation where income is received in the future. The Internal Revenue Code provides tax advantages for such schemes. Plans can be defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC), with DB plans providing monthly benefit payments in retirement. The focus of this report is on DB plans. The focus of this report is on multiemployer DB pension plans, which are sponsored by more than one employer and are of concern to Congress due to potential insolvency issues. When a plan becomes insolvent, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation steps in to provide financial assistance. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation provides financial assistance to multiemployer DB pension plans to ensure benefits up to a maximum of $12,870 per year. 79% of participants in plans receiving assistance receive their full benefit. Among terminated plans likely needing assistance, 49% have benefits below the maximum guarantee. Ongoing plans have benefits almost twice as large on average. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation provides financial assistance to multiemployer DB pension plans to ensure benefits up to a maximum of $12,870 per year. Among plans receiving assistance, the average benefit is almost twice as large as in terminated plans. PBGC estimates insufficient resources to provide financial assistance at the guarantee level in the future. Most participants would receive less than $2,000 per year due to limited annual premium revenue. Federal government is not obligated to provide assistance, but some policymakers suggest it might be necessary to prevent benefit reductions. CRS analyzed Form 5500 data from the Department of Labor for the 2015 plan year to ensure participants' benefits are not reduced. Pension plans are required to report information to IRS, DOL, and PBGC. Public-use Form 5500 data included 1,363 plans. The analyzed data in this report focuses on multiemployer DB pension plans that filed Schedule MB for the 2015 plan year. Out of 1,363 plans with 10.8 million participants, 1,267 plans with 10.7 million participants filed Schedule MB in 2015. About 38.3% were active participants, 28.5% were retired participants, and 27.5% were separated, vested participants. In 2015, multiemployer DB plans that filed Schedule MB had $477.7 billion in assets and owed participants $1,038.0 billion in benefits, resulting in total underfunding of $560.3 billion. The liabilities used in this report are based on the current liability value on Schedule MB, which includes actuarial value and RPA '94 liability. The main difference lies in the discount rate used to value plan liabilities. The RPA '94 valuation method discounts plan liabilities using a lower rate based on 30-year Treasury securities, resulting in higher valuations compared to the actuarial method. The median RPA '94 rate in 2015 was 3.51%, while the actuarial rate was 7.5%. PBGC uses a discount rate closer to the RPA '94 rate, such as 3.54% for multiemployer plans in 2014. Among 1,267 plans in 2015, 1,246 were underfunded, 17 were overfunded, and 4 did not report any funding status. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 required multiemployer plans to report their financial condition in specified categories. Plans in endangered or seriously endangered status must adopt a funding improvement plan to reduce underfunding by 33% or 20% over a specified period. During a 15-year funding improvement period, plans in seriously endangered status cannot increase benefits. Plans in critical status must adopt a rehabilitation plan with options like increased employer contributions. If a plan cannot emerge from critical status after a 10-year rehabilitation period, it must either delay emerging or prevent insolvency. Plans in critical status are restricted from increasing benefits during the rehabilitation period. During the rehabilitation period, plans in critical status are classified based on their projected emergence or indication of insolvency. Some ERM plans may become insolvent despite not being in critical and declining status. Analysis of 2015 Form 5500 data showed 800 plans in the green zone covering 5.8 million participants, 156 plans in endangered status covering 1.2 million participants, and 215 plans in critical status covering 2.2 million participants. During the rehabilitation period, 215 plans were in critical status, covering 2.2 million participants. Of these, 145 plans were expected to emerge from critical status, while 70 plans were not expected to recover and may become insolvent. Additionally, 83 plans were in critical and declining status, covering 1.2 million participants, with indications of insolvency. Multiemployer plans in critical and declining status must specify the year they expect to become insolvent in their Form 5500 filings. Plans in critical and declining status must indicate the year of expected insolvency. Table 3 shows the number of plans and participants in this status, along with benefits paid in 2015. The amount of benefits paid at insolvency may differ from 2015. Some participants may not receive full benefits due to the PBGC maximum guarantee. 51% of participants in terminated plans may see reduced benefits. In Table 4, the 25 largest multiemployer DB pension plans in the 2015 plan year are listed, totaling 4.7 million participants. These plans account for 44.4% of participants in multiemployer plans that filed Schedule MB in 2015. Insolvency of one plan could impact other plans where the same employer participates. An employer leaving a multiemployer plan may face withdrawal liability, impacting their financial statements and access to credit. Other plans where the employer is a major contributor could also be affected. Form 5500 requires listing employers contributing more than 5% to the plan. Form 5500 includes regular employer contributions and employer withdrawal liability. It is unclear whether withdrawal liability should be included in the 5% threshold calculations. PBGC staff believe it should not be included. 1,163 multiemployer plans had at least one 5% contributor in 2015, with a median of four contributors. Table 5 lists employers with contributions totaling $25 million or more in 2015. The United Parcel Service (UPS) is the largest 5% contributor in terms of dollar amount, with several grocery chains also contributing at least $25 million. Table 6 lists the 5% contributors in the 12 largest multiemployer DB plans in critical and declining status for the 2015 plan year. Table 6 lists the 5% contributors in the 12 largest multiemployer DB plans in critical and declining status for the 2015 plan year, including the amount of employer contributions, total contributions to the plan, and the percentage of contributions from 5% contributors. Total plan contributions consist of required employer contributions and withdrawal liability."
