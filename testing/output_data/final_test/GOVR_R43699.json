    "content": "This report provides an overview of court decisions that have influenced the EPA's implementation of the Clean Air Act. Challenges to EPA actions are typically filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit or through \"citizen suits\" in federal district courts. Several court cases currently being litigated address unresolved questions related to EPA's CAA authority. The Clean Air Act (CAA) addresses unresolved questions regarding EPA's authority. The CAA establishes national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) to protect public health and welfare from air pollutants. EPA is directed to issue air quality criteria to set NAAQS levels, and states must adopt implementation plans. The Clean Air Act requires states to adopt plans to meet NAAQS for pollutants. EPA reviews standards every five years, with stakeholders debating cost and feasibility considerations. EPA is directed to set NAAQS without considering cost or feasibility. In contrast to other CAA sections, Sections 108 and 109 do not require consideration of cost or feasibility when setting NAAQS. Court cases have held that EPA must set NAAQS without regard to cost or technological feasibility. The CAA allows EPA to factor in costs and feasibility, even if the technology to achieve a NAAQS does not currently exist. The CAA was technology-forcing and did not consider costs in setting primary NAAQSs, as affirmed in Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns. The Supreme Court ruled that EPA does not have to consider costs when setting NAAQS, citing CAA provisions that allow for compliance cost considerations in other sections. EPA is directed by the CAA to set NAAQS without regard to cost or feasibility. The EPA is directed by the Clean Air Act to translate NAAQSs into emission limits for specific stationary sources. States must submit a state implementation plan (SIP) within three years of NAAQS promulgation, detailing air pollution control measures. The SIP must meet various requirements, but economic and technological feasibility is not mandated. The Supreme Court ruled in Union Electric Co. v. EPA that EPA cannot consider infeasibility when approving or disapproving a SIP. The EPA must approve state SIPs that meet Section 110(a)(2) factors, even if they are more stringent than required by the Clean Air Act. Courts have ruled that EPA cannot condition SIP approval on specific control measures. EPA is not required to prepare an environmental impact statement under NEPA when approving or disapproving SIPs. States must submit air quality control regions as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable after NAAQS are set or revised. The EPA reviews state submissions to categorize air quality control regions as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable. After negotiations, EPA lists nonattainment areas, requiring states to submit SIPs outlining pollution control measures to meet NAAQS. Some states struggle due to transported air pollution, leading to provisions like the \"good neighbor\" provision in Section 110(a)(2)(D) of the CAA. The \"good neighbor\" provision in Section 110(a)(2)(D) of the CAA requires states to prohibit stationary sources from emitting pollutants that could impact air quality in other states. Litigation often involves emissions of nitrogen oxides, particulates, and sulfur dioxide, which can travel long distances and contribute to ozone formation. EPA issues SIP calls to states to revise their plans to meet these requirements. The \"good neighbor\" provision in the Clean Air Act requires states to prevent emissions that contribute to regional pollution issues like ozone formation and acid deposition. Litigation has addressed EPA's definition of significant contribution, cost-effectiveness in control measures, and the roles of EPA and states in identifying required controls. In Michigan v. EPA, the D.C. Circuit ruled that EPA can consider costs in determining significant contributions to downwind states' pollution levels. The court found that EPA can use \"highly cost-effective controls\" to reduce emissions uniformly in all covered states, regardless of each state's contribution. North Carolina v. EPA challenged the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions in 28 states to meet NAAQSs for fine particulate matter and ozone in downwind states. The court found CAIR flawed as it did not ensure measurable emission reductions in each upwind state. EPA must give assurance of emission reductions in each state to satisfy Section 110(a)(2)(D). The court found EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) flawed as it did not ensure measurable emission reductions in each upwind state to satisfy Section 110(a)(2)(D). EPA's subsequent effort, the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), addressed the same pollutants and states as CAIR but was also found to be inconsistent with the same section. EPA set limits on pollution an upwind state could produce under CSAPR, based on cost-effectiveness and impact on downwind nonattainment areas. In EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P., the Supreme Court upheld the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). The Court ruled that EPA's allocation of emission reductions among upwind states based on cost-effectiveness is a permissible interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision in the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 111 directs EPA to develop federal \"standards of performance\" for stationary sources of air pollution, known as New Source Performance Standards (NSPSs). NSPSs are nationally uniform to prevent companies from choosing locations with less stringent requirements. Litigated phrases include \"adequately demonstrated,\" which does not guarantee existing sources can meet NSPS. Portland Cement Ass'n v. Ruckelshaus clarifies that Section 111 focuses on achievable emission reduction through the best system of emission reduction. The Clean Air Act Section 111 directs EPA to develop federal standards of performance for stationary sources of air pollution, known as New Source Performance Standards (NSPSs). Litigated phrases include \"adequately demonstrated,\" which does not guarantee existing sources can meet NSPS. Portland Cement Ass'n v. Ruckelshaus clarifies that Section 111 focuses on achievable emission reduction through the best system of emission reduction. Lignite Energy Council v. EPA cautions against basing determinations on speculation or conjecture, allowing for extrapolation of technology performance in other industries. National Lime Ass'n v. EPA instructs that existing sources must be representative of the industry as a whole. Section 111 is silent on the weight to be given to cost and nonair quality impacts of control technology. The litigation over EPA's regulations limiting CO2 emissions from new power plants is central, with states challenging the standards of performance for stationary sources of air pollution. The Clean Air Act Section 111 focuses on achievable emission reduction through the best system of emission reduction, with the weight of cost and nonair quality impacts of control technology being silent. EPA has discretion in choosing the best adequately demonstrated technology, which will be sustained unless the costs are exorbitant. The achievable standard is described as within the efficiency of the system and need not necessarily be routinely achieved within the industry prior to adoption. Several states, including North Dakota and West Virginia, have filed petitions challenging EPA's final NSPS for CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. The petitioners question the adequacy of technologies like CCS on which the standards are based. Oral arguments for this case are scheduled for April 17, 2017. EPA must also establish emission guidelines for existing sources under certain circumstances. EPA must establish emission guidelines for existing sources under certain circumstances, similar to Section 110 of the CAA. The agency finalized emission guidelines to regulate CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel power plants, known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), on the same day as issuing Carbon Pollution Standards for new power plants. The CPP has been a controversial environmental regulation. The EPA's Clean Power Plan (CPP) has sparked multi-party litigation over controversial environmental regulations. Key issues include the authority to consider shifting to natural gas and renewable energy in the electric grid, and the interpretation of Section 111(d)(1)(A) amendments. Judicial decisions in this litigation will define EPA's authority under the Clean Air Act Section 111. The EPA's Clean Power Plan has sparked litigation over environmental regulations, with key issues including the authority to shift to natural gas and renewable energy. The boundaries of EPA's authority under the Clean Air Act Section 111 will be defined by judicial decisions in this litigation, particularly regarding the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program for new emission sources. BACT requirements vary by state but must be at least as stringent as NSPS and Section 112 standards. The PSD new source review program aligns with NSPS definitions, allowing states to impose stricter emission requirements. The Alabama Power Co. v. Costle decision clarified that new source review is only required in PSD areas, minimizing disparities in emission standards. The Supreme Court clarified that the PSD sections of the Clean Air Act do not require post-construction monitoring of emissions. In Alaska Dep't of Environmental Conservation v. EPA, the Court ruled that EPA can block construction in a PSD area if the state's determination of Best Available Control Technology (BACT) is inconsistent with the CAA definition. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether PSD new source review applies to greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources. EPA argued that after regulating GHG emissions from vehicles in 2011, PSD review should also apply to stationary sources emitting GHGs. However, this approach would lead to a significant number of new sources needing permits due to low emission thresholds. The EPA proposed the \"Tailoring Rule\" to address the issue of millions of existing stationary sources requiring Title V operating permits due to emitting above-threshold quantities of CO2. The Supreme Court, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, took a different approach by questioning whether greenhouse gases are included in the definition of \"air pollutant\" under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court questioned if greenhouse gases are considered \"air pollutants\" under the Clean Air Act, leading to challenges in regulating emissions from various sources. The Court ruled against EPA's attempt to ease administrative burdens by phasing in emission thresholds, but allowed for new source review with BACT requirements to include GHG emissions. The Clean Air Act defines \"modification\" as any change in a stationary source that increases emissions or results in new emissions. EPA has interpreted this term since 1974, excluding routine changes. This definition applies to NSPSs and new source review in PSD areas for both new and existing sources undergoing modifications. EPA's Tailoring Rule, if upheld, would have covered only 3% more of American stationary source GHG emissions, which account for 83% of total emissions. EPA was largely successful in the UARG case despite the rejection of the Tailoring Rule. The EPA has exempted routine maintenance, repair, and replacement (RMRR) at stationary sources from the definition of \"modification\" under the Clean Air Act since 1974. This exemption has been accepted by courts, but utilities have argued for a broader interpretation to avoid stringent regulations. The WEPCO decision in 1990 established that certain renovations at electric power plants do not qualify as RMRR and trigger new source review requirements. Determining if the RMRR exemption applies to existing-source renovations involves considering factors like plant life expectancy, project cost, nature, and magnitude. Courts often refer to these factors post-WEPCO decision. New York v. EPA is another significant RMRR case, rejecting a 2003 EPA attempt to broaden the exception. The D.C. Circuit found the Equipment Replacement Rule too broad, as it conflicted with the Clean Air Act's definition of \"modification.\" The court found the rule too broad for the RMRR exception, defining \"modification\" differently in NSPS and PSD contexts based on emissions amount per hour for NSPS and per year for PSD. EPA can define the term differently in each CAA program due to different statutory contexts. The Clean Air Act attaches regulatory consequences to modifications at emissions sources that increase the amount of a regulated pollutant. The bubble concept was used to measure emission amounts on an aggregate plantwide basis. The bubble concept is favored by industry for measuring emission amounts on a plantwide basis to avoid strict CAA regulations triggered by emission increases. EPA's adoption of the bubble concept in various programs has been challenged in court, with the D.C. Circuit ruling against it in ASARCO v. EPA in 1978. The court found EPA's definition of \"stationary source\" in conflict with the CAA definition, leading to the rejection of the bubble concept for determining modifications triggering NSPSs. The D.C. Circuit court rejected EPA's argument for the bubble concept in determining NSPS compliance costs, stating it was not needed. However, the court later ruled in Alabama Power Co. v. Costle that the bubble concept is required in PSD areas, calling the individual unit approach \"unreasonable.\" The court distinguished this from its earlier ASARCO ruling based on differing statutory purposes. In 1984, the Supreme Court upheld EPA's use of the bubble concept in nonattainment areas under the Clean Air Act, deferring to EPA's interpretation due to vague language. Hazardous air pollutants are more toxic than those addressed by NAAQSs and are regulated separately. Hazardous air pollutants are more toxic than those addressed by NAAQSs and are regulated pursuant to Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, which directs EPA to set National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs). EPA was slow to implement Section 112 in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to challenges in court for its failure to act. The language of Section 112 posed a dilemma for EPA Administrators as it required protection of public health with an \"adequate margin of safety.\" The 1990 Clean Air Act amendments revised Section 112 by listing 187 hazardous air pollutants for EPA to regulate and requiring technology-based emission standards for both new and existing sources. This change was made in response to issues raised in litigation during the 1980s. The 1990 Clean Air Act amendments require technology-based emission standards for new and existing sources. \"Major sources\" must use \"maximum achievable control technology\" (MACT), while \"area sources\" may have more lenient standards. EPA must review residual health risks and impose standards for public health protection if Congress does not act. EPA can determine major sources by aggregating all sources in a plant site under common control. The court found that EPA is not limited to aggregating sources within a single category or under the same code. In National Lime Ass'n v. EPA, the court ruled that EPA must create emission standards for hazardous air pollutants even if no sources in the category use controls for that pollutant. EPA cannot set emission levels only for pollutants currently controlled with technology. The D.C. Circuit clarified that the Clean Air Act mandates EPA to establish emission standards for each major source of hazardous air pollutants. In NRDC v. EPA, the court addressed ambiguous instructions regarding risk-based standards, ultimately upholding EPA's existing technology-based standard for a source category to maintain a cancer risk level of no more than 100 in 1 million. This decision was based on the interpretation of an \"ample margin of safety\" established before the 1990 amendments. The court upheld EPA's existing technology-based standard for maintaining a cancer risk level of no more than 100 in 1 million, based on the interpretation of \"ample margin of safety\" before the 1990 amendments. EPA can consider costs in setting risk-based standards, but the consideration of costs in determining if it is \"appropriate and necessary\" to regulate power plants under Section 112 has been a subject of litigation. Congress created a special procedure for applying the NESHAP program to power plants under Section 112. EPA can regulate HAP emissions from power plants under Section 112 only if it finds regulation to be \"appropriate and necessary.\" In 2012, EPA found it \"appropriate and necessary\" to regulate coal- and oil-fired power plants under Section 112 due to significant hazards from mercury emissions. EPA issued the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS rule) to limit these emissions, despite opposition from states and industry groups. The D.C. Circuit upheld EPA's decision not to consider costs in making its \"appropriate and necessary\" finding for regulating power plants under Section 112. The court stated that while EPA must consider costs when setting emission standards stricter than the MACT standard, it was not required to do so initially. The Supreme Court reversed Michigan v. EPA, stating that EPA's failure to consider costs in its \"appropriate and necessary\" finding for regulating power plants was unreasonable. The Court emphasized that cost should be a relevant factor in determining regulation necessity. The dissenting Justices in response to Michigan v. EPA agreed that EPA was unreasonable in not considering costs in its regulations, but found that EPA had met this requirement by considering costs when setting emissions standards. EPA issued a supplemental finding in 2016 reaffirming the regulation of HAP emissions from power plants as \"appropriate and necessary\" under Section 112, despite challenges from utilities, industry groups, and 14 states. The EPA's consideration of \"co-benefits\" from reducing non-HAP emissions in cost-benefit analyses is being challenged in court. The decision in the MATS supplemental finding case could impact how EPA evaluates costs and benefits for rulemakings under the Clean Air Act, which is currently the primary tool for regulating greenhouse gas emissions. The Clean Air Act has become the main tool for addressing greenhouse gases (GHGs). In 1999, advocates petitioned the EPA to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles under the Act. EPA initially denied the petition in 2003, but the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007 remanded the denial, stating that EPA had the authority to regulate GHGs. In 2007, the Supreme Court remanded EPA's 2003 denial of the petition to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The Court held that \"air pollutant\" in the CAA includes GHGs and that EPA must regulate them once they potentially endanger public health and welfare. This led to EPA issuing GHG emission standards for various vehicle types from 2012 to 2022. The Supreme Court's decision in American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut clarified that EPA has authority to regulate GHGs through NSPSs under CAA Section 111, eliminating federal judges' authority to impose GHG emission limitations. This extends to NSPSs under CAA Section 111(b) and resolves issues related to EPA's proposed regulations for CO2 emissions from new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants. The Supreme Court's decision in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA addressed EPA's regulation of GHG emissions from stationary sources, allowing the application of Best Available Control Technology in certain cases. In TVA v. Whitman, EPA's use of administrative compliance orders was successfully challenged under the CAA. Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), the EPA has enforcement options for violations, including civil and criminal penalties, adjudication, and administrative compliance orders (ACOs). ACOs allow EPA to impose penalties without court challenge, unlike other enforcement options. The U.S. Court of Appeals found this approach unconstitutional in TVA v. Whitman. In TVA v. Whitman, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that pre-enforcement court review must be available to recipients of EPA orders under the Clean Air Act. The court found that EPA's use of administrative compliance orders (ACOs) without court oversight was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court later affirmed this ruling in Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, allowing EPA to use aerial photography for emission source checks under CAA Section 114. The EPA will use aerial photography to check on emission sources. The Court ruled that a warrant is not required for such surveillance outside industrial plants, citing lack of privacy expectations similar to residential homes. Key terms include ACO, BACT, BSER, CAA, CAIR, CO2, CPP, EPA, GHG, HAP, MACT, NAAQS, NESHAP, NOx, NEPA, NSPS, PSD, RMRR, SIP, SO2."
