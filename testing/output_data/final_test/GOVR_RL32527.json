    "content": "The U.S. issues warnings through the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and NOAA Weather Radio All-Hazards Network. The National Weather Service (NWS) sends alerts through NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) for all hazards. The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) is a key initiative to improve warning systems, led by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). IPAWS will be able to receive, verify, and transmit alerts through various digital media. Many communities are also implementing local alert systems for voice and text messages. Many communities are installing local alert systems for voice, text messages, and email. The long-term goal is to integrate federal warning systems with localized systems and call centers like 911 and 211. The Emergency Alert System relies on various partners, with the federal government leading to ensure presidential alerts for national disasters. However, the division of responsibility has led to coordination issues and varying effectiveness of the system across states. The implementation of IPAWS is expected to provide a robust emergency alert capability at all levels. The IPAWS program has fallen behind schedule due to administrative retrenchment, focusing mainly on presidential alerts while neglecting state, local, and disability assistance programs. The Government Accountability Office attributed the lack of progress to shifting goals, lack of continuity in planning, and staff turnover. DHS agreed with GAO's recommendations but failed to meet them. The National Continuity Programs Directorate within FEMA is responsible for IPAWS. Damon C. Penn testified before Congress about the challenges faced by the program. Damon C. Penn, Assistant Administrator of the NCP, testified before Congress about re-energizing efforts for IPAWS. FEMA aims to achieve their IPAWS vision by 2012 with goals including interoperable standards, redundancy in dissemination network, integrated message distribution, and additional PEP stations. NCP is developing a strategic plan aligning federal goals with state, local, tribal, and territorial needs. Progress is on schedule according to Mr. Penn and Antwane V. Johnson. At a June 2010 meeting sponsored by the FCC, Director/PM of DHS/FEMA discussed the development of the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) as part of IPAWS. The goal is to deliver mobile alert messages to consumers by April 7, 2012, in response to the WARN Act. FEMA and the FCC are committed to the development of IPAWS and CMAS to relay emergency alerts through cell phones. The National Response Framework addresses coordination of federal, state, tribal, and local responsibilities for emergency information. However, there are limitations in disaster planning for communications with first responders and disaster victims. There is a lack of consistent planning for using improved systems to save lives during emergencies. There is a lack of consistent planning for using improved systems to save lives during emergencies, such as guiding evacuations to safe areas and directing disaster victims to life-saving resources. Communication plans are primarily local and rely on informing first responders or the National Guard, not the affected community. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) currently sends emergency messages through broadcast radio, television, and cable stations. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) originated as CONELRAD in 1951 as part of America's response to nuclear attack threats. It was upgraded and automated in the 1990s, and is now required to transmit federal warnings, although it has not been used for this purpose. The system is managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the FCC, with local warnings being its main value to the American people. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is managed by FEMA and the FCC, providing technical standards and support for broadcaster involvement. Non-federal EAS plans are developed at the state and local level, with uneven coordination and implementation across states. Organizations like the Media Security and Reliability Council and the Primary Entry Point Administrative Committee participate in EAS planning. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) involves various organizations such as the Council, the PEP Administrative Committee, and broadcasting associations. States have Emergency Communications Committees (SECCs) that work with broadcasting companies and public safety officials to coordinate emergency messages on radio and television. EAS technology constraints limit messages to two minutes, so agreements with broadcasters include warning messages and follow-up broadcasts. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) involves broadcasters providing EAS warning messages and follow-up programming. National Primary Stations transmit presidential alerts and messages, forming the backbone of the system under FEMA governance. In times of national emergency, broadcasts are relayed through PEP stations in a \"daisy chain\" to alert all broadcast and cable stations. State and local alerts enter the chain through PEPs, including National Primary Stations. FCC requirements govern the system. The FCC requires national primary stations to conduct weekly or monthly tests for emergency alerts. Different levels of governance use various radio broadcast stations to transmit messages, including federal, state, and local plans. States utilize radio stations with different coverage to match their geographical areas, all following FCC equipment requirements. Broadcast and cable stations must install FCC-certified EAS equipment as a licensing condition. The FCC mandates that radio and television broadcast stations, cable companies, and wireless cable companies must participate in the Emergency Alert System (EAS). Cable companies serving small communities may have partial exemptions. Broadcasters have the final authority to transmit non-federal emergency messages. IPAWS aims to enhance communication network robustness by upgrading PEP radio stations to satellite distribution. PEP broadcast stations will be expanded to provide satellite communications to every state and territory for radio broadcast survivability during catastrophic incidents. FEMA plans to assess the number of PEP stations needed to maximize the reach of EAS alerts. The FCC has expanded EAS requirements to include digital media carriage of alerts through the Digital Emergency Alert System (DEAS). EAS technology uses coders and decoders to send emergency messages in digital formats. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) allows for automated transmission of emergency messages to the public using unique codes for authentication. Messages are classified by event types with corresponding codes to facilitate quick recognition and re-transmittal at broadcast stations. For example, a tornado warning is coded as TOR, evacuation immediate as EVI, and civil emergency message as CEM. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) uses unique codes like CEM for civil emergency messages. Broadcast stations can relay these messages through program interruptions or crawls on TV screens. EAS technology is compatible with NOAA Weather Radio (NWR), which broadcasts weather forecasts and all-hazard warnings. NWR messages can be automatically received and decoded by EAS equipment, including weather radios programmed with Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) for specific alerts and locations. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) utilize broadcast technologies for alerts, but advancements in communication technology like the Internet and wireless devices offer more efficient alert systems. Some states and communities are adopting alert systems using email, wireless text messages, phone alerts, and cell broadcasting technology. The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) provides a standardized format for alerts. The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is a standardized format for alert messages used in various warning systems. CAP has been widely supported by the public safety community and accepted as a standard by OASIS. It allows for activation of multiple warning systems with a single input and is replacing SAME codes in EAS for new digitized alert networks. Federal agencies supporting CAP include DHS, the Department of Justice, the National Weather Service, and the U.S. Geological Survey. EAS messages must be delivered in both audio and visual formats as required by the FCC. Regular emergency broadcasts are not subject to this requirement. The community of disabled individuals is often under-served in emergency information dissemination outside the EAS network. Many technologies exist to provide accessible formats for people with special needs, but they are not supported by the current EAS system or are too expensive. FCC rules for the new CMAS for wireless devices require audio and vibration alerts for subscribers with disabilities. Incorporating cost-effective technologies to reach all segments of the population is a challenge for an effective nationwide warning system. Advocates are pushing for interoperability and standardization in all-hazard warning systems to ensure timely and meaningful emergency alerts. In 1999, FEMA and other agencies proposed using NWR as the foundation for a national warning network, with recommendations for a public-private partnership to improve warning systems. In 1999, FEMA and other agencies proposed a public-private partnership to improve warning systems, leading to the creation of the Partnership for Public Warning in 2000. This group worked on standardizing early warning systems and increasing communication channels for alerts. In 2002, they provided recommendations for the Homeland Security Advisory System. The Partnership for Public Warning (PPW) aimed to develop a national vision and goals for improving all-hazard warning systems at federal, state, and local levels. They recommended DHS take the lead in creating a national public warning capability, emphasizing the need for multiple redundant systems with common standards. Despite funding challenges, President George W. Bush issued an executive order in 2006 to establish an effective, reliable, integrated, and comprehensive alert system for the American people. The President outlined functional requirements for the Secretary of Homeland Security to improve the emergency alert system, including evaluating resources, adopting common protocols, delivering alerts, accommodating disabilities, and coordinating with the private sector and government. Other departments and agencies are expected to support the efforts. The Secretary of Homeland Security was directed to ensure a smooth transition to a new warning system as part of the response to the executive order. The WARN Act mandated the creation of a Commercial Mobile Service Alert Advisory Committee by the FCC, which included members from various sectors to provide recommendations for emergency alerts by mobile service providers. The FCC, in consultation with NIST, was tasked with adopting rules for emergency alerts by mobile service providers. Public TV stations' digital capacity will be used for geographically targeted alerts. The WARN Act allowed wireless providers to opt in or out of the alert service, with consumer notification requirements. Recommendations for using cell phone technology for alerts were submitted within the Congress deadline. The FCC, following the WARN Act, reviewed recommendations from the CMSAAC for a Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) within 180 days. Public comments were sought on the proposals, and most recommendations were adopted. Key rules include alert categories (presidential, imminent threat, AMBER), county-wide coverage, and federal agency management of alerts. The FCC is refining rules for CMAS, with the most recent requirements outlined in the Third Report and Order released on August 7, 2008. The NCP Directorate will act as a gateway and aggregator for alerts, and FEMA has adopted CMAS Government Interface Design specifications. Wireless carriers have until April 7, 2012, to provide CMAS alerts through the IPAWS gateway. The IPAWS gateway will provide CMAS alerts to various devices, including cell phones and electronic signs. Messages can be geo-targeted and available in multiple languages. The technology will be managed by the IPAWS server. The FCC prepared a National Broadband Plan (NBP) as required by Congress, focusing on advancing various national purposes including public safety and emergency communications. The plan included recommendations for leveraging broadband technologies to enhance emergency communications with the public, covering areas such as NG9-1-1, Emergency Alert System, first responder networks, cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure protection. The FCC's National Broadband Plan focused on improving the nation's 9-1-1 service and transitioning to NG9-1-1 using IP-based networks. It emphasized the use of broadband for emergency communications, particularly through 4G technologies and customizable emergency alerts. The FCC made recommendations for developing a multiple-platform, redundant next-generation alarm system. The FCC recommended developing a redundant next-generation alarm system and clarifying agency roles for its implementation and maintenance."
