The Emergency Communications and Competition Act of 2002 aims to facilitate the deployment of new wireless telecommunications networks to extend the reach of the Emergency Alert System, ensure priority access for emergency personnel, promote rapid deployment of low-cost services, and ensure universal carriage of local television stations by multichannel video programming distributors. The Emergency Communications and Competition Act of 2002 aims to facilitate the deployment of new wireless telecommunications networks to extend the reach of the Emergency Alert System and ensure priority access for emergency personnel. It also promotes the rapid deployment of low-cost services and universal carriage of local television stations by multichannel video programming distributors. Additionally, it aims to advance the public interest by providing high-speed data and video services to unserved and underserved populations, including schools, libraries, tribal lands, community centers, senior centers, and low-income housing. It also ensures prompt licensing and deployment of new technologies capable of fulfilling these purposes. SEC. 3. LICENSING. The Federal Communications Commission will assign licenses in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band for fixed terrestrial services within six months of the enactment of this Act, following rules for international satellite communications. The Commission may grant licenses after the specified deadline to qualified applicants. Licenses will only be granted if they do not interfere with direct broadcast satellite service. Applications for a license in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band will be accepted if the applicant demonstrates the technology they will use with operational equipment. The Launching Our Communities' Access to Local Television Act of 2000 requires independent testing for terrestrial service technology. Section 1012(a) is amended to include the ability to file applications. Licenses granted under this section cannot be used for Personal Communications Service or terrestrial cellular telephony service. The prompt deployment of service to unserved and underserved areas is essential. To prevent spectrum warehousing, licensees must deploy service to consumers within five years of license grant. Licensees must also disseminate Emergency Alert System warnings and provide immediate access to emergency personnel during activations. Licensees must adhere to rules governing the transmission of emergency data at a higher priority than other data. Additionally, licensees must comply with rules regarding local television station signals and obscenity consistent with the Communications Act of 1934. Licensees must allocate 4 percent of capacity for public interest services like telemedicine, educational programming, high-speed internet access, and specialized local data and video services. The Commission will establish license boundaries for public participation services, conforming to existing television markets. The Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service will be redesignated as the Terrestrial Direct Broadcast Service."
