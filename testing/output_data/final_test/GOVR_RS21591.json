    "content": "Non-elderly, non-disabled, non-working residents of public housing must participate in community service or self-sufficiency activities for eight hours per month to maintain eligibility. Exemptions include those over 62, disabled individuals unable to comply, caretakers of disabled persons, and those engaged in work or welfare programs. HUD data shows 1.86 million individuals living in public housing. According to HUD data, approximately 44% of the 1.86 million individuals in public housing are subject to the community service requirement, which entails eight hours of activities per month. PHAs have discretion in defining eligible activities, such as volunteer work, job training, or college attendance. Tenants cannot replace paid employees, and PHAs must verify each household member's participation. PHAs require households to verify compliance with community service activities annually. Nonexempt family members must submit a signed certification of activities performed over the past year. HUD allows PHAs to permit self-certification, but failure to comply results in the entire household being out of compliance. A \"work-out agreement\" must be signed to make up for any deficits in community service. The PHA requires households to verify compliance with community service activities annually. Noncompliant tenants may file a grievance to dispute the PHA's decision to terminate tenancy. PHAs must develop a local policy for administering the community service and economic self-sufficiency requirements. In 1997, H.R. 2 and S. 462 were introduced to reform HUD's low-income housing programs by consolidating public housing into a block grant program, denying occupancy to drug-related applicants, and requiring community service. The compromise version, Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, was enacted as Title V of the FY1999 VA-HUD appropriations bill. The Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act (QHWRA) was enacted as part of the FY1999 VA-HUD appropriations bill. HUD issued regulations for the community service requirement in March 2000, which took effect in October 2000. A provision in the FY2002 appropriations bill prohibited HUD from enforcing the requirement, but it was reinstated in June 2003. The community service requirement for public housing residents was reinstated in June 2003, following the enactment of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act. This requirement has been controversial, aligning with the welfare reform debates of the same era. Supporters argue that low-income families should earn their benefits through mandatory work policies. Opponents of the public housing community service requirement argue against the forced work mandate, stating it promotes low-wage work and is not truly promoting self-sufficiency. Proponents believe the requirement can help change negative cultures in public housing developments. Critics question the fairness of the public housing community service requirement, arguing it singles out public housing residents. Concerns were raised about the administrative burden and costs of enforcing the requirement, with industry groups deeming it unreasonable for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). Industry groups argue that the public housing community service requirement is burdensome for under-funded Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). Opponents speculate that PHAs may try to exempt many families and broaden eligible activities to avoid costs and administrative burdens. There are differing opinions on whether the requirement complements or duplicates existing work requirements for cash assistance recipients. Controversy surrounds HUD's implementation of the requirement, with exemptions tied to engagement in work activities. HUD's 2003 Notice to PHAs encouraged considering tenants engaged in work activities exempt from the community service requirement if working at least 30 hours per week. While PHAs were encouraged to set a 30-hour standard, it was not mandatory. In 2008, HUD's Inspector General audited the enforcement of the requirement due to reports of low enforcement levels. The audit found that HUD lacked controls to ensure proper administration of the community service requirement, leading to at least 85,000 ineligible households in public housing. In response, HUD issued additional guidance to PHAs in 2009, emphasizing reporting and enforcement measures. A 2015 audit by HUD's Inspector General highlighted ongoing issues with implementation and enforcement of the community service requirement. The audit by HUD's Inspector General found that the agency subsidized housing for 106,000 units occupied by noncompliant tenants out of nearly 550,000 units subject to the community service requirement nationwide, resulting in over $37 million in monthly subsidies. Recommendations included developing a written policy for compliance, training, and improved reporting mechanisms. HUD issued a notice to PHAs in 2015 with guidance on requirements, data collection, actions against noncompliant tenants, and penalties for noncompliance. HUD clarified that tenants receiving SNAP benefits are exempt from the community service requirement, reducing the number of noncompliant families. In 2016, HUD published data on compliance with the requirement. Approximately 44% of the 1.86 million people living in public housing are subject to the community service requirement. Among those, about 68% are exempt, leaving 32% (257,000 residents) who are not exempt. Of this group, 48% are in compliance, 32% are pending verification, and 19% are out of compliance."
