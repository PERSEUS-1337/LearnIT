    "content": "The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act is amended to include a section on the acquisition of projects. The Secretary will acquire the Elwha Project and Glines Project for $29,500,000, with a release from liability for obligations and liabilities to the United States upon title transfer. The United States will not assume liability to Indian tribes. After acquiring the Elwha Project and Glines Project for $29,500,000, the Secretary will remove the Elwha dam to protect the water supply. The United States will not assume liability to any federally recognized Indian tribe without their consent. The Secretary will take actions to improve water treatment and storage facilities after the removal of the dam to ensure water availability for Port Angeles, Dry Creek Water Association, industrial water users, and other Elwha River users. The Secretary will bear the cost of actions taken to mitigate any harm to fisheries and water quality resulting from the removal of the Elwha dam. A 12-year evaluation will assess the impact on fish runs, and compensation for lost revenue will be provided after the acquisition. After acquiring the Projects, the Secretary will pay Clallam County $150,000 per year for 12 years to recover lost revenue, with 50% of each payment dedicated to studying the river system. The Glines Project will be acquired and the Glines Canyon dam will not be removed for 12 years after the Elwha dam removal. The Elwha dam has been removed, and the Secretary may remove the Glines Canyon Project after a 12-year period if the benefit to fisheries and river restoration outweighs the value of power and the lake. An engineering and design study will determine the most cost-effective way to remove transmission lines. The Secretary will evaluate the impact of managing the Glines Canyon Project for fisheries restoration on future hydropower operations and develop a fish enhancement plan with relevant stakeholders. The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act requires the development of a comprehensive fish enhancement plan involving stakeholders like the Marine Fisheries Service and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. The plan must not interfere with existing power generation commitments or the Secretary's authority to remove the Glines Canyon Project within a specified timeframe. Amendments to the Act are also made to ensure compliance with these requirements. In section 4, subsection (a) requires the Secretary to implement necessary actions effective 60 days after the conveyance of the Projects. This includes the removal of the Elwha dam. Subsection (b) also removes references to section 3(c)(2). In section 4, subsection (a) requires the Secretary to implement necessary actions effective 60 days after the conveyance of the Projects, including the removal of the Elwha dam. Sections 5, 6, and 7 detail the specific changes to be made, such as removing references to section 3(c)(2) and specifying the removal of the dams in the Elwha Project. SEC. 2. COLUMBIA-SNAKE RIVER HYDROELECTRIC SYSTEM PROTECTION. The text chunk discusses restrictions on actions that could impair flood control facilities in the Columbia-Snake River basin or reduce the capability of the Federal Columbia River Power System without specific authorization by an Act of Congress. The text chunk outlines restrictions on reducing the power and energy generating capability of dams on the Columbia or Snake Rivers, as well as lowering the reservoir levels, except for flood control or maintenance purposes. The text chunk prohibits actions that would impair the Columbia-Snake River inland navigation system, restrict state water rights, or require the release of stored water from any water storage project above River Mile 106 without congressional authorization. The text chunk prohibits reducing the minimum navigation channel depth and lock sill clearance above Columbia River mile 106 without congressional authorization. Judicial review is limited in issuing equitable relief for dam or lock operations in the Columbia-Snake River basin. The exclusive competence of Congress is required for decisions on dam or lock operation, removal, breach, or modification. Civil action can be taken within 90 days to enjoin violations, with exclusive venue for such actions. Exclusive venue for civil action to enjoin violations of this section is the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The Court can stay implementation of agency action without bond or security upon motion by any party."
