    "title": "AB 1975",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature acknowledges progress in DUI awareness and prevention but notes an increase in alcohol-related crash fatalities in California. More action is needed to address repeat DUI offenders. To improve public safety and health outcomes, additional screening and assessment of repeat DUI offenders and first-time offenders with high blood alcohol content is necessary to identify alcohol dependence issues. Using ASAM criteria would help address alcohol abuse, promote referrals to necessary treatment, and reduce fatalities and injuries on public roads. In 2007, NHTSA assessed California's impaired-driving program, identifying key issues and making recommendations for improvement, including screening all DUI defendants for addiction and chemical dependency treatment needs. California and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services require the use of the ASAM tool in treatment settings, including with the Drug Medi-Cal population. Section 11837 of the Health and Safety Code is being amended to reflect this requirement. Section 11837 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require participation in a licensed driving-under-the-influence program for 18 months after a conviction for driving under the influence. The court may consider relevant information from a presentence investigation when deciding whether to refer a person to an alcohol and drug education program. Information cannot be provided by someone with a direct interest in a privately operated program. The court must also obtain the person's driving record from the Department of Motor Vehicles to determine eligibility. The probation department may recommend placing a defendant in a treatment program involving nonscheduled nonaddicting medications for alcohol or substance abuse. The defendant must obtain a prescription and medical suitability finding from their physician before the court considers this option. The court must refer first-time offenders with a blood alcohol concentration below 0.20% to a licensed program for at least three months as a condition of probation. The program includes 30 hours of activities such as education, group counseling, and individual interviews. The court must order first-time offenders with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.20% or more to participate in a licensed program for at least nine months, consisting of 60 hours of program activities including education, group counseling, and individual interviews. The State Department of Health Care Services may specify the required activities for participants in the treatment program. The court may refer individuals to a licensed program for treatment services as a condition of probation, even if their driving privileges are restricted, suspended, or revoked. Programs may include treatment for family members with their consent, without increasing costs to the convicted person. The court orders the administration of ASAM criteria for certain offenders with high blood alcohol levels or those in specific vehicle code programs as a condition of probation. The assessment entity must inform individuals of their assessment results. The court orders ASAM criteria assessment for offenders with high blood alcohol levels or in specific vehicle code programs as probation condition. Consult physician for assessment results, referral to treatment if necessary, and FDA-approved medications for alcohol dependence. Assessment aims to help individuals recognize chemical dependency and aid in recovery. Legislation is proposed to require ASAM assessments for repeat DUI offenders with high blood alcohol levels to determine treatment needs and provide additional services like counseling and medication-assisted treatment for alcohol abuse."
