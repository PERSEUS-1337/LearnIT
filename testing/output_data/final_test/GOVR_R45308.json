    "content": "The JOBS and Investor Confidence Act (S. 488) is a capital markets package with 32 titles that have bipartisan support. Originally known as the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, it was passed by the Senate in 2017 and later incorporated into Section 507 of S. 2155. The House passed a substitute amendment to S. 488 in 2018, referred to as JOBS Act 3.0. The JOBS Act 2.0, part of the Surface Transportation Act, is a response to the financial crisis of 2007-2008. It follows previous regulatory acts like the Dodd-Frank Act and includes proposals like the Financial CHOICE Act and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. The financial reform bill, P.L. 115-174, was passed by the Senate in March 2018 and signed into law in May 2018. S. 488, a capital markets package, includes provisions not in P.L. 115-174 and addresses various topics like insurance and human trafficking financing. It focuses on smaller companies' access to capital and includes recommendations for regulatory action. The report summarizes the 18 capital markets provisions in S. 488, focusing on investor access, compliance costs, financial intermediation, and investor protection under SEC oversight. Proposed changes include expanding access through SEC registration threshold amendments and promoting financial intermediation through pooled investment vehicles. The report focuses on capital markets provisions in S. 488, emphasizing investor access, compliance costs, financial intermediation, and investor protection under SEC oversight. It includes expanding access through SEC registration threshold amendments, promoting financial intermediation through pooled investment vehicles, and distinguishing between public and private securities offerings for investor protection. The S. 488 provisions aim to expand capital access by widening the accredited investor definition and allowing broader outreach to eligible investors for private offerings. Title I proposes exempting promotional events like demo days from general solicitation rules under certain conditions, providing prospective corporate issuers with a platform to market their private offerings. Demo days, also known as venture fairs or pitch days, are events sponsored by angel investors, venture capital associations, nonprofits, or universities to attract investor financing. Rule 506 of Regulation D allows companies to offer privately placed equity or debt securities to accredited investors without the need for state and federal securities registration. These offerings, popular with emerging companies, have no size limits but were previously restricted from general promotion or advertising. The JOBS Act amended Rule 506 to allow for general solicitations to accredited investors under Rule 506(c) with verification steps. The SEC's 2015 guidance clarified that issuers can use Rule 506(c) for demo days if they verify investor status and limit offerings to accredited investors. Title I of the JOBS Act addresses concerns regarding the applicability of the general solicitation ban at demo days by requiring the SEC to clarify that the ban does not apply to presentations or events sponsored by certain organizations. This aims to alleviate worries about the accredited investor verification process discouraging investor interest at demo days. The SEC is considering broadening the definition of accredited investors to include more individuals with technical expertise. This would allow accredited investors to participate in investment opportunities not available to non-accredited investors, such as investments in private companies and offerings by hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds. The cost of implementing this change is estimated to be less than $1 million. The SEC's current definition of an accredited investor includes individuals with high income and net worth, as well as certain institutions with significant assets. Critics argue that this definition implies that higher net worth equals investing sophistication. The current definition of an accredited investor has faced criticism for equating higher net worth with investing sophistication. Concerns have been raised about the sufficiency of the definition in protecting investors, especially for those relying on their net worth for financial security. Inflation adjustments could have significant long-term effects, as the current thresholds are not adjusted. Proposed amendments would include nonaccredited investors with financial education and experience. The provision in Title X of the bill would adjust income and net worth limits for inflation every five years and expand the accredited investor definition to include those with qualifying license, education, or experience. Family offices and family clients would be considered accredited investors. The bill also includes Title XI, which focuses on incorporating rural small businesses into the mission of the SEC Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation. According to the Economic Innovation Group (EIG), there has been a significant increase in new firm formations in U.S. metropolitan areas, while startup numbers in nonmetropolitan areas, or rural areas, have decreased. Observers are considering incorporating a rural focus into the SEC's Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation to address the challenges facing small rural enterprises. Title XI of the bill aims to broaden the office's focus to include rural small businesses and require annual reports to highlight the obstacles these businesses face. The cost of implementing bill H.R. 4821 for small rural enterprises is estimated to be less than $500,000. Compliance costs for small and medium-sized companies to go public are debated to outweigh the benefits, including external auditing, legal fees, and financial reporting fees. Public companies in 2011 faced initial regulatory compliance costs of around $2.5 million. In 2011, public companies faced initial regulatory compliance costs of around $2.5 million and annual ongoing costs of $1.5 million. Certain provisions in S. 488 aim to reduce compliance costs for publicly listed companies, particularly for those transitioning out of Emerging Growth Company (EGC) status. The JOBS Act aims to stimulate corporate capital formation and increase the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) by creating EGCs entitled to regulatory relief. EGCs, created under the JOBS Act in 2012, provide regulatory relief to companies with less than $1.07 billion in gross revenues. This relief includes exemptions related to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, specifically Sections 404(a) and 404(b), aimed at reducing financial fraud. EGCs lose their status after five years, ending the regulatory benefits. Title V of the legislation would amend the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to provide an additional five-year exemption from Section 404(b) for Emerging Growth Companies (EGCs) with certain revenue and public float criteria. This exemption is crucial for EGCs, many of which are biotechnology firms, as the cost of compliance with Section 404(b) can be significant and divert capital from research and development efforts. The extension of this exemption is seen as a critical protection for EGCs against these expenses. The SEC's 2011 staff study recommended against extending the Section 404(b) exemption to firms with market valuation between $75 million and $250 million, citing improved reliability of internal control disclosures and financial reporting. The Dodd-Frank Act exempts firms with public floats of less than $75 million from Section 404(b). Implementation of H.R. 1645 is estimated to have no significant effect on the SEC's costs. Title IX would allow all IPO issuers to test-the-waters and conduct confidential reviews during the registration process. Title IX of the JOBS Act established streamlined compliance options for emerging growth companies (EGCs) to reduce barriers for smaller companies accessing public offerings. Two key EGC benefits are test-the-waters and confidential review, previously only available to EGC status companies. The SEC expanded the EGC confidential review benefit to all companies on July 10, 2017. Some have proposed extending certain EGC benefits to other IPOs in response to declining IPOs over the past two decades. The SEC expanded the EGC confidential review benefit to all companies on July 10, 2017. CBO estimates that implementing a similar bill (H.R. 3903) would cost the SEC less than $500,000. Title XXII would direct the SEC to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of Form 10-Q within 180 days of the act's enactment. Publicly traded companies must provide ongoing disclosures through various reports. The curr_chunk provides information on unaudited quarterly financial statements, risk factors, sales of securities, and use of proceeds. Some in Congress are concerned about disclosure-related costs to issuers, especially smaller ones. Proponents argue that quarterly reporting is a distraction to companies' longer-term strategies, while opponents are concerned about its impact on financial transparency and investor protection. The President has requested the SEC to study shifting from quarterly to semi-annual reporting. CBO estimates that implementing a similar bill would cost the SEC around $2 million. Title XXXI would require the SEC to study costs associated with small and medium-sized companies when they undertake an IPO. Companies seeking to do an IPO contract with an underwriter to assist in preparation, determine capital raised, conduct promotional activities, and provide post-IPO support. Underwriters receive a \"gross spread\" as compensation, typically around 7% for middle-market firm IPOs. This cost has remained largely unchanged since the 1990s. The cost of underwriters for middle-market firm IPOs is typically around 7%, which has remained unchanged since the 1990s. Title XXXI aims to study cost differences between mid-market and large IPOs, with potential SEC implementation estimated to cost about $1 million. The financial intermediaries, such as brokers and investment companies, play a crucial role in channeling funding between investors and company issuers. Over the past 70 years, there has been a shift towards delegated fund management firms for investment activities. S. 488 promotes the use of pooled investment vehicles like mutual funds and private equity funds. Small company stock trading is considered less efficient than trading in larger companies. The trading of small company stocks is less efficient than larger companies' stocks, with less research coverage, market quality, and liquidity. S. 488 provisions aim to address these challenges by promoting investment research of small issuers, creating a venture exchange for smaller issuer stock trading, and removing registration requirements for M&A brokers facilitating sales of small and medium-sized firms. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 defines brokers and dealers in securities transactions. Being a registered M&A broker can be costly compared to unregistered brokers. There has been uncertainty over whether M&A brokers meet the definition of a broker under the Act. Some argue that broker-dealer regulations were meant to prevent certain tactics and roles no longer relevant. In 1985, the Supreme Court ruled that selling a firm or a controlling interest in it constitutes a securities transaction. The SEC issued a no-action letter in January 2014 regarding unregistered broker liability, stating that certain intermediaries facilitating securities transactions would not face enforcement actions under certain conditions. Title III of the Securities Exchange Act would exempt merger-and-acquisition brokers facilitating ownership transfers of privately held companies under certain conditions. Brokers cannot handle funds, engage in public offerings, work with shell companies, provide financing, or have a history as a \"bad actor.\" Stakeholders responded favorably to the letter regarding intermediary involvement in securities transactions. Title VIII of the Securities Exchange Act aims to clarify the oversight of national exchanges' expanded business lines by directing the SEC to define securities exchange facilities within 360 days of enactment. The provision addresses brokers involved in ownership transfers, prohibiting handling of funds, public offerings, working with shell companies, providing financing, or being a \"bad actor.\" The estimated cost of implementing a similar bill is less than $500,000. Title VIII of the Securities Exchange Act clarifies the regulation of national exchanges' business lines, including the creation of venture exchanges for smaller companies. The SEC oversees 21 national securities exchanges, and implementing a similar bill would cost around $1 million. Venture exchanges would only trade venture securities of early stage growth companies, emerging growth companies, and other specified issuers. The SEC is considering the establishment of venture exchanges for smaller and emerging companies to address liquidity challenges. These exchanges would conduct auctions instead of continuous trading and have specific disclosure standards. The idea was first proposed in 2013 to create a separate equity market with different regulatory requirements for smaller issuers. The SEC is exploring the creation of venture exchanges for smaller companies to improve liquidity. A bill (H.R. 5877) estimates a $1 million annual cost for the SEC, offset by fee collections. Title XXIV mandates a study on investment research coverage for small issuers, with results due within 180 days of enactment. Low research coverage can lead to lower stock liquidity. The SEC is considering venture exchanges for smaller companies to boost liquidity. A bill (H.R. 6139) would cost the SEC $1 million for a study on investment research coverage for small firms. This could lead to improved stock liquidity and price performance for companies with low research coverage. The Dodd-Frank Act exempts advisers to venture capital funds from registering with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. A venture capital fund manages investor assets by acquiring private equity stakes in startup and small to medium-sized firms. The SEC defines a VC fund as an entity pursuing a venture capital strategy with no more than 20% of its assets. VC funds are exempt from SEC registration under the Dodd-Frank Act if they adhere to a venture capital strategy with no more than 20% of assets in non-qualifying investments. Concerns arise as funds approach the 20% limit, leading to potential registration as nonexempt private fund advisers under the Investment Adviser Act. Advocates, including the National Venture Capital Association, argue that the 20% limit on secondary market equity causes funds to miss out on investment opportunities. Title XXV proposes SEC rules to expand a VC fund's potential portfolio by including primary or secondary market equity securities. Critics, like the Consumer Federation of America, are concerned about the impact of this change. The Consumer Federation of America is concerned that allowing expanded VC fund investment in secondary market shares would shift activity away from direct primary investments in startup firms. The legislation would direct the SEC to study the 10% threshold limitation for \"diversified company\" qualification under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This provision would require funds to disclose whether they are diversified or not. The legislation directs the SEC to study the 10% threshold limitation for \"diversified company\" qualification under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Some argue that this threshold could hinder funds from investing in small-cap companies, while others believe that investment companies would not likely take large positions in portfolio companies anyway. Implementing a similar bill would cost the SEC around $1 million. Title XXXII proposes allowing special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to invest in crowdfunding offerings by pooling money into a fund advised by a registered investment advisor. It aims to clarify existing crowdfunding regulations by defining terms like crowdfunding vehicle and crowdfunding vehicle adviser, and making amendments to SEC registration exemption requirements. The provision outlines criteria for a crowdfunding vehicle, including limited purposes, issuing only one class of securities, no compensation for activities, co-issuer status, meeting disclosure obligations, and using an investment adviser. The provision in Title XXXII allows special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to invest in crowdfunding offerings by pooling money into a fund advised by a registered investment advisor. It modifies crowdfunding transaction exemptions from SEC registration requirements, changing the issuer registration threshold to a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million. The use of Regulation Crowdfunding may increase with these modifications to the SEC's treatment of SPVs. The concept of using a SPV for crowdfunding involves pooling money from multiple investors into a single entity, with the SPV organizer acting as the main point of contact. This method aims to expand financial intermediation and promote capital access, while also addressing investor protection concerns through required adviser registration. The provision in question is similar to previous bills from past Congresses, with potential effects on the SEC's costs and operations. The policy debate surrounding capital markets often centers on balancing capital formation and investor protection, both key missions of the SEC. Capital formation allows for increased investment opportunities and funding for businesses, but it also presents challenges in investor protection. Reduced regulations can speed up capital formation but may expose investors to more risks. Investor protection is crucial for healthy and efficient capital markets, as it builds trust and confidence among investors. Multiple titles in S. 488 aim to create investor protection measures. Title XX of S. 488 aims to facilitate trading activities while directing the SEC to issue disclosure requirements to help investors understand investment products and risks. Titles XXVII and XXIX provide protection to general investors against corporate insiders, while Title XXX offers targeted protection to senior investors facing financial exploitation. Title XXVII also directs the SEC to study whether Rule 10b5-1 should be amended. The SEC is directed to study whether Rule 10b5-1 should be amended to address concerns about insider trading by corporate executives receiving compensation in the form of company stock or stock options. Rule 10b5-1 allows executives to make prearranged trades without insider information, but studies suggest it may have been abused, leading to abnormal returns for insiders. Title XXIX of bill H.R. 6320 aims to amend federal securities law to require public companies with multi-class shares to disclose stock holdings of corporate officials. Voting rights of common equity shares allow shareholders to vote on corporate policies and board elections. The SEC estimates the cost of implementing the bill to be around $1 million. The issuance of multi-class common equity shares involves one share class with limited voting power offered to the public and another with more voting power held by founders or executives, giving them majority control. In the 1980s, major stock exchanges relaxed listing restrictions on multi-class stock, leading to increased adoption. Companies like Google and Facebook have shown renewed interest in multi-class shares. The SEC Investor Advisory Committee makes policy recommendations related to investor interests. The SEC Investor Advisory Committee criticized multi-class share structures for giving corporate insiders more voting power than their ownership interest. They recommended clear disclosure of the relationship between stock ownership and voting rights. Concerns over multi-class shares undermining corporate governance have been raised by the Council of Investors. Despite criticism, multi-class shares may benefit by preventing investors from pressuring management for short-term gains over long-term growth. Title XXIX of the bill would require the SEC to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for issuers with multi-class share structures to report data on corporate executives and holders of over 5% of voting power. Title XXX would establish a Senior Investor Taskforce to address challenges and regulatory solutions for investors over 65, reporting every two years on related trends and best practices. The Senior Investor Taskforce, established under Title XXX of the bill, aims to address financial exploitation of senior citizens aged 65 and over. With this population projected to reach 18% of the U.S. population by 2030, the taskforce would focus on regulatory solutions and report on trends and best practices every two years. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) would also study financial exploitation of seniors and issue a report within one year of the act's enactment. Financial scams and abuses are a growing concern, with over 6.8 million senior citizens falling victim to exploitation, and cases being vastly underreported. The SEC would incur an estimated cost of $7 million to implement a similar bill. The CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 6323 would cost the SEC $7 million over 2019-2023 and less than $500,000 for GAO. Several provisions in S. 488 were included in H.R. 10 and stand-alone legislation."
