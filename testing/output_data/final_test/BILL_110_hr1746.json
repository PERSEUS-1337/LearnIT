    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Holocaust Insurance Accountability Act of 2007\". Congress acknowledges the Holocaust as one of the most heinous crimes in history, where millions suffered and millions of Jews were murdered. Many Holocaust survivors or heirs faced rejection from insurance companies post-WWII due to lack of documentation. Holocaust survivors and heirs have struggled for years to convince insurance companies to settle unpaid insurance claims. In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) was established to address the issue of unpaid insurance policies issued to Holocaust victims. Between 1998 and December 31, 2003, the ICHEIC resolved Holocaust-era insurance policies issued by German and Austrian companies for Jewish policy holders from Eastern Europe. The ICHEIC, which resolved Holocaust-era insurance policies for Jewish policy holders from Eastern Europe, is set to close in 2007 without disclosing thousands of names of policies sold to Jewish residents before World War II. Companies are still withholding names of owners and beneficiaries of insurance policies, with experts estimating the value of unpaid insurance theft from European Jewry during the Holocaust and its aftermath to be between $17 billion and $200 billion. Claims paid in recognition of victims have been reported as of February 2007. As of 2007, the ICHEIC had paid approximately $250 million in claims to Holocaust victims, with less than 5 percent of policies sold to Jews before World War II being settled. The organization had not provided the State Department with required information, as mandated by the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. The Supreme Court ruled in American Insurance Association, Inc. v. Garamendi that executive actions are subject to the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution. In the Garamendi case, the Supreme Court found that Congress had not addressed disclosure and restitution of Holocaust victims' insurance policies, preempting State laws on the matter. Survivors' suits against Assicurazioni Generali, S.p.A. were dismissed despite no executive agreement between the US and Italy. Congress believes US courts should handle these cases. Congress believes that US courts have jurisdiction to entertain actions by Holocaust victims and heirs to recover insurance proceeds sold before the Holocaust. This Act expresses Congress's intent to legislate regarding the rights of Holocaust survivors and heirs to obtain information from insurers and bring actions in US courts to recover unpaid funds from entities involved in the theft of family insurance assets. The ICHEIC did not adequately investigate or pursue restitution efforts. The ICHEIC did not make sufficient effort to investigate or obtain restitution for various forms of insurance benefits improperly withheld from Holocaust victims, including property and casualty insurance, disability insurance, health insurance, transport insurance, and marine insurance. The ICHEIC also failed to investigate the records of reinsurers who provided coverage for Jews' policies before World War II, despite evidence of their significant role in the theft of family assets. In 2006, disclosures about the Nazi archives at Bad Arolsen, Germany, revealed limited access for Holocaust survivors and families of victims. The necessity of opening all archival sources for Holocaust victims and their families has been emphasized since 1955. Insurance payments should be expedited to ensure justice for victims. States should collect Holocaust-era insurance information from insurance companies. Thousands of survivors worldwide, including in the US, live in poverty and struggle to meet basic needs. This Act aims to provide compensation for survivors, heirs, and beneficiaries. Holocaust victims and their families should be able to recover claims from insurance policies, penalize insurers for fraudulent practices, and have access to US courts for a reasonable number of years after the Act's enactment. Holocaust victims and their families should have the ability to recover insurance claims, penalize insurers for fraud, and access US courts for a set number of years after the Act's enactment, regardless of other statutes of limitation. The Holocaust Insurance Registry, established under the Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act of 2007, will collect and make accessible records related to insurance claims for Holocaust victims. The Archivist will maintain the registry and ensure public access to the records through various means, including the Internet. The Holocaust Insurance Registry, established under the Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act of 2007, aims to collect information on covered policies from European countries' archives. The Secretary of State will seek agreements with these countries to provide this information. Additionally, insurers are required to disclose Holocaust-era policies. Insurers must disclose Holocaust-era policies by providing specific information to the Secretary of Commerce in an electronic format within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Commerce will then promptly share this information with the Archivist of the United States. Penalties are in place for non-compliance. The Secretary of Commerce will impose a civil penalty of at least $5,000 per day for insurers failing to comply with the disclosure requirements. The penalties collected may be used by the Archivist of the United States to maintain the Holocaust Insurance Registry. SEC. 8. NOTIFICATION.\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce will notify each State's insurance commissioner of insurers failing to comply with section 4 requirements or civil penalties under section 6. Upon request, the Secretary will inform the commissioner of an insurer's compliance status.\n\nSEC. 9. STATE HOLOCAUST INSURANCE STATUTES. SEC. 9. STATE HOLOCAUST INSURANCE STATUTES. This section addresses preemption of State laws regarding insurer disclosure and claimant rights. It also mentions that legal fees should be borne by each party if litigation is dismissed due to reliance on this Act. There exists a Federal cause of action for claims related to a covered policy against insurers or related companies. This action can be pursued in addition to State or international law causes of action. The claim can be brought by the policy purchaser, beneficiary, heir, or assignee. Damages in such actions shall be at least three times the claim amount in US dollars as of December 31, 1938. The district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions related to covered policies, with provisions for attorneys' fees and costs for successful claimants. Personal jurisdiction rules may differ from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Act allows for jurisdiction over defendants in civil actions related to covered policies, regardless of residency, and permits service of process in any manner consistent with the Constitution. It applies retroactively to claims related to covered policies, including those previously dismissed on grounds of executive preemption. The Act allows jurisdiction over defendants in civil actions related to covered policies, regardless of residency, and permits service of process in any manner consistent with the Constitution.
