    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Congo Basin Forest Partnership Act of 2004\". The Congo Basin forests in Central Africa are second in size only to the Amazon Basin and are crucial for the region's economy. These forests play a vital role in environmental sustainability by absorbing carbon dioxide, cleansing water, and supporting diverse plant and animal species, including endangered ones like the lowland gorilla and chimpanzee. Logging operations in the Congo Basin are rapidly shrinking the forests due to global demand for tropical hardwoods. This is leading to intense hunting pressure on wildlife, with many species at risk of extinction. If deforestation and wildlife depletion continue at current rates, the economic and environmental consequences will be immense. The United States has a vested interest in promoting political stability and economic development in the Congo Basin countries to prevent the adverse impacts of deforestation and wildlife depletion. Poorly managed logging and hunting pose a threat to the region, leading to \"empty forests\" and potential environmental devastation. Efforts to conserve the Congo Basin forests include the Yaounde Forest Summit in 1999 and the Congo Basin Forest Partnership launched by Secretary of State Colin Powell in 2002. The United States contributes to the Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP) by focusing on conserving 11 key landscapes in 6 countries, identified as biologically important. Field-based activities will be funded within 25,000,000 acres to support a network of 27 national. The CBFP aims to conserve 25,000,000 acres in the Congo Basin, supporting national parks, protected areas, and forestry concessions. The initiative has international financial support and Gabon has recently created 13 national parks, representing over 10% of its surface area. The CBFP aims to conserve 25,000,000 acres in the Congo Basin, with Gabon recently creating 13 national parks, covering over 10% of its surface area. This initiative has generated unprecedented momentum for forest conservation in the region. Authorization of Appropriations: $18,600,000 is authorized for the Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP) program in fiscal year 2004. $16,000,000 is allocated to the Central Africa Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE) of the United States Agency for International Development. Amounts appropriated are available until expended."
