    "content": "Congressional interest in small business access to capital has grown due to concerns about limited access to funding for small businesses. Some argue for additional government resources to help small businesses, as financial institutions have tightened lending standards in response to economic conditions. They believe it is difficult for many small businesses, even those with good credit, to access the capital needed for expansion. Others are concerned about the long-term economic impact of increasing the federal deficit through spending programs. During the 111th Congress, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 provided additional funding and authorized pilot programs to help small businesses access capital. It also established a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund and a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative to encourage lending to small businesses. The State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) program was limited to seven years from enactment in 2010, with Treasury's role in administering the program ending in 2017. The program provided funding to states to expand or create small business investment programs. States received initial funding in FY2011, with over $366 million transferred, and an additional $859 million was anticipated for FY2012. In FY2012, Treasury transferred less SSBCI funding to states than in FY2011. Funding amounts transferred in subsequent years were $364 million in FY2013, $229 million in FY2014, $216 million in FY2015, and $50 million in FY2016. As of December 31, 2016, $1.43 billion had been disbursed to states out of $1.45 billion available. All 57 participants had received their first tranche, 56 had received their second tranche, and 53 had received their third tranche. States were expected to leverage their funds for new small business lending. SSBCI participants have leveraged $8.95 in new financing for every $1 in SSBCI funds. There are 57 participants including states, territories, and municipalities. Advocates believe SBLF and SSBCI will boost economic growth and job creation by improving small business access to capital. Opponents argue that these programs do not address the core issue of stimulating demand for credit by small businesses. The SSBCI program aims to stimulate job creation and economic growth through small business tax reductions. States have utilized 88% of the available $1.45 billion, showing some impact on small business lending. However, the program's influence on lending remains uncertain. For more details on different approaches to stimulate job creation and economic growth, refer to CRS Report R40985 and CRS Report R42045. The SSBCI's impact on small business lending is challenging to differentiate from other factors due to the small amount of financing relative to the national market. Treasury reported that $1.5 billion in funds supported over 21,000 loans and investments, benefiting small businesses with 10 or fewer employees and helping create or retain 240,669 jobs. The Obama Administration recommended an additional $1.5 billion round in its budget requests. The Obama Administration recommended an additional $1.5 billion round of funding in its budget requests for the SSBCI. Legislation with similar provisions was introduced in multiple Congress sessions. This report examines the Small Business Access to Capital Act and the SSBCI implementation, including audits by the GAO and OIG. The audits found states generally met requirements but identified compliance issues and suggested improvements in Treasury's oversight and the need for performance measures. President Obama proposed legislative enhancements to improve small business access to capital in response to financing challenges faced by small business owners. Several legislative proposals were introduced to enhance small business access to capital, including the establishment of a $30 billion SBLF. The Obama Administration sent draft legislation to Congress for the SBLF and SSBCI. Representative Gary Peters introduced the State Small Business Credit Initiative Act of 2010, authorizing a $2 billion SSBCI. Representative Barney Frank introduced the Small Business Lending Fund Act of 2010, creating a $30 billion SBLF to encourage lending to small businesses through eligible community banks. On May 18, 2010, the Committee on Financial Services approved H.R. 5297, including a $2 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative Act. Advocates argued that small businesses were struggling to access loans, leading to the need for these programs to promote economic growth and job creation. House Committee Republicans opposed the legislation. House Committee Republicans opposed H.R. 5297, stating it would not help small businesses or create jobs, adding to the national debt. They suggested extending small business tax credits instead of taxpayer-funded bailouts. The House passed H.R. 5297, which included tax incentives for small businesses and a proposed $1 billion Small Business Early-Stage Investment Program. The bill also incorporated H.R. 5486 and was retitled the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010. The House-passed version of H.R. 5297 included tax incentives for small businesses, a proposed $1 billion Small Business Early-Stage Investment Program, H.R. 5486, $30 billion SBLF, and $2 billion SSBCI. Arguments for and against the bill's passage were presented during House floor debate, with advocates citing increased small business lending and job creation, while opponents criticized the bill for repeating failed initiatives and not addressing the lack of sales and demand facing small businesses. The Senate passed an amended version of the bill after a series of votes and the August recess. The Senate passed an amended version of the bill (S.Amdt. 4594) on September 16, 2010, by a vote of 61-38, with funding for the SSBCI at $1.5 billion. The House passed the bill on September 23, 2010, by a vote of 237-187, and it was signed into law as the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-240) on September 27, 2010 by President Obama. Arguments during Senate debate focused on the SSBCI's support of state loan collateral programs. The SSBCI provided funding for state small business investment programs, including capital access programs, loan participation programs, loan guarantee programs, collateral support programs, and venture capital programs. These programs aimed to help small businesses obtain credit and expand their operations. Under the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI), lenders and borrowers contribute a percentage of the loan into a reserve fund, typically ranging from 3% to 4%. The state matches this contribution, reducing the lender's risk and encouraging lending to small businesses. Approved state Capital Access Programs (CAPs) are eligible for federal funding based on insurance premiums paid by the borrower and lender. Loan terms are negotiated between the lender and borrower. States may use SSBCI funding to make contributions to the lender-held reserve fund on a loan-by-loan basis. SSBCI state CAP loans can be used for various business purposes, with a maximum loan amount of $5 million and a requirement of 500 employees or fewer. State loan participation programs provide medium to long-term financing options for small businesses. State loan participation programs can be structured in two ways: by purchasing a portion of a loan originated by a lender or by participating in the loan as a co-lender. This encourages lending to small businesses by allowing the lender to share the risk of loan losses with the state. Interest rates, maturity, collateral, and other loan terms are negotiated between the lender and borrower, with the state possibly approving the terms for purchase transactions. State loan participation programs allow states and lenders to negotiate loan terms for companion loans, including interest rates, maturity, collateral, and other terms. These programs target small businesses with 500 employees or fewer, with an average loan amount of $5 million or less. State loan guarantee programs provide security for lenders to approve term loans or lines of credit for small businesses. The guarantee percentage is determined by states and lenders, but cannot exceed certain limits under the SSBCI. Under the SSBCI, guarantee percentage is determined by states and lenders, capped at 80% of loan losses. Origination and annual utilization fees vary by state, ranging from 0% to 3% of the loan amount. States set limits on lender-originated loans, maintain cash reserves for potential losses, and negotiate loan terms with borrowers. Loans in SSBCI state programs can be used for various business purposes, subject to restrictions. Loan terms are typically negotiated between the lender and borrower, with some requiring state approval. State loan guarantee programs under the SSBCI target borrowers with 500 employees or fewer and loans of $5 million or less, with no single loan exceeding $20 million. State collateral support programs provide pledged collateral accounts to lenders to enhance loan coverage, with lenders required to have 20% of their capital at risk. Interest rates, maturity, collateral, and loan terms are negotiated between the lender and borrower, with the state and lender determining the amount of cash collateral to be pledged. State collateral support is rarely provided for more than 50% of the loan value. State collateral support programs under the SSBCI target businesses with 500 employees or fewer, offering up to 50% of the loan value as collateral. State venture capital programs provide investment capital for start-up and early-stage businesses through state-run funds or fund of funds managed by professional firms. The average loan amount is $5 million or less, with no single loan exceeding $20 million. State venture capital programs typically outsource fund management to professional firms. Investments include equity and hybrid investments like preferred equity and subordinated debt. The standard life of state venture capital funds is 12 years, with individual investments lasting 3 to 7 years. SSBCI state venture capital program investments can be used for most business purposes, targeting businesses with 500 employees or fewer and avoiding those with over 750 employees. The average investment is $5 million or less, with a maximum single investment of $20 million. P.L. 111-240 allocated $1.5 billion to the SSBCI program for administering costs. The SSBCI program allocated $1.5 billion for administering costs to eligible states, territories, and municipalities. They were required to file a notice of intent by November 26, 2010, and submit an application by June 27, 2011. Municipalities could apply if their state did not participate in the program. Municipalities could apply for funding up to their state's SSBCI allotment based on population share. Applications required details on fund usage and expected impact on small business lending. The funding targets small businesses with 500 employees or fewer, does not support borrowers with more than 750 employees, and aims to provide new small business lending at least 10 times the amount of the SSBCI federal contribution. Documentation on management team skills, internal control systems, and planned fund usage for capital access in underserved communities is required. The SSBCI funding formula considered job numbers and losses nationally and in each state. Each state was guaranteed a minimum allotment of 0.9% of funding. Funding was provided in three installments, with the first tranche given immediately. The SSBCI funding formula allocated funds to states based on job numbers and losses. States received funding in three installments, with the first tranche provided immediately after signing the Allocation Agreement. States had to meet program requirements and certify expenditure of previous funds to receive subsequent tranches. Treasury could recoup misused funds and terminate undispersed allotments. All SSBCI allocation agreements expired on March 31, 2017. By June 27, 2011, 48 states and territories had signed agreements. By the June 27, 2011 deadline, 48 states and territories had applied for SSBCI funding totaling $1.4 billion. North Dakota and Wyoming did not apply, and Alaska later withdrew its application. Five municipalities requested $39.5 million in funding, with allocations made to Anchorage, Laramie, Mandan, and Carrington. See Table 1 for funding awarded to each state/territory. States received varying amounts of SSBCI funding, with California receiving the largest allotment ($167.75 million) and American Samoa receiving the smallest allotment ($10.5 million). Funding is used to support different small business investment programs, including capital access, loan participation, loan guarantee, collateral support, and venture capital programs. The majority of funds have been allocated to loan participation and venture capital programs. By December 31, 2016, all 57 participants had received their first tranche of funding. By December 31, 2016, all 57 participants had received their first tranche of funding, with 56 receiving the second tranche and 53 receiving the third tranche. States could use a percentage of the tranches for administrative expenses and had reporting requirements to submit quarterly and annual reports to Treasury. The Government Reports Elimination Act of 2014 eliminated the requirement for GAO to perform an annual audit of the SSBCI program. Treasury's OIG conducted audits and investigations into the use of SSBCI funds, releasing evaluation reports and audits of various states' use of the funds. The GAO released annual audits of the SSBCI program for multiple states, noting Treasury's efforts in establishing the application process and distributing funds quickly. Participants reported that many of their investment programs were new, indicating limited prior experience in operating such programs. Treasury issued policy guidelines and application materials via its website. Treasury issued initial policy guidelines and application materials in December 2010, distributing funds to two states in January 2011. Revised guidelines were released in April 2011, with 37 states submitting applications in June 2011. Some states delayed submissions awaiting final guidance. Despite some states postponing their applications, the GAO found that Treasury officials were helpful in providing guidance and answers during the application process. Treasury finalized disbursement procedures for SSBCI funds in November 2011, with no state having expended 80% of its initial disbursement at that time. However, states were potentially delayed in receiving their remaining funding while Treasury finalized procedures. The GAO found that Treasury had not developed performance measures for the SSBCI program, hindering its ability to determine program effectiveness. In response, Treasury adopted three performance goals and four performance indicators in January 2012 to measure program administration and outcomes. Treasury established performance goals and indicators in January 2012 to measure SSBCI program effectiveness. These included timely approval of agreements and disbursements, tracking fund usage, loans supported, private sector leverage, and job creation. Performance data was reported annually to the Office of Management and Budget and internally to the Assistant Secretary of Financial Institutions. Treasury established performance goals and indicators in January 2012 to measure SSBCI program effectiveness. The outcomes of these goals are not directly within Treasury's control as participating states are responsible for designing and implementing state programs. The results are influenced by external factors like demand for credit and borrower quality. While Treasury does not have direct control over these outcomes, measuring them is crucial for evaluating federal support for state programs and guiding future policy decisions. The GAO's second annual SSBCI audit in December 2012 found that Treasury had transferred $468 million to states, with states disbursing about $150 million. States with existing programs disbursed funds faster, while new programs required extensive outreach to lenders. Treasury could revoke untransferred funds after two years. The GAO found that Treasury had not developed a written policy on how to use untransferred funds by the two-year anniversary of state approval for the SSBCI program. Most states' two-year period would end in 2013, raising concerns about their ability to use all funds in time. Treasury indicated no immediate plans to exercise authority over unspent funds, but GAO emphasized the need for guidance in case states fail to meet deadlines. The GAO raised concerns about Treasury's lack of written policy on using untransferred funds for the SSBCI program, emphasizing the need for guidance as states approach their two-year deadline. Treasury had created performance measures but had not determined how or when to make this information public. GAO recommended making performance indicators publicly available to assist policymakers in reviewing small business assistance programs. Treasury responded to GAO's recommendation for written policy guidance in June 2013. Treasury responded to GAO's recommendation for written policy guidance on revoking untransferred SSBCI funds by disseminating a FAQ narrative to participating states and discussing the policy at a national conference in June 2013. The policy stated that states submitting their second disbursement request by June 30, 2015, and qualifying for it, would not have their allocated funds terminated if untransferred by that date. The Participating State will retain access to its Allocated Funds until March 31, 2017. If a state does not qualify for its second disbursement by June 30, 2015, Treasury will assess its progress in implementing SSBCI programs and may terminate un-transferred funds. Treasury released an annual summary report of SSBCI performance information in response to GAO's recommendation. The summary report from SSBCI participants' annual reports included data on Treasury's performance measures as of December 31, 2012. GAO's third annual audit in December 2013 found challenges in SSBCI fund usage despite increased spending pace. Treasury had disbursed $811 million in SSBCI funds by June 30, 2013, with some participants still working on their first tranche. Participants faced delays in spending their SSBCI funding due to Treasury's slow finalization of program guidelines and the learning curve of implementing new small business programs. Low demand for some capital access programs also hindered spending as funds had to be reallocated. New challenges included large banks' reluctance to participate and compliance with the Small Business Jobs Act. The reluctance of large banks to participate in the SSBCI program was due to variations in program requirements across the nation, including the certification requirement for sex offenders. Some lenders expressed concerns about additional regulatory scrutiny for using SSBCI programs. Some banks are hesitant to join SSBCI programs due to the sex offender certification requirement. Treasury officials briefed regulatory agencies to address lenders' concerns about increased scrutiny. FDIC and OCC published guidance to reassure regulated entities about participating in SSBCI programs. Treasury has set targets for administrative performance measures but not for other areas. Treasury has established targets for administrative performance measures but not for program performance measures. GAO recommended setting targets for program performance measures and seeking input from stakeholders. Treasury officials agreed with the recommendations and started the process of establishing targets and gathering input for SSBCI program evaluations. GAO's fourth annual audit found that while SSBCI spending had increased, some banks were still hesitant to participate. Some banks are hesitant to participate in the SSBCI program due to unfamiliarity or perceived regulatory scrutiny. Treasury established targets for private-sector leverage and funds disbursement. Lack of clarity in guidance on SSBCI fund use was noted by officials. The SSBCI program targets small borrowers with 500 or fewer employees and loans with an average principal amount of $5 million or less. Treasury sought input from stakeholders when designing the program evaluation metrics. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that Treasury's efforts to provide performance information on the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) were positive. Treasury appreciated GAO's guidance on program evaluation metrics and planned to include national program-wide outcomes, state-by-state variations, and feedback from lenders and investors in its final assessment. The Treasury's Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued its first evaluation report on the SSBCI program on August 5, 2011, praising Treasury officials. The OIG praised Treasury officials for seeking assistance during the SSBCI program's development. They made revisions to policy guidelines and application materials following consultation, including requiring applicants to detail oversight and compliance regimes. The OIG made nine recommendations for improvements, such as defining state oversight responsibilities more clearly and setting minimum standards for oversight of SSBCI. Treasury took immediate actions in response to the OIG's recommendations, including revising the SSBCI FAQ document to define terms like \"supervision and oversight\" and setting minimum standards for state oversight of SSBCI recipients. The SSBCI FAQ document on the Treasury website was updated to consolidate oversight requirements and clarify specific duties for participating states. The Treasury's OIG released audits for 24 states regarding their use of SSBCI funds, starting with California. The OIG reviewed small business loans in California to ensure compliance with program requirements. California mostly used $3.6 million in SSBCI loans properly, but $133,250 in loan loss reserves did not comply with program requirements. The OIG found that California did not comply with SSBCI program requirements, leading to a reckless misuse of funds. $160,988 in administrative expenses were not adequately supported, and 58% of tested loans lacked required assurances. Treasury agreed to recoup $133,250 in loan loss reserves and instructed California to provide additional documentation and address missing certifications. Treasury's OIG found that Montana misused $2.73 million of SSBCI funds by using them for prohibited investments and debt refinancing. Personnel costs of $3,426 were also deemed not allowable. Montana sought guidance from Treasury before enrolling the loans, but definitive guidance was not provided. The Treasury's OIG found that Montana misused $2.73 million of SSBCI funds by using them for prohibited investments and debt refinancing. Treasury officials did not provide definitive guidance on passive real estate loans and refinancing prior debt to the same lender. The OIG challenged Treasury's interpretation of the Small Business Job Act's prohibition on refinancing, noting the lack of clarity on the term \"re-funding.\" Treasury agreed to notify states that loans for passive real estate are considered a misuse of funds. Treasury found that Montana misused $2.73 million of SSBCI funds by investing in prohibited activities and refinancing debt. They also identified issues with Vermont's interest rate subsidy program. The OIG found that Vermont's quarterly reports to Treasury do not accurately reflect the state's use of funds for the program, hindering accurate measurement of leverage achieved with SSBCI funds. Recommendations include providing subaccounting of all funds transferred for the interest rate subsidy program and assessing if Vermont is in default of its Allocation Agreement. Additionally, $216,820 in administrative expenses charged to the SSBCI program were identified. The OIG found $216,820 in administrative expenses charged to the SSBCI program by Vermont that did not comply with program guidance. Treasury agreed to require subaccounting of funds transferred for the interest rate subsidy program and to assess if Vermont is in default of its Allocation Agreement. Treasury also agreed to disallow the expenses unless supporting documentation is provided. The Treasury's OIG found that Michigan misused approximately $2.524 million of the $38.5 million in SSBCI loans examined. This included using $2.5 million for lender purchase transactions not involving additional credit to borrowers, $3,000 for a partner buy-out (prohibited use), and $21,000 for a CAP insurance premium on a loan funded before Michigan's acceptance into the program. The OIG deemed the $21,000 payment as a \"reckless\" misuse that must be recouped. The Treasury's OIG found that Michigan misused $2.524 million of the $38.5 million in SSBCI loans, including $2.5 million for lender purchase transactions not benefiting borrowers. It recommended guidance for such transactions and disallowing $8,506 in administrative expenses incurred before Michigan's approval. Treasury agreed to issue guidance and recoup $21,000 used for a loan premium and disallow the $8,506 in expenses. The Treasury's OIG found Michigan misused $2.524 million of SSBCI loans, recommended guidance for transactions, and disallowed $8,506 in administrative expenses. Texas's program was found in compliance with SSBCI requirements, credited to their use of a compliance checklist. Massachusetts had spent $6.6 million of SSBCI funds, including $4 million for the Growth Capital Corporation. The audit of Massachusetts' use of SSBCI funds found $200,000 in non-compliant administrative costs and $51,248 of unreported program income. 34 out of 35 transactions were compliant with program requirements. The audit found that a $237,000 transaction made by the MBDC loan program violated SSBCI policy guidelines due to involving an SBA-guaranteed loan. Massachusetts officials believed it was compliant because only the unguaranteed portions were prohibited. Additionally, 89% of loans reviewed lacked complete borrower and lender assurances. The OIG recommended revising program guidance to clearly prohibit federally-guaranteed loans and disallowing $200,000 in administrative expenses. The OIG recommended revising program guidance to prohibit federally guaranteed loans and disallow $200,000 in administrative expenses unless adequately supported by the Commonwealth. Treasury is assessing Massachusetts's compliance with program requirements and considering further action. The Treasury's OIG found that Delaware had spent $4.1 million of its $4.3 million SSBCI disbursement, with funds allocated to various loan programs. A review of 26 loans showed compliance with program requirements, with no instances of intentional or reckless behavior identified. The OIG found that Delaware did not fully comply with all required affirmations for borrower and lender assurances at loan closing. Treasury became aware of this noncompliance in May 2012 but only directed Delaware to obtain missing assurances in October 2012. Delaware retroactively obtained these assurances by November 2012. The OIG recommended that Treasury strengthen its compliance monitoring and enforcement of program requirements. Treasury is adjusting the quarterly certification process to address noncompliance issues in participating states. Delaware implemented additional precautions, including random audits of SSBCI loans. An independent audit found that New Jersey complied with program requirements in administering $2.9 million of SSBCI funds. The OIG found that New Jersey successfully complied with all program requirements for administering $2.9 million in SSBCI funds. Key practices included using an SSBCI Application Eligibility Criteria Checklist for each transaction. Alabama's use of SSBCI funds was audited by an independent accounting firm, reviewing 14 loans totaling $3.8 million. The audit of Alabama's use of $3.8 million in SSBCI funds found compliance with program requirements, attributed to a checklist requirement by the Department of Economic and Community Affairs. However, Alabama overstated the funds used by $1 million in March 2012 and $4 million in June 2012 quarterly reports due to errors in including private-lender funds. The OIG found errors in Alabama's reporting of SSBCI funds due to including private-lender contributions incorrectly. Treasury's OIG audited Missouri's use of SSBCI funds, reviewing 17 transactions totaling $6.6 million in investments and $511,135 in loans. Administrative expenses of $151,568 were also reviewed for allowability. The audit of Missouri's use of SSBCI funds found that over 96% of the $7.3 million expended was properly used, with compliant administrative costs. However, a $240,000 venture capital investment was deemed a reckless misuse of funds due to a prohibited party relationship. The OIG recommended that Treasury recoup the $240,000 investment made by Missouri due to a prohibited party relationship with a director. Missouri disagreed with the finding, stating that the relationship was disclosed and the investment was made through a rigorous process. Missouri took measures to prevent similar issues in the future. The board administering the IDEA Fund took steps to address the misuse of funds, including replenishing the SSBCI program account and amending conflict-of-interest policies. Treasury agreed to recoup $240,000 from Missouri and assess compliance with related party prohibitions. An independent accounting firm audited Washington's use of SSBCI funds. The independent accounting firm audited Washington's use of SSBCI funds, reviewing loans and investments totaling $7.1 million. They found compliance with program requirements but identified an overstatement of $5,779 in administrative expenses. The auditors identified an overstatement of administrative expenses in Washington's SSBCI program, which was subsequently adjusted after notifying Treasury. Treasury's OIG contracted an accounting firm to audit Kansas's use of SSBCI funds, reviewing loans, investments, and administrative expenses. The audit of Kansas's use of SSBCI funds found that most expenses were appropriate, but questioned three $250,000 loans issued to affiliated entities. The OIG recommended clarifying the $20 million cap on SSBCI loans and Treasury agreed to revise the policy guidelines. Treasury agreed to revise the SSBCI policy guidelines to clarify requirements. An audit found that Kansas inaccurately reported a $173,822 advance as a loan in a quarterly report. $29,247 of the advance was not reported as administrative expenses. $13,181 of the $29,247 should be disallowed by Treasury. Treasury agreed to work with Kansas to correct quarterly statements, remove disallowed audit and tax consulting costs, and review the state's cost allocation plan. Treasury's OIG reviewed SSBCI investments and loans issued by the Florida programs between August 2011 and December 2012, ensuring proper use of funds and reviewing administrative expenses charged during that period. The OIG reviewed Florida's expenses charged against SSBCI funds, finding that the majority of funds were properly used. One questionable transaction involved $4 million in SSBCI funds in a $34.7 million investment, exceeding the $20 million restriction. The OIG recommended that Treasury revise the SSBCI Policy Guidelines to clarify the $20 million restriction on credit support for investments involving multiple equity instruments. Florida had overstated its administrative expenses by $55,000 due to incorrect selection criteria, which was corrected after informing Treasury. Florida overstated the amount of SSBCI funds obligated by $23 million due to including FLVCP reserves for future investments. State officials claimed compliance with SSBCI guidelines but adjusted their reporting after Treasury's criteria clarification in February 2013. Florida adjusted its quarterly statements for June 30, 2012, September 30, 2012, and December 31, 2012, to exclude amounts shown as obligated pursuit to the FLVCP reserve commitment letters. Treasury's OIG reviewed a random sample of 28 SSBCI loans and investments made by West Virginia's four SSBCI programs, finding full compliance with all SSBCI requirements. The Treasury's OIG examined a sample of SSBCI loans and investments in Illinois, totaling $34.5 million, and found full compliance with SSBCI requirements. Illinois appropriately used most of the funds but spent $105,000 on a loan for purchasing stock. The state's $1.03 million in SSBCI administrative costs were also found to be in compliance. The OIG found that Illinois violated SSBCI Policy Guidelines by participating in a loan to purchase stock of a company, along with other non-compliant transactions. Illinois also overstated private financing in a 2012 report by $4.7 million due to changes in transaction structure without state knowledge. Treasury will recoup the $105,000 expenditure and require modifications to master agreements with lenders. The OIG found Illinois violated SSBCI Policy Guidelines by participating in non-compliant transactions and overstating private financing by $4.7 million in a 2012 report. Treasury will recoup $105,000 and require modifications to master agreements with lenders. Treasury will work with Illinois to adjust the overstatement and determine if a general default occurred. The OIG examined 38 SSBCI loans in South Carolina totaling $11.4 million and $136,449 in administrative costs. South Carolina misused $427,500 of SSBCI funds for non-secular purposes, violating policy guidelines. The OIG also found eight other transactions that did not comply with National Standards. However, South Carolina's administrative charges were in full compliance with SSBCI requirements. Treasury will publish guidance to clarify fund usage. Treasury will publish guidance clarifying that using SSBCI funds for non-secular transactions is not allowed. South Carolina added a line item to ensure compliance with borrower and lender requirements. American Samoa received $10.5 million in SSBCI funds but had not used any for credit support by September 30, 2013. The audit focused on the reasonableness of American Samoa's $50,307 in administrative costs. The audit found $49,155 in unsupported expenses in American Samoa's SSBCI administrative costs. American Samoa failed to provide records to show readiness to extend credit, did not obtain approval for changes in fund administration, and missed reporting deadlines, leading to a default declaration by Treasury. The OIG recommended that Treasury disallow $49,155 in unsupported administrative expenses from American Samoa's Allocation Agreement. Treasury will determine if future funding should be reduced, suspended, or terminated, and require compliance with the agreement terms before disbursing additional funds. The Treasury will not disburse additional funds until American Samoa complies with the terms of the Allocation Agreement. Officials agreed to disallow questioned expenses but expressed concerns about the audit's severity. They mentioned organizational issues and stated that Treasury supported the Governor's decision. Additionally, they have submitted missing reports and hired consultants for program management. The Treasury hired consultants to design a compliance program for American Samoa's SSBCI program and requested approval for program modifications. Treasury's OIG examined a sample of SSBCI loans issued by North Carolina's programs totaling $4.9 million. The OIG reviewed North Carolina's SSBCI program loans from May 23, 2011, to December 31, 2012, totaling $4.9 million. They found that most funds were appropriately used, but $6,690 was misused due to a lender's misrepresentation. Refinancing loans by the same lender is prohibited and constitutes a misuse of funds. Additionally, North Carolina did not obtain compliant lender sex-offender assurances for 42% of transactions tested. The OIG found issues with North Carolina's reporting of SSBCI funds, including inaccurate reporting of investment amounts and inappropriate use of capital commitments to measure performance. Despite some concerns, all administrative cost transactions reviewed were in compliance. The OIG found that North Carolina's reporting of SSBCI funds was inaccurate and recommended actions for Treasury to take, including verifying fund withdrawals and revising definitions for venture capital programs. The OIG found inaccuracies in North Carolina's reporting of SSBCI funds and recommended actions for Treasury to verify fund withdrawals and revise definitions for venture capital programs. Treasury will make changes to disbursement procedures and adopt a standard definition of funds used for all program-reporting purposes. The Treasury's OIG reviewed Idaho's use of SSBCI funds, finding that Idaho appropriately used $9.6 million in collateral support. Idaho had reported additional administrative expenses of $272,744 as of September 30, 2013, which were reviewed for compliance with SSBCI guidelines. Idaho used $9.6 million in collateral support appropriately, but mistakenly overstated the total principal for 3 loans by $111,923. The state also inaccurately reported $781,000 as Treasury-approved subsequent private financing. Idaho corrected its report before submitting it to Treasury and implemented new controls to verify loan origination amounts. Idaho corrected loan origination amounts to ensure accuracy. Treasury will work with Idaho to rectify errors in reporting. Idaho's administrative expenses were compliant with guidelines. The OIG reviewed investments made by the Indiana Angel Network Fund and found compliance with SSBCI policy guidelines. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that a $499,986 investment by Elevate Ventures constituted an \"intentional\" misuse of funds due to a prohibited related party interest. The OIG noted that SSBCI Policy Guidelines prohibit such related interests. Another $300,000 investment by Elevate Ventures was found to be in compliance with SSBCI guidelines. Elevate Ventures manages investments for the Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC) on behalf of the Indiana Angel Network Fund. The OIG found a $499,986 investment by Elevate Ventures to be an \"intentional\" misuse of funds due to a prohibited related party interest. The closeness of the relationship between the Elevate board chairman and the applicant raised concerns of partiality. Treasury agreed to recoup the funds, declare a default event with Indiana, and review future investment decisions. Indiana reported that the $499,986 investment by Elevate Ventures was not an intentional misuse of funds, as it was repaid with a 15% return and led to the creation of new jobs. The state also mentioned that the board chairman of Elevate Ventures had resigned, and they will independently review future potential investment conflicts. The OIG examined a sample of 20 SSBCI investments made by Tennessee's INCITE Co-Investment Fund totaling $13.5 million. They found that investor use-of-proceeds assurances were missing for all transactions reviewed, and sex offender assurances were not executed for 12 transactions. Tennessee inaccurately certified compliance with SSBCI requirements in quarterly reports. Treasury provided Tennessee with consent. The OIG found that Tennessee corrected their process to ensure assurances meet program guidelines after attending a training conference. All sampled administrative expenses were reasonable. Treasury's OIG examined 15 SSBCI loans totaling $8.6 million made by the Mandan consortium. The OIG also reviewed the consortium's $194,101 in administrative expenses. The OIG reviewed the Mandan consortium's $194,101 in SSBCI administrative expenses and found them to be reasonable and appropriate. They also audited Rhode Island's Slater Technology Fund, which was found to have properly used most of the $1.5 million in SSBCI funds allocated between September 6, 2011, and December 31, 2012. The Slater Technology Fund misused $350,000 of SSBCI funds on two investments by not complying with the investor capital-at-risk requirement. Rhode Island's Slater Technology Fund failed to invest any private capital in the first investment and only injected private capital at the final payment for the second investment. The fund also did not obtain required investee and investor assurances for five investments. The Slater Technology Fund did not obtain required investee and investor assurances for five of the six investments before transferring SSCBI funds. Rhode Island acknowledged the lack of private capital initially invested as required by Treasury guidelines but has implemented measures for future compliance. Certain investor and investee assurances were not timely obtained by Slater, now requiring them prior to fund release. The OIG audited Canrock Innovate NY Fund, LP, finding issues with compliance in New York's SSBCI venture capital program. The OIG found that investments in four beneficiary companies in New York's SSBCI program were a reckless misuse of $1.63 million due to conflicts of interest with the general partner. Treasury was recommended to recoup the funds, but instead withheld the remaining allocation. The OIG found that the SSBCI funds were withheld by Treasury in response to the audit's recommendations. The program aimed to boost small business lending and create jobs, but its impact remains uncertain. States had utilized 88% of the available $1.45 billion by December 31, 2016, supporting over 21,000 loans and investments totaling $10.7 billion. The Treasury reported over $10.7 billion in loans and investments to small businesses, with 80% going to businesses with 10 or fewer employees. SSBCI funds helped create or retain 240,669 jobs. However, determining the program's impact on small business lending is challenging due to various factors. The Treasury's SSBCI program, representing 0.24% of small business loans, faced compliance challenges in 24 states. The release of \"SSBCI National Standards for Compliance and Oversight\" in 2012 helped states understand the program's rules. However, with many new small business investment programs involved, oversight is a concern after Treasury's role termination. With the termination of Treasury's role in SSBCI administration, congressional interest in SSBCI program oversight is expected to continue."
