The Clarks River Basin in Kentucky is crucial for various wildlife species and is the last remaining natural bottomland hardwood wetland ecosystem in western Kentucky. It offers recreational, research, and educational opportunities. The Clarks River Basin in Kentucky is an internationally significant environmental resource that requires active management to protect and enhance its value as fish and wildlife habitat. It has been identified for permanent protection in the establishment of the Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge. Agriculture and silviculture in the area are essential to the local economies and can contribute to healthy ecosystems for wildlife. To maintain healthy ecosystems for wildlife, the refuge should allow agricultural and silvicultural activities on private lands. The purpose of allowing agricultural and silvicultural activities on private lands within the refuge is outlined in Section 3. The Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge is established to conserve fish and wildlife populations, preserve biodiversity, provide a link to public areas with managed habitats, fulfill international treaty obligations, restore wetlands, and conserve threatened species. The Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge aims to conserve threatened species, provide opportunities for research and recreation, and ensure access compatible with its management purposes. SEC. 4.
