    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the main federal aid source for elementary and secondary education, with Title I-A being the largest program funded at $14.9 billion for FY2016. It aims to provide additional educational services to low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. The U.S. Department of Education allocates Title I-A grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) through four funding formulas. The ESEA was reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015, with minimal changes to the Title I-A formulas. The report provides final FY2016 state grant amounts under the four Title I-A formulas. Funds are allocated to LEAs through state educational agencies using these formulas, with different percentages allocated through each formula. The Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas allocate funds to LEAs based on a formula child count and expenditure factor. Maximum grants are calculated and adjusted to match available appropriations, considering state and LEA minimum grant provisions. LEAs must meet specific criteria to be eligible for grants under Title I-A formulas. The Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas allocate funds to LEAs based on a formula child count and expenditure factor. Maximum grants are calculated and adjusted to match available appropriations, considering state and LEA minimum grant provisions. LEAs must meet specific criteria to be eligible for grants under Title I-A formulas. Some LEAs may be eligible for grants under multiple formulas, with funds initially calculated at the LEA level. State grants are adjusted for state minimum grant provisions, and final FY2016 grants were calculated by ED. The percentage share of funds allocated under each Title I-A formula was calculated by CRS for each state. Table 1 provides each state's grant amount and percentage share of funds allocated under each formula for FY2016. Total Title I-A grants were calculated by summing the state-level grants for each formula. California received the largest total Title I-A grant amount of $1.8 billion, representing 11.98% of Title I-A grants, while Wyoming received the smallest grant amount of $34.8 million, accounting for 0.24% of grants. Grant amounts vary among states due to different allocation formulas, with the Basic Grant formula generally receiving a greater share of appropriations. Texas, for example, has different grant amounts and percentage shares compared to other states. The allocation of Title I-A funds varies among states based on different formulas. Texas, with a larger population of children, receives a higher grant amount compared to North Carolina. The percentage share of funds within a state may vary by formula, with some formulas favoring certain types of states. If a state's share of a specific formula exceeds its overall share of Title I-A funds, it indicates that the formula is more favorable to that state. For example, Florida and Nevada received a higher percentage share of Targeted Grants than overall Title I-A funds. In states with minimum grants under all four Title I-A formulas, Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas are more favorable, while Basic Grants and Concentration Grants are less favorable. Minimum grant amounts are denoted with an asterisk in Table 1."
