    "content": "In response to economic crises, Congress debates promoting U.S. exports for economic growth and job creation. Interest increased with President Obama's National Export Initiative to double exports by 2014, aiming to create 2 million new jobs through various strategies. Members of Congress now focus on understanding federal export promotion functions, coordination, and budgets. The 113th Congress is prioritizing understanding federal agencies involved in export promotion to support oversight and legislative activities. This report provides an overview of these agencies and issues for Congress to consider. It is important to note that state and local governments, as well as businesses, also play a role in promoting exports. The federal government provides export assistance services to U.S. companies, including distribution of trade-related information, market research, counseling, business matchmaking services, trade missions, and reverse trade missions. Key agencies offering direct export assistance include USDA, Department of Commerce, Department of State, SBA, and TDA. The U.S. government conducts feasibility studies to evaluate proposed projects in foreign countries that may generate exports of U.S. goods and services. Government agencies provide export financing and insurance to support U.S. exports, with USDA leading in agricultural export financing and the Export-Import Bank as the lead agency for overall financing. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) provides financing and insurance for non-agricultural exports, supporting small business exporters along with the SBA. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) finances and insures U.S. private investment in overseas projects, promoting the sale of U.S. goods and services. The U.S. government advocates for U.S. companies to compete fairly with foreign enterprises in export markets. The federal government, through agencies like the Departments of Commerce and State and the U.S. Trade Representative, promotes exports by addressing trade barriers, unfair practices, and developing foreign markets for U.S. goods and services. This includes negotiating trade agreements and monitoring their enforcement. The U.S. government, through agencies like the USTR, Commerce, and State, promotes exports by addressing trade barriers and developing foreign markets. Various government programs indirectly support export expansion, with key agencies like USDA's FAS carrying out programs to develop export markets for agricultural products. The cliff legislation extended the 2012 farm bill provisions for export market development through September 30, 2013. FAS administers export credit programs and provides assistance to U.S. exporters of agricultural products. Funding for USDA's export promotion programs is specified in farm bills and financed through the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP) is funded by the Commodity Credit Corporation and aims to develop long-term export markets for U.S. agricultural products. Funding is allocated annually to non-profit organizations for activities like consumer promotions and market research. The 2008 farm bill authorized $34.5 million annually for FMDP from FY2008 through FY2012, with continued funding in the \"fiscal cliff\" legislation. The Market Access Program (MAP) helps finance promotional activities for U.S. agricultural products, including consumer promotions, market research, and technical assistance. The program was made eligible for organic produce in the 2008 farm bill, with funding at $200 million annually from FY2008 through FY2012. \"Fiscal cliff\" legislation continues MAP funding at $200 million through FY2013. Both MAP and FMDP work with the private sector and reimburse participants for export promotion costs, with government funding accounting for 37% of export promotion under these programs. The Emerging Markets Program (EMP) and Quality Samples Program (QSP) receive government and private sector funding for export promotion activities. EMP focuses on technical assistance for U.S. agricultural exports to emerging markets, while QSP helps trade organizations provide samples of their products. EMP funding is set at $10 million annually from FY2008 through FY2013. The Quality Samples Program (QSP) assists U.S. agricultural trade organizations in providing samples of their products to potential importers in emerging markets. It focuses on industry and manufacturing needs, with an average annual funding of $2 million. The Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) program addresses barriers to exporting U.S. specialty crops, with activities such as seminars, research, and pre-clearance programs. TASC was authorized $9 million in FY2012 and continues to receive funding at that level through FY2013. The cliff legislation (P.L. 112-240) extends TASC funding at $9 million through FY2013. FAS provides resources for international sales of agricultural products, assisting small- and medium-sized exporters. USDA operates export financing programs like GSM-102 and FGP to support agricultural exports. FAS administers these programs through the CCC. The USDA operates export financing programs like GSM-102 and FGP to support agricultural exports, with an estimated $5.5 billion guaranteed in FY2012. Additionally, the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) allows exporters to sell U.S. dairy products at lower prices in foreign markets. Other agencies like the SBA, Ex-Im Bank, and OPIC also provide assistance for financing and insurance for overseas investments. The Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (ITA) provides export assistance services for U.S. non-agricultural businesses through trade specialists in U.S. Export Assistance Centers and overseas offices. The ITA's Trade Promotion and U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service unit helps U.S. companies with market research and trade events to promote their products in foreign markets. The International Trade Administration's Trade Promotion and U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service unit offers export assistance services for U.S. businesses in foreign markets. Services include market research, trade events, introductions to buyers and distributors, advocacy services, and liaisons to Multilateral Development Banks. The unit also leads U.S. Export Assistance Centers to support U.S. exporters. The U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) are a component of support services provided by federal government agencies to U.S. exporters, primarily SMEs. They offer export counseling, planning, and financing services to help firms identify target markets, formulate marketing strategies, and explore export financing options. The USEAC network includes participation from the SBA, Ex-Im Bank, and USDA, coordinating export education, promotion, and finance services for U.S. businesses. USEACs work with Foreign Commercial Service posts and non-federal export service providers to provide export assistance in over 100 U.S. cities. The U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) provide export assistance for U.S. businesses in over 100 cities. Some services are free, while others are fee-based. The Commercial Service unit's role includes the SelectUSA Initiative to promote inward investment. The Manufacturing and Services (MAS) unit aims to strengthen U.S. industry competitiveness and increase exports. The Market Access and Compliance (MAC) unit within the MAS focuses on monitoring foreign country compliance with trade agreements, identifying obstacles, and informing U.S. firms of business opportunities. Country desk officers specialize in resolving trade complaints and market access issues. The ITA also counters unfair foreign trade practices. The Import Administration (IA) unit within ITA enforces U.S. trade laws, including anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. ITA plays a key role in boosting exports through activities like trade missions and promoting foreign market access for U.S. companies. The New Market Exporter Initiative (NMEI) works with Strategic Partners like FedEx and UPS to support U.S. companies in expanding to international markets. The Obama Administration requested an increase in full-time employees and funding for the NEI to support an export expansion strategy. ITA's focus is on increasing U.S. exports to major emerging markets through trade missions, bringing foreign buyers to U.S. trade shows, and providing business matchmaking services. ITA also assists U.S. companies in identifying foreign buyers and overcoming trade barriers to ensure they benefit from trade agreements. The Obama Administration requested increased funding for the ITA to support an export expansion strategy, including the creation of a new Interagency Trade Enforcement Center (ITEC) to challenge unfair trade practices, particularly in China. The budget request for FY2013 includes funding for the ITEC and to promote U.S. exports through the Foreign Commercial Service. The Ex-Im Bank received $30.3 million to enhance U.S. exports in high-growth markets like China, India, and Brazil. It is the official export credit agency of the U.S. government, providing finance and insurance programs to facilitate exports to developing economies. The bank's main programs include direct loans, export credit guarantees, working capital guarantees, and export credit insurance, all backed by the U.S. government. Congress has authorized the Ex-Im Bank through FY2014. The Ex-Im Bank, authorized through FY2014, is a self-sustaining institution that charges fees for services and collects interest on loans. Congress sets an upper limit on its financial activities annually. In FY2012, the bank approved 3,796 transactions totaling $35.8 billion, supporting nearly $50 billion in U.S. exports and 255,000 U.S. jobs. While financing less than 5% of U.S. exports, a significant portion of its funding is for exports. In FY2012, the Ex-Im Bank approved 3,796 transactions totaling $35.8 billion, supporting nearly $50 billion in U.S. exports and 255,000 U.S. jobs. Despite financing less than 5% of U.S. exports annually, a significant portion of its financing is for exports of capital-intensive U.S. goods. The Bank's charter requires it to allocate a minimum percentage of its authority to finance exports by small businesses and promote renewable energy technologies. Additionally, appropriations language specifies a minimum percentage for financing exports of renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies. The charter also directs the Bank to expand its financial commitments in sub-Saharan Africa. In FY2012, the Ex-Im Bank provided enhanced financing to small business exporters and renewable energy exporters. Projects must not harm U.S. industry or compete with U.S. production. The Bank also limits foreign content in supported transactions. The Ex-Im Bank limits foreign content in supported transactions based on national interest and U.S. policy goals. OPIC promotes economic growth in developing economies by providing investment insurance and project financing for U.S. businesses. OPIC supports U.S. foreign policy goals by promoting private investment overseas, mitigating risks for U.S. firms. Its authority has been extended through appropriations, with activities focused on mobilizing private capital in developing countries. OPIC, with funding authorized by Congress, supports U.S. foreign policy goals by promoting private investment overseas. It has funded, guaranteed, or insured nearly $200 billion in investments, supporting $75 billion in U.S. exports and over 276,000 American jobs. In FY2011, OPIC provided $2.8 billion for new market-based financing and political risk insurance to U.S. businesses, with about $1 billion going to U.S. small businesses. In FY2011, OPIC provided $2.8 billion for new market-based financing and political risk insurance to U.S. businesses, with about $1 billion going to U.S. small businesses. Additionally, $1.1 billion of its project commitments in that year supported projects in the renewable energy sector. OPIC has statutory requirements to ensure projects contribute to a country's development without harming the U.S. economy or employment. OPIC provides financing and insurance for U.S. businesses in new markets, including small businesses. SBA assists small businesses with export promotion through various stages. In FY2011, the OIT helped 1,346 small business exporters access $924 million in capital through export loan programs, supporting $1.8 billion in export sales. The State Department promotes exports through U.S. embassies abroad, collecting trade data, identifying opportunities, and participating in trade negotiations. Secretary of State Clinton announced the \"Jobs Diplomacy\" initiative to advance U.S. economic priorities overseas and create an open economic system. The Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs (EB) supports the National Export Initiative (NEI) by replicating best practices for export promotion, targeting infrastructure opportunities, increasing support to SMEs, and addressing non-tariff barriers. EB's Trade and Policy Programs (TPP) section plays a key role in formulating U.S. trade policy, negotiating positions, promoting agricultural biotechnology, and enforcing intellectual property rights globally. The Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs (EB) collaborates with U.S. agencies like USTR and USPTO to ensure foreign governments comply with trade commitments. The Commercial and Business Affairs (CBA) section of EB supports U.S. businesses operating abroad by providing assistance with regulatory issues, market analysis, and resolving disputes. U.S. Embassies and Consulates advocate for American businesses overseas by offering market information and expertise on foreign judicial systems. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) promotes economic development and U.S. commercial interests in developing countries by linking U.S. businesses to export opportunities through funding feasibility studies and other activities. TDA provides grants to overseas project sponsors who select U.S. companies to conduct projects, primarily benefiting small- and medium-sized businesses. Congress appropriated $50.0 million for TDA in FY2012. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) received $50.0 million in funding for FY2012 and $57.6 million for FY2013. TDA-funded projects aim to open markets for U.S. exports by supporting overseas infrastructure investments. Feasibility studies funded by TDA help secure financing for projects, leading to opportunities for U.S. companies to export goods and services. In FY2012, TDA allocated $43.9 million for projects. In FY2012, TDA provided $43.9 million in funding for projects, with feasibility studies representing 32% of obligations. Technical assistance accounted for nearly one-third of obligations. Reverse trade missions made up about one-quarter of TDA activities. TDA identified $2.2 billion in U.S. exports supported by its programs in FY2012. The International Business Partnership Program hosts reverse trade missions to bring overseas buyers to meet with U.S. companies. TDA is increasing engagement with the Department of Commerce's Advocacy Center for new reverse trade opportunities. The USTR is working with the Department of Commerce's Advocacy Center to find new trade missions and grant opportunities for U.S. exporters. They negotiate trade agreements to expand market access, reduce trade barriers, and establish rules in areas like investment and intellectual property rights. U.S. FTAs are comprehensive and high-standard agreements, going beyond WTO commitments. The USTR is currently negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement. The USTR is negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement to increase access for U.S. companies in Asia-Pacific markets. They enforce trade agreements, operate the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center (ITEC), investigate unfair trade practices, and negotiate the removal of trade barriers. The USTR's budget request includes $2 million for ITEC out of a total of $53 million. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) enforces economic sanctions for U.S. foreign policy goals. The Department of the Treasury works on global economic issues and export promotion, but only a small part of its budget is allocated to export activities. The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) aims to coordinate trade promotion efforts across agencies. The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) was established in 1992 to coordinate federal agencies involved in export promotion and propose a unified export promotion budget to the President. It is comprised of 20 member agencies, with the Secretary of Commerce as the chair. The TPCC releases an annual report on national exports. The TPCC, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, releases an annual report called the National Export Strategy. The National Export Initiative, introduced by President Obama in 2010, aims to coordinate federal export promotion activities. Executive Order 13534 formalized the NEI and created a President's Export Promotion Cabinet to enhance and organize federal efforts in promoting exports. This Cabinet includes key Secretaries and Directors of export promotion agencies and senior White House advisors. The Cabinet works with the TPCC to implement the NEI. In 2012, a presidential memorandum strengthened the role of the Export Promotion Cabinet to ensure the effectiveness of federal trade promotion programs. The Cabinet, in coordination with the TPCC, was directed to develop strategies and initiatives supporting trade and investment goals, present a unified federal trade budget, and optimize office and distribution networks. Coordination of the Cabinet's activities was assigned to the Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics. The TPCC issues an annual report called the National Export Strategy, which now focuses on tracking progress in implementing the NEI. The report used to outline policy goals and spending levels for trade promotion activities. The TPCC and individual agencies determine funding levels for trade promotion activities included in the report. The TPCC does not have its own budget. The TPCC does not have an independent budget or authority to direct member agencies' resource allocation. Each federal agency has its own budget appropriated by congressional committees. The TPCC has not published trade promotion spending levels in recent National Export Strategy reports, making it difficult to identify trends in trade promotion budget authority. The National Export Strategy report provides an overview of trade promotion spending by TPCC member agencies, but lacks detailed budget breakdowns for specific export promotion programs. Only 9 out of 20 member agencies requested budgets for trade promotion activities in FY2012. In FY2012, budgets for trade promotion activities were reported by TPCC member agencies, but the funding levels may not reflect total U.S. agency spending on export promotion. For example, the Ex-Im Bank authorized $36 billion in credit and insurance for U.S. exports, despite a requested budget authority of $1 million. Overall, trade promotion-related budgets of federal agencies declined between FY2006 and FY2010. The trade promotion-related budget of federal agencies, as reported by the TPCC, declined by about 13% due to lower funding levels for USDA and the Ex-Im Bank. USDA's budget for trade promotion decreased from $819 million in FY2006 to $674 million in FY2010. The USDA's trade promotion budget requests for FY2011 and FY2012 also decreased. Ex-Im Bank's trade promotion funding levels decreased as the agency became self-sustaining in FY2008. USDA remains the agency with the largest funding levels for trade promotion, followed by the Departments of Commerce and State. The Departments of Commerce and State have the second- and third-largest fund levels for trade promotion. Commerce's funding increased from $352 million in FY2006 to $356 million in FY2010. Recent budget requests have been lower than FY2010 enacted amount; FY2011 request was $339 million and FY2012 request was $350 million. State's trade promotion enacted budget increased from $170 million in FY2006 to $176 million in FY2010. Recent budget requests have been higher than FY2010 enacted amount, increasing to $184 million for FY2011 and to $198 million for FY2012. FY2013 funding levels for federal agencies involved in export promotion may face significant cuts in nondefense category under Budget Control Act of 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 delayed automatic spending cuts until March 1, 2013. The 113th Congress could oversee federal agencies involved in export promotion. Advocates argue that government export promotion is crucial for addressing market failures. Export assistance services can help small business exporters overcome barriers to entry in overseas markets. Federal export promotion efforts aim to level the playing field for U.S. companies competing internationally, but critics argue that government-funded trade promotion may distort free markets and lead to inefficient resource allocation. Critics also question the significant impact of government export promotion on U.S. export levels. While there is debate over the effectiveness of export assistance in influencing overall employment levels, U.S. trade policy has increasingly focused on promoting exports to support economic growth and employment. This shift aims to reduce reliance on domestic consumption for GDP growth and prioritize other sectors, including exports. Congressional interest in coordinating government export promotion activities remains longstanding. The U.S. government's export promotion activities have long been of interest to Congress. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted studies on the effectiveness of the TPCC in coordinating federal agencies' export promotion activities. The TPCC aims to establish priorities, coordinate a government-wide framework, and propose a unified budget to the President. However, interagency coordination is challenging due to the different missions, goals, and priorities of the agencies involved. The GAO reports progress in improving coordination of export promotion activities by the TPCC, but identifies ongoing concerns. Positive developments include interagency training, joint outreach to small businesses, and support for trade promotion at U.S. embassies. However, limitations in the annual National Export Strategy reports hinder the TPCC's ability to coordinate activities effectively. The GAO testified in March 2009 that the strategy lacks a review of member agencies' resource allocation, potentially hindering progress towards export promotion priorities. The GAO has testified that the TPCC has limited influence over member agencies' resource allocation for trade promotion. The NEI aims to enhance interagency coordination through the Export Promotion Cabinet, but critics argue it is a bureaucratic maneuver without substantive reforms. Congress is divided on the effectiveness of the NEI in improving U.S. export promotion coordination. Some policymakers advocate for increased federal funding for export promotion activities to enhance U.S. firms' competitiveness in the global marketplace. They argue that greater resources would improve the government's ability to support exporters and level the playing field with foreign competitors. Increased federal funding for export promotion activities would help U.S. firms compete globally and counter unfair trading practices. Critics argue that current programs are adequately funded but need to be used more efficiently, especially in the agricultural sector. Some question the allocation of resources, with federal support for agricultural exports accounting for a significant portion of the export promotion budget. Some policymakers are concerned about duplicative functions and diffuse responsibilities in the National Export Strategy. Balancing diverse policy goals like increasing exports and supporting SMEs is challenging. There is interest in reorganizing federal trade policy functions to enhance effectiveness. Some policymakers are concerned about duplicative functions and diffuse responsibilities in the National Export Strategy. There is interest in reorganizing federal trade policy functions to enhance effectiveness, improve coordination, and avoid duplication. Proponents believe consolidation may streamline export promotion services and reduce costs, while critics fear creating a costly federal bureaucracy. President Obama proposed consolidating various federal entities involved in business and trade functions into one department in early 2012. Bills based on this proposal were introduced in the 112th Congress. Efforts have been made to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of federal trade functions within existing authority. In early 2012, President Obama proposed consolidating federal entities involved in trade functions. The Administration strengthened the Export Promotion Cabinet and created new coordinating bodies. Congress passed legislation related to export promotion, including bills on the Ex-Im Bank's reauthorization. The Administration is reviewing a proposal to reorganize the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration. In 2012, bills were passed to extend the Ex-Im Bank's authority and reauthorize USDA's export programs. The Ex-Im Bank's lending authority was raised to $140 billion in FY2014. Other bills related to export promotion were introduced but did not progress beyond the committee stage. H.R. 4041 aimed to enhance the TPCC's authority in assessing export promotion programs, approving budgets, and directing export activities. It also included provisions for redeploying Commercial Service officers and developing diplomatic plans to boost U.S. exports. The bill passed in the House and was referred to the Senate. H.R. 2988 and H.R. 3976 aimed to promote U.S. exports of clean energy and environmental products. H.R. 2988 required the Secretary of Commerce to establish a public directory for foreign buyers and a database on foreign sales opportunities. H.R. 3976 directed the SBA Office of International Trade to compile tariff schedules for small businesses. H.R. 4221 aimed to create jobs in the United States by expanding U.S. trade and investment programs to increase exports to Africa. It would have increased financing for small business exports and investment in Africa through federal agencies like the Department of Commerce, Ex-Im Bank, and OPIC. The bill aimed to reauthorize funding for USDA agricultural export programs and the Commodity Credit Corporation. It would have reduced the value of export credit guarantees and repealed the DEIP program. The 112th Congress ended without enacting a new five-year farm bill to replace the expiring 2008 farm bill. Both S. 3240 and H.R. 6083, including their trade provisions, will likely serve as a starting point in the formulation of a new five-year farm bill in the 113th Congress."
