The Controlled Substances Act is amended to include new substances such as 3b,17b-diol, 4-chloro-17a-methyl-17b-hydroxy-androst-4-en-3-one, 4-chloro-17a-methyl-17b-hydroxy-androst-4-ene-3,11-dione, 4-chloro-17a-methyl-androsta-1,4-diene-3,17b-diol, 2a,17a-dimethyl-17b-hydroxy-5a-androstan-3-one, 2a,17a-dimethyl-17b-hydroxy-5b-androstan-3-one, 2a,3a-epithio-17a-methyl-5a-androstan-17b-ol, [3,2-c]-furazan-5a-androstan-17b-ol, 3b-hydroxy-estra-4,9,11-trien-17-one, and 17a-methyl-androst-2-ene-3,17b-ol. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to include new substances such as 17a-methyl-androst-2-ene-3,17b-diol, 17a-methyl-androsta-1,4-diene-3,17b-diol, Estra-4,9,11-triene-3,17-dione, 18a-Homo-3-hydroxy-estra-2,5(10)-dien-17-one, 6a-Methyl-androst-4-ene-3,17-dione, 17a-Methyl-androstan-3-hydroxyimine-17b-ol, 17a-Methyl-5a-androstan-17b-ol, 17b-Hydroxy-androstano[2,3-d]isoxazole, 17b-Hydroxy-androstano[3,2-c]isoxazole, and 4-Hydroxy-androst-4-ene-3,17. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to include new substances like 4-Hydroxy-androst-4-ene-3,17-dione[3,2-c]pyrazole-5a-androstan-17b-ol, [3,2-c]pyrazole-androst-4-en-17b-ol, and [3,2-c]pyrazole-5a-androstan-17b-ol. These substances are considered anabolic steroids if derived from or structurally similar to listed steroids. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to include new substances like 4-Hydroxy-androst-4-ene-3,17-dione[3,2-c]pyrazole-5a-androstan-17b-ol, [3,2-c]pyrazole-androst-4-en-17b-ol, and [3,2-c]pyrazole-5a-androstan-17b-ol, which are considered anabolic steroids if they promote muscle growth or have pharmacological effects similar to testosterone. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to include new substances that are considered anabolic steroids if they promote muscle growth or have effects similar to testosterone. These substances are not considered drugs or hormonal substances if they are dietary ingredients under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow the Attorney General to temporarily add new substances to the list of anabolic steroids if they meet certain criteria. The Attorney General can temporarily add new substances to the list of anabolic steroids under certain criteria. An order issued for this purpose will not take effect until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, and will expire within 24 months unless extended. The Attorney General can extend a temporary scheduling order for up to 6 months. A temporary order will be vacated upon the issuance of a permanent scheduling order, which is not subject to judicial review. The Attorney General can issue a permanent order adding a substance to the list of anabolic steroids if it meets certain criteria. Rulemaking for a permanent order can begin simultaneously with a temporary order. The Controlled Substances Act allows for substances to be considered anabolic steroids based on specific criteria in legal proceedings. Additionally, new labeling requirements for anabolic steroids are outlined, making it unlawful to import or export falsely labeled substances. The Controlled Substances Act prohibits the import, export, manufacture, distribution, sale, or possession with intent to sell any anabolic steroid or product containing an anabolic steroid without proper labeling. Products with approved applications are exempt from this requirement. The Controlled Substances Act prohibits the import, export, manufacture, distribution, sale, or possession of anabolic steroids without proper labeling. Violators face criminal penalties of up to 10 years in prison and civil penalties. The Controlled Substances Act imposes penalties for violations related to anabolic steroids, including fines of up to $500,000 for importers, exporters, manufacturers, or distributors, and up to $25,000 for retail sales or offers to sell. Each instance of violation is considered separately. The Attorney General or Secretary can send a message to the person, which will be considered additional violations. The term 'product' refers to a discrete article prepared for sale. The Attorney General may collect data to determine if products contain anabolic steroids and publish the information. The Attorney General or Secretary can list products containing anabolic steroids that are not labeled correctly. The absence of a product from the list does not prove it does not contain an anabolic steroid. SEC. 3. SENTENCING COMMISSION GUIDELINES. The United States Sentencing Commission will review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines for offenses involving anabolic steroids, including those not in traditional forms like tablets or capsules. The guidelines will be updated to base sentences on the entire weight of the mixture or substance for such cases. Quantities of mixture or substance will be designated to correspond to a unit for offenses involving non-traditional forms of anabolic steroids. The United States Sentencing Commission will update sentencing guidelines for anabolic steroid offenses, including non-traditional forms. Penalties for offenses involving anabolic steroids must be as severe as those with known dosages. The Commission will also take any necessary actions to enforce this Act. The Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration will report to Congress every 2 years on anabolic steroids scheduled temporarily under the Act and the reasons for such scheduling."
