The conference version of H.R. 4850 maintained restrictions on federal and District funds for medical marijuana, abortion, and needle exchange programs. The conference version of H.R. 4850 allows District funds, but not federal funds, to be used for health care benefits, attorney's fees cap, and lobbying activities related to statehood and voting representation in Congress for residents of the District of Columbia. The conference version of H.R. 4850 includes provisions related to charter schools, such as allowing the use of federal funds for lease guarantees, encouraging public schools to convert to charter schools, providing a transition period for teachers, and giving charter schools preference in acquiring surplus school facilities. The consolidated appropriations act, P.L. 108-447, includes provisions giving charter schools preference in acquiring surplus school facilities, allowing for a 25-year lease period for city-owned property leased to charter schools, requiring annual reports to Congress, biennial evaluations by GAO, and mandating accounting practices in line with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

The Board's authority is not affected by District Code governing Procurement Practices. The controversy over funding a needle exchange program for FY2005 appropriations touches on issues of home rule, public health policy, and government involvement in illegal drug use. The debate over needle exchange programs revolves around reducing HIV spread among drug users. Proponents argue for their effectiveness, while opponents see it as government endorsement of illegal drugs. The issue also involves home rule and funding restrictions imposed by Congress. The 1999 act allowed private funding for needle exchange programs, while the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2001 continued the prohibition on federal and District funds for such programs. The Act also restricted the location of privately funded needle exchange activities. The provision prohibiting distribution of needles near schools was deleted in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act of FY2002. Prevention Works is currently the only entity providing needle exchange services. The FY2002 District of Columbia Appropriations Act required entities to track and account for public and private funds used for needle exchange programs. District officials tried to lift the prohibition on using District funds for needle exchange programs in the FY2004 Act, but were unsuccessful. The final version allowed the use of private funds for needle exchange programs and required separate accounting for funds received for other activities. The President's budget proposal for FY2005 and the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2005 both included provisions prohibiting the use of District and federal funds for a needle exchange program. The city's medical marijuana initiative is also a controversial issue, with past legislation prohibiting the counting of ballots for a voter-approved initiative. District Court Judge Richard Roberts ruled that Congress did not have the power to prevent the counting of a voter-approved medical marijuana ballot initiative in D.C., allowing the city to tally the votes. Congress had 30 days to pass a resolution of disapproval to stop the initiative from being implemented. The medical marijuana ballot initiative in D.C. faced opposition from Congress through appropriations acts, leading to legal challenges. Groups sought injunctive relief to put another initiative on the ballot. The Board of Elections and Ethics ruled that a congressional rider prohibited the use of public funds for a ballot initiative. A U.S. district court judge later deemed this ban unconstitutional, but the decision was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The President's budget proposal for FY2005 would have continued the prohibition. The President's budget proposal for FY2005 continued to prohibit the implementation of the medical marijuana ballot initiative in the District of Columbia. The District's budget for FY2005 did not address this issue. The House, Senate, and conference versions of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2005 included a provision that also prohibited the implementation of the medical marijuana ballot initiative. The public funding of abortion services for District residents is a recurring topic during Congress's deliberations on District appropriations. District officials view this prohibition on the use of District funds as congressional interference in local matters. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2002, P.L. 107-96, prohibited the use of federal or District funds for abortion services, except in cases where the life of the mother is endangered, or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. This prohibition has been in place since 1995, with limitations on public funds for abortion services for District residents dating back to 1979. The FY1989 Appropriations Act, P.L. 100-462, restricted the use of District and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the mother's life is endangered. President Reagan and President Bush vetoed appropriations acts over the abortion issue, leading to restrictions on District funding for abortion services. The FY1994 Appropriations Act, P.L. 103-127, removed the provision limiting District funding for abortion services. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1994, P.L. 103-127 reinstated public funding for abortion services in cases of rape and incest. However, subsequent appropriations acts limited funding to cases where the mother's life is endangered, or in cases of rape or incest. The FY2004 and FY2005 appropriations continued to restrict funding for abortion services to these qualifying circumstances. The Senate and conference committee maintain the ban on using District and federal funds for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest, or maternal health risks. P.L. 107-96 lifts the congressional ban on using District funds for the Health Care Benefits Expansion Act, allowing unmarried couples to register as domestic partners for health care benefits. The Act was approved in 1992 but was not implemented until 2002 due to a congressional prohibition. The Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1994 allows unmarried couples to register as domestic partners for health and family benefits, including hospital visiting rights. District government employees can purchase family health insurance coverage for their domestic partners. Critics argue that the act devalues marriage by granting unmarried couples similar benefits as married couples. The Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1994 allows unmarried couples to register as domestic partners for health and family benefits. Supporters argue that it is a question of home rule and local autonomy. Legislation has been introduced to define marriage in the District of Columbia as a union between a man and a woman. Legislation introduced during the 108th Congress aimed to repeal long-standing gun control measures in the District of Columbia, prohibiting laws exceeding federal gun control measures and restrictions on private firearm ownership. This included repealing laws banning certain firearms, limiting handgun ammunition possession, and requiring firearms to be kept unloaded or secured.

The bills were referred to committees but no action was taken. Legislation introduced during the 108th Congress aimed to repeal gun control measures in the District of Columbia. Senator Craig planned to include language from S. 1414 in the District's FY2005 appropriations measure, but did not proceed due to lack of votes. Representative Souder's bill, H.R. 3193, passed the House but no action was taken in the Senate. The District's mayor and congressional delegate opposed the repeal of gun control laws. Opposition to the repeal of the city's gun control measures is based on concerns about public safety and home rule. Supporters argue that the repeal is necessary to restore residents' constitutional right to bear arms and criticize the ineffectiveness of current gun control laws in reducing crime rates."
