    "content": "This report outlines the process for filling high-ranking appointed leadership positions in the federal government, known as PAS positions, which require the President's nomination and Senate's consent. It includes details on nominations to full-time PAS positions on various boards and commissions during the 111th Congress, such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Reserve Board. The appointment process for high-ranking federal government positions, known as PAS positions, involves the President's nomination and Senate's consent. This process includes selection, clearance, and nomination by the President, consideration by the Senate, and final appointment by the President. The White House selects and clears candidates before formal nomination to the Senate for approval. Presidential Personnel involves the President selecting candidates for positions, with recommendations sometimes made by Members of Congress. Senators may provide advice on selections, but the White House is not obligated to follow recommendations. Senators have used procedural prerogatives to delay or block nominations when consultation is perceived as insufficient. Most boards and commissions are required to have political balance among members. The White House negotiates nominations for boards and commissions with the opposition party in Congress to ensure political balance. This process may involve submitting multiple nominations together for Senate consideration. Candidates must submit forms like the Public Financial Disclosure Report and Questionnaire for National Security Positions during the clearance process. The vetting process for nominations includes submitting various forms like the SF 278, SF 86, SF 86 Supplement, and White House Personal Data Statement. It involves background investigations by the FBI and financial disclosure reviews by OGE and agency ethics officials. Conflicts found are mitigated, and once completed, nominations are ready for Senate submission. Delays in the selection and clearance stage have been common, especially with multiple candidates. The vetting process for nominations can experience delays, especially with multiple candidates. Candidates for higher-level positions are given priority, and efforts have been made to expedite the appointment of national security team members after a new President's inauguration. Provisions added in 2004 encourage early security clearance for potential nominees. During presidential transitions, a law allows for a 90-day extension for temporary appointments, excluding members of collegial boards and commissions. During presidential transitions, provisions to speed up appointment processes may not apply to collegial boards and commissions. Nominees need Senate confirmation and presidential appointment to assume duties. Recess appointments can be made by the President, but may have political consequences. The Senate confirms nominees for various positions, considering factors like the nominee's views and potential impact on policy. The President's party control and involvement can influence the confirmation process. The Senate confirmation process involves the President's support and committee-level activities, including investigation, hearings, and reporting. Committees gather information from the White House and conduct public hearings to discuss nominees' qualifications and views. Hearings provide opportunities for Senators and nominees to address any issues related to the program or agency. The Senate confirmation process involves committees holding hearings to explore nominees' qualifications and policy perspectives. Committees may choose to report a nomination favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. If a committee fails to obtain a majority vote to report a nomination, it will not be brought to the Senate floor. In certain circumstances, the Senate can discharge a committee from further consideration of a nomination to bring it to the floor for confirmation. The Senate confirmation process involves committees holding hearings to explore nominees' qualifications and policy perspectives. Committees may report a nomination favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. Rarely, a nomination fails on the Senate floor, usually due to not being reported or discharged from committee. Pending nominations not confirmed or rejected in the session must be resubmitted by the President. The Senate confirmation process involves committees holding hearings to explore nominees' qualifications and policy perspectives. Committees may report a nomination favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. Rarely, a nomination fails on the Senate floor, usually due to not being reported or discharged from committee. Pending nominations not confirmed or rejected in the session must be resubmitted by the President. After confirmation, the nominee is given a commission signed by the President and sworn into office, granting full authority to carry out the responsibilities of the position. The President can make limited-term appointments without Senate confirmation during recesses, which expire at the end of the next full Senate session. The President can make recess appointments to bypass the confirmation process, but Congress has enacted provisions to restrict the pay of recess appointees. If a recess appointee's position falls vacant while the Senate is in session, they may not be paid from the Treasury until confirmed by the Senate, unless certain conditions are met. The President can make recess appointments to bypass the confirmation process, but Congress has enacted provisions to restrict the pay of recess appointees. A recess appointment falling under certain exceptions must be followed by a nomination within 40 days of the next Senate session. The Department of Justice interprets the statute to prevent payment for appointees with successive recess appointments. If a recess appointee's nomination for a full term is rejected, they can continue to serve until the end of their recess appointment. The FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act provision may prevent an appointee from being paid after rejection. Congress has used specific scheduling practices to prevent recess appointments by the President. The boards and commissions discussed in this report share common characteristics. The boards and commissions discussed in this report have members appointed by the President with Senate approval, serving fixed terms with staggered end dates to ensure leadership continuity. Fixed terms minimize simultaneous board member departures. The President can nominate individuals to replace appointees who have resigned or died for unexpired terms. Alternatively, nominees can be chosen for upcoming terms with the expectation of confirmation before the new term begins. In some cases, the same person may be nominated for both the unexpired term and the succeeding term simultaneously. Chairs of commissions may require Senate confirmation and must be selected from current commissioners. If the President wants to appoint someone not on the commission as chair, two nominations are submitted - one for member and one for chair. Executive branch boards and commissions have staggered membership and are independent entities with political implications. Executive branch boards and commissions have staggered membership, providing them with more political independence from the President compared to executive departments. However, the President can still influence membership by appointing chairs or filling multiple vacancies at once. President George W. Bush was able to shape the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Labor Relations Board during his first two years in office due to existing vacancies and resignations. This turnover in membership can occur coincidentally or due to a buildup of vacancies over time. The President's ability to shape executive branch boards and commissions may be limited by politically balanced membership requirements and advice and consent requirements for certain appointments. During the 111th Congress, President Barack Obama submitted nominations for 77 positions. During the 111th Congress, President Barack Obama submitted nominations for 77 positions on regulatory and other boards and commissions. Out of 99 nominations, 76 were confirmed, 4 were withdrawn, and 19 were returned to the President. Multiple nominations were submitted for some positions to fill the 148 full-time positions available. During the 111th Congress, President Obama submitted nominations for 77 positions on boards and commissions. Out of 99 nominations, 76 were confirmed, 4 withdrawn, and 19 returned. Some nominations were pending for varying lengths of time, with an average of 128.5 days between nomination and confirmation. The average time between nomination and confirmation during the 111th Congress was 128.5 days, with a median of 97.0 days. The inclusion of all days in the calculation differs from previous reports, potentially affecting comparability. Each board or commission profile in the report is divided into three parts. The report is divided into three parts: a paragraph discussing the body's organizational structure, a table of membership in the 111th Congress, and a table of nominations and appointments during that Congress. It covers statutory requirements for appointed positions, including member numbers, terms, political balance, and chair selection. Data on appointment actions during the 111th Congress are included. The curr_chunk discusses Senate confirmation, incumbents in fixed terms, party affiliations, pay levels, and appointment actions for presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation. The curr_chunk provides information on nominations in chronological order, including nominee names, positions, submission dates, confirmation dates, and days elapsed. It also notes actions other than confirmation, such as rejections, withdrawals, and recess appointments. Occasionally, multiple nominations are submitted for the same nominee to complete unexpired terms or comply with legal requirements. The follow-up nomination was submitted to comply with legal requirements. The mean number of days to confirm a nomination is calculated by adding the days between nomination and confirmation dates for all confirmed nominations and dividing by the number of nominations confirmed.
