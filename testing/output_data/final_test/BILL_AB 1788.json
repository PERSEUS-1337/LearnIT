    "title": "AB 1788",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislative Employee Whistleblower Protection Act, known as Article 11, allows legislative employees to report ethical violations without fear of retribution. It defines a legislative employee as someone currently employed by either house of the Legislature, excluding members. A protected disclosure involves filing a complaint with the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee regarding a violation by a legislator. The Senate and Assembly have separate committees to address ethical violations by members and employees. An ethics ombudsperson can also receive information about potential violations. \"Use of official authority or influence\" includes promising benefits or taking personnel actions. A Member of the Legislature or legislative employee cannot use their authority to intimidate or interfere with a legislative employee's right to make a protected disclosure. Violators may face a fine up to $10,000 and imprisonment. They can also be sued for damages in a civil action. A legislative employee can file a complaint for reprisal or retaliation with their supervisor or designated officer. The section does not allow disclosure of information prohibited by law and does not prevent personnel actions justified by separate evidence. The complaint must be filed within one year of the improper act, and the identity of complainants and witnesses must be kept confidential. Records from investigations are confidential unless requested by a law enforcement agency. The section does not limit the authority of the Attorney General or other authorized agencies to investigate the Legislature. A person who intentionally engages in acts of reprisal, retaliation, threats, coercion, or similar acts against a legislative employee for making a protected disclosure may face a fine up to $10,000 and imprisonment for up to one year. This includes former employees if the complaint is filed within one year of the improper act. In addition to other penalties, a person who retaliates against a legislative employee for a protected disclosure is liable for damages. The burden of proof is on the offending party to show the retaliation would have occurred for legitimate reasons even without the disclosure. Punitive damages may be awarded by the court for malicious acts, and the injured party is entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. A legislative employee can bring an action for civil damages without filing a complaint first. Supervisors in the Legislature can take personnel actions based on separate evidence, not just protected disclosures. The definition of \"legislative employee\" includes former employees if the complaint is filed within one year of the improper act. This article does not affect the rights of legislative employees under other laws. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts due to this act creating new crimes or changing penalties."
