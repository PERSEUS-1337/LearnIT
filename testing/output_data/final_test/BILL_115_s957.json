    "content": "The Act titled \"Access to Contraception for Women Servicemembers and Dependents Act of 2017\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that women serving in the Armed Forces, comprising over 15% of military members, are critical to national security. More than 95% of these women are of reproductive age, along with 1,100,000 female spouses and dependents. TRICARE covered around 1,400,000 women of reproductive age in 2015, with approximately 900,000 relying solely on TRICARE for coverage. Contraception is deemed essential for women's health. Contraception is crucial for women's health, reducing unintended pregnancy. It is linked to women's educational and professional opportunities, leading to increased earnings and gender equality. Studies show that removing cost barriers and providing comprehensive counseling on contraception methods is beneficial. The Affordable Care Act mandates coverage of preventive services, including contraception counseling and methods like LARCs, to reduce unintended pregnancies and promote women's health. The Affordable Care Act mandates coverage of preventive services, including contraception counseling and methods like LARCs, to reduce unintended pregnancies and promote women's health. HRSA provides women's preventive services including FDA-approved contraceptive methods, family planning practices, and sterilization procedures. TRICARE program offers full coverage of prescription drugs, including contraception, for servicewomen on active duty without cost-sharing requirements. However, servicewomen not on active duty and female dependents of Armed Forces members do not have similar coverage for all FDA-approved contraceptive methods. Studies show that servicewomen require comprehensive counseling for pregnancy prevention, especially during predeployment preparations, to address the high rate of unintended pregnancies among them. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS) has recommended that all Armed Forces provide FDA-approved contraception methods without cost-sharing to reduce unintended pregnancies. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS) recommends that all Armed Forces implement initiatives to educate servicemembers on family planning and provide various contraception methods to increase readiness and quality of life. Health care, including family planning for survivors of sexual assault in the military, is crucial due to the high prevalence of sexual assault among women in the military. The Department of Defense reported over 3,000 sexual assaults involving service members in fiscal year 2011, with servicewomen on active duty experiencing unwanted sexual contact at rates 16 times higher than the general population. The Department of Defense supports a policy ensuring servicewomen have access to emergency contraception after sexual assault. \"Contraception coverage parity is mandated under the TRICARE program.\" TRICARE program mandates contraception coverage parity for female beneficiaries, ensuring access to preventive pregnancy care without cost-sharing. The TRICARE program mandates coverage for all methods of contraception approved by the FDA, including insertion, removal, sterilization procedures, and patient education without cost-sharing. SEC. 4. EDUCATION ON FAMILY PLANNING FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES. The Secretary of Defense will establish a standard curriculum for family planning education in the Armed Forces, utilizing the latest technology. The curriculum will provide information for members to make informed decisions and prevent unintended pregnancies. The curriculum for family planning education in the Armed Forces will include information on preventing unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, the importance of comprehensive family planning, medically accurate information, a range of contraception methods, applicable laws and policies, and patients' rights to confidentiality. The curriculum for family planning education in the Armed Forces includes information on patients' rights to confidentiality and the unique circumstances faced by members of the Armed Forces affecting contraception use. SEC. 5. Pregnancy prevention assistance at military treatment facilities for sexual assault survivors. The purpose of this section is to enhance regulations requiring health care providers at military treatment facilities to consult with sexual assault survivors about emergency contraception and follow-up care. Assistance must be provided to women who disclose being victims of sexual assault or are believed to be survivors at every military treatment facility. Assistance for sexual assault survivors at military treatment facilities includes prompt provision of comprehensive information on emergency contraception approved by the FDA, emergency contraception upon request, and notification of confidentiality rights. The provision of information pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) must be clear, concise, and easily understood, meeting conditions set by the Secretary in regulations."
