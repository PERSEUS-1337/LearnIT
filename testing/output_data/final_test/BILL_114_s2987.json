    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Safe, Convenient, Reliable, Efficient, Effective, Next-Generation, Functional, and Secure TSA Act of 2016\" or the \"SCREEN FAST Act\". It includes a pilot program for increased efficiency and security at Category X airports. The \"SCREEN FAST Act\" includes a pilot program to enhance efficiency and security at Category X airports by reconfiguring and installing security systems in airport terminals with large open screening areas. Airports selected for the program must be able to promptly implement the security system changes and prioritize proposals seeking federal funding for reconfiguration. The pilot program under the \"SCREEN FAST Act\" aims to enhance security and efficiency at Category X airports by reconfiguring existing security systems. Selected airports must have the space to reduce vulnerabilities and be willing to enter a cost-sharing arrangement with the Transportation Security Administration. The \"SCREEN FAST Act\" pilot program focuses on developing and testing prototypes for airport security systems to improve security and efficiency at Category X airports. Selected airports must have space to reduce vulnerabilities and be willing to share costs with the Transportation Security Administration. The Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration will establish a pilot program at 3 airports to test screening security systems and configurations to expedite passenger movement. Airports selected must be Category X airports with space for testing prototypes. The Transportation Security Administration will establish a pilot program at 3 Category X airports to test new security systems. Priority will be given to airports that can provide space for testing prototypes and enter a cost-sharing arrangement for funding. The Administrator must submit a report to specific committees within 90 days of the Act's enactment regarding pilot programs established under sections 2 and 3. Funding for these programs will come from appropriations and reimbursements from airports. The Transportation Security Administration will accept and provide resources for the pilot programs. Section 114(m) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to allow the Under Secretary to accept and provide resources, including services, supplies, equipment, personnel, and facilities, from public or private entities without reimbursement. Additionally, the Under Secretary can accept monetary gifts or bequests upon request, to be used in accordance with the terms of the gift."
