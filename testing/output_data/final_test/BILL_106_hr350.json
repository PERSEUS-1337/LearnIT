The Congress finds that before acting on proposed private sector mandates, it should consider the effects on consumers, workers, and small businesses. The implementation of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 has increased awareness of intergovernmental mandates without affecting existing environmental, public health, or safety laws. This Act will enhance awareness of prospective mandates on the private sector without impacting existing laws. The costs of private sector mandates are often borne by consumers through higher prices and reduced availability, workers through lower wages and benefits, and small businesses through hiring disincentives and stunted growth.
