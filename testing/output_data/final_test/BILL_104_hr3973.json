The Alaska Natives Commission was established to assess the social, cultural, and economic conditions of Alaska's Natives following the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The Commission held regional and statewide hearings between 1992 and 1993. The Alaska Natives Commission, established to assess Alaska Native conditions post the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, found a crisis of unemployment, lack of economic opportunity, alcohol abuse, and high morbidity rates among Alaska Natives. The report was formally conveyed to Congress, the President, and the Governor of Alaska. Government programs for the poor have replaced traditional Alaska Native social safety nets, leading to a loss of self-sufficiency and interdependence. The Alaska Natives Commission suggests that with support from Congress and effective governance, Alaska Natives can undergo a renewal in social, cultural, economic, and spiritual aspects. The Alaska Natives Commission emphasizes the importance of Alaska Natives taking responsibility for their well-being, strengthening their economies, governance, social services, education, health care, and law enforcement, and exercising their rights as citizens. They advocate for self-reliance, self-determination, and preserving the integrity of Native cultures.
