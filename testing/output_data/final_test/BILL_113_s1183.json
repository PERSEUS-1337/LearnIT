The Gift Tax computation is based on different brackets: 18% for amounts up to $10,000, increasing with higher amounts up to 30% for amounts over $100,000. For amounts over $100,000, the Gift Tax rate is $38,800 plus 32% of the excess over $150,000. For amounts over $250,000, the rate is $70,800 plus 34% of the excess over $250,000. For amounts over $500,000, the rate is $155,800 plus 35% of the excess over $500,000.

Additionally, the amendment adjusts the lifetime gift exemption amount under section 2505(a) to $5,000,000. The tax computation is to be adjusted for inflation after 2011, with the dollar amount in subsection (a)(1) increasing annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment. Rounding rules apply for adjusted amounts that are not multiples of $10,000. The tax computation is adjusted for inflation after 2011, with amounts rounded to the nearest multiple of $10,000. Conforming amendments are made to section 2505 of the Code. The amendments made by this section apply to gifts made on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. A transition rule treats the calendar year of enactment as two separate calendar years for tax purposes."
