    "content": "The complex humanitarian emergency is defined by various factors such as population displacement, destruction of social networks, insecurity of civilians, and human rights abuses. Crisis operations increased in war-torn regions in the 1990s, with humanitarian organizations, international actors, and multinational military forces playing a role. The media also had a significant impact on crisis response through greater access and live reporting. Population displacement is a significant consequence of crises resulting from conflict, with refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) requiring protection and sustained emergency assistance from various international entities and organizations. In protracted civil conflicts, humanitarian assistance may be provided to victims for many years. Refugees and IDPs may become stranded in affected areas. Providing humanitarian and refugee assistance in conflict areas is complicated and expensive due to security concerns, funding sources, civil-military relations, human rights issues, and access challenges. Ongoing conflicts in Syria and Iraq highlight these challenges, while natural disasters also require urgent and prolonged assistance. The United States is a major contributor to relief efforts in international crises and disaster situations, with key policy issues in Congress including budget priorities, funding levels, and operational assistance delivery. Congress consistently supports humanitarian efforts in response to natural disasters. The United States has been a significant contributor to international relief efforts, providing over $4 billion annually from FY2008 to FY2012, increasing to $6.4 billion in FY2014, with a focus on responding to crises like the one in Syria. Congressional support for humanitarian assistance is bipartisan, with the President granted broad authority under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide government-funded aid in disaster relief efforts. The U.S. government plays a significant role in providing humanitarian assistance, with the Administrator of USAID coordinating the response to disasters. This includes mobilizing federal agencies, funding private voluntary organizations, and collaborating with other countries. The focus is on addressing urgent needs such as food, shelter, and medical aid in a timely manner to save lives. The U.S. government provides broad humanitarian assistance in response to disasters and international crises, with Congress defining activities to be flexible. Assistance is case-specific and exempt from foreign aid sanctions, allowing the President to provide disaster aid as needed. The U.S. government, through various agencies like USAID, State Department, and Department of Defense, provides humanitarian assistance to countries in need, regardless of restrictions on foreign aid. This assistance includes relief, food aid, refugee programs, and logistical support. USAID is responsible for coordinating U.S. government and private sector foreign assistance efforts. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) coordinates U.S. government emergency assistance during international crises and disasters by providing relief materials and personnel. OFDA was established in 1964 to streamline U.S. response to disasters and works through grants to various organizations. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) coordinates U.S. government emergency assistance during international crises and disasters by providing relief materials and personnel. Funding for USAID/OFDA is authorized and appropriated in annual Foreign Operations legislation. A response to a disaster generally begins with the U.S. ambassador or chief of mission responding to a request from the affected country's government for assistance. OFDA has up to $50,000 immediately available for disaster response, which is released within 24 hours to the USAID mission or U.S. embassy. This money is then provided to local disaster response organizations or used to buy relief supplies. The United States also works with the affected government to determine additional aid needs. USAID/OFDA can respond immediately with cash, relief materials, and personnel. The President has the authority to set terms and conditions for disaster aid provided by USAID/OFDA, which can respond immediately with cash, relief materials, and personnel to any disaster. Assistance typically lasts about 90 days, with monitoring and mitigation projects possibly extending beyond. OFDA has personnel worldwide and Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) that can quickly mobilize for various disasters, with a Response Management Team (RMT) in Washington, DC activated when a DART is deployed. Under disaster assistance legislation, the President can borrow up to $50 million annually from other economic assistance accounts if USAID/OFDA funds are insufficient. Borrowed funds can be repaid through Congress passing a supplemental appropriation. USAID regional bureaus can reprogram projects or transfer funds to USAID/OFDA for disaster-related programs. Facilities, equipment, and personnel from other agencies can be requested, such as U.S. weather prediction facilities and CDC specialists for disease outbreaks. The Food for Peace Act (FFPA), also known as P.L. 480, authorizes foreign food assistance through Title II, Emergency and Private Assistance, administered by USAID. This program provides U.S. agricultural commodities as grant aid for emergency and nonemergency food needs in foreign countries. The legislation grants USAID wide authority to provide food aid, including a \"notwithstanding clause\" to bypass other prohibitions. Commodities can be distributed directly to the needy or sold, bartered, or disposed of in other ways. The United States is a major contributor of emergency food aid in disaster situations, providing assistance to victims of complex humanitarian emergencies. Food aid programs target vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Title II grant food aid is used for humanitarian relief and development purposes through various organizations. The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) and USAID/OFDA provide food aid in disaster-prone regions. U.S. food aid may take months to reach a disaster site and must be shipped on U.S. flagged vessels. Development professionals question the efficiency of U.S. food assistance. Proposed reforms in the FY2014 budget were not adopted by Congress. Section 416 (b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 allows for the donation of surplus U.S. food aid. The Agricultural Act of 1949 allows for the donation of surplus U.S. agricultural commodities to needy countries, managed by the Department of Agriculture. The Office of Civilian-Military Cooperation (CMC) within USAID coordinates humanitarian assistance with the U.S. military to improve development outcomes. Senior USAID staff assess development needs in geographic Combatant Commands. The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) provides post-disaster transition assistance, focusing on short-term peace and democratization projects with some humanitarian elements. OTI funding is often given during the early recovery phase of a disaster. The Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) supports transition efforts. The Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) provides transition assistance for development through early intervention in conflict causes and consequences. USAID manages three funds for disaster assistance focused on specific issues - Displaced Children and Orphans Fund (DCOF), Leahy War Victims Fund (LWVF), and Victims of Torture Fund (VOT). The Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) addresses refugee problems worldwide, including internally displaced persons (IDPs). Humanitarian assistance includes basic needs, community services, and dialogue initiatives. Key issues addressed by PRM include protection, asylum, identification, and returns. The Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) addresses refugee issues globally, providing cash grants to international organizations like UNHCR and ICRC. The Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund (ERMA) allows the President flexibility in responding to refugee emergencies, with a maximum amount of $100 million set by P.L. 103-236. The Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund (ERMA) allows the President to respond to refugee emergencies due to persecution based on religion, race, political opinion, or social group. The law includes a \"notwithstanding clause\" to waive aid prohibitions in other legislation. ERMA requirements include publishing a Presidential Determination and informing congressional committees of drawdowns. The Department of Defense provides support for emergency situations, including food, shelter, logistical support, and medical evacuations. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees DOD humanitarian assistance programs funded through the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Action (OHDACA) account. This includes providing low-cost humanitarian daily rations, coordinating global security cooperation efforts, and managing projects in all Geographic Combatant Commands. DOD provides humanitarian assistance through various programs in response to disasters and emergencies worldwide. The Secretary of State determines when DOD should respond, requesting specific assistance such as transportation, water supplies, and infrastructure repair. Response time depends on the requested aid and mobilization of personnel and equipment. Military personnel may join assessment teams to determine the type of aid needed. DOD provides humanitarian assistance through various programs in response to disasters and emergencies worldwide. Military personnel may join USAID's OFDA assessment team to help determine aid types. DOD limits service activities to stabilizing emergency situations like road or bridge repair, not rebuilding. The Denton program authorizes shipment of privately donated humanitarian goods on U.S. military aircraft. Donated goods can be shipped on commercial vessels using Section 2561 funds. Section 506 (a) (1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 allows the drawdown of military equipment up to $100 million in any fiscal year for unforeseen emergencies. The President must notify Congress before using this provision. Another subset of DOD Humanitarian Assistance, Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA) activities, is authorized under Section 401 of Title 10, U.S. Code. Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA) activities under Title 10 U.S.C. Section 401 authority are separate from HA programs managed by DSCA and placed under direct oversight of Secretary of Defense. Congress funds U.S. humanitarian assistance through global humanitarian accounts, generally approved at requested levels. Congress has provided the President with the authority to borrow up to $50 million from economic assistance accounts in the foreign aid program to cover disaster assistance that exceeds the appropriated amount. Congressional amendments may reimburse agencies for specific disasters as part of the next year's appropriation. Supplemental appropriations are generally supported to replenish emergency accounts or other accounts used for assistance. Difficulty in passing supplemental legislation usually involves non-disaster items or unrelated amendments. Humanitarian assistance funding appropriated through State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs from FY2008 through FY2015 is provided by account and year in the table and graph below. In FY2014, funding for the IDA and MRA accounts increased by approximately 15% each from FY2013, enabling some carryover to meet urgent needs in FY2015. The United States remains a major contributor to relief efforts in international crises and disaster situations, with the number of humanitarian crises due to conflict or natural disasters remaining high. The funding data for U.S. humanitarian assistance shows a steady increase, reaching nearly $6.4 billion in FY2014. This increase is mainly due to Level 3 crises such as Syria, South Sudan, and Iraq. Congress designated a portion of foreign assistance funds as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) starting in FY2012 to cover extraordinary and temporary costs. The OCO designation has replaced the use of supplemental funds for humanitarian assistance. The Obama Administration proposed significant reforms to U.S. food aid funding in FY2014, shifting funds from Food for Peace programs to humanitarian assistance accounts. Although Congress did not adopt these reforms, the issue of food aid reform may resurface. The Administration's FY2016 budget request for global humanitarian accounts totals $5.6 billion, including $1.74 billion for International Disaster Assistance (IDA). The FY2016 budget request includes $810 million for IDA-OCO to address crises in Syria and Iraq, with a significant portion supporting neighboring countries hosting refugees. Additionally, $2.45 billion is requested for MRA, with $1.63 billion for international humanitarian organizations and NGO partners, and $819 million for MRA-OCO for Syrian and Iraqi displacement. The request also includes $50 million for ERMA and $1.4 billion for the Food for Peace program. The United States provides varying amounts of relief and recovery assistance in response to global needs, often in coordination with international partners. The involvement of multiple actors, including U.N. agencies, international organizations, donors, and NGOs, creates coordination challenges and potential duplication of efforts. International actors offer relief through financial contributions, in-kind support, and direct assistance to affected countries. Local, regional, and national authorities also play a role in providing assistance and access control. Relief operations involve various actors such as local aid organizations and the international community, each bringing different strengths to the table. The United Nations collaborates with a range of aid organizations and donors to provide assistance, with agencies like OCHA, WFP, WHO, UNICEF, UNHCR, and UNDP playing key roles in humanitarian efforts. The United Nations, along with various aid organizations and donors, work together to respond to crises. OCHA coordinates with organizations like ICRC and IOM, as well as NGOs who provide operational support on the ground. The level of prior planning and identification of responders is crucial in humanitarian emergencies, with a focus on helping those who are least able to help themselves. Experts stress the importance of learning from past crises to improve communication, coordination, and logistics in providing aid to vulnerable populations. Congress faces challenges in sustaining humanitarian funding amidst domestic budget constraints, with the need to replenish resources for future crises. The United States has shifted away from annual supplemental funding for humanitarian crises, opting to increase funding during the regular appropriations process. Experts warn of negative impacts of relying too heavily on post-disaster supplemental funding, such as budget uncertainty leading to program cuts and delays in decision making. This could affect the credibility and reliability of the U.S. as a partner in humanitarian efforts. The United States' credibility and reliability as a partner in humanitarian assistance are crucial. Congress and the Administration emphasize the importance of measuring the effectiveness and cost of foreign affairs activities, including humanitarian aid. It can be challenging to determine the actual contributions of countries and organizations, as pledges may not always translate into tangible support. Additionally, funds allocated for relief efforts may not always be new contributions, as they could have been redirected from other sources. The allocation of funds for humanitarian emergencies can be complicated, with challenges in determining actual contributions and sharing costs among international donors. Donor fatigue and differing opinions in Congress about the U.S.'s role in providing assistance can impact relief operations during crises. Some experts and Members of Congress are concerned about transparency and accountability in donor contributions for international disaster relief. The United Nations is addressing issues with its financial tracking system. Direct contributions to IOs and NGOs also raise transparency questions. Congressional proposals for conditions and time limits to ensure accountability may lead to pressure to spend funds quickly, potentially resulting in waste and duplication of efforts. Since the 1990s, limitations on humanitarian agencies' operating environment have been debated due to increased insecurity and attacks on staff. Despite a more consistent international response to crises, access to at-risk populations has decreased over time, possibly due to operations in more conflict areas. Some experts suggest that humanitarian agencies face challenges operating independently due to various factors, including the blurring of lines between humanitarian and military actors. The security of humanitarian workers has decreased as they are often not seen as neutral, with concerns about their inclusion in counter-insurgency operations and integrated U.N. missions. Adherence to international humanitarian law and principles like impartiality, neutrality, and independence are crucial in this context. The provision of humanitarian assistance is guided by principles of impartiality, neutrality, and independence, but their application varies among organizations. The security of humanitarian workers is a growing concern, influenced by how roles are defined and the level of protection provided by security forces. Security and access remain top priorities in the humanitarian community. The provision of humanitarian assistance raises concerns about potential misuse and effectiveness, with questions on whether it actually helps or prolongs conflicts. NGO roles and funding sources also play a significant role in this independent enterprise in conflict areas. The debate over humanitarian assistance includes concerns about its impact on conflict duration and the labeling of U.S. aid to ensure recipients know its origin. Balancing visibility as a donor with security risks for aid recipients is a challenge, as is leveraging political objectives without politicizing aid. Questions remain about the political benefits of U.S. humanitarian efforts and whether recipients are aware of its origins, as seen in the case of Syria. Some argue for more aggressive branding of U.S. aid in conflict areas like Syria to show solidarity, but concerns exist about compromising neutrality and risking attacks on labeled organizations. Political considerations influence aid distribution, and the impact of raising awareness of U.S. assistance on local perceptions is uncertain. Humanitarian efforts are debated for their effectiveness in addressing human suffering and achieving strategic objectives. Humanitarian assistance is a flexible policy tool that can be quickly deployed in crises to buy time, keep options open, and achieve minimal consensus on an international response. It can also serve to maintain contact with a country/region, mitigate tensions, avert crises, support allies, and maintain a presence in the region, depending on the situation and strategic interests. The United States' level and sources of humanitarian assistance will impact its standing among allies and foreign policy goals. The President's flexibility in involvement may lead to long-term participation in reconstruction and political solutions amid escalating crises."
