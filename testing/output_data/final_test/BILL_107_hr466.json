    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"PART L--RESOURCE STAFF FOR STUDENTS\" with the addition of \"SEC. 10993. FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that there is a significant need for mental health services for children under 18, with only 1 in 5 receiving the necessary support. The current ratio of students to counselors in schools is 513:1, far above the recommended ratio of 250:1. Schools require more mental health professionals to specifically serve students, as existing counselors are overwhelmed with administrative tasks. Student populations are expected to grow significantly over the next few years, leading to a high demand for school-based services. More than 100,000 new dedicated resource staff for students will be needed to increase student-to-staff service availability. Federal support for reducing the student-to-staff ratio would have benefits such as reduced violence and substance abuse, and improvements in academic achievement. The purpose of this part is to recruit, train, and hire 100,000 school-based resource staff to work with students in grades 6-12. The goals include reducing student-to-counseling ratios, addressing students' mental and emotional needs, and supporting school staff in early intervention and identifying signs of violence and mental health issues. The Student Resource Staff Program aims to recruit, train, and hire 100,000 school-based resource staff to support students in grades 6-12. The program aims to reduce student-to-counseling ratios, address mental and emotional needs, and provide early intervention for signs of violence and mental health issues. The Secretary will make grants to local educational agencies to provide resource staff for students, ensuring fair distribution nationwide. Each grant will last up to 3 years, and agencies must submit applications describing the targeted school population. The program must target a specific population and address their personal, social, emotional, education, and career development needs. It should describe the activities, services, and training provided, methods for evaluating outcomes, qualifications of personnel, and ensure funds are used appropriately. The funds allocated for the program should supplement and increase non-Federal sources, not replace them. Local educational agencies must use the funds to provide resource staff with mental health training and certification to support children and adolescents in schools. To qualify for mental health support in schools, individuals must have national certification in mental health or a related specialty, a master's degree in school counseling, or a master's degree in social work. Additionally, they must meet specific education and internship requirements and hold state licensure or certification in school psychology. Authorization of Appropriations.--$2,800,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $3,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, $3,200,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, and $3,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 and each fiscal year thereafter."
