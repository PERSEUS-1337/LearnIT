    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. Congress finds that the placement of telecommunications facilities near residential properties can devalue properties, impact views, and affect the desire to live in the area. States and local governments should have control over the placement of such facilities through zoning and land use regulations to protect the environment and public health. There are alternatives to building new facilities, such as using existing towers or structures for colocation. Alternative methods of designing towers for telecommunications and broadcast needs include small towers that do not require safety lights, break skylines, or protrude above tree canopies. The Federal Communications Commission proposed a rule in 1997 to preempt State and local zoning ordinances on broadcast transmission facilities. The Federal Communications Commission proposed a rule in 1997 to preempt State and local zoning ordinances on broadcast transmission facilities, but it is in the interest of the Nation that the Commission not adopt this rule. It is suggested that memoranda opinions and orders be modified to allow State and local governments to regulate the placement of telecommunications or broadcast facilities. The Federal Communications Commission does not consider itself a health agency and relies on external experts for guidance on the health and safety effects of radio frequency exposure. The Federal Aviation Administration lacks sufficient authority to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of telecommunications facilities. PCS-Over-Cable, PCS-Over-Fiber, and satellite telecommunications systems offer the opportunity to provide emergency telephone service across the United States. The Federal Aviation Administration lacks authority to regulate telecommunications facilities near airports, which could impact aviation safety and airspace use. The telecommunications industry should adhere to high standards in their interactions with governmental authorities. The Federal Government has made efforts to study the effects of electric and magnetic fields on biological systems through the RAPID Program. However, there has been no similar effort to investigate the potential health effects of radio frequency emissions from telecommunications facilities. The RAPID program could serve as a model for a Federally-sponsored research project to repeal limitations on State and local authority regarding the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities. This Act aims to allow State and local governments to require the use of alternative telecommunication technologies when inconsistent with regulations. The Act aims to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of telecommunications facilities to ensure public safety and airspace efficiency. Applicants and service providers must be accountable for the accuracy of information provided in permit applications. The Act regulates state and local authority over the placement, construction, and modification of telecommunications facilities. The Act amends Section 332(c)(7)(B) of the Communications Act of 1934 to remove limitations on the regulation of personal wireless facilities. It ensures non-discrimination among providers of similar services and updates administrative remedy timelines. The Act amends Section 332(c)(7)(B) of the Communications Act of 1934 to remove limitations on the regulation of personal wireless facilities. It shifts the burden of proof to the party seeking to place, construct, or modify a telecommunications facility. The Federal Communications Commission is prohibited from adopting a rule preempting state and local authority over broadcast transmission facilities. In 1997, the Communications Act of 1934 was amended to grant authority over placement, construction, and modification of transmission facilities. SEC. 337 grants state and local authority over telecommunications facilities. SEC. 337 grants state and local authority over telecommunications facilities, ensuring that no provision of the Act allows for the placement, construction, or modification of facilities in a way that goes against state or local laws or decisions. Additionally, states and local governments can still require safety and interference studies for telecommunications facilities within their jurisdiction. The government has the authority to require environmental and safety compliance documentation for broadcast transmission facilities within its jurisdiction, including adherence to radio frequency exposure limits and aviation safety standards. The government can refuse to grant authority for locating facilities if required studies are not produced. States and local governments can enforce compliance with documentation submitted for placing telecommunication or broadcast facilities within their jurisdiction. SEC. 3. ASSESSMENT OF RESEARCH ON EFFECTS OF RADIO FREQUENCY EMISSIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct an independent assessment on the impact of radio frequency emission on human health through grants to selected entities. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2000 for this assessment. Additionally, a report on existing research evaluating the biological effects of radio frequency emissions on human health will be produced. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide a report on the health effects of radio frequency emissions to Congress by January 1, 2001."
