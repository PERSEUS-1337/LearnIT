    "content": "The COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted the US dependency on China for critical manufacturing and global value chains, especially in medical supplies like PPE and pharmaceuticals. Congress is concerned about these dependencies and has passed legislation to address shortages caused by reduced exports from China. Reduced exports from China have caused shortages of critical medical supplies in the US. The Chinese government nationalized control of medical supply production and directed all production for domestic use, exacerbating shortages in the US and other countries. China's manufacturing sector is recovering from COVID-19, leading to a potential release of medical supplies for overseas delivery. The Chinese government's decisions are influenced by political calculations, similar to recent actions taken with other countries. The COVID-19 outbreak in China peaked in late January 2020, resulting in a significant economic slowdown due to restrictions on movement of people and goods. As China eases restrictions, efforts to restart business activities have been slow and uneven. The resumption of business activities in China has been slow and uneven, leading to shortages in deliveries of various goods for U.S. companies. As China's economic activities resume, there could be intensifying shortages in microelectronics, auto parts, health and medical products, and other imports that transit via container ship. This could impact global trade as bilateral trade may face bottlenecks in inputs and logistics. As China's economic activities resume, global trade faces potential slowdowns in demand, transportation, and logistics. Suppressed global demand may complicate efforts to revive China's economy. Concerns arise about China overwhelming overseas markets with exports to offset the economic downturn. Congressional decisions will impact long-term U.S. trade relations with China. Some Members have raised concerns about U.S. supply chain dependence on China for critical products, especially during crises or if China nationalizes industries. The COVID-19 pandemic could increase reliance on Chinese medical supplies in the short term. Diversification efforts are being incentivized. Bilateral trade with China is crucial for the U.S. economy, affecting various industries. Total U.S. trade with the world was $5.6 trillion in 2019, equivalent to 26% of U.S. GDP. In 2019, U.S. trade with China totaled $558.9 billion, with China being the third largest export market for U.S. goods. U.S. goods exports to China were valued at $106.6 billion, while goods imports from China reached $452.2 billion. Services exports to China were $56.7 billion, and services imports were $18 billion. U.S. foreign direct investment in China was $116.5 billion, while China's investment in the U.S. was $60.2 billion in 2018. Top U.S. exports to China include semiconductor chips, devices, parts, and manufacturing. Since late January, the outbreak of COVID-19 in China has directly impacted U.S. firms operating in China, exporting to or selling goods and services in China, or relying on Chinese goods and services. Top U.S. exports to China in 2018 included semiconductor chips, agriculture, aircraft, optical and medical equipment, autos, plastics, and pharmaceutical products. Top U.S. imports from China in 2018 included microelectronics, appliances, toys, apparel, auto parts, iron and steel articles, medical instruments, and organic chemicals. China's economy experienced a sharp drop in economic growth and exports in Q1 2020. The global spread of COVID-19 has caused a worldwide economic fallout, impacting key industries like microelectronics production. The United States could also face a similar drop in imports from China, particularly in mobile phones and computers. Foxconn, a Taiwan firm producing iPhones for Apple in China, has faced challenges despite reopening its facilities in mid-February. Foxconn, a Taiwan firm producing iPhones for Apple in China, received government permission to reopen its facilities in mid-February. Challenges include quarantine and transportation restrictions, potential labor concerns, and supply constraints for key microelectronics inputs. Other companies using Foxconn for contract manufacturing in China include Amazon, Cisco, Dell, Google, Hewlett Packard, Nintendo, Sony, Huawei, and Xiaomi. The U.S. auto industry and manufacturers in South Korea, Japan, and Germany are facing manufacturing bottlenecks due to the lack of availability of auto parts supplies from China. The spread of COVID-19 to major auto manufacturing markets like the United States, Germany, Japan, and South Korea may pose additional constraints. China exported $9.6 billion in auto parts to the United States in 2019. China exported $9.6 billion in auto parts to the United States in 2019. U.S. manufacturing faces potential shortages of intermediate inputs for steelmaking and heavy manufacturing, such as refined manganese metal, ferrosilicon, and ferrovanadium. Manganese and ferrovanadium are steel strengtheners that depend on China-based processing. While manganese is mined around the world, China controls 97% of manganese processing. Ferrosilicon is used to extract oxygen from liquid steel and is mostly produced in China. U.S. retailers, tourism, and service providers that rely on the Chinese consumer base have also taken a hit, with many closing or significantly reducing operations in response to COVID-19. For example, Starbucks closed about half its 4,200 retail outlets in China between late January and late February. The COVID-19 outbreak has led to a significant reduction in global transportation links, impacting the transport of products and manufacturing inputs. Passenger air traffic and container shipments have slowed down, affecting air cargo capacity and port operations. U.S. airlines have suspended flights to China, leading to disruptions in supply chains and revenue losses for retailers and tourism service providers. China's outbound tourism spending in 2018 was $277 billion, with $36 billion spent in the United States. United Airlines announced steep flight cuts in early March 2020 due to COVID-19, with ticket bookings down 70% for Asia-Pacific flights. Revenue in April and May could drop by as much as 70%. Federal Express (FedEx) and United Parcel Service (UPS) continued running flights in affected countries but warned of potential delays in shipments. Quarantine measures and restrictions in China significantly curtailed shipments, with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) imposing further restrictions on airlines. The Civil Aviation Administration of China restricted airlines to one flight per week, impacting air freight capacity. Container shipping from China faces constraints due to worker shortages and trucking issues, affecting U.S. imports and exports. Ports in Los Angeles and New York project significant drops in cargo volumes, with requests for federal aid to offset losses. Southern California jobs tied to ports are at risk. In the immediate term, shipping and logistical constraints are slowing U.S. exports to Asia. U.S. exporters are facing shortages of refrigerated containers and overflowing cold storage facilities. Global manufacturing, including production shifted out of China, is still recovering from supply disruptions. Asian countries like Vietnam, Taiwan, and South Korea are experiencing Q1 supply shortages due to strong supply chain links with China. COVID-19 outbreaks in these countries and others like South Korea and Italy are further complicating recovery efforts. Disruptions in Chinese supply chains due to COVID-19 are impacting U.S. imports from China, leading to potential shortages of raw materials and consumer products. U.S. firms may diversify away from China and explore new supply chains. Opportunities for increased exports to China may arise once global port operations resume. Increased U.S. exports to China could be driven by recent tariff liberalization under the phase one trade deal signed in January 2020. China announced a tariff exemption process for various products, including agriculture and medical supplies. The U.S. government may push China to meet purchase targets, but COVID-19 could hinder progress due to economic fallout in both countries. China committed to buying at least $200 billion above a 2017 baseline amount of U.S. agriculture and energy products. China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced detailed rules for the application and allocation of grain and cotton import tariff-rate quotas for 2020, specifying imports for wheat, corn, rice, and cotton. Companies applying for tariff-rate quotas must have a \"positive record\" in China's corporate social credit system, allowing the Chinese government to restrict certain U.S. cotton exporters. This could create counter pressure in response. China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced rules for grain and cotton import quotas in 2020, with a requirement for a \"positive record\" in China's corporate social credit system for U.S. cotton exporters. This could be used by China to retaliate against recent U.S. actions blocking imports of textiles with Xinjiang cotton. Falling oil prices may force China to buy more goods to meet purchase obligations, raising doubts about the implementation of the U.S.-China phase one trade deal signed in January 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan has led to Chinese companies invoking force majeure, such as CNPC cancelling LNG imports. Chinese companies interpret force majeure differently from the US, allowing them to cancel obligations. The Ministry of Commerce is providing free certifications for force majeure declarations. In China, force majeure is used to cancel obligations, with the invoking party being released from their duties while the other party may still need to fulfill contract terms. Chinese courts are unlikely to support foreign firms in prosecuting Chinese companies for non-performance. The US is facing shortages of medical supplies amid the pandemic, prompting Congress to address the issue. China's role as a major supplier of medical products to the US is crucial. China's role as a major U.S. and global supplier of medical PPE, devices, antibiotics, and pharmaceutical ingredients has led to shortages in the United States. Reduced exports from China, due to increased demand and nationalization of supplies, have impacted the availability of critical medical supplies. In 2019, China exported $9.8 billion in medical supplies and $7.4 billion in organic chemicals to the U.S. There are no agreed-upon standards for classifying these products, but U.S. imports of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies were estimated at $20.7 billion. In early February 2020, the Chinese government nationalized control of medical supplies production and distribution in response to COVID-19 concerns. The NDRC took over authority from the Ministry of Information Industry and Technology, directing all medical-related production, including U.S. companies' production lines in China, for domestic use. Foreign firms like 3M and Foxconn complied with government directives. China nationalized medical supplies production in response to COVID-19, leading to a shift in operations by foreign firms like 3M and Foxconn. By late February 2020, China increased face mask production to over 100 million a day. This move may have limited access to critical medical supplies for countries reliant on open markets. China's Ministry of Commerce directed efforts to secure medical supplies globally, potentially worsening shortages in the United States and other markets. China's Ministry of Commerce nationalized medical supplies production to counter COVID-19, leading to increased imports of essential PPE and medical supplies. This policy resulted in a decrease in China's exports of critical medical products to the world. The Australian government imposed temporary restrictions on foreign investment proposals, particularly from Chinese investors, due to concerns about strategic acquisitions of distressed assets. Chinese property developers in Australia were found purchasing large quantities of medical supplies for shipment to China. Risland and Greenland Australia, subsidiaries of major Chinese developers, were involved in shipping medical supplies back to China. Greenland Group, backed by the Chinese government, instructed its Australian subsidiary to secure bulk medical supplies from the global market. Greenland sourced 3 million protective masks, 700,000 hazmat suits, and 500,000 gloves from Australia and other countries for export to China. Shortages of medical supplies are worsened by reduced production and exports from China. 3M sold all masks from its Shanghai factory to meet China's demand, while other manufacturers await export authorization. China denies imposing export restrictions on medical supplies. President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act of 1950 in response to COVID-19, granting broad authorities to mobilize domestic industry for national defense. This was in reaction to reported shortages of medical supplies, including PPE, in the US since February. The Defense Production Act of 1950 allows the President to prioritize government contracts and control the distribution of materials for national defense. Limited direction is provided to the private sector under this authority, potentially causing delays in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic due to the need for increased production of PPE and ventilators. Many U.S. firms are hesitant to invest in production without guaranteed buyers. Manufacturing firms like General Motors, Ford, and Tesla are repurposing factories for ventilator production, but experts anticipate this will take months. In the US, PPE and ventilators require FDA approval. The late activation of the Defense Production Act by the Trump Administration allowed US companies to choose between domestic or export orders. Other countries like Taiwan, Thailand, France, and Germany increased production but restricted exports, limiting US supply options. In early 2020, U.S. private sector relief efforts bought large amounts of PPE for China, depleting U.S. supplies. Some Members of Congress called for tariff relief, while others argued against it fearing an influx of imports during an economic downturn. The USTR lifted tariffs on certain medical supplies from China but hesitated to liberalize non-health related tariffs. In late March 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection may approve delays in tariff payments and consider suspending duties to provide economic relief during COVID-19. USTR is seeking public comments on extending tariff exclusions for products granted in June 2019. There are concerns that liberalizing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods could expose the U.S. economy to Chinese industrial capacity and market share gains. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) arranged airlift for 22 flights from Asia to quickly bring overseas medical supplies into the United States. This accelerates delivery time by shipping by air instead of ocean freight. A longer-term disruption of China's pharmaceutical and medical exports could increase the cost of everyday drugs and routine medical procedures in the United States. China is a major exporter of drugs and biologics to the United States, accounting for a significant portion of imports. The FDA faces challenges in determining the volume of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) manufactured in China due to supply chain complexity. A slowdown in API exports from China could lead to cost pressures for U.S. drug manufacturers, as China supplies a large percentage of key medications like penicillin and tetracycline. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn recently announced a shortage of a drug due to an affected Chinese API manufacturer amid the COVID-19 outbreak. The FDA did not disclose the name of the drug affected by COVID-19, but noted that alternatives are available for patients. China's role as the primary supplier of APIs to global manufacturers, especially in India, may increase costs of generic pharmaceuticals in the short-to-medium term. The outbreak in India could also impact the availability of generic drugs in the US, as India imports 70% of its APIs from China. India's export restrictions on drugs reliant on Chinese supply chains have raised concerns about potential global shortages, exacerbated by a nationwide lockdown. Amid concerns about the availability of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, nations have imposed export controls on these products due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures highlight the risks of relying on global supply chains and distribution channels, potentially causing delays or cancellations in transactions. The WTO is publishing a list of temporary export bans enacted during COVID-19 for transparency. G-20 emphasized keeping markets open and fair distribution of medical products. China, India, and the EU have imposed export limits. Measures could restrict US access to certain imports like medical ventilators. China's leaders are prioritizing resuming manufacturing production to boost economic growth. They are focusing on stabilizing employment and streamlining business approvals. Government support is being offered to address shortages of labor and raw materials. China plays a significant role in the supply chain for various imports, including medical ventilators, breathing masks, CT scanners, medical protective equipment, thermometers, pharmaceuticals, and antibiotics like tetracycline and penicillin. The Chinese government is supporting infrastructure projects and addressing shortages of labor, raw materials, funds, and protective gear to boost economic activity. Transportation is operating normally, with some regions operating close to 100% capacity. However, the resumption of operations by companies may not mean they are fully online or at pre-crisis levels. Economic analysts are using alternative measures like traffic congestion and air pollution levels to gauge business resumption rates. Many measures suggest that businesses in China are not fully returning to capacity as reported by local governments. In Wuhan, certain companies were allowed to resume work early, including those in the medical industry and critical supply chains. China's economy relies on exports and foreign firms, with efforts to stabilize foreign investment and trade. On March 12 and 13, Commerce Vice Minister Wang Shouwen engaged with American and European Chambers of Commerce in China to urge companies to reopen and increase investments. Various Chinese agencies were also involved in the discussions to stabilize foreign investment and trade. During past crises, China has encouraged firms to keep facilities production-ready and retain workers for social stability. China's stimulus efforts aim to maintain social stability by keeping facilities production-ready and retaining workers. Despite a 17% drop in exports in January-February 2020, Chinese industry may have had sufficient stock for export due to the economy being shuttered in February. This indicates the potential power of a resumed export push from China, which is crucial for the global economy. The United States and other countries are now potentially vulnerable to a concerted Chinese export push. China's steel production remained high during the COVID-19 crisis, leading to a 3% increase in production for January-February 2020 compared to 2019. With domestic demand collapsing, China's finished steel inventories surged by 45% during the same period. This surge in production and inventory levels could potentially result in a concerted Chinese export push to reduce inventories and generate cash, posing a threat to global markets. China's steel production in 2019 reached almost 1 billion tons, with China accounting for over 50% of global supply. To boost targeted exports during the COVID-19 crisis, China increased the export VAT rebate for 1,500 products, including steel, construction materials, insecticides, and chemicals. This policy aims to reduce inventories and generate cash, potentially posing a threat to global markets. China is promoting the export of insecticides, chemicals, and agricultural products to increase purchases from the United States. The export VAT rebates are incentivizing the export of wild animals and their byproducts overseas. China has banned the sale and consumption of wild animals in response to concerns about the origin of COVID-19. China is capitalizing on investments made during the COVID-19 outbreak to push ahead on goals outlined in its Made in China 2025 industrial plan, aiming to create competitive advantages in strategic industries and reduce reliance on foreign firms and their intellectual property. The Trump Administration's Section 301 actions against China target the distortions and predatory policies of the Made in China 2025 industrial plan, particularly in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. Chinese government restrictions on market access for foreign firms include clinical trial requirements, disclosure of proprietary information, and production mandates. These policies persist despite amendments to the Drug Administration Act in 2019. Despite amendments to the Drug Administration Act in 2019, China's policies continue to restrict access to medical information about COVID-19, potentially putting U.S. science and industry at a disadvantage. The government's tight controls over biotechnology and pharmaceutical testing could advantage its state firms, as seen in the centralized handling of viral samples from the COVID-19 outbreak. The Wuhan Institute of Virology, a national lab run by China's military, centralizes government knowledge on virus origins and treatment. It operates China's only P4 lab for studying contagious diseases. China controlled access to health information, delaying WHO's visit and foreign drug patents. Gilead Sciences, a U.S. company, faced delays in obtaining approval for patents on Remdesivir in China during the COVID-19 crisis. The Chinese government required clinical trials and benefited from foreign companies sharing drug samples and insights. The Chinese government cracked down on BrightGene BioMedical Technology Co. for prematurely announcing a generic version of Remdesivir. This move may be to position China's national labs, like the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has applied to patent an adaptation of Remdesivir. China is offering significant funding to Chinese biotech and pharmaceutical companies to combat COVID-19. Jointown, a top Chinese medical supplier, issued preferential bonds, and the State Council's CITIC purchased private placement shares in the company. China's leadership is using its control of medical production and supply chains to help other countries selectively, while promoting ties to China. State media emphasizes China's interest in global medical leadership. Efforts include a new initiative called Health Silk Road to promote Chinese leadership in the health sector and deflect criticism. The Chinese government took extraordinary measures during the COVID-19 outbreak to sustain R&D and manufacturing in strategic sectors like telecommunications and semiconductors, potentially impacting competitive market positions of U.S. and foreign firms. Special transportation and quarantined dormitories were operated at Yangtze Memory Technology, Co., Ltd. YMTC, a national champion in memory chip development located in Wuhan, China, received special government dispensation to continue operations during the COVID-19 outbreak. HiSilicon, a semiconductor subsidiary of Huawei, also sustained operations. Huawei plans to increase its R&D budget by $5.8 billion in 2020. These decisions by Chinese companies could impact U.S. trade relations with China and the global economy. The COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted global supply chains, leading to a decrease in transportation, services, and manufacturing production. This has caused shortages of essential medical supplies and a decline in consumer demand. There are growing concerns about U.S. dependence on China for critical products, with debates on potential steps to address this issue. Some U.S. companies and Members of Congress are suggesting lowering tariffs on goods from China. The urgent need for pharmaceutical and medical supplies is increasing U.S. reliance on China trade. China's industrial policies aim to advance in global industrial value chains, raising concerns about U.S. dependency on China as a competitive supplier. China is selectively releasing medical supplies to designated countries, potentially for political reasons. Some countries are paying for the supplies, while others may receive aid. There are reports of faulty Chinese medical supplies and testing kits. China may be using the crisis to push substandard products and gain market share over traditional U.S. suppliers. PRC state propaganda blames FDA for shortages of Chinese products for export. U.S. suppliers in China, already FDA certified, face challenges exporting to the U.S. Some companies lack PRC authorization. Congress must decide on incentivizing domestic production of health supplies and potentially imposing conditions. Considerations include diversifying supply chains and on-shoring capabilities. The U.S. may need to diversify supply chains and on-shore capabilities to counter China's dominance in the medical market post-COVID-19. Recent legislative actions, like the CARES Act, aim to address drug shortages and expand reporting requirements for medical devices. Collaboration with other countries and mitigating impacts on lesser-developed economies are also considerations. The CARES Act addresses drug shortages and expands reporting requirements for medical devices and pharmaceutical supply chains. It also includes provisions for companies to report on API sources and encourages the purchase of American pharmaceuticals by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. Additionally, the bill provides federal financing guarantees to U.S. medical supply companies. The Medical Supply Chain Security Act, S. 3343, aims to enhance the security of the medical supply chain by increasing FDA authority and requiring manufacturers to report shortages. It also includes provisions for federal financing guarantees to U.S. medical supply companies and economic incentives for producing pharmaceuticals and medical equipment in the United States. Additionally, the bill would establish a registry to track APIs and require a country-of-origin label for imported drugs. The Safe Medicine Act, H.R. 5982, would require FDA waiver for purchasing pharmaceutical products from China. The No Chinese Handouts In National Assistance (CHINA) Act, H.R. 6386, prohibits funds for Chinese government-controlled entities. The Pharmaceutical Independence Long-Term Readiness Act, H.R. 4710, directs the Department of Defense to enhance pharmaceutical independence. The Securing America's Medicine Cabinet Act of 2020 aims to strengthen U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply chains. It includes provisions to enhance FDA's advanced manufacturing programs and designate research universities as centers of excellence. Additionally, there are bills and resolutions introduced to amend provisions under the Defense Production Act and facilitate the production of medical supplies. The Trump Administration drafted an Executive Order in mid-March 2020 to increase U.S. production capacity for medical supplies and eliminate loopholes allowing overseas purchases. COVID-19 highlights the impact of disruptions in critical supplies from China to the United States, raising questions about future economic and trade relations. The Trump Administration drafted an Executive Order in mid-March 2020 to increase U.S. production capacity for medical supplies and eliminate loopholes allowing overseas purchases. COVID-19 highlights the impact of disruptions in critical supplies from China to the United States, raising questions about future economic and trade relations. Congress faces interrelated questions about calibrating trade policy to position the United States in the current crisis and beyond, including concerns about U.S. dependencies on China in critical areas like microelectronics. The United States has imposed tariffs on China in response to unfair trading practices, leading to a trade war. Tariff relief for medical supplies could incentivize imports, but deeper issues like supply shortages and export constraints remain. Tariff liberalization has not addressed industrial policies within borders, such as regulatory standards and local content requirements imposed by China. Recent actions by countries imposing export barriers highlight gaps in WTO rules prohibiting export bans during global crises. US import requirements liberalization has led to challenges like reporting shortages and classifying imported content for pharmaceutical firms. This could benefit Chinese industrial policies in medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, potentially overwhelming global markets. Additional policy measures may be necessary to address China's export-driven economic recovery. The outbreak of COVID-19 has exposed gaps in U.S. understanding of domestic competencies and dependencies on China and other sources of global supply. Congress may need to monitor potential predatory commercial activity and consider imposing requirements to address vulnerabilities in raw materials supply chains. The United States has relaxed definitions of U.S. products with imported content, masking reliance on overseas inputs. Pharmaceutical company stockpiles are proprietary, only reported in case of shortfall, hindering national planning. The International Investment Survey Act of 1976 grants the President authority to collect corporate activity abroad for statistical purposes. The President has the authority to request mandatory surveys of companies, with penalties for noncompliance. Congress could consider requesting surveys on corporate activity abroad, including supply chain information on PPE and medical supplies, especially in China. This data could inform legislation on overseas supply chains, including sourcing from China. The U.S. federal government plays a crucial role in ensuring adequate production, contracting, and distribution of medical supplies, especially in the current crisis. Lack of coordination has led to states competing for critical supplies. Congress may explore how the government positions itself in relation to states, private actors, and foreign governments in securing supplies. The U.S. government's posture towards securing medical supplies globally is crucial in countering China's dominance in the market. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for expanded production capacity in the U.S. to support not only domestic needs but also those of other countries. China's export restraints have strained the global supply chain, leading to countries closing borders and restricting access to supplies. This situation underscores the importance of reaffirming U.S. global leadership in trade and health issues. China's market power over other countries' procurement decisions is evident as they control and release supplies through contracts and aid, potentially improving their global image. Concerns arise about China manipulating the crisis for political gain and dominating global supply chains. Analysts worry that China's economic recovery could challenge the open trade system by exporting excess capacity without considering global market conditions. China's market power in global supply chains is raising concerns about political manipulation and dominance. Analysts worry about China's economic recovery impacting the open trade system. Members may use hearings and legislation to address key issues, including economic openness, diversifying medical supply sources, and countering China's control of the COVID-19 narrative. Some Members are calling for hearings to address the role of the WHO during the COVID-19 outbreak and the need to reform global health governance. Others are examining the chronology of events in the outbreak to counter Chinese state propaganda. Several Members are interested in holding China accountable for its slow response to the outbreak as required by H.R. 6373. H.R. 6373 requires WHO members to address the COVID-19 outbreak. P.L. 116-136 waives oversight requirements under the Defense Production Act for purchases over $50 million. Notifications to congressional committees are necessary for such actions. H.R. 6373 increases funding for the Defense Production Act Fund to $3 billion for FY2020-2021 to respond to the COVID-19 emergency. It also includes provisions for enhanced oversight through mandatory quarterly reporting to congressional committees and the public. H.R. 6399 and S. 3568 propose amendments to the Defense Production Act of 1950 to increase production of essential medical supplies in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. S. 3568 specifically targets the production of N95 respirators, medical ventilators, face shields, gloves, gowns, and other necessary equipment. The bill, S.Res. 547, urges the President to utilize the Defense Production Act to boost the production of medical supplies for the COVID-19 crisis. It emphasizes the need for increased production of personal protective equipment and supports the distribution of medical materials to restock the Strategic National Stockpile. Additionally, S. 3570 aims to expedite the procurement of essential medical equipment. S. 3570 bill aims to expedite procurement of critical medical equipment under the Defense Production Act of 1950. It includes major purchase orders for N95 masks, a national assessment of medical supply needs, waiving restrictions on orders, and increased funding for DPA accounts. H.Res. 906 calls on the President to invoke the Defense Production Act in response to COVID-19. H.R. 6398 and S. 3570 aim to expedite procurement of critical medical equipment under the Defense Production Act of 1950. The bills include major purchase orders for N95 masks, a national assessment of medical supply needs, waiving restrictions on orders, and increased funding for DPA accounts. Congress stands ready to make additional appropriations available for this effort. H.R. 6390 aims to compel the President to use the Defense Production Act to produce medical equipment for COVID-19, including N95 respirators, ventilators, face shields, gloves, and gowns. It also requires establishing prices for these goods."
