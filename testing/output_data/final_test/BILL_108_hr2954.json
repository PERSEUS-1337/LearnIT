CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\" During World War II, thousands of Jews and others were deported from France to Nazi concentration camps on trains operated by SNCF. US citizens and servicemen were among those deported. Lawsuits have been filed against SNCF in the US for their role in the deportations. The complaint alleges that SNCF, a separate entity during World War II, operated deportation trains for profit, collaborating willingly with the German Nazi regime. SNCF provided rolling stock, scheduled departures, and charged ordinary passenger fares for deportations to concentration camps. The plaintiffs allege that SNCF operated deportation trains for profit during World War II, collaborating with the Nazi regime. Passengers of all ages were crowded into train cars without food, water, or sanitary facilities, with corpses removed after each trip. The destination was a camp where deportees faced extermination, forced labor, or inhumane conditions, violating the Principles of the Nuremberg Tribunal. SNCF operated deportation trains during World War II, collaborating with the Nazi regime and violating the Principles of the Nuremberg Tribunal. SNCF has not compensated deportees or their heirs, and its wartime archives remain closed to the public. SNCF claimed sovereign immunity in a lawsuit despite being one of the world's largest corporations. SNCF, a major corporation, earns millions in the US and is not immune in France. The lawsuit against SNCF was initially dismissed but later appealed and remanded for further proceedings. The case is significant for US citizens and veterans, with SNCF trying to avoid liability using the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. SNCF faces lawsuit in the US, trying to avoid accountability by invoking Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. The rule of separate entities does not grant immunity in this case. Access to United States courts for Holocaust deportees is addressed in Section 2. The United States district courts have jurisdiction over civil actions for damages related to deportation to Nazi concentration camps between 1942 and 1944, brought against railroads that owned or operated the trains. Other laws do not apply to these cases. The United States district courts have jurisdiction over civil actions for damages related to deportation to Nazi concentration camps between 1942 and 1944, brought against railroads that owned or operated the trains. Sections 1330 and 1601 through 1611 of title 28, United States Code, or any other law limiting the jurisdiction of the United States courts, shall not preclude any action under this section. No action described in this section shall be barred by a defense that the time for bringing such action has expired under a statute of limitations. This section applies to any action pending on January 1, 2002, and to any action commenced on or after that date."
