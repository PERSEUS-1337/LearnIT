It includes findings related to postpartum depression. Postpartum depression is a mood disorder that affects many women during and after pregnancy. It can be categorized into three subgroups: \"baby blues,\" postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, and postpartum psychosis. \"Baby blues\" is characterized by mood swings, tearfulness, irritability, and poor sleep. Postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, including postpartum depression and psychosis, have symptoms defined in the DSM. Postpartum psychosis involves losing touch with reality, distorted thinking, and hallucinations. Baby blues affect 80% of new mothers, postpartum depression 10-20%, and postpartum psychosis 1 in 1,000. Causes of postpartum depression are complex. Postpartum depression is a complex disorder with causes including hormone level changes, difficult labor, lack of support, and previous history of depression. It is treatable with prompt diagnosis and personalized care. Postpartum depression can lead to further issues like substance abuse, loss of employment, divorce, and even suicide if left untreated. This is often due to social stigma, lack of self-diagnosis, shame, and economic pressures. Treatment involves a personalized regimen of care including social support, therapy, medication, and hospitalization when necessary. Postpartum depression, if untreated, can lead to social alienation, self-destructive behavior, and even suicide. It also impacts society through the infant's physical, psychological, and cognitive development, as well as the risk of child abuse, neglect, or death. The Act aims to support new mothers struggling with postpartum conditions. The Act establishes a program of grants for the delivery of services regarding postpartum depression and psychosis. The Secretary shall make grants for projects to provide education on postpartum conditions to new mothers and their families, and to deliver essential services to individuals with postpartum conditions. Grants may be made to entities that meet the specified criteria. Grants are made to specific entities, such as states or public/nonprofit organizations, that submit applications to the Secretary as required. The Secretary may require information in a certain manner. Projects under subsection (a)(1) should provide education on postpartum conditions, conduct training programs, and offer screening and referral services. States receiving grants must ensure that postpartum education meets requirements.
