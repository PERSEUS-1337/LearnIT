    "content": "The U.S. Trade Representative notified Congress of the Trump Administration's intent to renegotiate NAFTA, sparking congressional attention. NAFTA eliminated tariffs on textile and apparel trade between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, leading to increased production integration. The Trump Administration aims to renegotiate NAFTA to maintain duty-free access for U.S. textile and apparel products in Mexico and Canada. Changes in customs enforcement and rules of origin could impact the textile and apparel industries. U.S. stakeholders urge the Administration to avoid disrupting trade and investment linkages encouraged by NAFTA. Since NAFTA took effect over two decades ago, the U.S. textile industry has undergone significant changes, becoming highly automated and capital-intensive. U.S. textile manufacturers, generating $18.3 billion in value added in 2016, produce yarns and fabrics from raw materials like cotton. The industry has adapted its North American production around NAFTA's terms. The United States is a major producer of cotton and man-made fibers. U.S. textile mills have seen a 70% drop in cotton consumption since 1997 due to competition from imported products. Mexico is the 5th largest export market for U.S. raw cotton, while Canada ranks 35th. China dominates global production of man-made fibers, particularly polyester. The U.S. textile industry is a supplier to various sectors like apparel, home textiles, and technical textiles. NAFTA led to a decrease in domestic apparel industry consumption of U.S.-manufactured fibers. The U.S.'s share of global apparel exports has declined, with 98% of apparel purchased by U.S. consumers being produced outside the country. Mexico was a leading source of U.S. apparel imports but has since declined. Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, Mexico has fallen to sixth place in U.S. apparel imports behind China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and India. U.S.-headquartered apparel firms now often manufacture in low-cost regions through a mix of owned facilities and third-party arrangements. NAFTA rules have encouraged sourcing from Mexican plants using U.S.-made materials. About 40% of domestic textile output is used for home textiles and furnishings. In 2015, 40% of domestic textile output was used for home textiles, furnishings, and floor coverings. U.S. manufacturers of these products have fared better against import competition due to automation and less reliance on labor costs. The carpet and rug mill industry's health is influenced by domestic housing and commercial building construction, raw material prices, and competition from foreign producers. Canada and Mexico are the top export markets for U.S. made-up textiles. Technical textiles are used across various industrial sectors. Textiles, including technical textiles, account for half of U.S. textile output in 2015. The U.S. is a leader in producing technical textiles due to advanced manufacturing processes and research. Mexico is the largest market for U.S. technical textiles, followed by Canada. Industrial protective apparel is also in demand in Canada, especially in industries like oil and gas and construction. The automotive industry is a significant user of technical textiles in the U.S., with proposed NAFTA changes potentially impacting domestic producers. The proposed changes would require motor vehicles to have 85% North American content and 50% U.S. content to qualify for tariff-free treatment. This could lead to auto manufacturers importing more passenger cars from outside the NAFTA region and paying the 2.5% U.S. import duty instead. NAFTA has been criticized for causing a loss of production and employment in U.S. manufacturing, including the textile and apparel sectors. However, the impact of NAFTA on these industries is complex, with various factors contributing to their decline over the past quarter-century. The textile industry has been less prone to relocation to lower-wage countries compared to apparel manufacturing due to its capital- and scale-intensive nature, requiring higher worker skills. Since 1994, textile manufacturers in the U.S. have lost about 500,000 jobs, with direct employment dropping to around 230,000 in 2016. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a further decline to about 185,000 by 2026. Output by U.S. textile mills peaked in December 1997 but has since decreased significantly, with production in 2016 being 29% lower than in 2007 and about 60% lower than in 1997. The number of textile mills has also decreased by half since 1997. Textile production in the United States has significantly declined since 1997, with output in 2016 being 34% lower than a decade ago. The number of textile mills has decreased by half, and the industry has seen a decline in employees by three-quarters. Despite this, significant textile production remains in the country, with mills investing in technology to reduce costs. Textile production requires substantial capital investment, with weaving mills costing $12-25 million and spinning mills costing $50-70 million. The industry ranks high in productivity increases due to automation and the closure of less efficient mills. Textile production in the United States has declined significantly since 1997, with a 34% decrease in output by 2016. The number of textile mills operating in the country dropped by 10% from 2005 to 2015, leading to a decrease in jobs from 242,900 in 1994 to about 115,000 in 2016. The impact of imports on employment was minimal, but the collapse of the domestic apparel industry and changing clothing preferences may have had a more significant effect on domestic textile production. Textile production is mainly concentrated in the southeastern states and California, with every state having some textile manufacturing presence. In 2016, textile jobs were mainly located in Georgia and North Carolina, with a significant decline in apparel production and companies in the sector. Apparel manufacturers employed about 128,800 workers in 2016, a decrease from 1990. The number of domestic apparel manufacturers also decreased, with industry output declining by 85% between 1997 and 2016. Apparel production hit an all-time low in September 2017, with a decrease of 11% since the start of the year. US apparel brands and retailers heavily rely on global supply chains for sourcing decisions. Apparel production in the United States has declined as manufacturers opt for lower-wage countries like Mexico. The focus is now on niche products and military market, with a decrease in manufacturing jobs since 1990. NAFTA may have played a role, but the growth in apparel manufacturing for the U.S. market is mainly in Asian countries. The U.S. apparel industry has shifted lower-skilled production jobs offshore to Asian countries. The industry retains higher-paying jobs like design and marketing. Robotic sewing machines may automate some apparel assembly in the future. The U.S. has a strong export position in yarns and fabrics, with a trade surplus in textiles. In 2016, the United States had a textile trade deficit of $18.8 billion, with import penetration reaching 40%. The US exported $6 billion in yarns and fabrics to NAFTA partners, with a trade surplus of $4.1 billion in yarns and fabrics with both Canada and Mexico. U.S. textile products are used by apparel producers in Canada and Mexico for goods exported to the United States. In 2016, the United States had a textile trade deficit of $18.8 billion, with import penetration reaching 40%. The US exported $6 billion in yarns and fabrics to NAFTA partners, with a trade surplus of $4.1 billion in yarns and fabrics with both Canada and Mexico. U.S. textile products are used by apparel producers in Canada and Mexico for goods exported to the United States. In addition, U.S. yarns and fabrics were exported to the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) region, resulting in a $2.3 billion trade surplus. Only a small amount of U.S. yarns and fabrics were exported to the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries. Mexico was the largest source of apparel imports into the U.S. market, reaching a market share of 14.4% following the signing of NAFTA in 1994. Mexico had a trade deficit of $2.7 billion with the United States in apparel products last year. Mexico benefited from quota-free access to the U.S. market, giving its apparel an advantage over other countries subject to U.S. quotas on textile and apparel imports through 2004. After NAFTA was implemented in 1994, Mexico became the largest source of apparel imports into the U.S. market, with a market share of 14.4%. However, once textile and apparel quotas were removed, Mexican apparel exports to the United States began to decline due to high import tariffs. Despite NAFTA exempting Mexico from these tariffs, its apparel industry struggled to compete with leading Asian exporters. Producers in North America, especially Mexico, had to adapt to increased global competition. Producers in North America, particularly Mexico, have faced growing global competition, including from other Western Hemisphere textile producers under CAFTA-DR. However, the main challenge comes from China and Vietnam, which are leading sources of low-cost apparel for U.S. importers. The NAFTA supply chain involves the U.S. exporting textiles to Mexico or Canada, where they are turned into apparel for sale in the U.S. market. Canada and Mexico have limited textile and apparel trade between each other. Canadian apparel producers have turned to Mexico for lower-wage assembly operations. Canadian textiles focus on higher-value-added products for various industries. Canadian clothing companies compete with U.S.-owned brands in designing high-end attire. Canada ships 90% of its garments to the United States. Mexico's apparel industry relies on the U.S. market for exports, using U.S.-made fabrics for basic items like denim jeans and T-shirts to avoid import duties. Mexican apparel producers benefit from using U.S. inputs and proximity to the United States for quick replenishment. Some U.S. fashion companies find NAFTA duty savings not worth the compliance effort. Central America and the Caribbean provide regional competition for NAFTA-based textile and apparel producers. CAFTA-DR and other trade agreements allow duty-free entry of regional apparel products to the U.S. as long as yarn and fabrics originate in the region. China remains a dominant supplier of apparel to the U.S. despite rising costs and competition from other countries. Vietnam is the second-largest exporter of apparel to the United States, with $10.9 billion in imports in 2016, accounting for 13% of total U.S. apparel imports. They focus on selling shirts, suits, and overcoats rather than basic apparel products like T-shirts and trousers. Vietnam's apparel sector primarily sources yarns and fabrics regionally from China and other suppliers. The Vietnamese apparel sector buys most of its yarns and fabrics regionally, mainly from China, South Korea, and Taiwan, with a limited amount from the United States. The government plans to increase yarn and fabric capacity. The competitive textile and apparel sectors in China and Vietnam are a factor in NAFTA renegotiations, with concerns about existing exceptions for Mexico and Canada to import duty-free from China and Vietnam. The U.S. textile industry is pushing to exclude yarns and fabrics from China and Vietnam from NAFTA benefits. The potential impact on the NAFTA textile and apparel supply chain depends on whether the US will enter a free-trade agreement with Vietnam. If NAFTA changes or ends, Mexican producers could lose duty-free access to the US market, benefiting CAFTA, Caribbean, and South American manufacturers. Tariff preferences are crucial for keeping apparel producers in the Western Hemisphere competitive in the US market. If NAFTA were terminated, U.S.-made textiles and fabrics would lose protected access to Canada and Mexico, impacting the textile and apparel industries. Rules of origin determine duty-free trade benefits, with the U.S. textile industry aiming for regional manufacturing. Apparel industry opposes yarn-forward standard, preferring more flexible rules of origin in trade agreements. NAFTA renegotiation may lead to modifications in these rules. One possible outcome in the NAFTA renegotiation could be a modification of rules of origin for textile and apparel products. Rules include Fiber Forward, Yarn Forward, and Fabric Forward, each requiring different production processes within the free-trade agreement member territory. The NAFTA agreement includes rules of origin for textile and apparel products, such as Fiber Forward, Yarn Forward, and Fabric Forward. The yarn-forward rule requires fibers and yarns to be from any country, but the fabric must be knitted or woven in FTA member countries. Cutting and sewing of the finished article must occur in FTA member countries. NAFTA also had a textile and apparel safeguard that expired in 2004, allowing tariffs to be reimposed in case of import surges. Under NAFTA, exceptions to detailed rules-of-origin requirements allow for flexibility in using materials not widely produced in North America. Textile Product Levels (TPLs) provide duty-free access for limited quantities of apparel made with foreign yarn or fabric, including materials from China and other Asian suppliers. Mexico has consistently approached the maximum allowable amount of cotton and man-made fiber apparel with duty-free foreign content. The NAFTA Textile Product Levels (TPLs) allow duty-free access for limited quantities of apparel made with foreign materials. The United States has proposed ending the TPL regime, supported by textile manufacturers but opposed by apparel and retail groups. Eliminating the TPL program may not bring textile production or jobs back to the U.S. and could lead to imports from other countries displacing Mexican apparel production. Mexico and Canada oppose ending the NAFTA TPL program, which allows duty-free access for apparel made with foreign materials. Textile manufacturers want exemptions eliminated, while apparel companies argue they are crucial for Mexican plants to adapt to consumer demand. NAFTA has a de minimis threshold allowing 7% of a garment's content to come from outside the region. Apparel and retail groups are pushing for a renegotiated NAFTA agreement to streamline the process for determining materials in short supply. U.S. negotiators have proposed incorporating a short-supply list in the agreement, similar to the CAFTA-DR agreement. The U.S. textile industry is seeking exemptions to be addressed in the NAFTA renegotiation. The U.S. textile industry wants NAFTA renegotiation to address exemptions under the Kissell Amendment and avoid changes to government procurement rules that could undermine the Berry Amendment. Customs enforcement is crucial as textile trade contributes significantly to U.S. duty revenue and importers. The U.S. textile industry is concerned about transshipment issues, especially with countries like China potentially exploiting free-trade agreements like NAFTA. The renegotiation of NAFTA could result in no change, adjustments to rules of origin, or full U.S. withdrawal. Global textile and apparel supply chains would need to adapt to any changes in NAFTA. The potential impact of NAFTA renegotiation or elimination on textile and apparel supply chains is uncertain. U.S. textile manufacturers could face a decrease in income if demand for U.S.-made yarns and fabrics within NAFTA decreases. Ending NAFTA may lead to U.S. apparel brands importing more from countries like China and Vietnam, causing U.S. textile manufacturers to lose export sales to Mexico. Asian textile suppliers could benefit the most from NAFTA's dismantlement by gaining market share from Mexico. The profitability of the North American textile and apparel industry will likely be influenced by the outcome of NAFTA renegotiation in the long run. The North American textile and apparel industry's profitability may rely less on NAFTA preferences like yarn forward and more on regional producers' innovation to stay competitive globally. The United States' withdrawal from the TPP in 2017 could impact supply chains under NAFTA if the TPP-11 countries reach a trade deal. This could lead to an increase in textiles and apparel sourced from the TPP region, with Canada and Mexico potentially importing more from other TPP countries. The inclusion of Canada and Mexico in a new TPP arrangement could impact NAFTA participation. It may take time to see the effects of NAFTA renegotiation on the textile and apparel supply chain. President Trump has Trade Promotion Authority until July 1, 2018, extendable to July 1, 2021. Selected Textile and Apparel Industry Comments on NAFTA Negotiating Objectives highlight industry representatives' consensus on the importance of NAFTA for maintaining competitiveness in the textile and apparel supply chain. The comments also address recommendations for improving intellectual property rights, e-commerce, regulatory cooperation, and labor provisions within NAFTA."
