    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Credit Default Swap Prohibition Act of 2009\". The Congress finds that credit default swaps were originally meant to spread risk and increase liquidity in the lending system. However, the market has evolved to include naked credit default swaps, leading to overexposure and systemic risk. Speculation without collateral poses a threat to the financial system, as credit default swaps have proven to be harmful instruments causing wealth destruction during economic crises. The Act aims to give oversight to the Securities and Exchange Commission over security-based swap agreements and to prevent further economic damage by banning credit default swaps. The Act establishes Securities and Exchange Commission oversight of credit default swaps. The Securities Act of 1933 defines a credit default swap as a swap agreement that protects against the risk of loss due to specified events related to a security, loan, or reference asset. The SEC may also prescribe other forms of credit risk protection as needed for the public interest or investor protection. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 now includes a definition of a credit default swap as a form of credit risk protection for investors. The Securities Act of 1933 is amended to give the Securities and Exchange Commission jurisdiction over security-based swap agreements, allowing for registration and enforcement of rules to prevent fraud and insider trading. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to grant the Securities and Exchange Commission jurisdiction over security-based swap agreements, enabling registration and enforcement of rules to combat fraud and insider trading. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to give the Securities and Exchange Commission authority over security-based swap agreements by removing certain subsections from various sections of the Act. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to prohibit credit default swaps, making it illegal for any person to enter into such agreements. This Act and its amendments will apply to swap agreements and credit default swaps entered into after a 180-day period from the enactment date."
