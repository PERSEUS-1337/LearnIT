    "title": "AB 1783",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature enacted the Field Act after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake to ensure earthquake-resistant construction of schools. The Division of the State Architect oversees the design and safety of K-12 schools and community colleges, including nonstructural components. Implementation of the Field Act involves coordination among various entities. The South Napa earthquake in 2014 caused minimal structural damage to schools but highlighted significant nonstructural hazards. The DSA has issued guidelines for nonstructural earthquake hazards in California schools, but there are no state requirements for inspections to ensure compliance with these guidelines. School classrooms should be examined to ensure furnishings and equipment are properly located, anchored, and braced to prevent harm after an earthquake and ensure safe egress. Chapter 8 is added to the Education Code to address nonstructural earthquake hazards. Each school district, county office of education, and charter school must inspect school buildings in high seismic areas by January 1, 2020, to assess compliance with earthquake safety guidelines and develop corrective actions. To ensure compliance with earthquake safety guidelines, corrective actions must be developed for noncompliant contents. The Department of Conservation defines \"higher seismicity\" as an area with ground motion of .30g or greater. By February 1, 2017, instructions on how to determine if a school building is in a high seismic area will be posted on the Department's website. Within 60 days of inspecting each area in a school building, a report detailing compliant and noncompliant contents must be submitted to the relevant governing body. The report should prioritize noncompliant items posing immediate safety threats and recommend corrective actions to bring them into compliance with guidelines. The governing board of the school district, county board of education, or charter school must review and publicly post a report on their website following a meeting held in accordance with specific government acts. The superintendent or chief administrator must annually certify to the governing board which corrective actions have been completed. Certifications for each school building must be posted on the school district's website. If a school district, county office of education, or charter school completes an inspection before January 1, 2017, they may report it to the governing board to comply with regulations. \"Contents\" for inspection purposes include various items like equipment, office supplies, and storage racks. The chapter will only be implemented if funding is provided in the annual Budget Act or another statute. If the Commission on State Mandates finds that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement will be made to local agencies and school districts according to the Government Code."
