    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Rx Drug Discount Act of 2003\" introduces the Medicare Prescription Drug Discount Card Endorsement Program under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The Secretary will establish a program to endorse prescription drug discount card programs meeting specific requirements and provide information to Medicare beneficiaries. Requirements for endorsement include passing discounts to beneficiaries, applying to drugs available other than by mail order, and offering beneficiary services. The endorsed prescription drug discount card program must provide beneficiary services such as education and counseling, prevent adverse drug interactions, offer information on enrollment fees and prices, demonstrate experience in operating similar programs, and have quality assurance procedures in place. The prescription drug discount card program must meet requirements for solvency, financial compliance, audit compliance, and contractual guarantees. It may charge an annual enrollment fee not exceeding $25 and must protect Medicare beneficiaries from overcharging. The prescription drug discount card program endorsed under this section will not affect the best price determination. The Secretary will promote informed choice among endorsed programs and provide oversight for compliance. The Secretary will provide oversight for compliance with endorsed programs, including verification of discounts and services. The 1-800-medicare toll-free number will handle inquiries and complaints. Sanctions may be imposed for abusive practices, and beneficiaries can only be enrolled in one endorsed program at a time. The Secretary oversees endorsed programs, verifies discounts, and handles complaints. Beneficiaries can only be enrolled in one program at a time and must meet a minimum enrollment period before changing. Transition and discontinuation of the program will occur when outpatient prescription drug benefits are available. Endorsed programs must safeguard health information according to federal regulations. Authorization of appropriations is allowed for the program under this section, in line with federal regulations on health information privacy."
