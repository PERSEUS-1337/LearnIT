Despite being classified as a low-income nation, it is part of the \"Next 11\" group of emerging economies. The nation's growth potential depends on its ability to control corruption, and it is projected to hold a significant portion of the world's population along with other developing nations. In May 2013, the U.S. Department of State highlighted the importance of Bangladesh's development and governance in a joint statement. The United States emphasizes support for political stability, democracy, economic development, liberalized trade, human rights, and military-to-military exchange with Bangladesh. The U.S. Department of Defense's Pacific Command collaborates with Bangladesh on peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and maritime security. Bangladesh is seen as a moderate voice in the Islamic world. The United States values Bangladesh as an important regional actor and encourages free movement of ideas, goods, and people to enhance regional peace and prosperity. U.S. assistance is crucial for strengthening Bangladesh following its return to a democratically elected government in 2008. The Obama Administration's budget request for 2014 aims to address social, demographic, and economic factors inhibiting economic growth and increasing vulnerability to extremism in Bangladesh. Bangladesh's moderate form of Islamic belief, strong secular and democratic heritage, and contributions to international security are highly valued. Bangladesh is valued for its efforts in countering violent extremism, assisting international peacekeeping, and improving regional connectivity. It is a significant contributor to United Nations Peace Operations and could play a strategic role in the dynamics between India and China due to its location and energy reserves. Bangladesh plays a strategic role in regional dynamics due to its energy reserves and location. It seeks closer ties with China and India, while also improving relations with the United States through various cooperation programs. The US has promised assistance in healthcare, environmental sustainability, law enforcement, and business connections. The United States has shown concern for workers' rights in Bangladesh, particularly in the garment sector following a factory collapse in 2013 that resulted in over 1,100 deaths. Trade privileges for Bangladesh were suspended due to labor rights violations, impacting economic cooperation between the two countries. The United States suspended trade privileges with Bangladesh due to labor rights violations, leading to a focus on improving worker safety in Bangladeshi factories. North American retailers introduced a five-year plan through the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, with 17 companies contributing $42 million for annual inspections and worker support. The Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety introduced a plan to address factory inspections, safety standards, worker training, worker's voices, governance, progress reports, factory improvement, and government involvement. Critics argue that without Bangladeshi worker involvement and legal consequences for companies, the project may not succeed. U.S. assistance to Bangladesh includes support for environmental and climate change adaptation. USAID is implementing projects in natural resource management and biodiversity conservation through a multi-stakeholder approach. The U.S. and Bangladesh are pursuing a debt-for-nature swap to promote tropical forest conservation. USAID provides assistance for health programs, including HIV/AIDS prevention and family planning. Bangladesh is led by the Awami League, with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in power. In Bangladesh, political parties like the BNP and the Awami League have used protests and strikes to gain control of the government. Political violence has been a longstanding issue, with bombings by militants causing instability in the past. The Awami League won a majority in the 2008 election, while the BNP only captured a few seats. The AL leads the Grand Alliance with 14 other parties. The Awami League in Bangladesh does not need support from other political parties to govern for its full term. The country's denial of entry to refugees from Burma has raised international concerns. Bangladesh faces accusations of unequal rights for women, human trafficking, and violence against minority groups. The U.S. Department of State's 2012 Human Rights Report highlights enforced disappearances, discrimination against marginalized groups, poor working conditions, and labor rights as significant issues. Discrimination against women and indigenous people, as well as extrajudicial deaths, are also raised as concerns by Human Rights groups. Comprehensive measures to investigate these issues have not been taken by the government. The government in Bangladesh did not take comprehensive measures to investigate and prosecute security force killings, allowing human rights violations to go unpunished. Human Rights Watch reported increased pressure on civil society and human rights defenders, with violations worsening in 2012 and 2013. Bangladesh denied entry to Rohingya refugees from Burma, exacerbating human rights issues. The Rohingya ethnic group faced obstacles entering Burma and were denied humanitarian aid. Around 200,000 unregistered Rohingya refugees reside in Bangladesh, where human trafficking is prevalent. The government established a committee in 2011 to combat exploitation. Bangladesh is ranked at Tier 2 in the U.S. Department of State's Trafficking in Persons Report, with children as young as eight forced into prostitution in slave-like conditions. Trafficking often occurs from rural areas to cities due to poverty. Many children are sold into prostitution due to poverty or fraud, with Bangladeshi immigrants facing recruitment fraud in the Gulf region. Most trafficked individuals are sent to Pakistan and India. Despite a National Plan of Action established in 2012, the government has been ineffective in curbing human trafficking. Political leaders from BNP and Jamaat-i-Islami have been arrested for war crimes dating back to 1971. The ongoing trials are opposed by BNP and Jamaat, who see them as a move to benefit the AL politically. The 1971 war in Bangladesh resulted in millions of deaths and displacements, with trials now targeting those who allegedly committed war crimes. Suspects include members of the Jamaat-i-Islami Party, which collaborated with the Pakistani military. Bangladesh faces challenges in stabilizing relations between Islamist extremists and minority religious populations. The attacks on religious minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, Buddhists, and other groups, have led to mass movements of victims and a decrease in the Hindu population from 30% in 1947 to 10% today. Violence against these communities has been ongoing, with concerns raised by Sri Lankan communities and government. Minority religions like Judaism and the Ahmadiyya Muslim community have also faced discrimination. Members of Congress are interested in promoting women's issues in Bangladesh through development assistance programs. Bangladesh ranks poorly in women's rights and living standards globally. In 2012, it ranked 81st out of 93 countries on the Gender Empowerment Index and 86th out of 135 nations on the Global Gender Gap Index. Despite this, it fares better than some Islamic nations like Pakistan. The booming textile market in Bangladesh has provided work opportunities for many poor women with limited education. The booming textile market in Bangladesh has created job opportunities for millions of women, serving as a way out of rural poverty. Garment factories are the main source of employment for women due to low demand for labor in agriculture. After the 2013 factory tragedy, Bangladesh and Western governments aim to improve safety and labor standards in the industry. The garment industry in Bangladesh is calling for improved wages and factory conditions for its female workers, who play a crucial role in the country's development by investing their incomes in family nutrition, education, and healthcare. This industry provides an alternative to traditional labor roles but has also led to social tensions. The garment industry in Bangladesh relies on cheap female labor, reducing marginalization but facing challenges from religious fundamentalists. Women face abuse and health risks from undocumented migration for work. International organizations like U.N. Women and USAID are working to empower Bangladeshi women and address these issues. USAID is actively involved in promoting women's equality in Bangladesh, aiming to address gender inequity to support the country's long-term development and economic growth. The organization plans to incorporate gender parity recommendations in projects, require partners to develop gender-related exercises, have a gender advisor for all project considerations, and assess programs based on gender equity goals. Bangladesh has faced political instability with multiple coups and tensions between the military and civilian governments since its independence in 1971. Tensions between the military and the government in Bangladesh led to a deadly mutiny in 2009, where 57 officers and 15 family members were killed. The army quickly suppressed the two-day mutiny, with Army Chief of Staff General Muhammad Abdul Mubeen supporting Prime Minister Hasina. A recent deal with Russia provided the Bangladeshi military with additional arms, including a $1 billion loan for arms purchases. Bangladesh, originally founded on secular-socialist principles, is also receiving Russian grants for nuclear power plant construction. Some attribute the rise of Islamist influence in Bangladesh to the failure of political elites to effectively govern and represent the interests of the masses. The Government of Bangladesh is committed to combating domestic and transnational terrorist groups, with assistance from the United States. Militant extremist groups like Jamaat-e-Islami, with connections to Al Qaeda, have operated in Bangladesh. The rise of Islamist influence in Bangladesh is attributed to the failure of political elites to effectively govern. Radical groups like Jamaat-e-Islami, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI), and Islamic Oikya Jote have international linkages. The government is taking steps to curb extremist groups, with a conflict between radicalism and moderate Islam in early 2013 resulting in at least 150 deaths. The struggle includes opposition to measures enforcing Islamic laws and punishments for blasphemy.

The government is taking steps to curb extremist groups, with a conflict between radicalism and moderate Islam in early 2013 resulting in at least 150 deaths. The struggle includes opposition to measures enforcing Islamic laws and punishments for blasphemy. CNN reported a push and pull between Bangladeshi youths inspired by social media to moderate Islamic fundamentalism and Islamic radicals criticizing protestors as anti-Islamic atheists. The United States assists Bangladesh and other South Asian nations in counterterrorism efforts through military training. The Government of Bangladesh has also attempted to curb terrorism through social measures focusing on youth, as per the Country Reports on Terrorism by the United States Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism. The Ministry of Education oversees madrassas and is developing a national curriculum with secular subjects up to eighth grade. The Ministry of Religious Affairs and National Committee on Militancy Resistance work with imams to combat terrorism. The government empowers women economically to counter extremist messages. The US government offers programs on religious tolerance and human rights to madrassah students. Religious leaders are introduced to modern development concepts. The USAID and Bangladesh Ministry of Religious Affairs collaborate on the Leaders of Influence project to train Muslim leaders in promoting democracy, tolerance, family planning, and social harmony. Bangladesh's strategic importance in South Asia and Asia as a whole is highlighted by its history with Pakistan and India's role in the region. Bangladesh's strategic importance in Asia is seen as a potential counterbalance to China by some. There are discussions about closer ties with China as a strategic move. Prime Minister Hasina sought cooperation with China for various projects during her visit in 2010. China and Bangladesh have been cooperating on various projects, including the construction of a deep sea port at Chittagong and a road link to Kunming. There are calls for Chinese investment in developing a deep seaport at Sonadia. China reiterated its support for the Deep Sea Port in Chittagong in June 2011. A joint statement in 2010 emphasized intensifying cooperation in areas such as sharing hydrological information, dredging river beds, enhancing transportation links, increasing trade, and strengthening military cooperation. Bangladesh reaffirms One China policy and supports China's cooperation with SARC countries. Concerns arise over China's hydropower plans on rivers flowing into South Asia, including building a dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo River. Suspicions of China's motives in developing port access in South Asia lead to concerns in India and the United States. Port development in Bangladesh is viewed as part of China's \"string of pearls\" strategy to secure sea lanes in the Indian Ocean. Prime Minister Hasina has improved relations with both India and China, despite past strains over border disputes and the presence of militants in Bangladesh. In September 2011, India and Bangladesh drafted an agreement for economic and social cooperation titled \"Framework Agreement on Cooperation for Development\" to address disputes, militant presence, and refugee concerns. The agreement aims to neutralize China's influence by providing economic leverage to Bangladesh and addressing issues such as terrorism, illegal immigrants, migrant workers, disaster management, and environmental protection. Bangladesh and India have strengthened economic ties with a $1 billion investment pledge from India for Bangladesh's infrastructure. Bangladesh is also involved in a hydro-power project in northeastern India to access electricity, as more than 60% of its population lacks electricity. Despite being one of the world's poorest nations, Bangladesh has seen consistent GDP growth, driven by manufacturing and remittances. Per capita GDP has increased due to economic expansion and slower population growth, with GDP almost tripling from 1994 to 2010. Bangladesh's GDP is expected to grow by about 6% in 2013. The United States is Bangladesh's largest trading partner, with discussions on a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) ongoing. Bangladesh is highly dependent on remittances from overseas Bangladeshis, with two-thirds of revenue coming from the Middle East. American trade and investment interests in Bangladesh include developing natural gas reserves in the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh relies heavily on remittances from overseas Bangladeshis, with two-thirds of revenue coming from the Middle East. There are an estimated six million Bangladeshis working abroad, making Bangladesh one of the world's largest sources of overseas workers. The country's textile exports are reportedly doing well, which may help offset remittances shortfalls. In January 2013, Bangladesh rejected financing from the World Bank and instead sought financial assistance from Russia for its nuclear power program. Bangladesh is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to the negative impacts of climate change due to its low-lying geography. Bangladesh faces increasing environmental challenges, including climate change impacts such as rising sea levels. Projections suggest that sea levels could rise enough to affect 10 million people in the south of the country within 25 years. Global warming has also led to reduced food production in key exporting nations, impacting prices. These climate-related challenges, combined with a growing population and limited agricultural resources, could lead to political instability in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects a decrease in rice and wheat production in Bangladesh by 2050 due to rising sea levels and increased salinity. Climate change impacts such as river floods, tropical cyclones, and high temperatures are expected to worsen in the future. Despite achieving food self-sufficiency in the 1990s, Bangladesh still imports rice, although the rate of importation is decreasing. Bangladesh's imports of rice and wheat dropped to 2.24 million tonnes from 5.15 million tonnes in 2011. The country's lack of resources to accommodate those displaced by environmental changes and extreme population density could lead to cross-border migrations into India, exacerbating border tensions. The international community and regional governments are working to reduce the impact of climate change in Bangladesh, but the country needs financial and technological support to ensure environmental sustainability. USAID provides finance, technology transfer, and capacity enhancement support for sustainable development in Bangladesh. They invested $13 million in a project to promote an integrated Protected Area co-management system for environmental conservation. The organization adjusts its policy based on immediate needs and long-term goals in Bangladesh."
