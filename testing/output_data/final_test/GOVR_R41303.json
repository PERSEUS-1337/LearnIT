    "content": "In 1908, Congress mandated the Forest Service to pay 25% of its gross receipts to states for use on roads and schools in counties with national forests. This revenue-sharing program, known as Forest Service Payments to States, compensates local governments for the tax-exempt status of national forests. States have no discretion in allocating funds to counties, as the Forest Service determines the amount based on national forest acreage in each county. The Forest Service pays states a percentage of its gross receipts for road and school programs in counties with national forests. States must pass the funds to local entities, with varying allocations for road and school projects. Congress also has programs to share receipts from BLM lands, with the Oregon and California payments being the primary source for counties in western Oregon. Oregon and California grant lands were returned to federal ownership due to states' failure to meet grant terms. O&C counties receive 50% of receipts from these lands for local government use. Concerns and proposals to change FS revenue-sharing payments often include O&C payments, both mainly from timber receipts. Timber sale revenue and revenue-sharing peaked in the late 1980s but have since declined due to factors like reduced federal timber sales. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 authorized owl payments to counties in the Pacific Northwest, which were later replaced by the nationwide SRS program in 2000. The SRS program allowed counties to receive optional payments instead of the 25% receipt-sharing payment. The SRS payment calculation was modified in FY2008 to consider county population and per capita income, with an annually declining payment level. Payments under SRS were substantial, with FS SRS payments averaging $360 million annually for the initial six years authorized. Over the life of the program, FS SRS payments averaged $337 million per year, while BLM SRS payments averaged $78 million annually. The comparison of FS actual payments to estimates without SRS shows significant differences in revenue-sharing payments. SRS expiration in 2014 led to payments based on agency receipts subject to sequestration. The post-sequester revenue-sharing payments for FS and BLM in February 2015 were $50 million and $18 million, respectively. P.L. 114-10 enacted on April 16, 2015, included provisions for FY2014 SRS payment makeup and authorized an FY2015 SRS payment. The total FS SRS payment for FY2014 was $274 million, and for BLM, it was $38 million. These payments were not subject to sequestration for FY2015 and FY2016. SRS expired on October 1, 2016, without congressional reauthorization. Without congressional reauthorization, counties received revenue-sharing payments for FY2016. The post-sequester payment was $54 million for the Forest Service and $19 million for BLM. If SRS payments had been authorized, the FS payment would have been approximately $248 million and the BLM payment would have been approximately $34 million. In addition to these programs, Congress has enacted the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) Program to compensate for federal land presence. PILT payments are calculated based on eligible federal lands in each county. PILT payments are reduced by other payment programs, such as FS Payments to States, affecting county payments. FY2012 PILT payments to Colorado were double those to Oregon due to mandatory spending amendments. Annual appropriations were needed before 2008, but became mandatory for FY2008-FY2014. Each county received its pro rata share of the appropriation. For FY2015, Congress provided $439.5 million for PILT payments, 97% of the total authorized payment. FY2016 saw $452 million in discretionary appropriations for PILT payments, 98% of the total authorized payment. In FY2017, Congress allocated $465 million for PILT payments, expected to be paid in June 2017. Concerns have been raised about the decline in timber sales affecting FS and O&C revenue-sharing programs, as well as the annual uncertainty about payment amounts. The decline in timber sales has led to a drop in O&C receipts, causing concerns about the effect on county payments. National forest receipts decreased significantly from FY1989 to FY2009, with some counties experiencing a steep decline in revenue. Counties are exploring alternative revenue options to replace lost timber receipts and declining SRS payments. Counties are concerned about the fluctuating payments based on revenue generated, which have varied widely from year to year. The wide annual fluctuations in payments have imposed serious budgeting uncertainties on the counties. Additionally, counties are rewarded for advocating receipt-generating activities and opposing management decisions that might reduce such activities. County governments have historically aligned with the timber industry, opposing efforts to reduce timber harvests. Some support maintaining the link between county compensation and agency receipts, citing benefits like local employment. Others argue for ending the linkage to allow local officials independence in supporting management decisions. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act (SRS) was enacted in 2000 to provide an alternative payment system for counties with FS land and O&C land. Counties could choose between regular receipt-sharing payments or SRS payments, calculated based on past payments. Counties receiving less than $100,000 could distribute the entire payment to roads and schools. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act (SRS) provided an alternative payment system for counties with FS land and O&C land. Counties receiving over $100,000 under the alternative system were required to spend 15%-20% on federal land projects or certain county programs. SRS was originally temporary but has been extended. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act (SRS) was enacted as a temporary program but has been reauthorized five times, extending payments for an additional nine years. SRS expired in FY2006, with final payments made in FY2007. Legislation to extend the program was considered in the 110th Congress, with a one-year extension eventually authorized in P.L. 110-28. In FY2007, preliminary payments were made in September and final payments in December. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act extended SRS payments through FY2011 with changes to the program, including full funding declining over four years and modifications to payment calculations. Section 601(b) modified the FS 25% payment program based on average revenue generated over the previous seven years. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act extended SRS payments through FY2011 with changes to the program, including full funding declining over four years and modifications to payment calculations. Full funding for SRS was defined as $500 million for FY2008 and 90% of the previous year's funding for FY2009-FY2011. Total payments exceeded the full funding amount in the first two years due to transition payments authorized in eight states. SRS payments differed significantly from the original program, with payments to each state or county varying. The revised SRS payments were based on historic revenue-sharing payments, modified by each county's share of federal land and income level. The calculation process involved determining the three highest revenue-sharing payments for each county, calculating the average, and then determining the proportion of these payments in each county. This was followed by calculating the proportion of federal and O&C lands in each eligible county. Step 1: Calculate the base share for counties with FS lands and the 50% base share for counties with O&C lands by averaging the payment proportion and acreage proportion. Adjust each county's base share by its relative income to calculate the adjusted share. \n\nStep 2: The revised SRS payments were based on historic revenue-sharing payments, modified by each county's share of federal land and income level. \n\nSummarized chunk: Calculate the base share for counties with FS lands and the 50% base share for counties with O&C lands by averaging the payment and acreage proportions. Adjust each county's base share by its relative income to calculate the adjusted share. The new formula for SRS payments divides each county's result by the total adjusted shares in all eligible counties, based on historic revenues, proportion of FS and O&C land, and relative county income. Some counties opted out of the amended SRS system due to the altered allocation, while others opted in. Payments to states like Pennsylvania and New Hampshire under SRS varied between FY2006 and FY2009. The act set a full payment amount allocated among counties participating in the program. Counties in eight states received transition payments for three fiscal years, FY2008-FY2010, at fixed percentages of their FY2006 payments under SRS. The amended version of the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program allowed counties with different payment amounts to allocate funds for various projects. Counties with less than $100,000 in annual payments could use 100% for roads and schools. Counties with payments between $100,000 and $350,000 could use 15%-20% for federal land reinvestment or county projects. Counties with payments over $350,000 were limited to 7% for county projects. The amendment also changed the authorized uses of Title III funds. The Secure Rural Schools program was amended to allow counties to allocate funds for various projects based on their payment amounts. The authorized uses of Title III funds were also changed, with some uses deleted and others expanded. Additionally, the program altered the FS revenue-sharing payment program by changing the payment calculation to a seven-year rolling average of gross receipts, providing more stability in payments. This change affected counties with FS land that did not participate in the SRS payment program and all counties with FS land in FY2016. The Secure Rural Schools program was extended through FY2013 with payments set at 95% of previous levels. Legislation in the 112th and 113th Congresses addressed the program's funding and oversight, with final payments disbursed in early 2014. In April 2015, Congress passed the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which included a two-year reauthorization of mandatory spending for Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments. Counties that elected to receive an SRS payment for FY2013 would automatically receive payments for FY2014 and FY2015. The FY2014 payment was to be made within 45 days of enactment. The 114th Congress considered options to extend or modify the expired SRS program, but did not enact any. Two bills in the 115th Congress, H.R. 2340 and S. 1027, aim to reauthorize SRS for two years and provide a make-up payment for FY2016. Congressional considerations include reauthorizing SRS with or without modifications, implementing other proposals, or taking no action. Issues raised include geographic distribution, lands covered, basis for compensation, funding source, authorized uses of payments, and duration. The Congress is considering reauthorizing the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program with potential modifications. One key issue is whether to fund the program through regular discretionary appropriations instead of mandatory spending. There are concerns about legislation with mandatory spending increasing federal expenditures and potentially adding to the deficit, which may require budgetary offsets. The Congress is considering reauthorizing the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program with potential modifications. Legislation to reauthorize SRS would require offsets in spending or increased revenues to balance the budget. In the past, waivers or reserve funds have been used to fund the program, such as selling federal lands or accelerating land sales. The Bush Administration proposed selling national forest lands to fund a phase-out of SRS payments, but no legislation was introduced for the land sales. Congress included a reserve fund for SRS payments in the budget resolution instead. Geographic allocation of SRS and PILT payments is an issue for Congress. In FY2015, Oregon received the largest SRS payment of approximately $94 million, nearly one-third of the total SRS payments. California and Idaho received just under 10% each. PILT payments are more evenly distributed, with no state receiving more than 10% of the total payments. SRS payments are only for national forests and O&C lands, while other federal lands exempt from taxation receive little or no funding. National forests and national grasslands receive different compensation under SRS, with national forest counties receiving 25% of gross receipts and protection from declines in receipts, while national grassland counties receive 25% of net receipts and no SRS payments. Other tax-exempt federal lands, such as BLM and National Park Service lands, provide minimal compensation to local governments. PILT offers some compensation for most federal lands. In 1992, the Office of Technology Assessment recommended fair and consistent compensation for tax-exempt federal lands, including national forests. Congress could consider extending a compensation program to all tax-exempt federal lands, but determining a fair compensation level would likely spark debate. The legislative histories of agriculture appropriations acts show the intent to substitute receipt-sharing for local property taxation in payments to states for national forest lands. The rationale for various tax-equivalency proposals and revenue-sharing payments for national forests has not been clearly explained. Different payment levels have been proposed over the years, with the intent to either reduce or increase payments. Geographic basis has been identified as a potential issue for Forest Service revenue-sharing payments, as calculations can vary depending on the formula used. The Forest Service revenue-sharing payments are permanently appropriated from agency receipts and established before federal income taxes and oil/gas royalties. Proposed changes would create mandatory payments funded from the General Treasury, with fluctuations in funding sources between receipts and the Treasury causing concerns among critics. Critics are concerned about the availability of General Treasury funds for Forest Service revenue-sharing payments due to the current fiscal climate. Recipients argue that Treasury funding is fair compensation for the presence of FS lands. Some worry that the linkage between agency receipts and county payments still favors timber sales. SRS modified county payment usage by requiring a portion to be used for specified purposes like local governmental costs and federal land projects. The Forest Counties Payments Committee recommended granting local governments more flexibility in their use of the payments, with a focus on federal land projects and local governmental costs. Critics argue that using funds for federal land projects could reduce funding for local schools and roads. The O&C payments are available for any local governmental purpose, and there are policy questions about how often Congress should review the payment systems. The Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments include options for Congress to review the payment systems and consider inducing future reviews. SRS was originally a six-year program extended multiple times, with the last payment made in FY2016. The annual uncertainty about the program concerns those seeking consistent payments for local governments and those interested in federal spending. The Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments were modified in FY2006 and FY2009, changing the payment formula to include federal acreage and relative income in each county. This led to changes in payments and allocation of total payments. Some counties switched between 25% payments and SRS payments, resulting in an increase in SRS payments in FY2009 in states like Michigan, New Hampshire, Ohio, Puerto Rico, and Wisconsin. Some counties in Pennsylvania opted for 25% payments in FY2009, leading to a decline in SRS payments. Some counties opted for 25% payments in FY2009, leading to a decline in Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments. Various proposals have been made over the years to change the compensation system for federal lands, focusing on tax equivalency. Developing a single federal compensation system for tax-exempt federal lands may be challenging due to the different tax mechanisms used by states and counties. President Reagan proposed replacing receipt-sharing programs with a tax equivalency system in his 1984 budget request, but the change was not enacted. President Clinton later proposed a 10-year payment program to offset declining timber sales payments, which Congress enacted in 1993. These \"owl\" payments began in 1994. The \"owl\" payments, established in 1994 under the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, started at 85% of the FY1986-FY1990 average payments and decreased annually. President Clinton proposed legislation in FY1999 to stabilize payments by extending the formula to all national forests, but it was not introduced in Congress. The Administration's proposed legislation for the FY2000 and FY2001 FS budget requests was not introduced in Congress. The National Association of Counties (NACo) proposed an alternative in 1999, suggesting a long-term solution for timber removal from National Forests and establishing local advisory councils. The NACo approach aimed to maintain or increase payments, reduce annual fluctuations, and retain the linkage between receipts and payments in some areas. The Budget Control Act required sequestration of budgetary resources for FY2013 due to Congress not enacting deficit reduction by a specified date. The total sequestration amount was approximately $85 billion, with half allocated to defense and half to non-defense spending. Reductions were further divided between discretionary appropriations and direct spending. Discretionary appropriations are budgetary resources in annual appropriations acts, while direct spending includes budget authority from laws other than appropriations acts. The Budget Control Act required sequestration of budgetary resources for FY2013, with reductions applied to both discretionary appropriations and direct spending. OMB calculated a 5.1% reduction for direct spending programs, including payments under SRS. These payments, not funded through annual appropriations acts, were classified as non-defense, direct spending subject to sequestration. BLM and FS managed the sequestration of FY2013 SRS payments differently. BLM distributed $38 million to O&C counties in Oregon for FY2012 SRS payments, while FS also faced sequestration of SRS funds. The Forest Service distributed full FY2012 SRS payments in January and February 2013, without withholding any amount in preparation for the potential sequester order. On March 19, 2013, the Forest Service announced it would seek to recover 5.1% of the payments subject to sequestration from the states. In letters to affected governors, repayment options were outlined, with a deadline for response by April 19, 2013. Invoices for repayment were not included. Some states, like Alaska, Washington, and Wyoming, publicly indicated they would not repay the SRS funds. The Forest Service sent invoices to 18 states in August 2013 for repayment of SRS funds. States had three options: pay in full, agree to a payment plan, or request a review. The invoices also included a Notice of Indebtedness and Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset. As of May 21, 2014, two states, New Hampshire and Maine, made SRS sequester-related payments to the Department of Agriculture. The Forest Service sent letters to 22 states in August 2013, informing them of reduced Title II allocations due to sequestered amounts. Collection efforts have not been initiated in the remaining 16 states. The last congressional action on this issue was a House Committee on Natural Resources oversight hearing on January 14, 2014."
