The amendments in this section will be effective upon the enactment of this Act. SEC. 3. FLOOR STOCK REFUNDS. Floor stock refunds are provided for under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

Claims for credit or refund must be filed within 6 months after the tax reduction date.

No credit or refund is allowed for liquid in retail stocks intended for retail sale. Definitions for \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are provided in this section. The terms \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are defined in section 6412 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The tax reduction date is June 26, 2000. Rules similar to section 6412 apply for this section. SEC. 4. FLOOR STOCKS TAX.

The floor stocks tax date is September 5, 2000, and the applicable period is from June 25, 2000, to September 5, 2000. The tax imposed must be paid within 6 months after the floor stocks tax date.

Controlled groups are treated as one person for this subsection. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, principles similar to those in subsection (a) of section 1563 of the tax Code apply to a group of persons under common control where one or more are not corporations. All provisions of law, including penalties, applicable to taxes imposed by section 4081 of the Code also apply, insofar as applicable and not inconsistent. The floor stock taxes imposed by subsection (a) apply to the same extent as if imposed by section 4081 of the tax Code. SEC. 5. Tax reduction benefits should be passed on to consumers. Congress believes consumers should immediately benefit from tax reductions under this Act. Producers and dealers of transportation motor fuels should lower prices to reflect the tax reduction, including providing immediate credits to customer accounts. The Comptroller General of the United States will study the tax reduction to ensure it has been passed on to consumers. The Comptroller General of the United States will report the results of a study on tax reduction to the Senate and House committees by September 30, 2000."
