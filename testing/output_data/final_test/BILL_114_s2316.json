Section 6107 of title 38, United States Code is amended to include provisions for reissuance of misused benefits by fiduciaries. If a fiduciary misuses a veteran's benefits, the Secretary must pay the beneficiary or their successor fiduciary the amount misused.

Improved access to financial records for oversight by the Department of Veterans Affairs of fiduciaries is addressed in Section 2. Section 5502 of title 38, United States Code, is amended to require fiduciaries for Department beneficiaries to authorize the Secretary to obtain financial records from institutions when necessary for program administration or safeguarding benefits against neglect or fraud. The amendment to Section 5502 of title 38, United States Code, requires fiduciaries to authorize the Secretary to obtain financial records for program administration or safeguarding benefits against neglect or fraud. The authorization provided by the fiduciary is a one-time authorization that remains in effect for two years after approval by a court or the Secretary of a final accounting of benefits. This authorization is a condition of appointment as a fiduciary and meets the requirements of the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978. The Secretary can obtain financial records from a financial institution if provided with authorization by the fiduciary. Certification requirements do not apply to these requests. The request must identify the fiduciary and beneficiary. The Secretary must inform the authorizer of the authorization's duration and scope. The Secretary can revoke a fiduciary's appointment if they refuse to provide authorization for obtaining financial records. Revoked fiduciaries may result in benefits being paid as per subsection (d). Disclosures under this subsection are considered disclosures under a Federal statute. The term 'fiduciary' includes individuals or states. The term 'fiduciary' includes any person or governmental entity appointed to receive benefits on behalf of a Department beneficiary. The term 'financial institution' includes various entities authorized to do business in any State. The term 'financial record' has a specific meaning as defined in the relevant section."
