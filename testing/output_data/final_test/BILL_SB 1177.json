    "title": "SB 1177",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Article 14 of the Business and Professions Code introduces the Physician and Surgeon Health and Wellness Program, aimed at identifying and supporting physicians and surgeons dealing with substance abuse issues to ensure public safety and maintain professional integrity. The program will provide interventions for rehabilitation and enable practitioners to continue practicing medicine safely. The Physician and Surgeon Health and Wellness Program aims to educate licensed physicians on recognizing and preventing physical, emotional, and psychological problems, offer assistance in identifying substance abuse issues, evaluate and refer physicians to treatment, and provide confidential participation for those with substance abuse problems. The program also allows the board to inquire about enrolled physicians during investigations. The board's Physician and Surgeon Health and Wellness Program requires compliance with substance abuse standards, including contracting with a third-party entity with expertise in substance abuse for program administration. The administering entity must utilize a statewide treatment resource network, provide counseling and support for physicians and their families, and offer services to all licensed California physicians. The administering entity must report any physician and surgeon who withdraws or is terminated from the program to the board with absolute confidentiality. The contract must also include requirements for the administering entity. The administering entity must provide regular reports to the board, including program statistics such as the number of participants, referrals, completions, and terminations, while maintaining participant confidentiality. As part of the program, physicians must agree to pay for treatment expenses and comply with all program requirements. The board can conduct audits to ensure compliance and terminate contracts if necessary. The program requires physicians to agree to a plan with monitoring conditions, treatment compliance, completion criteria, and termination guidelines. Participants must cover expenses, and agreements are not considered disciplinary unless specific conditions apply. The physician and surgeon must comply with the conditions in the agreement, and any information reported to the board remains confidential. However, confidentiality may not apply if the board has referred a participant as a condition of probation. This section does not affect the discovery or admissibility of evidence in disciplinary actions against a physician and surgeon. The Physician and Surgeon Health and Wellness Program does not exempt participants from disciplinary actions by the board. Disciplinary action may be taken against a physician terminated from the program, but confidential information cannot be used as evidence unless authorized. The Physician and Surgeon Health and Wellness Program Account is established to collect fees for program support upon legislative appropriation. The board sets fees for physicians in the program to cover all costs, using funds from the Contingent Fund."
