    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community Gardening and Nutrition Act of 2014\". The Congress acknowledges the benefits of community gardens, such as improving quality of life, providing nutritious food, and creating opportunities for recreation and economic development. Community gardens also help in cleaning up abandoned lots and donate fresh produce to local food pantries. Eating recommended amounts of vegetables and fruits can prevent deaths and save on medical costs. Health guidelines suggest more vegetables, legumes, and fruits, and less refined grains and fat. Studies show that community gardens promote healthy behaviors and improve dietary intakes, especially in children. The Community Garden Pilot Program is introduced.
