Anwar Sadat, born in 1918 in Egypt, graduated from the Royal Military Academy and became President after Nasser's death in 1970. Anwar Sadat became the third President of Egypt and launched an offensive against Israel in 1973. After negotiations with Henry Kissinger, Egypt and Israel signed an agreement allowing Egypt to regain land in the Sinai, marking the beginning of a peace process. President Sadat signed the Sinai Interim Agreement in 1975 and addressed Congress, emphasizing shared values with the US. In 1977, he made history by visiting Israel and meeting with Prime Minister Begin. President Sadat courageously spoke before the Israeli Knesset in Jerusalem, expressing his commitment to achieving peace in the Arab-Israeli conflict without bloodshed. He emphasized the value of every human life and the importance of peace over war. President Jimmy Carter hosted President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin at Camp David in 1978 for 13 days of negotiations resulting in the Camp David Accords. President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin signed the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty at the White House in 1979, with Prime Minister Begin commending President Sadat for his civil courage. The Peace Treaty signed in 1979 between Israel and Egypt led to mutual recognition and the end of the state of war that had existed since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Both President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for this historic agreement, making Egypt the first Arab country to officially recognize Israel. President Sadat's courageous decision to attend a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Begin in 1977 marked a significant break from the past. His pursuit of peace was driven by a commitment to future generations, as highlighted in his Nobel lecture and praised by President Carter in 1979. President Carter praised President Sadat for his courage and vision in creating hope through the Peace Treaty with Israel. Carter emphasized the importance of cooperation between Egypt and the United States and expressed support for Sadat's efforts to maintain stability in the region. The signing of the Peace Treaty angered those who opposed normalized relations with Israel. President Sadat, who pushed for peace despite opposition, was assassinated in 1981 by a member of Egyptian Islamic Jihad. President Reagan praised Sadat as a courageous leader whose vision brought nations together. Sadat is remembered as a respected champion of peace whose actions provided a roadmap for peaceful resolutions. President Sadat's vision for peace led to the Camp David Accords, which President Obama praised for changing the course of history and inspiring future peace efforts in the Middle East. The Camp David Accords and the Peace Treaty serve the interests of the United States by preserving peace and fostering partnership in a conflict-ridden region.
