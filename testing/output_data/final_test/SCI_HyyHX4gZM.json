Ongoing research focuses on understanding the layers, improving efficiency, and addressing limitations. Inspired by quantum theory, complex value kernel functions are proposed for use in machine learning. These quantum inspired kernels show robustness to unpredictable scenarios like clutter noise and data deformations.

The convolution process in machine learning involves applying a local and non-linear function to produce an output. The convolution process in machine learning involves applying a local and non-linear function to produce an output, where the kernel functions are learned from data to minimize error. Quantum inspired complex value kernels are proposed for use in machine learning, showing robustness to unpredictable scenarios. The study focuses on the limitations of current real value kernels in image recognition tasks. It introduces quantum inspired complex value kernels that show high resistance to data deformation and clutter noise, utilizing a Bayesian probability model for feedforward performance evaluation. The quantum interference phenomenon BID1 BID0 is highlighted as a key factor for building convolution networks. In this study, complex value kernels inspired by quantum theory are demonstrated for shape detection, comparing them to classical convolution techniques and the MAP estimator of the Bayesian model. The paper does not provide a full recipe for building kernels in the CNN framework but plants a seed for future research in this area. The relevance of interference phenomena in building complex value kernels is highlighted as a new contribution to the field. In this study, a one-layer CNN is proposed for shape detection using feature points extracted from an image. The approach allows for an in-depth analytical study of performance, focusing on the problem of object detection. The paper presents a study on shape detection using a one-layer CNN, focusing on performance analysis and object detection. It includes deforming shapes with random values and adding clutter for testing. Sections cover general shape descriptions, Bayesian and Hough transform methods, quantum theory application, and classical statistical methods for shape detection. The paper discusses shape detection using a one-layer CNN, comparing quantum and classical statistical methods. Shapes are defined by points satisfying S \u0398 (x) = 0, with translations of shapes represented as S \u0398 (x \u2212 \u00b5). The quantum method outperforms the classical statistical method for large deformations or clutter noise scenarios. The paper discusses shape detection using a one-layer CNN, comparing quantum and classical statistical methods. Shapes are described by a set of points X satisfying S \u0398 (x) = 0, with translations represented as S \u0398 (x \u2212 \u00b5). A shape is defined by a set of parameters \u0398, with more complex shapes requiring a larger set of parameters. For example, a circle is described by {\u00b5 x , \u00b5 y , r} and an ellipse by \u0398 = {\u03a3}. An energy model per data point x is created based on the shape model.

Shapes are described by a set of points X satisfying S \u0398 (x) = 0, with translations represented as S \u0398 (x \u2212 \u00b5). A shape is defined by a set of parameters \u0398, with more complex shapes requiring a larger set of parameters. For example, a circle is described by {\u00b5 x , \u00b5 y , r} and an ellipse by \u0398 = {\u03a3}. An energy model per data point x is created based on the shape model. The smaller E S \u0398 (x \u2212 \u00b5), the more likely the data point x belongs to the shape S \u0398 with center \u00b5. Deformations of a shape are observed in directions perpendicular to the shape tangents, along the direction of \u2207 x S \u0398 (x \u2212 \u00b5) xi, where \u2207 x is the gradient operator. The likelihood model for shape detection involves deforming data points independently based on a shape parameter \u0398. The posterior distribution is proportional to the likelihood model, with a normalization constant. The Hough transform casts binary votes for shape parameter values consistent with data points, defining error tolerance for data point inclusion in a shape. Center detection is achieved through convolution with a kernel in a rectangular shape. The Hough transform for center detection involves convolving a kernel with the input image to determine the center location based on Hough votes. The Bayesian method uses probability values and is resistant to clutter noise, while the Hough method with a specific parameter is effective for detecting deformed circle points. The Bayesian method struggles with non-uniform noise in images and cannot handle complex data like overlapping circles, while the Hough method outperforms it by discarding irrelevant data and widening center detection probabilities. The Bayesian model is best for exact data generation, but the Hough method is more effective in handling complex scenarios. The Hough method, more robust to real-world data variations, uses convolution for center detection by feeding the radius. It yields a probability in the \"middle\" of centers without suggesting two peaks. With \u03b1 = 2.769, it includes deformed circle points. Quantum theory benefits shape detection by evolving particles over time. The hidden shape dynamics theory is utilized for shape detection by invoking a hidden time parameter. This concept allows for shape evolution and comparisons, as well as the production of shape-skeletons through a time evolution equation. The optimization criteria involve the concept of action to produce the optimal path for shapes to evolve within a time interval. The shape point x contracts to the center \u00b5 in the interval of time T, evolving through a path integral point of view in quantum theory. The wave propagation is characterized by a probability amplitude \u03c8 \u0398(t) (x(t)), with a path of shape contraction from initial state (x, \u0398) to final state (\u00b5, 0). The Kernel K introduces a new parameter with its own interpretation and value. The given image describes an empirical estimation of probability amplitudes using a set of impulses at an empirical data set. The probability amplitude is a superposition of impulses, and its evolution is determined by a convolution of a kernel throughout the center candidates. Deformations in shape points are interpreted as evidence of different quantum paths, not just the optimal classical path. According to quantum theory, probability amplitudes are determined by the phase difference between data points belonging to a shape and clutter. The interference phenomenon arises from cosine terms in the probability, with clutter points canceling each other out in images with a large amount of clutter. The quantum method outperforms classical methods in detecting centers and identifying two centers by canceling out clutter noise through interference. The two circle center peaks in figure 4b show superior results compared to classical methods. Further analysis is needed to compare performance. The complexity of computations for quantum probability is linear in the data set size. Quantum method outperforms classical methods in center detection and interference phenomena contribute to better resolution of the center. The quantum probability method, derived from the quantum probability amplitude using Wick rotation, improves center detection by transforming quantum systems into statistical systems. Each data point produces a vote controlled by a parameter \u03b1, resembling a Hough transform. The method outperforms classical methods in resolving the center. The quantum method, derived from probability amplitude, is compared with classical statistical method for center detection using a circle example. Points on the circle are deformed independently and uniformly, improving center detection. The quantum method interprets shape deformations as quantum trajectories, while the classical method sees them as statistical errors. Different probabilistic interpretations lead to different evaluation methods for optimal parameters. The probability amplitude is interpreted as a sum over independent samples, leading to statistical averages for optimal parameter evaluations. The quantum method interprets shape deformations as quantum trajectories, while the classical method sees them as statistical errors. Points can be interpreted as N C times the statistical average of the function f over the random variable S i, represented by two independent and uniform random variables. The ratio of probabilities for the circle can be evaluated numerically. The Hough total vote is interpreted as an average over a function of the random variable |S i|. The quantum method interprets shape deformations as quantum trajectories, while the classical method sees them as statistical errors. The Hough total vote is an average over a function of the random variable |S i|. The choice of hyper-parameters for the models aims to accurately detect the true center. The amplitude probability equation has a parameter that scales up the magnitude of shape values, affecting the phase \u03d5 i. The parameter large can align shape points to similar phases, while small values help misalign points. Evaluating shapes with the \"wrong\" parameters should cancel shape points. One can maximize the ratio Q C (a, b, ) by choosing values of to balance high and low amplitudes. Figure 5 suggests this choice. By choosing appropriate values of \u03b1, the quantum method outperforms the classical Hough transform in accuracy detection, as shown in FIG4. The estimation of \u03b1 involves maximizing H(a, b, \u03b1) to reduce votes at the true center and displaced center. Higher values of \u03b1 do not improve Hough transform performance, even with added noise. Deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proven useful in various fields. Inspired by quantum theory, complex value kernel functions were used along with local non-linear absolute operator square. The study focused on a specific problem, varying parameters for different figures. The proposed parameter value was found to be 0.1401. The proposed parameter value is 0.1401, yielding a high ratio and \u03b1 = 2.769 gives all Hough votes in the center. Quantum ratio outperforms classical Hough method, especially as center displacement increases. Figure 5d displays values of |\u03c8| 2 (\u00b5 * ) \u00d7 at the true center in blue, and V (\u00b5 * ) \u00d7 \u03b1 in red. Quantum inspired complex kernels outperform classical kernels in shape detection, especially with overlapping shapes and clutter noise. The Bayesian shape estimator is effective under certain data conditions, but breaks down with multiple shapes or clutter noise. A comparison between the Quantum method and the Hough method shows the Quantum method's superior accuracy due to interference phenomena. The proposed quantum kernel method allows for the use of standard gradient descent techniques to learn kernels. Complex numbers in the network layers double the parameters, as they are continuous and differentiable. The work suggests that using complex numbers in network layers may improve performance and reduce network size. Quantum theory is used as a statistical method in computer vision models, not for physics concepts like forces or energies. Interference phenomena are explored for their advantages in accuracy compared to traditional methods like the Hough method. The article explores interference phenomena in neural networks, demonstrating its advantage. Bringing quantum ideas to this field requires showcasing their utility."
