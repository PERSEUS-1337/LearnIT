    "content": "The Softmax function is commonly used in sequence-to-sequence models for language generation, but it is slow and memory-intensive. A new technique replaces the softmax layer with a continuous embedding layer, resulting in faster training times and the ability to handle larger vocabularies without sacrificing translation quality. The new technique replaces the softmax layer in language generation models with a continuous embedding layer, allowing for faster training times and the handling of larger vocabularies without compromising translation quality. This approach also leads to more meaningful errors in translation compared to softmax-based models. The current systems limit output vocabulary, sacrificing linguistic diversity by replacing rare words with unknown tokens. Softmax is computationally slow and memory-intensive. Various alternatives have been proposed, including sampling-based approximations and hierarchical structures. The proposed technique generates low-dimensional word embeddings instead of using a probability distribution over the vocabulary. It trains sequence-to-sequence models with continuous outputs by minimizing the distance between the output vector and the pretrained word embedding. This approach can be applied to any language generation task, such as neural machine translation. This work is the first to use word embeddings as outputs in language generation, instead of the softmax layer. The work proposes using word embeddings as outputs in language generation tasks instead of the softmax layer. A new loss function is introduced to model the correct probability distribution over the word embedding space, improving performance in machine translation tasks. The models can be trained up to 2.5x faster than previous methods. The models proposed in the work use word embeddings as outputs in language generation tasks, outperforming softmax-based models in terms of training speed. Error analysis shows that models with continuous outputs are better at generating rare words and produce errors that are semantically related to the reference translation. The text discusses using continuous word vectors instead of one-hot representations to address the bottleneck in natural language generation tasks caused by the size of the output vocabulary. This approach involves introducing a novel probabilistic loss function to train models, as described in prior work. Prior work has focused on addressing the softmax bottleneck problem in natural language generation tasks by introducing modifications to the softmax layer. Sampling-based approximations, such as Importance Sampling, Noise Contrastive Estimation, Negative Sampling, and Blackout, aim to speed up training time but may degrade generation quality. Hierarchical approaches, like replacing the flat softmax layer with a binary tree structure, alleviate the normalization issue during training but may lead to a drop in performance at test time compared to softmax. BID7 proposes clustering the vocabulary based on frequencies to improve performance in training and decoding by making the output embedding matrix sparser. However, this approach may result in inferior performance for rare words. BID0 and BID11 introduce additional terms to the training loss to avoid explicit normalization, leading to faster evaluation of certain words in language modeling tasks. BID18 introduces character-based methods for natural language generation tasks. BID18 introduces character-based methods to reduce vocabulary size, while BID38 uses sub-word units obtained through Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to find a middle ground between characters and words. Despite limitations, BPE achieves good performance and is the state-of-the-art approach in machine translation. The proposed model represents each word type in the output vocabulary with a continuous vector, obtained through training a word embedding model on a large monolingual corpus. The model's decoder produces a continuous vector to predict the output word by finding the nearest neighbor in the embedding space. The model is trained to minimize the distance between the target vector and the output vector, optimizing towards the information encoded by the embeddings. This results in the model outputting words in a semantic space, producing correct or close synonyms. The proposed probabilistic loss function, a variant of cosine loss, addresses limitations of existing empirical losses by measuring closeness between vector directions using von Mises-Fisher distribution. It provides a theoretically grounded regression loss for sequence generation, controlling for syntactic forms and generating words in a semantic space. The proposed probabilistic loss function, a variant of cosine loss, utilizes the von Mises-Fisher distribution to measure closeness between vector directions. The model output is a vector of dimension m, with \u03ba as the concentration parameter. The density function is computed using a normalization term and a modified Bessel function. The negative log-likelihood of the vMF distribution is used at each output step. Regularization of the NLLvMF loss is necessary to prevent overemphasis on increasing \u03ba. The NLLvMF loss puts too much weight on increasing \u00ea, leading to a rapid decrease in the second term without a significant decrease in cosine distance. To address this, a regularization term is added, with two variants experimented. NLLvMF reg1 adds \u03bb1\u00ea to the loss function to prevent excessive increase in vector length. The modified loss function controls the rate of decrease in the second term. The standard seq2seq model in OpenNMT is modified to implement this architecture, with a bidirectional LSTM encoder and an attention-based decoder. The encoder-decoder model uses a bidirectional LSTM encoder and an attention-based decoder. The model is trained with a continuous output layer instead of softmax, with hyperparameters \u03bb1 = 0.02 and \u03bb2 = 0.1. The input word embedding size is 512 and the output size is 1024, with m = 300 for the output dimension. More details can be found in the appendix. The models are trained with m = 300 until convergence on validation loss. Out of vocabulary words are mapped to an unk token. A post-processing step replaces the unk token with the word with highest attention score. Bilingual dictionaries are automatically extracted from the parallel training corpus. Evaluation is done using BLEU score on standard machine translation datasets. The study focuses on machine translation datasets from IWSLT'16 BID6, including English: German\u2192English, French\u2192English, and French: English\u2192French language pairs. The training sets consist of around 220,000 parallel sentences, with a target vocabulary size of 55,000 words. Additionally, experiments are conducted on a larger WMT'16 German\u2192English BID5 task with 4.5M sentence pairs and a target vocabulary size of 800,000. The models are trained without the need for a time-consuming softmax computation. The proposed model allows training with a large target vocabulary without increasing training time per batch. Sub-words computed using BPE are used as the source vocabulary to avoid a huge increase in trainable parameters. The datasets used come from different domains, with IWSLT'16 containing less formal spoken language and WMT'16 containing primarily formal data. The study compares target word embeddings for English and French trained on WMT'16 datasets from various sources. Two embedding models, word2vec and fasttext, are experimented with using recommended hyper-parameters. The proposed loss function is compared with standard loss functions in multivariate regression, with a focus on Squared Error to penalize large errors. The study compares target word embeddings for English and French trained on WMT'16 datasets using word2vec and fasttext models with recommended hyper-parameters. The proposed loss function aims to address the sensitivity to outliers by using a square rooted version of 2 loss. However, there is a mismatch between the objective function, distance measure, and 2 distance as the objective function. The model can handle decoding open vocabulary but may still encounter unknown words, requiring an unk token. Removing the bottom 5,000 words did not significantly impact translation quality. Considering cosine loss minimizes the distance between output and target vectors while disregarding their magnitudes. The study experiments with a margin-based ranking loss to reduce hubness in high-dimensional spaces for learning word vectors. The loss function aims to rank the word vector prediction for the target vector higher than any other word vector in the embedding space. It uses a hyperparameter \u03b3 to represent the margin and one informative negative example closest to the target word vector.

It aims to rank the word vector prediction for the target vector higher than any other word vector. The negative example closest to the target word vector is used, and different decoding schemes are compared, including nearest-neighbor decoding and greedy decoding. The input embedding matrix in the decoder of a sequence-to-sequence model plays a significant role in the size of trainable parameters. The input embedding matrix in the decoder of a sequence-to-sequence model significantly impacts the size of trainable parameters. Experimenting with fixed and tied embedding layers leads to a reduction in parameters and improved translation quality. Tied embeddings are the most effective setup, achieving high translation quality and faster convergence. Using fasttext embeddings results in a >1 BLEU improvement in translation quality. Our proposed model can process large mini-batches efficiently, training much faster than baseline models. The largest mini-batch size we can train with is 512, compared to 184 in the baseline model. Using max-margin loss slightly increases training time compared to NLLvMF due to the computation of negative examples. Our proposed model can process large mini-batches efficiently, training much faster than baseline models. It converges faster than baseline models, leading to a significant improvement in overall training time. Memory requirements for our best performing model are minimal, requiring less than 1% of the number of baseline models. Future work can explore using approximate nearest neighbors algorithms to further improve translation time. Our best performing model has significantly fewer parameters in input and output layers compared to BPE-based baselines. It shows substantial improvements in translating less frequent and rare words, possibly due to better embeddings learned from the monolingual target corpus. In BPE models, rare words on the source side are split into smaller units, leading to potential translation errors. For example, \"saboter\" in French is incorrectly translated as \"sab+ot+tate\" instead of \"sabotage.\" Similarly, \"retraite\" is translated as \"pension\" instead of \"retirement.\" Despite not always matching reference translations, our models produce meaningful outputs. The model sometimes produces nearby words or paraphrases instead of the target word, leading to ungrammatical outputs. Integrating a pre-trained language model in the decoding framework could be a potential solution. Using syntactically inspired embeddings might help reduce errors, but fluency errors are not uncommon in other models as well. The study introduces a novel framework for sequence to sequence learning in language generation using word embeddings. New probabilistic loss functions based on vMF distribution are proposed for learning in this framework. The model trained on machine translation tasks shows a reduction in trainable parameters, faster convergence, and up to 2.5x speed-up in training time compared to standard benchmarks. Results are comparable to state-of-the-art models in neural machine translation. The study introduces a novel framework for sequence to sequence learning in language generation using word embeddings.

Results are comparable to state-of-the-art models in neural machine translation. The proposed setups in the report are comparable or slightly lower than the strongest baselines, but there are numerous possible directions to explore and improve. Future work will focus on additional loss functions, beam search setup, scheduled sampling, types of embeddings, translating into morphologically-rich languages, and the potential benefits for low-resource neural machine translation with continuous outputs. The proposed architecture and probabilistic loss have the potential to benefit other applications with sequence outputs, such as speech recognition. The proposed models aim to simplify training of generative adversarial networks for language generation by using continuous outputs. The normalization constant in the objective function is not directly differentiable due to the Bessel function. Translation quality experiments show potential for generating candidates for beam search using K-Nearest Neighbors, but ranking partially generated sequences remains a challenge. Training with continuous outputs efficiently and accurately yields significant gains in training time. Decoding with beam search is a topic for future investigation. Education is crucial, requiring everyone to be better role models for women and girls in our lives.
