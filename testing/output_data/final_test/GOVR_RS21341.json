    "content": "An insurance score, similar to a credit score, is generated by a computer model analyzing credit history to assess risk for insurers. Information for these scores is mainly sourced from credit reports provided by Equifax, Experian, and Trans Union. The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates these credit reporting agencies. While credit scores have long been used by lenders, insurers are now utilizing insurance scores to evaluate risk levels. Insurers increasingly use credit information from credit reports in underwriting decisions for personal lines of insurance like auto and home insurance. There is a growing trend of credit information being used in commercial insurance as well. 90% of property insurers now incorporate credit information in their underwriting processes, citing a statistical connection between insurance scores and risk likelihood. Insurers use credit information to determine insurance scores, which are linked to the likelihood of filing claims and the cost of those claims. Better insurance scores result in fewer claims and lower losses, allowing insurers to offer lower premiums and coverage to more customers. Insurers either develop their own scoring models or use third-party scores, all pointing to a clear connection between insurance scores and losses. Stress may be a factor influencing this relationship. Insurance scores are used to determine premiums based on credit information, with two possible explanations for their impact: stress and risk-taking behavior. Critics argue that insurance scores discriminate against low-income and minority consumers, penalizing those without credit records. Some advocate for banning or limiting their use due to concerns about unfair discrimination. The use of insurance scores in setting premiums has sparked controversy, with calls to ban or limit their use due to concerns about discrimination. The FCRA allows credit reports to be used by insurers without consumer permission, but adverse actions must be notified. The FTC oversees enforcement of FCRA provisions related to insurers obtaining consumer reports for policy decisions. The FTC allows insurers to use consumer reports for underwriting decisions, including obtaining credit reports for discounts. The Federal Reserve addresses credit scores in mortgage lending. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) addresses issues related to credit scores in the mortgage application process, including concerns about disparate impact on minorities and low-income applicants. Congress monitored the effectiveness of FCRA, leading to the introduction of H.R. 2622 in 2003 to amend the Act. Insurers' use of credit information, particularly insurance scores, also drew congressional interest. Congressman Gutierrez introduced H.R. 1473 to regulate insurers' use of credit information. An amendment calling for a study of insurer usage of credit information was accepted and included in H.R. 2622. The Senate passed a bill amending the FCRA, S. 1753, which included a requirement for a study on credit information usage in insurance. The conference committee made slight changes to the study requirement, which was included in the conference report signed by the President (P.L. 108-159). Unlike banks, insurers are primarily regulated at the state level, with state insurance laws prohibiting unfair trade practices and requiring fair insurance rates. Many states have laws prohibiting unfair trade practices and ensuring insurance rates are not discriminatory. State lawmakers are addressing the use of credit-based insurance scores by insurers, with 48 states taking action on this issue. State laws are following a model recommended by the National Conference of Insurance Legislators, requiring insurers to notify applicants and consumers if credit information will be used in underwriting and rating decisions. The NCOIL law requires insurers to notify consumers if credit information will be used in underwriting and rating decisions, inform them of adverse actions based on credit information, and re-underwrite policyholders if credit reports are corrected. State insurance regulators are increasing oversight over credit-based insurance scores, with some states already addressing the issue. In an effort to develop a unified national approach, state insurance regulators are working through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to address the use of credit information in insurance underwriting and rating. The NAIC appointed a credit scoring working group in March 2002 to draft documents for insurance consumers and regulators, including a Consumer Brochure explaining how insurers use credit information. The document discusses the pros and cons of regulating the use of credit history for insurance rating purposes. A proposed study on the potential disparate impact of credit scoring sparked debate and opposition, leading to the cancellation of a scheduled session at a NAIC meeting. It was suggested that concerned states should conduct their own studies on the matter. Several states planned studies on credit scoring but abandoned the effort due to industry litigation. The NAIC working group produced a white paper on best practices. Lawsuits have been filed alleging violations of state or federal law related to credit information usage, such as a case against Allstate for allegedly targeting non-whites for more expensive policies based on credit information. Insurers are concerned about a case that could set a new discrimination standard, potentially overriding state laws. Lawsuits have been filed against insurers like State Farm and Farmers Insurance Group for using credit history in setting premiums. A settlement in a Texas case was challenged by policyholders."
