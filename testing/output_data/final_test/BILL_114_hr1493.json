    "content": "The \"Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act\" calls for the establishment of an interagency coordinating committee to protect cultural property at risk from various threats. The committee should be chaired by a Department of State employee and include representatives from the Smithsonian Institution and other relevant federal agencies. It should also consult with governmental and nongovernmental organizations. The \"Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act\" aims to coordinate efforts to protect and preserve international cultural property, prevent illegal trade and trafficking, protect significant sites, and facilitate lawful exchanges. Additionally, the Act includes provisions for emergency protection of Syrian cultural property. The President has the authority to impose import restrictions on archaeological or ethnological material of Syria under the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, regardless of Syria's status as a State Party. This includes bypassing emergency conditions and limitations. Annual determinations regarding certification are required. The President must annually determine if Syria meets conditions to request an agreement under the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act. The import restrictions referred to in subsection (a) shall terminate on the date that is 5 years after the President determines that neither of the conditions specified in paragraph (1)(B) are met, or if Syria requests to enter an agreement with the United States, the restrictions shall terminate on the earlier of 3 years after the President's determination. The President may waive import restrictions for specified archaeological and ethnological material of Syria if certain conditions are met, including a request for temporary protection in the United States. The President may grant a waiver for specified archaeological and ethnological material of Syria to be temporarily located in the United States for protection. The material must be returned to the owner upon request, and the waiver should not contribute to illegal activities.
