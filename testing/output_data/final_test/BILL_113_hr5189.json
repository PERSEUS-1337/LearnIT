    "content": "The Act titled \"Energy and Water Research Integration Act of 2014\" focuses on integrating energy and water research. The Energy and Water Research Integration Act of 2014 mandates the Secretary of Energy to incorporate water considerations into energy research programs. This includes advancing energy technologies to minimize freshwater usage, increase water efficiency, utilize nontraditional water sources, and address climate variability's impact on water supplies for energy generation. The Act aims to improve understanding of the energy-water nexus. The Secretary of Energy must develop a strategic plan within 12 months of the Act's enactment, outlining research needs for energy programs. This plan will include milestones for achieving objectives such as advanced cooling technologies, performance improvements, and water reuse innovations. The strategic plan developed by the Secretary of Energy within 12 months of the Act's enactment will focus on innovative water reuse, recovery, treatment technologies, carbon capture systems with efficient water use, cost-effective technologies, systems analysis of energy-water nexus issues, wastewater treatment technologies for energy sources, and advanced materials for nontraditional water sources in energy generation and fuel production. The Secretary of Energy will develop a strategic plan focusing on innovative technologies for water reuse, recovery, treatment, carbon capture systems with efficient water use, cost-effective technologies, systems analysis of energy-water nexus issues, wastewater treatment technologies for energy sources, advanced materials for nontraditional water sources in energy generation, fuel production, and collaboration with other Federal agencies to avoid duplication. The Secretary of Energy will develop a strategic plan incorporating relevant information and recommendations, consulting with representatives from various sectors with expertise in energy-water nexus technologies and practices. The Secretary of Energy will submit a strategic plan to Congress within 15 months of the Act's enactment, and update it every 3 years using information from various sources. The Secretary of Energy will submit an updated strategic plan to Congress and provide progress reports every 2 years. Additionally, the Secretary may conduct additional research activities to integrate water considerations into the Department's overall research efforts. SEC. 3. ENERGY-WATER OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION. The Energy-Water Subcommittee of the Energy Advisory Board, established by the Secretary in coordination with other relevant Federal agencies, aims to improve energy and water resource data collection, reporting, and technological innovation. It includes representation from various programs and agencies, as well as non-Federal members with expertise in the energy-water nexus. The Subcommittee's functions include making recommendations on data collection and communication standards and protocols. The Energy-Water Subcommittee aims to improve data collection for the energy-water nexus by recommending ways to enhance Federal water use data, utilizing existing monitoring networks, and conducting annual technical workshops for information exchange among various government and private sector entities. Reports are required annually to track progress. The Energy-Water Subcommittee will transmit a report to Congress on its findings and activities under this Act every 2 years. SEC. 4. MANDATES. This Act does not require State, tribal, or local governments to take actions that increase their financial burden by restricting water use. SEC. 5. COORDINATION AND NONDUPLICATION. The Secretary will coordinate activities under this Act with other Department programs and Federal research programs to the maximum extent practicable. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The Department refers to the Department of Energy, energy-water nexus is the energy needed for water supplies and vice versa in the US, Secretary means the Secretary of Energy, and Subcommittee is the Energy-Water Subcommittee of the Energy Advisory Board."
