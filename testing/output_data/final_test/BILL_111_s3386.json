    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act\" and includes findings and a declaration of policy. The Internet is a significant platform for commerce in the US, with billions in retail sales annually. Consumer confidence is crucial for online commerce growth. Aggressive sales tactics harm consumer trust and the economy. The Committee revealed that reputable online retailers shared customers' billing information with third party sellers, who then used misleading tactics to charge millions of consumers for unwanted membership clubs. Third party sellers charged consumers for membership clubs without obtaining billing information directly from consumers, using a \"data pass\" process. Consumers were unaware they were enrolled in clubs as sellers acquired billing information from initial merchants. Sellers used free trials to enroll members and then charged them until memberships were canceled, employing \"free-to-pay conversion\" and \"negative option\" sales tactics. Consumers were misled into membership clubs through free trials and then charged using deceptive sales tactics like \"free-to-pay conversion\" and \"negative option\". PROHIBITIONS AGAINST UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE INTERNET SALES PRACTICES. Requirements for Certain Internet-Based Sales: It is illegal for post-transaction third party sellers to charge consumers without clearly disclosing all transaction terms, including goods/services description and their non-affiliation with the initial merchant. Post-transaction third party sellers must obtain express consent from consumers before charging their financial accounts by providing full account details, consumer information, and requiring additional affirmative actions. This is to prevent deceptive internet sales transactions facilitated through data-pass. It is illegal for initial merchants to share customer financial information with post-transaction third party sellers for online sales. This does not override the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. Initial merchant is defined as the one who gets billing info directly from the consumer, while post-transaction third party seller is the seller after the transaction. Post-transaction third party seller is a person who sells goods or services online after a consumer has initiated a transaction with the initial merchant, but is not affiliated with the initial merchant. Negative option marketing on the internet is prohibited unless clear disclosure of terms, consent, and mechanisms to stop recurring charges are provided to consumers. The Federal Trade Commission is responsible for enforcing regulations on negative option marketing on the internet, ensuring clear disclosure of terms and mechanisms to stop recurring charges for consumers. Violation of this Act or any regulation prescribed under it will be treated as a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act regarding unfair or deceptive acts. The Federal Trade Commission will enforce this Act with the same powers and duties as the FTC Act. Penalties for violations will be in accordance with the FTC Act. Authority preserved under this Act.

State attorneys general can still exercise their powers under state laws and proceed in court for alleged violations. No separate suit can be brought under this section if the same alleged violation is already being addressed. No separate suit can be brought under this section if the same alleged violation is the subject of a pending action by the Federal Trade Commission or the United States under this Act.
