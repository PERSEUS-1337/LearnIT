Congress finds that the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty would decrease significantly with the protection of armor vests. Studies show that officers not wearing vests face a 14 times higher risk of fatality. Approximately 25% of State, local, and tribal officers are not issued body armor. Bullet-resistant materials have saved over 2,000 officers' lives between 1985 and 1994. The purpose of this Act is to save lives of law enforcement officers by providing them with armor vests.
