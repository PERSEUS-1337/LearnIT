    "content": "Juvenile offenders of federal criminal law are primarily under the jurisdiction of state juvenile court authorities. The Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act allows federal delinquency proceedings in cases where state courts are unable to take jurisdiction or for specific federal interest crimes. In serious cases, juvenile offenders may be tried as adults. The increase in serious juvenile crime, limited state court jurisdiction, and expanded federal criminal law have led to more federal delinquency proceedings. In early America, children under 7 were considered incapable of criminal responsibility, with a rebuttable presumption of incapacity until age 14 when they were deemed capable of understanding criminal intent. During the early nineteenth century, children under the age of seven were considered incapable of criminal responsibility, with a presumption of innocence. Between seven and fourteen, children were presumed to lack criminal intent, but this presumption could be overturned with evidence of malicious intent. Age was not a sole factor in determining guilt, as the understanding and consciousness of guilt were also considered. Children as young as eight have been executed for capital offenses based on their demonstrated awareness of their actions. In the early twentieth century, states established juvenile court systems to process children accused of criminal conduct separately from adults. By 1930, the federal government was the only entity treating child offenders as adults, while states had adopted noncriminal juvenile court systems focused on rehabilitation. Attorney General Wickersham recommended treating juvenile offenders with social methods instead of punishment, citing the inadequacy of federal penal institutions for handling juvenile delinquency. Congress agreed to return juveniles charged with federal offenses to their home state's juvenile authorities. The Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act of 1938 addressed limitations in state juvenile proceedings by allowing federal juvenile proceedings if both parties agree. The Federal Youth Corrections Act in 1950 provided special rehabilitative opportunities for federal juvenile offenders tried as adults. In 1974, Congress revised the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act to provide basic procedural rights to juveniles under federal jurisdiction and align federal procedures with state laws. Crimes punishable by death or life imprisonment were included in federal juvenile treatment for the first time, following Supreme Court decisions on capital punishment procedures. In 1984, Congress made significant changes to federal juvenile law, emphasizing that some juveniles who commit serious crimes should be punished as adults. The Sentencing Reform Act repealed the Federal Youth Corrections Act and eliminated juvenile parole provisions, also lowering the age for juvenile transfer. The Sentencing Reform Act lowered the age for juvenile transfer to adult court and expanded the list of crimes for such transfers. Federal juvenile law emphasizes state jurisdiction first, with federal delinquency provisions as a second preference. Historically, federal delinquency cases, mainly involving Native Americans, arise in areas beyond state jurisdiction like Indian country. In some cases involving drugs or violence, juveniles can be tried as adults under federal law. Federal law allows juveniles to be tried as adults in federal court for instances involving drugs or violence. A juvenile is defined as an individual under 21 years old when the crime is committed and before reaching the age of 18. Federal authorities can prosecute individuals as adults if they are actively involved in a conspiracy or racketeering enterprise that spans their eighteenth birthday. After being found delinquent, a juvenile's supervised release can be revoked, and they may be held until age 26. State and local officials primarily handle criminal investigation and prosecution, but federal law violations often overlap with state laws. Federal criminal law violations usually also violate state laws. For example, crimes like robbery of a federal insured bank or murder of a federal employee will typically be against state laws as well. State juvenile courts can have jurisdiction over violations of federal law by individuals under 18, allowing them to bypass federal authorities. However, some states have narrowed their juvenile court jurisdiction compared to federal law in terms of age or type of crime. Some states narrow juvenile court jurisdiction compared to federal law in terms of age or type of crime. Federal custody activates legal rights and notification requirements for juveniles taken into custody for federal law violations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has provided guidance on federal advice and notification provisions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has clarified that \"immediate\" means the same for advice and notifications purposes. Parental notification must include advice on the juvenile's rights, and can be done through a surrogate or foreign consulate if parents are outside the U.S. Convictions or delinquency determinations may be overturned if tainted by egregious violations of section 5033. Less egregious violations may result in suppression of incriminating statements. Juveniles must be brought before a magistrate for arraignment promptly. The juvenile must be promptly brought before a magistrate for arraignment, with the process being expedited even when a magistrate is not immediately available. The juvenile is entitled to legal counsel, and a guardian ad litem may be appointed if necessary. Detention may be ordered for the juvenile's safety or to ensure court appearances. A delinquency hearing must be held within 30 days for juveniles under federal detention. The speedy trial requirement for juveniles in federal custody excludes certain periods of time, such as state detention, periods of non-detention, delays due to deception, time between admission and sentencing, and continuances granted at the juvenile's request. Time spent on government appeals and transfer motions is also excluded. Federal law allows federal proceedings against a juvenile offender if there is no viable state option or for serious federal crimes. The government must certify the need for a federal forum based on various criteria. Certification by the Attorney General is required, and a single basis for certification establishes federal jurisdiction. Certification by the Attorney General is required for federal proceedings against a juvenile offender. The certification is jurisdictional and must show a substantial federal interest. The term \"crime of violence\" lacks a statutory definition, so courts have relied on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 for guidance. The term \"crime of violence\" is defined as an offense that involves the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person or property. This definition has been relied upon by courts due to the lack of a statutory definition. The Supreme Court declared 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) unconstitutionally vague in Sessions v. Dimaya, impacting the definition of \"crime of violence.\" Future lower federal courts may need to use different statutes or create a new definition. If the government doesn't pursue federal proceedings, the juvenile may be released or handed over to state authorities. The government can initiate proceedings by filing information and the juvenile's past record with the district court. Most courts believe they can't proceed against a juvenile without evidence of their prior record. The government may proceed against a juvenile as an adult based on their prior record, through either the child's insistence or a juvenile court transfer. There are mandatory transfers for violent felonies committed by juveniles 16 years or older with a history of similar offenses. Discretionary transfers can also occur for juveniles 15 or older, or even 13 or older in cases of assault, homicide, or robbery. The transfer of juveniles to adult court can be mandatory for violent felonies committed by those 16 or older with a history of similar offenses. Discretionary transfers can also happen for juveniles 15 or older, and in some cases, even for those 13 or older involved in assault, homicide, or robbery. The language used in determining these transfers is similar to that found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16(a) and 16(b), which has been deemed unconstitutionally vague by the Supreme Court in the case of Dimaya. The discretionary transfer provision for juveniles 15 years of age or older faces challenges due to the vague definition of \"crimes of violence.\" Lower courts must interpret section 16(a) or find alternative definitions to avoid uncertainty. Mandatory transfers have been upheld constitutionally, but questions regarding prior convictions cannot be raised during the transfer hearing. Juvenile adjudication is presumed appropriate in discretionary transfers unless the government proves otherwise. Juvenile adjudication is presumed appropriate in discretionary transfers unless the government proves otherwise. Section 5032 outlines factors for the court to consider when transferring a juvenile for trial as an adult, focusing on the juvenile's background, offense, delinquency record, intellectual and psychological development, treatment efforts, and available programs. The court aims to balance the juvenile's rehabilitation prospects against the risk of harm if not tried as an adult. The court considers factors such as the juvenile's age, social background, seriousness of the alleged offense, and role in the transgression when deciding on transferring a juvenile for trial as an adult. The older the juvenile at the time of the offense and transfer hearing, the more weight age carries in favor of transfer. Allegations of serious offenses strongly support transfer. The court considers factors such as the juvenile's age, social background, seriousness of the alleged offense, and role in the transgression when deciding on transferring a juvenile for trial as an adult. The extent and nature of the juvenile's prior delinquency record, intellectual development, and psychological maturity are also taken into account. A clean record does not prevent transfer, and intellectual development can influence the decision, especially for older juveniles. The fourth factor aims to predict the juvenile's receptiveness to rehabilitation efforts. The fifth factor in determining transfer for trial as an adult evaluates the juvenile's past receptiveness to rehabilitative efforts. Availability of treatment programs for the individual is also considered, with age or offense potentially affecting eligibility for state programs. Transfer hearings are treated like preliminary hearings, with rules excluding hearsay evidence. Juvenile statements during transfer hearings may not be used in subsequent criminal proceedings, and psychiatric examinations may influence transfer determinations. The court may base transfer determinations on results without violating the juvenile's Fifth Amendment rights. Transfer decisions can be appealed under an abuse of discretion standard. The Supreme Court's ruling in Miller v. Alabama prohibits life imprisonment without parole for juvenile offenses, but allows transfer for offenses punishable by imprisonment. If the government does not request transfer and the juvenile does not request an adult trial, the district court can hold a delinquency hearing. Grand jury indictment and jury trial rights are not constitutionally required. The Constitution does not require grand jury indictment or jury trial rights for juveniles. However, it mandates key features of a criminal trial such as notice of charges, right to counsel, and protection against self-incrimination. After a finding of delinquency, the court schedules a sentencing hearing or a commitment for examination. The court can dispose of the case by suspending sentence, ordering restitution or probation, or committing the juvenile to the Attorney General for detention. Time limits are established for the court's authority in ordering detention or imposing sentences. Section 5037(c) sets limits on the court's authority for detention, probation, and juvenile delinquent supervision. The court can order detention for juveniles under 18 until they turn 21 or based on sentencing guidelines. For juveniles between 18 and 21, detention limits depend on the seriousness of the misconduct. The court can order detention for juveniles under 18 until they turn 21 or based on sentencing guidelines. For juveniles between 18 and 21, detention limits depend on the seriousness of the misconduct, with specific time limits for probation as well. The court may revise or revoke a juvenile's probation and order detention for probation violations, with specific time limits based on age and seriousness of misconduct. Detention authority following revocation is governed by time limits for juveniles between 18 and 21, with a maximum detention age of 23 for individuals 21 and older. An individual aged 21 or older may not be detained beyond age 23, or 25 for serious misconduct. The court can order detention for up to 5 years for serious offenses and 3 years for less serious offenses. Additionally, juvenile delinquent supervision may be imposed along with detention. When a court orders juvenile detention, it can also impose juvenile delinquent supervision with its own time limits and conditions. The supervision term cannot exceed the individual's 21st birthday if under 18 at the time of detention order. For individuals between 18 and 21, the supervision term is limited by the time served in detention. The court may order a supervision term up to five years for serious offenses punishable by 12 years or more. The maximum term of detention following revocation of a term of supervision is the same as the maximum term of detention following revocation of probation, less time served in detention. The court may order a term of supervision no longer than five years for serious offenses punishable by 12 years or more. The term of supervision for juvenile delinquents is limited to five years, or until the individual turns 26 years old, depending on the seriousness of the offense. Section 5037(d)(6) is unclear about supervision limits for individuals under 18 or between 18 and 21 years old. For those over 21, the term of supervision \"shall be in.\" The Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act limits supervision for juvenile delinquents to five years or until they turn 26, depending on the offense seriousness. Section 5037(d)(1) lacks time limits, allowing courts to impose supervision after official detention. An appellate court determined that supervision duration is based on the juvenile's age at the revocation hearing. The Act aims to protect juveniles from severe consequences. The Juvenile Delinquency Act aims to protect juveniles from the harsh consequences of the criminal justice system by keeping them separate from adults, sealing their records, and balancing confidentiality with public interest. Juveniles transferred for trial as adults in federal court are treated similarly to adults. Juveniles tried as adults in federal court are treated similarly to adults, with few distinctions based on age. The Sentencing Guidelines now allow consideration of the defendant's age in some cases, and juveniles cannot receive the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole for crimes committed as juveniles."
