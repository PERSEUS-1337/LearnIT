The Act mandates that manufacturers produce a specific percentage of dual-fueled vehicles, with 50% for model years 2011 and 2012, and 90% for model year 2013 onwards. There is an exception for vehicles running solely on electricity. Additionally, regulations must be established within a year of the Act's enactment, and there is a provision for promoting blender pumps. The Blender Pump Grant Program defines a blender pump as a fuel dispenser capable of dispensing various gasoline and ethanol blends, including E-85 fuel and ethanol fuel blends ranging from 0% to 85% ethanol content. The Secretary of Energy will provide grants to eligible facilities for installing blender pump fuel infrastructure, including equipment for retail sale and marketing of ethanol fuel blends. The Secretary of Energy will provide grants for installing fuel infrastructure for ethanol blends, including blender pumps and storage tanks. The Federal share of the project cost will be 50%, with authorized appropriations of $50 million for 2010, $100 million for 2011, and $200 million for 2012. The Clean Air Act amendment allocates $200 million for 2012, $300 million for 2013, and $350 million for 2014 for the installation of blender pumps by major fuel distributors at owned and branded stations. Definitions for E-85 fuel and ethanol fuel blend are provided. The Clean Air Act amendment allocates funding for the installation of blender pumps by major fuel distributors at owned and branded stations. The term 'major fuel distributor' is defined as a person owning a refinery and directly marketing its output, excluding those with less than 50 retail fueling stations. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Administrator of the EPA. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Administrator of the EPA, will require major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at owned and branded stations for a minimum of 5 years. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the EPA Administrator, will mandate major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at majority-owned and branded stations for a minimum of 5 years, with applicable percentages determined according to a specified table. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the EPA Administrator, will require major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at majority-owned and branded stations. The applicable percentages for installation are 10% in 2011, 20% in 2013, 35% in 2015, and 50% from 2017 onwards. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the EPA Administrator, will require major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at specified percentages in majority-owned and branded stations. The Secretary will ensure that each major fuel distributor installs these pumps in each State where they operate. Financial responsibility regulations will also be promulgated. The Secretary will ensure major fuel distributors assume full financial responsibility for installing blender pumps and necessary equipment to ensure proper function. Production credits will be earned for exceeding blender pump installation requirements at owned and branded stations. The major fuel distributor can earn credits for installing blender pumps exceeding requirements, which can be used in the following three calendar years. They can also sell these credits to other distributors to help them meet the installation requirements. A major fuel distributor cannot use purchased credits to meet the geographic distribution requirement."
