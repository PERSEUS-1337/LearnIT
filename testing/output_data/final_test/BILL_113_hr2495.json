The Department of Energy High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004 defines key terms such as co-design, Department, exascale, and high-end computing system. Co-design involves developing algorithms and codes with computer architectures to maximize high-end computing system efficiency. The Department of Energy High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004 defines key terms such as institution of higher education, leadership system, National Laboratory, Secretary, and software technology for advanced scientific and engineering applications. The curr_chunk discusses optimal algorithms, programming environments, tools, languages, and operating systems for high-end computing systems. The Department of Energy High-End Computing Research and Development Program focuses on optimal algorithms, programming environments, tools, languages, and operating systems for high-end computing systems. The Department of Energy High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004 is amended to include partnering with universities, National Laboratories, and industry to apply technology developed in the program to various challenges in science, engineering, medicine, and industry. The Department of Energy is amending the High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004 to focus on developing exascale computing systems through partnerships with universities, National Laboratories, and industry. This includes research, development, and engineering of multiple exascale architectures to advance the Department's missions. The Department of Energy is amending the High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004 to focus on developing exascale computing systems through partnerships with universities, National Laboratories, and industry. This includes research, development, and engineering of multiple exascale architectures to advance the Department's missions by conducting mission-related co-design activities, developing advancements in hardware and software technology, and exploring the use of exascale computing technologies to advance science and engineering. The Secretary will provide access to exascale systems for researchers in US industry, higher education institutions, National Laboratories, and Federal agencies. Outreach programs will be conducted to increase readiness for domestic industries to use these platforms. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress outlining an integrated strategy and program management plan within 90 days of the enactment of the American Super Computing Leadership Act. The report will outline the plan for the Exascale Computing Program, including target dates, milestones, functional requirements, roles, acquisition strategy, and resources needed. It will also detail the Department's organization for managing the program and ensuring balance across subprograms in a budget-constrained environment. The Secretary will provide status reports on milestones and costs for the exascale computing program in the budget submission. Additionally, a plan detailing cost projections and capabilities of new energy technologies will be transmitted to Congress before construction of any exascale-class computing facility. The Secretary will report on milestones and costs for the exascale computing program in the budget submission. A plan detailing cost projections and capabilities of new energy technologies will be sent to Congress before building an exascale-class computing facility. The plan will include an assessment of technical risks, scientific advances, and investments in system software and algorithms. The House of Representatives passed the document on September 8, 2014, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
