    "content": "The Constitution grants Congress authority to impeach and remove government officials for specified offenses, serving as a crucial tool for accountability. Impeachment involves two distinct proceedings in the House and Senate, with a conviction requiring a two-thirds majority in the Senate. If the Senate convicts with a two-thirds majority, the official is removed from office and may be disqualified from holding federal office in the future. The House has impeached nineteen individuals, including federal judges, a Senator, a Cabinet member, and two Presidents. Eight individuals, all federal judges, were convicted by the Senate. Impeachment proceedings have specific requirements, with Senators under oath and no jury trial. The Chief Justice presides over the Senate trial if the President is impeached. The President cannot use pardon power to shield individuals from impeachment or removal. Understanding Congress's historical practices on impeachment is crucial. Understanding Congress's historical practices on impeachment is crucial for interpreting the Constitution's impeachment clauses. James Madison and Justice Joseph Story believed that the meaning of impeachable offenses would evolve over time, much like common law. Justice Story thought it impossible to precisely define all political offenses that could lead to impeachment in the future. The report delves into the historical background of impeachment, emphasizing the unique roles of the House and Senate in the process. It also explores recurring questions about impeachment, including legal considerations for a Senate trial. The concept of impeachment and the standard of \"high Crimes and misdemeanors\" are central to the discussion. The concept of impeachment and the standard of \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" originate from English, colonial, and early state practice. Parliament used impeachment as a tool to punish political offenses that damaged the state or subverted the government, focusing on misconduct in high places. The concept of impeachment and the standard of \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" originate from English, colonial, and early state practice. Impeachment was used to punish political offenses that damaged the state or subverted the government, focusing on misconduct in high places. The standard of high crimes and misdemeanors applied to significant abuses of government office, misapplication of funds, neglect of duty, corruption, abridgement of parliamentary rights, and betrayals of public trust. Impeachment in the English experience addressed conduct involving an individual's abuse of power or office that damaged the state. American colonies adopted their own impeachment practices, limiting it to officeholders based on misconduct committed in office. The Framers at the Constitutional Convention adopted impeachment procedures based on English and colonial practices. Impeachment was limited to government officials and punishment was removal from office, with the possibility of future disqualification. The English Parliamentary structure influenced the division of power for impeachment between the \"lower\" and \"upper\" house. The Framers at the Constitutional Convention adopted an \"Americanized\" impeachment practice with a republican character distinct from English practice. The Constitution established an impeachment mechanism exclusively for holding public officials, including the President, accountable, narrowing the scope of impeachable offenses compared to English practice. The Framers' choices in crafting the Constitution's impeachment provisions provide Congress with a crucial check on the other branches of the federal government and inform the Constitution's separation of powers. They adopted a requirement of a two-thirds majority vote for conviction on impeachment charges, unlike English practice, and restricted the pardon power from being applied to impeachments. This Americanized impeachment practice with a republican character is distinct from English practice. The American colonies and early state constitutions had their own impeachment procedures before the federal Constitution. The Constitutional Convention debated various bodies to try impeachments, including the Supreme Court. Concerns were raised about the Court's independence due to Justices being appointed by the President. Impeachment serves as a crucial legislative check against the judicial branch in the Constitution's structure. Impeachment in the Constitution serves as a crucial check against the judicial branch, ensuring that judges cannot be removed by other means. The Framers decided that Congress alone would determine who is subject to impeachment to prevent the judiciary from usurping legislative authority. Impeachment is a bridle in the hands of the legislative body upon the executive branch, with the power to impeach separated from the authority to try and convict. The Framers established a separation of powers in the impeachment process to prevent persecution and promote integrity. The Chief Justice presides over impeachment trials of the President to avoid conflicts of interest. Impeachable conduct standards were narrowed compared to the English experience. The Framers restricted impeachment to treason, bribery, and \"other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,\" focusing mainly on the President's behavior. Gouverneur Morris argued for the President's removal through impeachment to prevent betrayal of trust, citing historical examples of bribery. The Framers at the Constitutional Convention rejected including \"maladministration\" as an impeachable offense, opting instead for \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" from English practice. James Madison argued against \"maladministration\" due to its vagueness, leading to the adoption of the current impeachment standard. The Framers rejected \"maladministration\" as an impeachable offense and opted for \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" instead. This decision was influenced by the British impeachment proceedings of Warren Hastings, where corruption and abuse of power were key charges. George Mason referenced the impeachment of Hastings at the Constitutional Convention, highlighting the importance of defining impeachment beyond just treason and bribery. Mason objected to limiting impeachment to treason, proposing that maladministration should also be included as an impeachable offense. He believed impeachment was necessary to hold government officers accountable for political crimes. James Madison emphasized the importance of defending the community against the chief executive's negligence or betrayal of trust. Impeachable offenses, as described by Alexander Hamilton, arise from the abuse of public trust and relate to injuries done to society. James Iredell noted the challenge in defining such offenses beyond causing harm to the government, emphasizing the need to punish high crimes and misdemeanors against the government. Impeachable offenses, according to historical figures like Alexander Hamilton and James Iredell, involve acts of great injury to the community and abuse of public trust. These offenses are not limited to indictable crimes but can also include actions like receiving bribes or making willful mistakes that harm the government. Impeachment was discussed by historical figures like Randolph and Wilson, who believed it was appropriate for political crimes and violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause. Wilson argued that impeachments were not part of ordinary jurisprudence and were based on different principles. Impeachment historically applied to political offenses, such as violations of public trust and duties by public officials. The phrase \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" was understood to encompass uniquely political misdeeds that could not be fully defined in advance. The impeachment process is determined over time through the political process, with the Constitution granting the power to the House of Representatives. Impeachment can be initiated by a Member through a resolution or charge, or by a referral from an external investigatory body. The House has the sole discretion to begin impeachment proceedings against an individual, which can be initiated by a Member through a resolution or referral from an external investigatory body. Impeachment investigations are typically handled by a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, with the scope varying depending on the case. The House Judiciary Committee subcommittee conducts impeachment investigations, which can be initiated independently or rely on outside records. If articles of impeachment are approved, House managers present the case to the Senate, acting as prosecutors in the trial. Nineteen individuals, including federal judges, a Senator, a Cabinet member, and two Presidents, have been impeached by the House. The consensus on impeachment is that it can address misconduct not necessarily leading to criminal charges. Grounds for impeachment include abusing power, incompatible behavior, and misusing office for personal gain. Impeachment is meant to cover a broad range of serious misconduct by officials. Impeachments and convictions of federal officials serve as important examples of impeachable conduct. Even unsuccessful impeachment processes, like the attempt against President John Tyler in 1842, can shape the understanding of what constitutes an impeachable offense. In the aftermath of failed impeachment attempts, Presidents have used veto power for policy reasons, seen as a separation of powers limitation. President Nixon's impeachment articles for obstructing justice at Watergate inform lawmakers on impeachable offenses. President Nixon's alleged abuse of power at the Watergate Hotel and Office Building led to a cover-up of investigated activities. While no impeachment vote was taken, the experience highlighted a serious abuse of presidential office integrity. It is cautioned that what may not be impeachable in one context could be in another, making the full scope of impeachable behavior difficult to specify. Historical precedent may not always apply. The Constitution grants the Senate broad discretion in establishing procedures for impeachment trials. In Nixon v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that impeachment trials are a nonjusticiable political question. The term \"try\" in the Constitution is solely committed to the Senate. The Supreme Court ruled in Nixon v. United States that the term \"try\" in the Constitution's impeachment provisions is solely for the Senate to interpret. The Constitution imposes three clear requirements for impeachment trials in the Senate, giving the Senate substantial discretion in establishing its own procedures. The Senate impeachment trials frequency and nature depend on charges from the House. While the House has impeached various officials, the Senate has only convicted a few. Senate acquittals may set precedents for future impeachments. For example, the first impeachment involved a Senator aiding Great Britain, but the Senate dismissed the charges in 1799. The Senate acquitted Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1799, establishing a precedent that impeachment is not for disagreements with a judge's decisions. Senators take a special oath for impeachment trials, emphasizing their unique role in the process. The Senate takes a special oath for impeachment trials, pledging impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. The Constitution allows the Senate to disqualify an individual from holding future office after conviction, a practice that emerged during the Civil War era. Federal judge West H. Humphreys was impeached in 1862 for joining the Confederate government while retaining his U.S. government seat. The Senate voted to convict and disqualify Judge Humphreys from holding future office in 1862. Senate practice now requires a simple majority vote for disqualification, separate from the supermajority needed for removal. Impeachment is a political remedy distinct from criminal processes, allowing for conviction, removal from office, and future disqualification. Impeachment is a political remedy for misconduct, distinct from criminal proceedings. It is a method of national inquest into the conduct of public officials for the abuse of public trust. Impeachable offenses relate to injuries done to society, aiming to protect the public interest rather than impose punishment. This was evident in the impeachment trial of Judge Alcee Hastings, where he was impeached for conduct similar to his criminal indictment, highlighting the distinction between impeachment and criminal proceedings. Judge Hastings argued that impeachment proceedings were \"double jeopardy\" due to his previous acquittal in a criminal case. The Senate rejected his motion to dismiss the articles and voted to convict and remove him on eight charges. However, he was not disqualified from holding office in the future. The Constitution allows for impeachment of civil officers for \"treason, bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,\" with the interpretation of these terms evolving over time through historical practice. The Framers did not provide a specific list of impeachable offenses. Impeachment proceedings aim to establish and protect constitutional norms, either by reinforcing existing norms or by setting new markers for impeachable behavior. Congressional history of impeachment illuminates the constitutional meaning of impeachment and helps define the scope of impeachable activities and individuals. During the Adams Administration in 1797, Senator William Blount was impeached for conspiring with the British to invade land in the American Southwest under Spanish control. The House impeached Blount, questioning whether Senators were \"civil officers\" subject to impeachment. Despite the debate, Blount was impeached and expelled from the Senate. Samuel W. Dana argued that Members of Congress must be civil officers, as mentioned in the Constitution. At the Senate impeachment trial in 1799, Blount's attorneys argued that impeachment was improper because Blount had already been expelled from his Senate seat and had not been charged with a crime. The primary issue of debate was whether Members of Congress qualified as civil officers subject to impeachment. The House prosecutors argued that virtually anyone was subject to impeachment, while the defense argued that this broad interpretation would disrupt the division of federal and state authorities. The Senate voted against declaring Blount a \"civil officer\" subject to impeachment. The Senate voted to dismiss the impeachment articles against Blount, the first federal official to be impeached and removed from office was John Pickering, a federal district judge impeached in 1803. President Thomas Jefferson's election in 1800 signaled a shift from Federalist party control of government. Judge Pickering was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1803 and convicted by the Senate on March 12, 1804. The impeachment focused on accusations of drunkenness, blasphemy on the bench, and refusal to follow legal precedent. Despite evidence of his mental illness being presented, he was found guilty as charged. The Senate found Judge Pickering guilty as charged, but the articles did not specify high crimes or misdemeanors. Objections to the question framing led some Senators to withdraw. On the same day, the House impeached Justice Samuel Chase, seen as partisan by Jeffersonian Republicans for supporting Federalist John Adams and giving aggressive jury instructions in Sedition Act cases. The Senate trial of Justice Chase began on February 4, 1805, with accusations of arbitrary behavior, misapplication of law, and expressing partisan views. The primary conflict was whether his actions were impeachable, leading to a Senate vote where three out of eight articles received a majority for conviction, falling short of the necessary two-thirds majority. The Senate vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed for conviction on any articles during the trial of Justice Chase in 1805. The impeachment raised questions about whether it is limited to criminal acts or extends to noncriminal behavior. The acquittal of Justice Chase established a limit on impeachment, indicating it does not cover disagreements with a judge's opinions or judicial philosophy. Some Senators did not view the alleged offenses as impeachable behavior. In 1830, the House of Representatives impeached Judge James Peck for abusing his authority by holding an attorney in contempt for criticizing him in a newspaper article. The context involved disputes over land grant titles in the Louisiana territory. In 1830, Judge James Peck was impeached by the House for holding an attorney in contempt after a critical article was published. The Senate acquitted Judge Peck, leading to a law reforming judicial contempt power. During the Civil War, Judge West H. Humphreys was impeached and convicted for joining the Confederate government while still holding a U.S. federal judge position. Judge Humphreys was convicted for joining the Confederate government and abandoning his position. Unlike Judge Pickering, he did not attend the proceedings and no defense was offered. President Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial occurred during the Civil War and after President Lincoln's assassination. Johnson, a Democrat and former slave owner, lacked a party and geographic power base, which isolated him during his presidency. President Johnson clashed with the majority Republican Congress over Reconstruction policies and control of executive branch officials. He vetoed twenty-one bills, with fifteen overrides by Congress. The Tenure of Office Act, reauthorized in 1867 over Johnson's veto, restricted the President's ability to remove officeholders without Senate approval. Congressional Republicans anticipated possible impeachment. President Johnson clashed with Congress over Reconstruction policies and control of officials. The Tenure of Office Act limited his power to remove officeholders without Senate approval. Republicans knew of his plans to fire Secretary Stanton, leading to his impeachment for defying the Act and violating the Army Appropriations Act. The Senate appointed a committee to recommend rules for the impeachment trial of President Johnson, including a one-hour time limit for each side to debate. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase presided over the trial, with a debate over Senator Benjamin Wade's eligibility to participate due to the vacant Vice Presidency. Ultimately, Senator Wade was sworn in for the trial. During the impeachment trial of President Johnson, the Senate debated whether the Tenure of Office Act protected Secretary Stanton, appointed by President Lincoln. President Johnson's counsel argued that impeachment for violating an unclear statute was inappropriate and an intrusion into the President's authority. The Senate failed to convict Johnson by one vote on three articles, with some Senators prepared to acquit. Seven Republicans voted to acquit, questioning the Act's applicability to Stanton and the impeachment over an ambiguous law interpretation. The acquittal of President Johnson in his impeachment trial raised questions about the limits of impeachment for abuses of power versus political disagreements. The struggle between Congress and the President over executive power was highlighted during the trial. The postbellum experience in American history saw government officials impeached on various grounds, guiding the practice of impeachment today. In 1873, Judge Delahay was impeached by the House for drunkenness, but resigned before a Senate trial was held. This case demonstrates that impeachable behavior is not strictly limited. The impeachment of Judge Delahay in 1873 showed that impeachable behavior is not limited to strictly criminal acts, but also includes abuses of power. During this period of American history, there was partisan conflict over Reconstruction, leading to investigations and impeachment proceedings against various individuals, such as federal district judge Edward H. Durrell. Durrell was accused of corruption and interfering with elections, but resigned before impeachment proceedings could be completed. This was the first and only time a Cabinet-level official was impeached. The first and only impeachment of a Cabinet-level official occurred during Ulysses S. Grant's presidency. Secretary of War William W. Belknap was impeached in 1876 for allegedly receiving payments in exchange for appointing someone to maintain a trading post in Indian territory. Belknap resigned before the House impeached him, but the Senate still held a trial where he was acquitted. Senators voted to convict him, but no article received a two-thirds majority, resulting in acquittal. Some Senators voted to acquit due to the belief that the Senate lacked jurisdiction over a private citizen. The impeachment of Belknap in 1876 charged him with high crimes and misdemeanors, not bribery as explicitly stated in the Constitution. The twentieth century saw the expansion of impeachable conduct, including noncriminal behavior and the role of federal judges. The question of judicial review of impeachments arose in the federal courts, and the impeachment of Charles Swayne raised the issue of Congress designating behavior as a \"high crime or misdemeanor\" by statute. The impeachment of Judge Swayne in the early 1900s stemmed from a federal statute requiring district judges to live in their districts. The House impeached Swayne based on a report from the Judiciary Committee, with articles of impeachment presented to the Senate. The process involved unique steps, with individual articles receiving less support than the initial impeachment vote. The impeachment of Judge Swayne in the early 1900s accused him of various offenses, including misusing his office and living outside his judicial district. At the Senate trial, Swayne admitted to some accusations but argued that his actions were not impeachable. The Senate failed to convict him on any charges. The impeachability of noncriminal behavior for federal judges was established by the impeachment of Judge Archbald in 1912. Judge Archbald was impeached by the House for using his position as a judge for personal gain. The Senate convicted him on five articles and disqualified him from holding office in the future. The impeachment was a result of corruption scandals in the 1920s, including the Teapot Dome Scandal. The Teapot Dome Scandal involved the noncompetitive lease of government land to oil companies, leading to resignations and the criminal conviction of a Cabinet-level official. Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall leased reserves in Teapot Dome, Wyoming to his friends without competitive bidding, resulting in bribery and conspiracy convictions. President Harding's death in 1923 halted congressional hearings on the scandal. The Teapot Dome Scandal involved noncompetitive leases of government land to oil companies, leading to resignations and a Cabinet-level official's criminal conviction. President Harding's death in 1923 halted congressional hearings on the scandal. The affair also led to judicial decisions on Congress's investigatory powers, including an impeachment investigation into Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty's decisions. Daugherty resigned in 1924 amid allegations of improper activities in the Justice Department. Judge English was impeached for directing a U.S. marshal to gather state and local officials into court, threatening members of the press, and showing favoritism to certain litigants. He resigned before a Senate trial, and the charges were dismissed without a trial. Judge Louderback was impeached in 1933 for favoritism in appointing bankruptcy receivers. The House authorized an investigation, but the Judiciary Committee voted against recommending impeachment, instead urging censure. The Judiciary Committee voted against recommending impeachment of Judge Louderback, favoring censure instead. The House still voted to impeach him, but the Senate did not convict. Judge Ritter was impeached for various offenses, acquitted on individual counts but convicted on one for bringing his court into disrepute. This was the first impeachment challenged in court. The first impeachment challenged in court was that of Judge Ritter, who sued seeking back pay, arguing that the Senate's verdict was improper. The court rejected his suit, stating that the Senate has exclusive jurisdiction over impeachments. The impeachment of President Richard Nixon, although he was never impeached or tried in the Senate, set a standard for impeachable behavior in a President. Nixon resigned less than two years after his reelection. Less than two years after his reelection, President Richard Nixon resigned following impeachment articles adopted by the House Judiciary Committee. The impeachment stemmed from the Watergate break-in by men linked to the Committee to Re-Elect the President. Investigations by a special prosecutor and Senate committee revealed Nixon's involvement in covering up the incident. President Nixon was involved in covering up the Watergate incident, illegally harassing his enemies and using a \"plumbers unit\" to commit burglaries. Evidence revealed his tape recording system in the Oval Office, leading to the Saturday Night Massacre when he refused to hand over the tapes. The Saturday Night Massacre occurred when President Nixon ordered the firing of Special Prosecutor Cox, leading to the resignation of Attorney General Richardson and Deputy Attorney General Ruckelshaus. Solicitor General Bork eventually fired the special prosecutor. Nixon later agreed to hand over some subpoenaed tapes. The House Judiciary Committee began impeachment hearings in April 1974, and a grand jury indicted seven individuals connected to Watergate, naming the President as an unindicted coconspirator. The House Judiciary Committee voted to adopt three articles of impeachment against President Nixon in late July 1974. The articles alleged obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and authorizing burglaries of political enemies. The House Judiciary Committee considered and rejected two proposed articles of impeachment against President Nixon. One article was rejected for concealing bombing operations in Cambodia during the Vietnam conflict, while the other concerned receiving compensation at Nixon's private properties and tax evasion. Clause 7 of the Constitution and tax evasion were key points in the impeachment proceedings against President Nixon. Some Members argued that the evidence for impeachment was insufficient, while others believed tax fraud was not grounds for impeachment. President Nixon resigned before the full House could vote on the articles. The lessons and standards set by his impeachment remain a topic of debate. The impeachment of President Nixon involved articles that were likely impeachable, but the rejection of certain articles by the House Judiciary Committee raised questions about what constitutes an impeachable offense. The impeachment of President Clinton also highlighted differing views on when private conduct can be grounds for impeachment. The House Judiciary Committee recommended impeachment based on perjury by the President. The articles of impeachment argued that perjury by the President was an impeachable offense, even if unrelated to his official duties. The minority views disagreed, stating that impeachment should be reserved for conduct that abuses executive powers. The impeachment of President Clinton stemmed from an investigation into financial transactions predating his presidency. During the Whitewater investigation, Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr replaced Fiske and looked into allegations of sexual harassment by President Clinton towards Paula Jones. Monica Lewinsky, an intern, was also involved in the investigation. Counsel Starr received information about Lewinsky trying to influence a witness in the Jones litigation, including recordings of conversations between Lewinsky and Linda Tripp. Attorney General Reno expanded Starr's investigation into President Clinton's response to the Paula Jones case. A grand jury investigated whether Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice. President Clinton's response to the Jones suit and potential obstruction of justice by encouraging others to lie about his relationship with Lewinsky led to a grand jury testimony. Independent Counsel Starr referred his report to the House of Representatives, triggering an impeachment investigation. The House Judiciary Committee released the Starr report and the tape of the President's testimony, without conducting an independent fact-finding investigation or calling live witnesses. The Judiciary Committee relied on the Starr report to recommend impeachment of President Clinton on four counts, including perjury and obstruction of justice. The House approved articles of impeachment against President Clinton for making untruthful responses to Congress. The Senate acquitted him on February 12, 1999, with Senators disagreeing on what constitutes an impeachable offense. Senator Richard G. Lugar highlighted the obstruction of justice in Clinton's case, stating it was not about adultery but about lying to a grand jury and inducing false testimony. Senator Lugar believed President Clinton should be removed from office for betraying the nation's trust. Senator Snowe voted to acquit, citing insufficient evidence of perjury and suggesting criminal prosecution for influencing testimony. Several Senators expressed doubts about the impeachment articles. The Clinton impeachment experience raised debates on what constitutes an impeachable offense, with some Senators not considering the President's behavior as such. Democratic Senator Dorgan voted to acquit, stating Clinton's actions were reprehensible but not a grave danger to the nation. The House declined to impeach Clinton for perjury in a civil suit and untruthful statements to Congress. Some scholars and Senators argued that the Clinton impeachment lacked merit or was driven by partisanship, pointing to the Senate's acquittal of both articles. The failure to convict Clinton may be due to the House Managers' inability to prove their case or political calculations by some Senators. The lessons of the Clinton impeachment will shape future assessments of impeachable conduct by Presidents. In the 1980s, Congress impeached three federal judges after criminal prosecutions. One judge later served in the House of Representatives after impeachment. Another judge's impeachment trial reached the Supreme Court, which ruled it nonjusticiable. Harry E. Claiborne was impeached in 1986 for false tax statements. Judge Claiborne faced impeachment for providing false statements on his tax returns and continued to collect his judicial salary while in prison. The House voted in favor of four articles of impeachment, with the Senate using a committee to gather evidence for the trial. The Senate committee gathered evidence and voted on pretrial motions regarding evidence and discovery in Judge Claiborne's impeachment case. The full Senate later voted to convict him on multiple articles. In a separate case, Judge Alcee L. Hastings was acquitted in a criminal trial but faced impeachment proceedings due to his behavior. The House of Representatives approved seventeen impeachment articles against Judge Hastings, including perjury, bribery, and conspiracy. The Senate convicted and removed Judge Hastings on eight articles but did not disqualify him from holding future office. Judge Hastings was later elected to the House of Representatives. Before Judge Hastings' Senate trial began, the House impeached Judge Walter L. Nixon. Judge Nixon was convicted in a criminal trial. The House impeached Judge Walter L. Nixon for perjury to a grand jury. He was convicted in a criminal trial and imprisoned. The House Judiciary Committee recommended impeachment on three articles, with the Senate convicting him on the first two articles. Judge Nixon challenged the Senate's use of a committee in his impeachment trial, but the Supreme Court rejected his challenge. The Senate \"try\" all impeachments, as ruled in Nixon v. United States. Impeachment proceedings are largely immune from judicial review. Two judges have been impeached in the twenty-first century, following criminal indictments. Judge Samuel B. Kent was impeached for sexual assault and obstruction of justice. Judge Kent resigned before a Senate trial after being accused of obstructing a judicial investigation and making false statements to the FBI. In contrast, Judge Porteous was impeached in 2010 for engaging in corrupt financial relationships and receiving benefits in exchange for helping bail bondsmen. This impeachment did not follow criminal proceedings, unlike previous impeachments of federal judges. Judge Porteous was impeached in 2010 for misconduct during his state and federal judgeships, including making false statements during his nomination to the U.S. District Court. He was convicted on all four articles, removed from office, and barred from future federal positions. The House Managers argued that his past conduct was still impeachable, leading to his conviction. The Senate affirmed the first article 96-0 and the second article 90-6, accusing Judge Porteous of lying during his confirmation hearing. Senators emphasized the importance of integrity and judgment in office, rejecting the argument against impeachment for pre-federal conduct. Senator McCaskill and Senator Leahy supported this stance. Senator Patrick Leahy rejected the idea of impeachment immunity for pre-federal behavior if misconduct was hidden or undiscovered during the confirmation process. The Constitution subjects the President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States to impeachment and removal, with the definition of \"civil Officers\" remaining partly unresolved. Federal judges and Cabinet-level officials are considered \"civil Officers\" subject to impeachment based on constitutional text and historical precedent. The Constitution does not clearly define which lower-level executive branch officials can be impeached and removed by Congress. Historical precedent only shows one example of a lower-level official, Secretary of War William Belknap, being impeached. This lack of clarity contrasts with the impeachment of federal judges and Cabinet-level officials, who are considered \"civil Officers\" under the Constitution. The impeachment power has not been used against lower-level executive officials, so it is unclear how far down the federal bureaucracy it might reach. Impeachment is a tool to remove government officials who abuse their power or engage in misconduct, preserving the separation of powers. The Framers recognized that there may be times when it is not in the President's interest to remove a \"favorite\" from office. The Framers emphasized the need for the impeachment power to remove corrupt or oppressive ministers whom the President might protect. Early constitutional commentators suggest a broad interpretation of \"civil Officers of the United States,\" extending the power to officers whose abuse of authority could harm the separation of powers and good government. Early constitutional commentators suggest a broad interpretation of \"civil Officers of the United States,\" extending the power to officers whose abuse of authority could harm the separation of powers and good government. All officers of the United States, whether in executive or judicial roles, are considered civil officers and liable to impeachment, according to early interpretations. This includes officers from the President downwards, not just Cabinet-level officials. The impeachment power was intended to extend to all executive officers, as indicated by the Constitution. The definition of \"Officers of the United States\" for impeachment purposes can be guided by the Constitution's Appointments Clause, which outlines the nomination and appointment process for various government positions. This clause serves as a useful reference point in determining the definition of \"civil Officers\" eligible for impeachment. The Appointments Clause allows Congress to vest the appointment of inferior officers in the President, courts, or department heads. The Supreme Court distinguishes between officers and employees based on the authority they exercise. Officers are appointees with significant authority, while employees are subordinate functionaries. Principal officers can only be appointed by the President with advice and consent. The Appointments Clause allows Congress to vest the appointment of inferior officers in the President, courts, or department heads. The Supreme Court distinguishes between officers and employees based on the authority they exercise. Principal officers can only be appointed by the President with advice and consent. The Court has not set forth an exclusive criterion for distinguishing between principal and inferior officers, but generally, inferior officers have a relationship with higher-ranking officers and their work is directed and supervised by others appointed with advice and consent. In analyzing whether one may be properly characterized as either an inferior or a principal officer, the Court focuses on the extent of the officer's discretion to make policy choices and the authority of other officials to supervise and remove the officer. Employees, as non-officers, would not be subject to impeachment. Officials who qualify as principal officers, such as heads of agencies, would be impeachable. The impeachment power extends to all officers of the United States, including inferior officers who exercise significant authority under a principal officer. This interpretation allows Congress to impeach and remove executive branch officers, even deputy political appointees and administrative judges. However, historical evidence suggests that inferior officers may not have been impeachable. Historical evidence suggests that inferior officers may not have been meant to be subject to impeachment, as indicated by statements from delegates at the North Carolina ratifying convention and Governeur Morris at the Constitutional Convention. Despite ongoing debate, the authority to clarify the scope of \"civil Officers\" for impeachment purposes initially lies with judges. The Constitution leaves ambiguity in the scope of \"civil Officers\" for impeachment, with the House adopting articles and the Senate trying the officer. Impeachment grounds include \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,\" but the meaning of this phrase is not clearly defined. Some argue only criminal acts are impeachable, but historical practice shows noncriminal activity can also be grounds for impeachment. Impeachment can apply to noncriminal misconduct, as historical practice and congressional materials show. Impeachable offenses are considered to be constitutional wrongs that undermine the integrity of government and public trust. The term \"Misdemeanor\" in this context does not refer to minor criminal offenses but to serious violations of the public trust. Impeachment is not limited to criminal misconduct but also includes noncriminal behavior by public officials that damages the state and governmental operations. Impeachment serves as a remedial tool to maintain constitutional government by removing individuals unfit for office, based on abuse of powers or violation of public trust. Impeached individuals are not immune from criminal liability post-impeachment. Impeachment is not restricted to criminal actions but also encompasses noncriminal behavior that violates the public trust. Past impeachments have involved misconduct such as intoxication on the bench, abuse of judicial power for personal gain, and actions that bring the court into disrepute. This demonstrates that impeachment can be based on conduct that is not necessarily criminal but still damages the state and governmental operations. Some judges were impeached for misusing their position for personal gain. The Constitution allows for impeachment of federal judges for \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,\" as well as for failing to exhibit good behavior. The modern view of Congress is that the phrase \"good behavior\" simply designates the tenure of federal judges. The modern view of Congress is that the phrase \"good behavior\" designates judicial tenure, indicating federal judges hold office for life unless removed through proper constitutional means. Impeachment grounds for judges do not include the \"good behavior\" clause, as affirmed by the House Judiciary Committee's discussions in 1973 and 1974. The House Report on the Impeachment of President Clinton affirmed that impeachable conduct for judges mirrors that of other civil officers in the government, using the \"treason, bribery, and high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" clause as the standard. While the \"good behavior\" clause does not delineate a standard for impeachment of federal judges, one might argue that the range of impeachable conduct differs between judges and executive branch officials due to the nature of each office. The impeachment and acquittal of President Clinton highlighted the uncertainty surrounding what constitutes impeachable conduct for nonjudicial officers. The House impeached Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice, arguing that even conduct outside official duties could be impeachable. This raises questions about whether conduct meriting impeachment for a judge would also apply to nonjudicial officers. The report rejected the idea that certain misconduct, like perjury, is only impeachable for judges. It cited cases of judges impeached for dishonesty and argued that perjury by the President is equally damaging to the government. The report emphasized that both Judge Claiborne and Judge Nixon were impeached for perjury unrelated to their official duties, similar to President Clinton's case. The minority views from the report opposing impeachment argued that not all impeachable offenses are crimes and not all crimes are impeachable offenses. They stated that impeachment is reserved for conduct that constitutes an egregious abuse or subversion of the powers of the executive office, citing examples from past impeachments. The Judiciary Committee rejected an article of impeachment against President Nixon alleging tax fraud, as it related to his private conduct, not his official duties. The minority argued that not all impeachable offenses are crimes and not all crimes are impeachable offenses. They suggested that impeachment should be for conduct that constitutes a severe abuse of executive powers. The Judiciary Committee rejected an article of impeachment against President Nixon for tax fraud related to his private conduct. The Senate acquitted President Clinton on two charges of impeachment, but the motivations for the votes varied. The acquittal of President Clinton on two charges of impeachment had varied motivations among Senators. Some believed the House Managers failed to prove their case, others disagreed on the impeachability of the behavior, and some may have voted based on political calculations. Congress has discretion in determining what constitutes \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" for impeachment of civil officers. The Constitution looks to various sources to define bribery, including the federal criminal code and the understanding of bribery at the nation's Founding. Bribery was a common law crime at the time of the Constitutional Convention, involving corruptly seeking or receiving bribes for official acts. The scope of bribery has expanded to include giving and receiving bribes, as well as attempted bribery in certain situations. At the time of the Founding, bribery was understood to be an impeachable offense in England, extending to executive officers. Gouverneur Morris mentioned the risk of presidential bribery at the Constitutional Convention. The First Congress passed a federal bribery statute for customs officers. Congress enacted a federal bribery statute for customs officers, imposing fines and office disqualification for convicted officers and fines for bribe payers. Another bribery statute applied to anyone giving bribes to judges, with additional officers included in 1853. States also had laws prohibiting bribery and extortion by state officers and judges. Several impeachments in the United States have involved charges of bribery, with specific articles framed as \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" or an \"impeachable offense.\" For example, Judge Hastings was convicted for participating in a \"corrupt conspiracy to obtain $150,000 from defendants in return for lighter sentences,\" described as a \"bribery conspiracy\" or \"bribery scheme.\" Similarly, Judge Porteous was charged with \"solicit[ing] and accept[ing] things of value.\" The impeachment against Judge Porteous charged him with soliciting and accepting things of value without disclosure and ruling in favor of those clients. The second charge involved soliciting and accepting things of value for personal benefit while taking official actions that benefited a bail bondman and his sister. The Judiciary Committee report alleged that Judge Porteous had participated in a bribery scheme, although bribery was not explicitly mentioned in the articles. The Framers did not provide a formal definition of bribery in the Constitution. The Framers did not define bribery in the Constitution for impeachment purposes. Impeachments in the US often encompass bribery under \"other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" Judge Archbald was impeached in 1912 for conduct before assuming office and convicted by the Senate in 1913. Judge Archbald was impeached and tried by the Senate in the 62nd Congress for misconduct in his positions as a U.S. Circuit Judge and a designated judge of the U.S. Commerce Court. He was convicted on four articles related to his current positions and one article for misuse of office in his previous position as a U.S. District Judge. This behavior occurred before he assumed his current positions. Judge Porteous was impeached and convicted for misconduct that occurred before he began his federal office tenure. He was found guilty on four articles, including making false statements during his nomination process. This is in contrast to past impeachments of federal officials, where misconduct typically occurred during their time in office. Federal officials who have resigned amid impeachment investigations may still face impeachment and a ban on holding future office. Resignation often ends impeachment proceedings, as seen in cases like Secretary of War William W. Belknap and President Richard Nixon. The degree of certainty required to prove allegations varies in the judicial system. In the judicial system, the burden of proof varies depending on the type of proceeding. In criminal trials, the prosecutor must prove each element \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" while in civil litigation, the plaintiff's burden is a \"preponderance of the evidence.\" Other standards include \"probable cause\" for federal grand juries and \"clear and convincing evidence\" in some cases. The Constitution does not establish a clear standard of proof for impeachment. Both the House and Senate have not set a specific standard, allowing members to use any standard they wish when deciding how to vote. Historical practice suggests that members only need to be convinced to their own satisfaction when deciding on impeachment and removal. It may be difficult to enforce a governing standard of proof even if one were established. The standard of proof for impeachment is often compared to a grand jury's decision to indict, with the House needing to determine if there is enough evidence to charge an official with an impeachable offense. This standard is argued to be similar to that of an investigating grand jury, such as \"probable cause\" or preponderance of the evidence. The Judiciary Committee's consideration of Judge Charles Swayne's impeachment in 1904 focused on the standard of proof needed for impeachment. Representative Powers argued that the House's role is to determine if there is enough probable cause for the case to be tried before the Senate. The gravity of the impeachment process, especially in presidential impeachments, was emphasized, with the impact on the entire executive branch being a key concern. In the context of impeachment proceedings, the President's counsel argued for a high standard of proof, stating that lower standards are not sufficient for impeachment trials. The House Judiciary Committee's report on President Nixon's impeachment showed a historical reluctance to impose a formal burden of proof on Members. The dissenting Members believed that the standard of proof in House impeachments should be no less than clear and convincing evidence. The minority in the House impeachment proceedings believed that the standard of proof should be no less than \"clear and convincing evidence,\" but they did not advocate for a fixed rule on this. Senators are not bound by a specific burden of proof in impeachment trials, with differing opinions on the standard to be applied. The Constitution's language suggests a criminal-like standard, but there is no set rule on this. The Senate's approach in impeachment trials is debated, with some arguing for a criminal-like standard of proof, while others believe it is not necessary. The Constitution does not specify a burden of proof for Senators, allowing for individualized decisions on the standard needed for conviction. During Judge Claiborne's impeachment trial, there was a debate over the standard of proof to be applied, with the House Managers arguing against setting a specific standard. The Presiding Officer ultimately decided that each Senator could use their own judgment on the standard of proof. This approach was reaffirmed during Judge Porteous's trial, where the Senate declined to establish an obligatory standard, allowing each Senator to use their own standard of proof. The Senate impeachment trial allows Senators to use their own standard of proof, guided by their conscience and oath to do \"impartial justice.\" Evidentiary questions are handled based on Senate precedent, with objections ruled on by the Presiding Officer and settled by a majority vote. The Senate Impeachment Rules provide a procedural framework for handling evidentiary issues. The Senate Impeachment Rules provide a procedural framework for handling evidentiary issues, allowing objections to be made by parties or their counsel and ruled on by the Presiding Officer. The rules give basic guidance on standards for evidentiary decisions, including relevancy, materiality, and redundancy of evidence. The Senate reserves the right to determine competency, relevancy, and materiality. The Senate Impeachment Rules provide guidance on evidentiary decisions, including relevancy and materiality. Senate precedent plays a significant role in determining evidentiary standards, with limited debate on submitted questions. Parties often use judicial evidentiary standards, like the Federal Rules of Evidence, in Senate trials. The Senate is not bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence in impeachment trials, as each Senator must weigh all relevant evidence independently. Chief Justice Rehnquist ruled that Senators are not jurors but a court during impeachment trials. Judicial principles may guide the Senate, but the body is not strictly bound by them. The Senate, acting as a court during impeachment trials, determines the admissibility of evidence based on Senate precedents rather than court decisions. Impeachment proceedings do not fit traditional judicial molds and have a unique combination of judicial and legislative characteristics. The process has historically required a distinct approach to procedural and evidentiary questions. The Supreme Court has ruled that challenges to Senate impeachment proceedings are nonjusticiable political questions. In Nixon v. United States, Judge Walter L. Nixon was impeached by the House of Representatives and convicted by the Senate using Impeachment Rule XI. The Supreme Court ruled that challenges to Senate impeachment proceedings are nonjusticiable political questions. In Nixon v. United States, the Senate had the sole authority to try impeachments, and the word \"try\" lacked a judicially manageable standard of review. This grant of sole authority meant that the Senate alone could determine whether an individual should be acquitted or convicted, serving as the only check on the Judicial Branch by the Legislature. The Supreme Court ruled that challenges to Senate impeachment proceedings are nonjusticiable political questions. The final reviewing authority for impeachments is in the hands of the Senate, creating political uncertainty if judicial review were allowed. The Court distinguished this from Powell v. McCormack, where the judiciary reviewed a congressional decision on a Member-elect's qualifications. The Supreme Court ruled that the House's claim of unreviewable authority to determine the qualifications of its Members was defeated by the specific requirements outlined in Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution. This was in contrast to the nonjusticiable political questions surrounding Senate impeachment proceedings, where the final authority lies with the Senate. The Supreme Court ruled that the House's authority to determine its Members' qualifications was not unreviewable, as outlined in Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution. In contrast, the Senate's interpretation of the word \"try\" in impeachment proceedings was deemed acceptable. Additionally, challenges to the impeachment process, such as a case involving Judge G. Thomas Porteous, have been raised. Impeachment proceedings were initiated against Judge Porteous for alleged corruption. He argued that using his immunized testimony in the impeachment violated his Fifth Amendment rights, but the court rejected his challenge citing the Speech or Debate Clause. Judge Alcee L. Hastings also tried to prevent the House Judiciary Committee from accessing grand jury records. Judge Alcee L. Hastings attempted to block the House Judiciary Committee from obtaining grand jury records for an impeachment investigation, arguing that it violated the separation of powers. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected this argument, stating that secrecy in grand jury materials must give way to a specific need in an impeachment investigation. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia initially threw out Judge Hastings's Senate impeachment conviction due to procedural errors. The court later dismissed the case as a nonjusticiable political question, highlighting the Americanized impeachment remedy crafted by the Framers of the Constitution to hold government officers accountable for political offenses. Impeachment is generally immune from judicial review, allowing Congress substantial authority in pursuing misconduct by public officials. Impeachment is generally immune from judicial review, giving Congress significant discretion in structuring proceedings. The Constitution does not specify what constitutes \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors,\" as the range of possible offenses by government officials is vast. Impeachment historically targets abuses of power, corruption, and misconduct incompatible with one's office, rather than political or policy disagreements."
