    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Building Code Incentive Act of 2012\". Congress recognizes the importance of mitigation planning in saving lives, protecting properties, and developing disaster-resistant communities. Recent studies show that State building codes significantly reduce property damage and personal injury during disasters. Modern building codes ensure the protection of residential and commercial structures from natural disasters, providing assurance to the people of the United States. Active enforcement of building codes based on nationally recognized models reduces the need for public disaster aid, promotes sustainable communities, and contributes to the durability of structures. FEMA provides Federal assistance to States for mitigation efforts under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Federal mitigation assistance aims to encourage States to adopt a comprehensive approach to disaster loss reduction, including the active enforcement of State building codes as a key strategy. The purpose of federal mitigation assistance is to encourage states to adopt a comprehensive approach to disaster loss reduction, including enforcing state building codes. The Act aims to reduce property loss, improve property quality, and minimize damage by incentivizing the adoption and enforcement of State building codes. It also encourages States to coordinate hazard evaluation and mitigation activities and require the use of current nationally applicable model building codes. The Act promotes the use of current nationally applicable model building codes for State-sponsored mitigation projects. The Act promotes the use of current nationally applicable model building codes for State-sponsored mitigation projects. Additionally, there is additional mitigation assistance provided. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act is amended to allow for additional mitigation assistance if a State enforces a building code meeting certain conditions. The President can increase contributions by 4% for disasters where the State has an approved building code in place. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act can provide increased federal share for states with approved building codes meeting specific conditions. The President can approve additional assistance if the state certifies its building code within 6 years of the latest model code and uses it as a minimum standard, submitted within 90 days of a declared disaster. The President, through the Administrator, will establish standards for periodic updates of State building codes approved in accordance with mitigation planning requirements. Definitions include \"actively enforcing\" as the effective execution of State building codes during construction approval and inspection. The term 'nationally recognized model building code' refers to a building code developed by a code organization with input from national experts, based on national structural design standards for residential and commercial construction to ensure safety and health. The State building code sets requirements and standards for residential and commercial construction statewide to ensure the safety of building users against natural disasters. The President will issue regulations within 180 days to oversee construction activities related to structural safety of commercial, industrial, and multifamily structures. This applies to major disasters declared on or after October 24, 2012. Major disasters declared between October 24, 2012, and the date of enactment of this Act must submit certification within 90 days."
