    "content": "Legislation in the 110th Congress proposed amendments to federal capital punishment laws, including changes to the Constitution. The United States Constitution does not explicitly mention the death penalty but prohibits cruel and unusual punishments. The punishment clause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes the death penalty for child rape without intent to kill. Proposed amendments aimed to allow death penalty for child rape cases under sixteen years old. The Broun proposal aimed to remove Eighth Amendment impediments to capital punishment in child rape cases. H.J.Res. 80 sought to abolish capital punishment for state and federal crimes, extending to pending and future cases. Existing federal law treats capital cases differently, with no statute of limitations and a preference for trials in the county of occurrence. Defendants in capital cases are entitled to two attorneys, one of whom must be knowledgeable in capital case law. The Attorney General must approve the decision to seek the death penalty. Defendants in capital cases are entitled to notice and a copy of the indictment before trial. They have more peremptory jury challenges than in other felony cases. The sentencing procedures for federal capital offenses are divided into three categories: espionage and treason, homicide offenses, and drug offenses. The decision to seek the death penalty must be approved by the Attorney General. The sentencing procedures for federal capital offenses are divided into three categories: espionage and treason, homicide offenses, and drug offenses. In homicide cases, the sentencing hearing involves determining intent and weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances for the death penalty. Mitigating factors apply to all categories, including impaired capacity, minor participation, no prior criminal record, and victim consent. Each category also has its own list of statutory aggravating factors. The three categories of federal capital offenses have their own list of statutory aggravating factors. The designated aggravating factors for espionage and treason include prior convictions, grave risk to national security, and grave risk of death. Homicide aggravating factors include murder during the course of other federal offenses. Drug aggravating factors focus on prior convictions, risk to children, use of firearms, and lethal adulteration. The jury must unanimously agree on an established aggravating factor before imposing the death penalty. The death penalty can only be imposed if the jury unanimously finds that aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors. Proposals during the 110th Congress aimed to modify laws related to capital offenses trials, appointment of counsel, pre-trial notifications, mental retardation claims, aggravating and mitigating circumstances, jury matters, and federal execution sites. The Constitution mandates trials for crimes to be held in the state where they occurred, with provisions for capital cases to be tried in the county of occurrence. Murder and manslaughter cases are to be tried where the death-inflicting injury occurs, regardless of where the victim dies. The Constitution mandates trials for crimes to be held in the state where they occurred, with provisions for capital cases to be tried in the county of occurrence. H.R. 3156 and S. 1860 proposed changes to venue laws for capital cases, removing the requirement to trial them in the county where they occur. The proposed amendment aimed to repeal certain features of the venue laws for capital cases, allowing trials where commerce-related conduct occurred. Constitutional constraints would impact the scope of the amendment, ensuring trials are held in the state where the crime occurred. The Supreme Court rulings in United States v. Cabrales and United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno addressed the issue of venue in criminal cases. Cabrales clarified that money laundering must be tried where the funds were generated, while Rodriguez-Moreno allowed for trials based on where the crime occurred, even if the weapon was acquired elsewhere. These cases show a balance between restrictive and permissive venue rules. Rodriguez-Moreno and his associates kidnapped a drug trafficking associate and transported him from Texas to New Jersey and then to Maryland. He acquired a firearm in Maryland and was tried in New Jersey for using it during the kidnapping. The Supreme Court ruled that venue for a crime with distinct conduct elements can be wherever any of those elements occurred, allowing for proper venue in Texas, New Jersey, or Maryland. The Court ruled that venue for a crime with distinct conduct elements can be in Texas, New Jersey, or Maryland. The case distinguished between Cabrales and Rodriguez-Moreno, stating that the underlying crime is critical for venue determination. Lower courts have interpreted this to require trial where at least one element occurs. The proposed venue amendment's outcome in light of these cases remains uncertain. The proposed venue amendment would allow trial in a district where related conduct affecting interstate or foreign commerce occurred, even if the offense itself was committed in another district. This could impact cases like Cabrales' drug trafficking in Missouri and money laundering in Florida. However, the outcome remains uncertain. The proposal for venue amendment in federal capital offenses aims to allow trial in a district where related conduct affecting interstate commerce occurred, even if the offense itself was committed in another district. However, the proposal may not always meet the \"conduct element\" standard set by Rodriguez-Moreno. The alternative wording of the proposal suggests that affecting commerce may not be an element of the offense. This could raise constitutional concerns. The proposed federal crime would prohibit committing a crime of violence in relation to a drug trafficking offense, with prosecution allowed in any district where the offenses occurred. This mirrors the structure of U.S.C. 924(c)(1) and the Rodriguez-Moreno case involving a continuing offense. Rodriguez-Moreno was involved in a drug trafficking offense, which may be considered a continuing offense for venue purposes. Several bills proposed adding an explicit venue provision for federal capital offenses related to crimes of violence in aid of racketeering. The Second Circuit has held that prosecution for a RICO violation can occur where the crime of violence or racketeering activity occurs. The Second Circuit has ruled that venue for trial of a section 1959 offense is proper wherever an element of a RICO violation occurs. Capital defendants are entitled to two attorneys for their defense, with uncertainty on when they should be appointed. The Justice Department is concerned about the Fourth Circuit's ruling that the right to appoint counsel does not expire with the government's decision not to seek the death penalty. H.R. 851 aims to address inefficiencies in cases where the death penalty is not sought but a second attorney must be retained until a formal decision is made. Critics argue that early appointment of counsel expert in capital cases benefits both the defendant and the government. Section 3593 requires prosecutors to notify the defendant and court of their intent to seek the death penalty before trial or plea acceptance. Failure to provide timely notice may impact a prosecutor's ability to seek the death penalty, as seen in rulings by the Fourth and Eleventh Circuits. The government's death notice must be filed in a timely manner to seek the death penalty. Prosecutors may provide a \"protective death notice\" to keep the option open, which can be withdrawn if the Attorney General decides against seeking the death penalty. The Justice Department does not prefer this arrangement. The Justice Department does not prefer seeking the death penalty, but there are arguments for expediting prosecutorial determinations in capital cases. Proposed bills would allow for continuances in case of delayed notification of intent to seek the death penalty and prevent defendants from pleading guilty before prosecutors can seek approval for the death penalty. These bills aim to balance the prosecution's obligation to disclose aggravating factors. The proposed bills aim to balance the prosecution's obligation to disclose aggravating factors with the defense's obligation to notify the prosecution of mitigating factors when seeking the death penalty. Section 3592(a) allows evidence of mental retardation as a mitigating factor. The Court in Atkins cites clinical definitions of mental retardation, requiring subaverage intellectual functioning and significant limitations in adaptive skills before age 18. Legislation proposed by Representative Gohmert, Representative Lamar Smith, and Senator Cornyn addresses the issue of mental retardation in federal capital cases. Legislation proposed by Representative Gohmert, Representative Lamar Smith, and Senator Cornyn aimed to make procedural adjustments for claims of mental retardation in federal capital cases. This included establishing a pre-trial notification requirement for both prosecution and defense regarding aggravating and mitigating factors, allowing for independent mental health examinations, and providing the prosecution with the right to a continuance if needed. The proposed legislation for federal capital cases includes procedural adjustments for claims of mental retardation, such as pre-trial notification requirements, burden of proof on the defendant, and sentencing guidelines for mentally retarded defendants. The Justice Department endorsed legislative proposals in the 109th Congress for a statutory definition of mental retardation in federal capital cases, requiring an IQ of 70 or less, onset before 18 years old, and continuous impairment of mental functions. Some objections include concerns about the narrowness of the definition, the timing of resolving mental retardation issues, and the lack of mirroring the prosecution's right to a mental health examination in insanity defense claims. Furman v. Georgia condemned state and federal capital punishment procedures for not reserving the death penalty for the most serious cases. Adjustments have been made to provide juries with factors to guide their discretion. Proposed bills suggested changes to aggravating and mitigating circumstances in federal law, such as limiting the mitigating factor for codefendants not facing the death penalty. The proposed amendment aims to limit the mitigating factor for codefendants not facing the death penalty, potentially impacting the catch-all provision for mitigating circumstances in capital cases. The proposal aims to add an aggravating factor to the espionage and treason category, allowing for the death penalty even without prior convictions or grave risks. However, it is uncertain if the death penalty can be imposed for crimes not involving loss of life, raising constitutional concerns. Most federal capital punishment statutes outlaw murder under specific circumstances, such as the murder of a Member of Congress or murder in conjunction with rape. Section 3592(c)(1) recognizes murder during certain federal crimes as an aggravating factor. Proposed bills aim to add offenses like conspiracy against civil rights and witness tampering to the list of designated federal crimes. The rationale for expanding federal capital punishment statutes includes adding new crimes like witness tampering and retaliating against a witness as aggravating factors. Supporters argue that capital punishment should be reserved for the \"worst of the worst\" offenders. Opponents believe that specific designation of aggravating factors is less significant due to the catch-all provision allowing presentation to the jury regardless. The expansion of federal capital punishment statutes includes adding new aggravating factors like witness tampering and retaliating against a witness. Critics argue that the list of aggravating factors is becoming too broad, potentially making all murders capital offenses. Proposed legislation aims to address obstruction of justice in the judicial process by making it a capital offense. The use of aggravating factors in federal capital punishment statutes has expanded, including factors such as previous firearm offenses. Section 924(c) outlines penalties for using a firearm during a federal crime, with murder resulting in a capital offense. There are proposals to clarify the interpretation of these factors. One of the bills, H.R. 851 (Representative Gohmert), would have amended section 3592(c)(2) to clarify that it did not cover the conviction resulting in the capital sentencing hearing, but only prior firearms convictions. Critics argue this could make possession of a firearm during any federal crime an aggravating factor. Section 3592(c)(8) covers murder-for-hire as an aggravating factor. The factor of murder-for-hire as an aggravating factor in capital sentencing covers murders motivated by monetary gain, not incidental gain. Proposed amendments aimed to address uneven application by including murders committed to retain illegal possessions. Proposed amendments aim to expand aggravating factors in capital sentencing to include murders committed in expectation of pecuniary gain or to retain illegal possession of valuable items. H.R. 851, H.R. 3156, and S. 1860 are among the bills addressing this issue, with concerns raised about the broadening scope of capital punishment for murders not considered the \"worst of the worst.\" H.R. 3153 also sought to include the murder of law enforcement officers as an aggravating factor in sentencing. The proposed amendments aim to expand aggravating factors in capital sentencing to include murders committed in expectation of pecuniary gain or to retain illegal possession of valuable items. H.R. 851, H.R. 3156, and S. 1860 address this issue, with concerns about broadening the scope of capital punishment for murders not considered the \"worst of the worst.\" H.R. 3153 also sought to include the murder of law enforcement officers as an aggravating factor in sentencing. The Supreme Court upheld a state court instruction in California v. Brown, emphasizing that a capital jury must not be swayed by sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion, or public feeling. Several proposals in the 110th Congress aim to eliminate the option of sentencing for a term of years in capital cases, even if aggravating factors are present. Existing law allows for a sentence other than death if no aggravating factors are found, and for life imprisonment without parole if the death penalty is not imposed despite aggravating factors. Additionally, there are concerns about expanding aggravating factors in capital sentencing to include murders committed for financial gain or to retain illegal possessions. The proposed bills, H.R. 851 and H.R. 1914, seek to amend the provision regarding the number of jurors in capital cases. They would allow the court to approve a lesser number of jurors for good cause without requiring the approval of the defendant or prosecutor. This change could lead to criticism if the death penalty is imposed based on the recommendation of a jury with less than twelve members. The bills also aim to increase the number of permissible alternate jurors from six to nine and provide each side with four additional peremptory challenges. H.R. 851 (Gohmert) and other proposed bills aim to amend the number of jurors and alternates in capital cases. They would allow for up to nine alternates and provide additional peremptory challenges. The bills also address the issue of retaining alternates until sentencing is completed. Existing proposed bills such as H.R. 851, H.R. 3156, and S. 1860 aim to authorize federal executions in federal facilities with regulations by the Attorney General. They also include a confidentiality clause for executors and witnesses. Additionally, S. 607 addresses interference with federal disaster relief efforts, with potential death penalty or life imprisonment for offenders. H.R. 3806 focuses on making sabotage against nuclear facilities a punishable offense. H.R. 3806 proposed making sabotage at a nuclear facility a capital offense if it resulted in death. H.R. 3884 aimed to make it a federal offense to murder a member of the armed forces regardless of the circumstances. Bills like H.R. 3150 and H.R. 880 included new federal death penalty offenses related to gang violence. The proposed legislation included making crimes of violence committed during drug trafficking offenses punishable by death if a death resulted. Other bills also introduced capital offenses for multiple murders and violent crimes in aid of criminal street gangs. Additionally, existing laws already address overseas murders and assaults by terrorists against Americans. Several proposed bills aim to expand existing laws to include overseas kidnapping of Americans by terrorists and propose the death penalty as a sentencing option when a death results. Additionally, some immigration bills seek to punish evasion of border inspection with death, imprisonment, or life in prison if death results. Rather than amending existing non-capital federal terrorist offenses, other bills would create new capital offenses for certain crimes. The proposed bills, including H.R. 3156 and S. 1860, aimed to create a new federal offense for terrorist acts resulting in death, punishable by death or life imprisonment. This would include offenses such as arson, biological weapons, congressional murder, nuclear materials, and others. The impact of these bills may not be as significant as initially thought, as many predicate offenses are already capital crimes or would be elevated to capital offenses elsewhere in the legislation. The curr_chunk lists various federal offenses related to terrorism, including conspiracy to murder, destruction of government property, financing of terrorism, and providing material support to terrorist organizations. The curr_chunk lists federal offenses related to terrorism, including financing of terrorism, military-type training, torture, narco-terrorism, and sabotage of nuclear facilities. It also includes offenses such as assault on a flight crew, destruction of interstate gas pipelines, and harboring terrorists. The proposed bills aim to establish the death penalty as a sentencing option for certain federal offenses related to terrorism, including participation in programs involving weapons of mass destruction, anti-aircraft missile offenses, atomic weapons offenses, radiological dispersal device offenses, and variola virus offenses. Additionally, the bills would rewrite the federal criminal gang statute to allow for capital punishment for various crimes of violence, money laundering, drug offenses, credit card fraud, and other offenses. The proposed bills aim to establish the death penalty as a sentencing option for certain federal offenses related to terrorism, including participation in programs involving weapons of mass destruction. H.R. 880, H.R. 3150, H.R. 3156, and S. 1860 all had similar proposals, including outlawing interstate travel to commit crimes of violence. H.R. 3156 and S. 1850 would have allowed the death penalty in cases resulting in death, while S. 447 and H.R. 6875 aimed to eliminate the death penalty for federal and military capital offenses. The proposed bill aimed to eliminate the death penalty for federal and military capital offenses, replacing it with life imprisonment without the possibility of release. It also included amendments to various statutes related to the trial and prosecution of capital offenses. The proposed bill aimed to eliminate the death penalty for federal and military capital offenses, replacing it with life imprisonment without the possibility of release. Federal sexual offenses and crimes against children could be prosecuted at any time under certain statutes, with exceptions for specific crimes. The bill listed federal crimes punishable by death that could be prosecuted at any time, even after the elimination of the death penalty. The curr_chunk lists federal crimes punishable by death, including murder of federal officials, family members, and witnesses, as well as kidnapping resulting in death and murder by escaped federal prisoners. The curr_chunk lists federal crimes punishable by death, including murder of federal officials, family members, witnesses, and inspectors during official duties. It also includes crimes committed by drug kingpins and the requirement to notify the government of an insanity defense. The defendant must notify the court and file a notice if they intend to rely on an insanity defense or introduce expert evidence of a mental condition. The court may allow late notice for good cause and grant additional trial-preparation time. The court may order the defendant to undergo a competency examination. Results of any examination conducted must be sealed and not disclosed unless the defendant is found guilty of capital crimes and intends to offer expert evidence on mental health during sentencing. The defendant must disclose results and reports of any mental condition examination conducted by their expert for sentencing proceedings. No statements made during the examination can be used against the defendant in a criminal proceeding, except on issues related to mental condition. The defendant must comply with disclosure requirements for expert evidence on mental condition in capital sentencing proceedings. Failure to give notice or submit to examination may result in exclusion of such evidence. Evidence of withdrawn intention after notice is inadmissible. In capital sentencing proceedings, failure to comply with disclosure requirements for expert evidence on mental condition may result in exclusion of evidence. Evidence of withdrawn intention after notice is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding. Various federal crimes punishable by death are listed under different U.S.C. codes. Various federal crimes punishable by death are listed under different U.S.C. codes, including murder of federal officers, conspiracy against civil rights, deprivation of civil rights, obstruction of religious beliefs, killing a Member of Congress, espionage, and bombing federal property.
