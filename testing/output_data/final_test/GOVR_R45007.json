    "content": "The U.S. Department of Labor updated the overtime exemptions for EAP employees on May 23, 2016, with an effective date of December 1, 2016. A preliminary injunction was issued on November 22, 2016, blocking the rule's implementation. The District Court ruled that DOL lacked the authority to use a salary level test for EAP exemptions. The Department of Justice appealed the injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on December 1, 2016. On June 30, 2017, DOJ requested the Court of Appeals to reverse the district court's judgment on DOL's legal authority regarding salary levels. The U.S. District Court ruled that the Department of Labor exceeded its authority by setting the salary level in the 2016 rule for EAP exemptions, invalidating the rule. The Department of Justice dropped its appeal, and the DOL issued a request for information on revising the EAP exemptions under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted in 1938 to establish labor protections, recordkeeping requirements, and create the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) within the Department of Labor (DOL) to enforce the act. It aims to correct detrimental labor conditions by setting federal minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor protections. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets standards for minimum wages, overtime pay, and child labor protections. It covers most workers under \"enterprise coverage\" or \"individual coverage,\" with around 132 million workers currently protected. However, the FLSA does not regulate practices like paid time off, premium pay for weekend work, or fringe benefits, and does not limit the number of hours an employee may work. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not limit the number of hours an employee may work in a day or week but requires premium pay for overtime hours. Covered nonexempt employees must receive one-and-a-half times the regular rate for hours worked over 40 in a workweek, unless exempted. Certain employers and employees are exempt from FLSA regulations. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) provides exemptions for EAP employees, retail store employees without interstate operations, and agricultural employees. Initially, the FLSA did not cover sectors like farm labor, retail trade, and public service, but now it covers over 80% of the labor force. At enactment in 1938, it covered about 11 million employees, mainly in manufacturing, transportation, and mineral industries. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) initially covered 11 million employees in manufacturing, transportation, or mineral industries. Amendments in 1961 and 1966 expanded coverage to most employees. Data shows a shift towards more service occupations, particularly \"white-collar\" jobs, with an increase in professional and technical occupations from less than 5% in 1910 to nearly 25% by 2000. Analysis of 11 major occupation groups shows that five increased as a share of the total, while six declined. The declining groups are concentrated in industries like agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, while the increasing groups are white-collar occupations with higher education requirements. White-collar occupations went from 24% to 75% of the total. The composition of the workforce has significantly changed over the 90-year period from 1910 to 2000. White-collar occupations increased from 24% to 75% of total employment, while blue-collar occupations declined. This shift has implications for the EAP exemptions under the FLSA, which were designed to cover a minority of the workforce but are now more relevant due to the increase in white-collar occupations. The FLSA exempts certain employees from minimum wage and overtime provisions based on their executive, administrative, or professional capacity. The Secretary of Labor is authorized to define these terms through regulations. The legislative history of these exemptions does not provide much clarity on their scope. The EAP exemptions in the FLSA were included due to the unique nature of work performed by EAP employees and their perceived compensation advantages, such as above-average benefits and job security. This was seen as a tradeoff for being exempt from overtime protections. The EAP exemptions in the FLSA were included due to the unique nature of work performed by EAP employees and their perceived compensation advantages. The term \"bona fide\" was added to distinguish these exemptions from general white-collar exemptions. The Secretary of Labor has discretion to define and delimit the exemptions for executive, administrative, and professional employees. The FLSA includes exemptions for certain types of employees, such as those in agriculture or working for small newspapers. The language of the FLSA gives the Department of Labor broad authority to define these exemptions. The FLSA grants the Department of Labor explicit authority to define exemptions for certain types of employees, such as those in agriculture or small newspapers. This authority is notable for its specificity compared to other exemptions outlined in the FLSA. The FLSA grants the Department of Labor authority to define exemptions for specific types of employees, such as those in agriculture or small newspapers. The Section 13(a)(1) exemptions require a qualifying condition for certain executive, administrative, and professional employees to be exempt from minimum wage and overtime provisions. DOL has broad discretion in regulating these exemptions, as seen in the 1940 rulemaking hearings. The lack of statutory specificity for exemptions under Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA has given the Department of Labor discretionary power to determine eligibility and set parameters. This has resulted in varying methodologies and changing thresholds for almost 80 years. Despite multiple amendments to the FLSA, the language creating exemptions remains largely unchanged, with operational EAP exemptions being subject to administration priorities. Rulemaking decisions have evolved over time. The criteria for exemption under Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA include a fixed salary, specific job duties, and meeting a salary threshold. These tests have evolved through rulemaking since 1938, with the salary basis test remaining constant while the duties and salary level tests have changed. These tests serve as screens for exemption. The evolution of the duties and salary level tests for exemption under Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA is discussed. The importance of maintaining duties-based criteria for exemption is highlighted, emphasizing the need for a salary commensurate with the duties performed rather than relying solely on job titles. The evolution of duties tests for EAP exemptions has occurred in three phases: Long Tests (1938-1949), with regulations defining required duties for exemption for \"executive and administrative\" and \"professional\" categories. The 1940 rule split the first category into \"executive\" and \"administrative,\" establishing the three distinct exempt EAP categories still in use today. These rules set out tests describing duties employees must perform for EAP exemption from overtime. The evolution of duties tests for EAP exemptions has occurred in three phases: Long Tests (1938-1949) established required duties for exemption for \"executive and administrative\" and \"professional\" categories. The 1949 rule introduced the \"long\" and \"short\" tests, with corresponding salary levels, to form exemption tests. The long tests had lower salary thresholds and limited nonexempt work time to 20% in a workweek for EAP-exempt employees. The 1949 rule introduced the \"long\" and \"short\" tests for EAP exemptions, with a focus on primary duties rather than time spent on activities. The 2004 rule eliminated these tests and established standard tests for EAP exemptions. The 2004 rule replaced the long and short tests for EAP exemption with a single \"standard\" duties test and salary level. The 2016 rule maintains the standard duties test for EAP exemption, which does not have a time limit on nonexempt work by exempt employees. The Department of Labor has required a certain salary level for EAP exemption since the enactment of the FLSA in 1938. The Department of Labor has frequently emphasized the importance of salary as a key factor in determining exempt status for EAP employees. The salary level threshold for exemption has been adjusted eight times since the enactment of the FLSA in 1938, with the most recent increase occurring in 2016. This threshold reflects the priorities and methods of the administrations regulating the exemptions. The Department of Labor has adjusted the salary level threshold for exempt EAP employees eight times since 1938, with the latest increase in 2016. The adjustments have been made intermittently, with periods between changes ranging from 2 to 29 years. The rules created a two-test system of exemption, with a long duties test accompanied by a lower salary threshold and a short test accompanied by a higher salary threshold. The EAP salary level thresholds for the long test were determined first, and the short test salary level was typically set as a percentage of the long test salary levels. The Department of Labor has adjusted the salary level threshold for exempt EAP employees eight times since 1938, with the latest increase in 2016. The rules created a two-test system of exemption, with a long duties test accompanied by a lower salary threshold and a short test accompanied by a higher salary threshold. The 2016 rule maintains the standard duties test and single salary level, with methodologies categorized into three periods based on approaches used to define and delimit the EAP exemptions. Path dependence is a significant factor in the evolution of EAP exemptions, with administrations incorporating methodologies from previous rules. The key question for the Department of Labor has always been how to differentiate between exempt and nonexempt employees. The tests for exemption can be adjusted to broaden or narrow the scope, with examples of broad and narrow exemptions provided. The salary level test has been crucial in determining the scope of EAP exemptions, with a broad exemption leading to fewer employees qualifying for overtime pay compared to a narrow exemption. The 2016 final rule highlighted the importance of the salary threshold in this differentiation, noting a common methodology used in setting the threshold. The administration's policy choices drive variations in setting salary level thresholds for EAP exemptions. Proposals to update thresholds for inflation lock in prior methodological and data choices. Early rules used multiple data sources to amend salary thresholds. The 1949 rule used various data sources to adjust salary thresholds for EAP exemptions, including comparisons to federal minimum wage, state salary levels, average salaries for exempt and nonexempt personnel, government pay scales, and average salaries in specific occupations. The sources reflected the available data at the time and highlighted the challenges in comparing methodologies over time. The 1949 rule increased the salary threshold for executive employees from $30 to $55 per week, using various data sources. This set a baseline for future threshold increases, locking in parts of previous methodologies. The threshold was aimed to be near the lower end of prevailing salaries for EAP employees. The DOL set the EAP salary levels for exemption based on the lower end of prevailing salaries, rejecting regional or industry-based thresholds to not exclude bona fide EAP employees in lower wage industries and regions. This decision was made in the context of a more robust \"long\" duties test in previous rulemakings. The DOL updated salary levels for exempt EAP employees based on CPI-U, aiming to set a threshold that differentiates exempt and nonexempt workers while minimizing denials of exemption. The 1958 rule introduced using a specific percentile for income-based proportionality, departing from previous rules considering regional and industry differentials in wage levels. The 1958 rule, known as the \"Kantor method,\" set the salary threshold for exempt EAP employees at levels where no more than 10% would fail to meet the tests based on region, establishment size, city, or industry. Subsequent rules have used a specific percentile on a wage distribution to establish the threshold for exemption from overtime pay. The 10% principle established in 1958 for EAP exemptions was based on wage distribution data from the WHPC division of DOL, which was not available for the 2004 and 2016 rules. The WHPC reports included data on EAP-exempt employee salaries by various categories and collected actual salary data for compliance investigations. The WHPC investigates establishments with potential FLSA violations, mainly in the South and nonmetropolitan areas. The salary threshold for EAP exemptions is determined using wage distribution data from exempt employees. The analysis varied between establishment and employee levels, with thresholds adjusted based on survey findings. The DOL increased the salary threshold for executive exemption from $100 to $125 per week in the 1970 rule. The Kantor method aimed to disqualify no more than 10% of EAP employees from exemption in various categories. However, this was challenging to achieve as a significant percentage of administrative employees in different regions and industries earned below the $125 per week threshold. The 2004 and 2016 rules maintained the concept of proportionality for EAP exemptions but operationalization differed due to changing data availability. The 2004 rule eliminated long and short duties tests, using a standard duties test and wage distribution data to set salary thresholds. DOL intended to establish updated levels based on the Kantor method, aiming to disqualify no more than 10% of EAP employees from exemption. The 2004 and 2016 rules set salary thresholds for EAP exemptions using wage distribution data from the Current Population Survey. The 2004 rule aimed to exclude approximately 20% of full-time salaried workers in the South and retail industry from exemption. The Department of Labor (DOL) set the salary level for exemption in the 2016 final rule at the 40th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census region, which is currently the South region. This was higher than the methodology used in the 2004 rule, which aimed to exclude approximately 20% of full-time salaried workers in the South and retail industry from exemption. The Department of Labor (DOL) set the salary level for exemption in the 2016 final rule at the 40th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the South region. DOL rejected including retail industry salaries as a demarcation point for exemption, citing the lack of historical parity at the 40th percentile. Multiple duties tests would have been required to include retail industry salaries. The Department of Labor (DOL) set the salary level for exemption in the 2016 final rule at the 40th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers. The salary distribution includes employees excluded from FLSA coverage or the salary requirement for overtime exemption, such as doctors and lawyers. DOL argues that the 2004 threshold was too low due to changes in exemption tests, leading to the adoption of a higher salary level of $913 to correct the mismatch. The 2016 final rule set the salary level for exemption at the 40th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers, aiming to correct a mismatch from the 2004 threshold. The 2004 and 2016 rules differ in methodology, setting the salary level threshold on a wage distribution of all salaried employees and using different percentiles. The EAP salary levels are often compared to the Consumer Price Index-All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and the federal minimum wage for context. The 2016 standard salary level of $913 per week is compared to previous inflation-adjusted levels. The comparison between the standard and short test salary levels and minimum wage historically shows how EAP salary levels established by DOL have changed over time. The standard duties test introduced in 2004 is quite comparable to the short duties test, making it more appropriate for comparing the value of the salary threshold over time. Differences between the two tests were minimal, as acknowledged by DOL. The Department concludes that quantitatively estimating the number of exempt workers due to differences in standard duties tests is impossible. Indexing EAP salary levels to inflation from 1949 to 1975 would have resulted in a 2016 salary level ranging from $991 to $1,231 per week. However, indexing from the 2004 adjustment would have led to a 2016 salary level of $575 per week. The real value of the threshold for the standard test decreased over time. The real value of the threshold for the standard test decreased from $1,106 in 1950-1975 to $575 in 2004. If the 2016 rule had not been invalidated, the threshold would have decreased by 17% from the short test level but increased by 59% from the 2004 level. The EAP short test salary level ratios to the federal minimum wage over time are shown in Figure 2. The EAP exemptions were based on workers earning salaries above the minimum wage. The 1963 rule compared the salary threshold for executive and administrative employees to the prevailing hourly minimum wage, guiding the DOL to set the threshold at 80 times the minimum wage. The ratios of EAP salary levels to federal minimum wage rates averaged 2.94 from 1950 to 1975, ranging from 3.33 to 2.34 during different periods. From 1968-1969, the EAP salary level was $150 per week, compared to the federal minimum wage of $64. Between 1976 and 2003, the ratio of EAP salary levels to the minimum wage declined, averaging 1.7. In 2004, the EAP salary level increased to $455 per week, raising the ratio to 2.21. After minimum wage increases in 2007-2009, the ratio dropped to 1.57. By 2016, the ratio reached 3.15 with an EAP salary level of $913 per week and a federal minimum wage of $290. In 1940, the Secretary of Labor updated the salary levels for EAP exemptions under the FLSA. The salary level for executive employees remained at $30 per week, administrative employees increased to $50 per week, and a new category, professional employees, was set at $50 per week. The DOL emphasized that the salary level should not be close to the federal minimum wage of $0.30 per hour to maintain exempt status as intended by the FLSA. The Department of Labor (DOL) maintained the $30 salary level for executive exemptions under the FLSA, citing the absence of data showing it was unsatisfactory. DOL considered state overtime salary thresholds, compensating advantages for executives, and the lack of employment spreading with a higher salary level. The Department of Labor increased the salary level for the administrative exemption from $30 to $50 per week to prevent abuse and ensure differentiation between clerical and administrative employees. The absence of a limit on nonexempt work for employees in this category led to the establishment of a higher salary requirement. The Department of Labor raised the salary level for the administrative exemption from $30 to $50 per week to distinguish between clerical and administrative employees. The new salary level was based on federal wage schedules and data from stenographers, bookkeepers, accountants, and auditors. Additionally, a new category of exempt workers called professional employees was defined. In 1949, the Department of Labor increased the salary levels for executive, administrative, and professional employees. The new salary thresholds were set at $55 per week for executives, $75 per week for administrative employees, and $75 per week for professional employees. Additionally, a short test with a salary threshold of $100 per week was established. In 1949, the Department of Labor increased salary levels for executive, administrative, and professional employees, setting new thresholds at $55 per week for executives, $75 per week for administrative employees, and $75 per week for professional employees. A short test with a $100 per week salary threshold was also established. DOL emphasized the importance of updated salary levels in distinguishing between exempt and nonexempt workers to prevent misclassification and simplify enforcement. The Department of Labor increased salary levels for executive, administrative, and professional employees in 1949. The new thresholds were set at $55 per week for executives and $75 per week for administrative and professional employees. The decision was based on changes in average weekly earnings in the manufacturing industry, with consideration given to lagging executive salaries in certain regions and industries. The Department of Labor raised the salary level for administrative and professional employees from $50 to $75 per week in 1949. The update focused on white-collar workers, including clerical workers, accountants, engineers, and federal government professionals. A \"short test\" for EAP exemptions was introduced, along with a two-test system that lasted until 2004. Special provisions were made for \"high salaried\" EAP employees earning at least $100 per week. The Department of Labor introduced a \"short test\" for EAP exemptions in 1949, raising the salary level for administrative and professional employees to $75 per week. Employees earning at least $100 per week with a \"primary duty\" as an executive, administrative, or professional were exempt from overtime protection. DOL justified the new short test for duties and salary based on the correlation between higher salaries and meeting exemption requirements. In 1958, the Department of Labor increased the salary levels for executive, administrative, and professional employees for EAP exemptions. The short test salary level was set higher than the long test to include employees with no exemption question. The 1958 rule emphasized setting salary levels near the lower end of the range for each exempt category. The Department of Labor set salary levels near the lower end of the range for EAP exemptions to ensure no more than 10% of employees would fail to qualify for exemption. This was done by analyzing survey data on salaries paid to exempt employees across different criteria. The Department of Labor analyzed salary data to set salary thresholds for EAP exemptions, ensuring no more than 10% of employees would not qualify. Different thresholds were set for various categories, with the final salary level threshold at $80 per week in the 1958 rule. Adjustments were made to the survey data collected in 1955. In 1955, the Department of Labor adjusted salary levels based on survey data and nonexempt manufacturing worker earnings. The 1963 rule increased salary levels for executive, administrative, and professional employees, as well as the short test threshold. The 1963 rule increased salary levels for executive, administrative, and professional employees. 13% of establishments paid executive employees less than $100 per week, 4% paid administrative employees less than $100 per week, and 12% paid professional employees less than $115 per week. The Department of Labor noted that the salary thresholds were related to those set in 1958. The 1963 rule increased salary levels for executive, administrative, and professional employees. The standard used in the 1963 rule differed from the 1958 standard in terms of reporting data. The short test salary level was adjusted to $150 per week. The rationale for the increase was not elaborated, but it maintained similar ratios of short-to-long test salary levels. In 1970, the salary levels for executive, administrative, and professional employees were increased. The salary threshold for the short test was raised from $150 to $200 per week. The 1970 rule analyzed actual salaries paid to EAP exempt employees and found that the EAP salary level had become less of a line of demarcation. The Department of Labor found that the salary levels for exempt executive, administrative, and professional employees needed to be increased to maintain their role as a demarcation for bona fide employees. This was based on survey data showing discrepancies in salaries among exempt and nonexempt employees. In 1970, the Department of Labor adjusted salary levels for executive, administrative, and professional employees, as their status was questionable due to low salaries. The new thresholds resulted in 14% of exempt executives, 11% of exempt administrators, and 17% of exempt professionals earning below the new levels. In 1975, the salary levels were further increased for these employees, along with an adjustment to the short test salary level. The Department of Labor increased the salary threshold for executive, administrative, and professional employees in 1975, adjusting for inflation since 1970. The updated levels were intended to be interim pending a study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 2004 Rule updated the salary level for EAP exemptions. The 2004 Rule updated the salary level for the EAP exemptions, creating a standard salary level of $455 per week and eliminating long and short tests for duties. The 2004 Rule updated the salary level for the EAP exemptions to $455 per week and eliminated the quantitative limit on nonexempt work, making the standard test similar to the short test used since 1949. DOL intended to establish the updated salary level based on the methodology in the 1958 rule, aiming for a threshold where no more than about 10% of EAP employees would fail to qualify for exemption. The 2004 Rule updated the salary level for EAP exemptions to $455 per week, using survey data from the Current Population Survey to set the salary level at the 20th percentile of full-time salaried workers in the South and retail industry. This aimed to exclude approximately 20% of workers in these regions from exemption. The 2016 final rule increased the standard salary level for the EAP exemption to $913 per week, which is the 40th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the South. It also implemented automatic updates to the salary level, with adjustments every three years based on the 40th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time nonhourly workers in the South. The 2016 final rule increased the standard salary level for the EAP exemption to $913 per week, based on the 40th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the South region. This rule did not change the duties tests for EAP exemptions and used CPS data to establish the threshold. The Department of Labor (DOL) set the standard salary level for the EAP exemption at $913 per week, based on the 40th percentile of earnings in the South region. DOL excluded retail industry salaries from the calculation and included employees not subject to FLSA coverage or overtime exemption requirements. The Department of Labor (DOL) set the standard salary level for the EAP exemption at $913 per week, based on the 40th percentile of earnings in the South region. DOL excluded retail industry salaries from the calculation and included employees not subject to FLSA coverage or overtime exemption requirements. DOL argues that the 2004 threshold was too low and adopted the $913 salary level to correct the mismatch between the standard salary level and the standard duties test."
