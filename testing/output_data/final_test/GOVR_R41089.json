    "content": "As Congress considers clean energy legislation, new hydropower resources on small rivers and streams are being discussed. These resources, with a power generation capacity of 1 to 30 megawatts, could contribute to the 6% of electricity currently produced by hydropower in the United States. The focus of this report is on characterizing small and low-head hydropower and addressing issues related to their development. Hydropower has been used for electricity production since the 19th century, with almost half of US electricity coming from it in the early 20th century. Larger hydropower facilities use dams for water storage to provide a constant electricity supply. Run-of-river plants generate electricity without significant water storage. Hydropower facilities use dams to impound water for controlled power generation. Water flows through a penstock to turn turbine blades, producing electricity based on water volume and elevation difference. It is a cost-effective source of electricity with no fuel cost, but maintenance of dams is a major expense. Some dams serve multiple purposes like irrigation and flood control, and electricity can be sent to industrial centers via transmission lines. Impoundment hydropower supports recreational activities and can release water for electricity needs or to maintain water levels. Pumped storage plants reuse water for electricity generation by pumping it back to a reservoir. Run-of-river hydropower facilities generate electricity without large reservoirs, utilizing natural water flow conditions. Run-of-river hydropower facilities can be designed using large flow rates with low head or small flow rates with high head, relying on the natural range of water flow in a river. Some facilities have a dam across the river to impound water, but water flows over the dam to continue downstream. Diversion facilities channel a portion of a river to capture water for power generation before releasing it downstream. Concerns over environmental impacts of conventional hydropower include habitat changes affecting wildlife and migratory fish populations. The development of dams can have dramatic impacts on migratory fish populations and water quality. Clearing trees for dam construction can lead to soil erosion and landslides, causing sediment buildup in streams. Spilling water from dams can saturate basin water with gases, leading to fish deaths. Reservoirs can disrupt natural water flow, causing stratification and oxygen depletion, making it difficult for fish to survive. The construction of dams can have significant impacts on water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Deep reservoir water low in oxygen can lead to the release of toxic metals downstream. Changes in water release patterns can harm fish and other organisms. Dams also have other negative environmental effects, such as releasing soil mercury and methane. Many dams in the United States were not built for power generation but for flood control, irrigation, or water storage. A study by the Department of Energy in 2003 found that enhancing existing hydro facilities by adding turbines to dams or increasing capacity is cost-effective. The potential for small and low-head hydroelectric generation in the US was assessed in 2006, with a focus on feasibility criteria. The Department of Energy assessed the potential for small and low-head hydroelectric generation in the United States in 2006. Feasibility criteria were established for \"developable resources,\" with a focus on sites close to towns or electricity lines and roads. Approximately 5,400 sites were identified with the potential for small hydro projects, which could result in a greater than 50% increase in total hydroelectric power generation if developed. Low-head hydro projects are designed to operate at optimal river or stream levels and are almost always run-of-river to minimize infrastructure and costs. Pressure reducing valves (PRVs) are used in water supply systems and industry to reduce fluid pressure. They can be found at distribution points in water conduits, canals, and pipelines, offering power generation opportunities. \"Reverse pumps\" can replace PRVs to generate electricity while reducing pressure in the water system. Hydropower projects can generate electricity by transferring water between reservoirs or releasing it to rivers. Small turbines in waterways and canals can harness water flow to produce power. The location and size of a hydropower project determine regulatory requirements, while the delivery of electricity determines other aspects. The regulatory treatment of hydropower projects is influenced by the delivery of electricity, whether it serves end-use customers, connects to distribution grids, or directly to transmission grids. Small projects near existing distribution lines can reduce costs, while larger projects may connect to transmission lines for remote loads or power sales on the grid. Federal hydroelectric projects may have been initially designed for irrigation or flood control purposes. The larger federal hydroelectric projects were originally designed with irrigation or flood control purposes as a primary goal, with power generation as a secondary benefit. Public policy for hydropower now includes clean energy provision from renewable resources. Some environmental advocates question hydropower due to potential negative impacts. Congress is considering bills for climate change mitigation and clean energy, such as H.R. 2454 and S. 1462. The RES would require retail electric suppliers to obtain increasing percentages of renewable electricity for the power they provide to customers. Renewable energy technologies qualifying for the RES include wind, solar, geothermal, marine, biomass, landfill gas, and \"qualified hydropower.\" H.R. 2454 allows incremental capacity additions or energy efficiency improvements to existing hydroelectric facilities or non-hydroelectric dams. The provisions in S. 1462 allow for efficiency improvements and capacity additions to existing non-hydroelectric dams, with specific criteria to prevent water surface elevation increases solely for hydropower projects. Alaska is permitted to include small hydropower, pumped storage, and lake tap energy for qualifying hydropower projects. Only limited applications of hydropower would qualify to be included in satisfying the RES, such as incremental capacity and energy efficiency improvements to existing dams, and capacity added to existing non-hydroelectric dams. New run-of-river low-head and small hydropower projects may not meet the requirements for \"qualified hydropower\" unless installed at existing non-hydropower dams. Ineligibility for local energy projects may not concern developers, but connecting to transmission could result in lost economic incentives. Requirements for \"qualified hydropower\" may change as the RES is debated. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is responsible for licensing non-federal hydropower projects under the Federal Power Act. FERC issues licenses for construction, operation, and maintenance of hydropower projects for up to 50 years, overseeing environmental matters and ongoing project operations. Most hydropower projects are subject to FERC licensing requirements. FERC's licensing process for hydropower projects can be lengthy and challenging, requiring multiple permits from various regulatory agencies. This process applies to projects on navigable waterways, federal land, surplus water or power from federal dams, and those affecting interstate commerce. Existing conventional projects may be replaced by small or low-head hydropower projects due to relicensing requirements. FERC has introduced processes for expedited consideration and exemptions from licensing requirements for eligible hydropower projects. Exemptions are issued in perpetuity but still subject to terms set by federal and state agencies. Two types of exemptions exist for small hydropower projects and water transportation conduits. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 requires states to implement utility conservation programs and create incentive rates for eligible small power producers and cogeneration facilities, including small hydropower facilities. States set prices and mandatory purchase requirements for utilities to buy from qualifying facilities. Small power and low-head projects may be eligible for \"net metering\" credit for excess power production. \"Net metering allows retail customers with generation to receive retail rate credit for excess energy produced. FERC jurisdiction applies unless a wholesale sale of power occurs. If there are net sales of energy, the generator must comply with FPA requirements for wholesale sales.\" Small hydropower generating stations have lower environmental impacts compared to large hydro stations. Negative impacts can be mitigated with good design and practices, but issues can arise from dam construction and flooding. Changes in flow regime from hydroelectric development can affect wildlife habitats. The potential for small and low-head hydropower development to impact the environment, including water quality, soils, and habitats, is significant. Research indicates that there is potential for significant growth in hydropower capacity from various sources by 2025. DOE's focus on hydropower R&D in 2010 includes technology development, environmental impact studies, and resource assessment. The Administration's funding for hydropower in FY2011 decreased by 19% from FY2010 levels. DOE is conducting a national assessment of existing hydropower infrastructure to identify opportunities for increased generation and improved environmental performance. Low-head hydropower projects have lower output per unit of water, requiring increased flow to compensate. Construction costs for low head developments can increase proportionately per installed kilowatt. Construction costs can increase per installed kilowatt for low head developments. Turbine/generator sets placed directly in a stream can reduce structural works, but lower head electromechanical equipment gives less power per unit of weight. Expensive frequency and voltage control equipment is often needed for low-head hydro projects with large variations in head or flow. New ideas for low-head hydropower include unregulated turbines that vary speed with head or flow, and permanent magnet-type generators (PMG) that produce output voltage varying with head and flow. PMG technology faces challenges in electric grid connection approval due to synchronization issues. Low-head hydropower projects are seeing advancements in technology, such as direct-drive variable speed PMGs that can be placed in flow channels with minimal civil works. These projects typically do not face the same environmental issues as larger hydroelectric facilities. PMG technology is becoming more cost-effective for hydropower projects, with decreasing costs of rare earth magnets and improved electronic interfaces for synchronization. Impoundments and dams need to consider fish passage solutions to mitigate potential impacts. New technologies for low-head hydropower projects, such as direct-drive variable speed PMGs, are becoming more cost-effective. Fish passage solutions, including directing fish around dams or using fish-friendly turbines, are still in need of research to minimize injuries and mortality. Low technology solutions like waterwheels and changes to spillway design can help reduce fish passage and injury issues. Run-of-river hydropower facilities can generate electricity without the need for large dams, minimizing water impoundment and associated ecological problems. Site conditions will determine the economic feasibility of these technologies. The economics of developing hydropower projects are influenced by site conditions. Innovation is needed for low head sites to optimize technology. Turbine choice depends on pressure head and design flow. Impulse and reaction turbines are the two basic modes of operation. Impulse turbines are driven by water jets at atmospheric pressure, while reaction turbines use the momentum of flowing water. Water turbines need a certain flow to operate efficiently. If the river flow is insufficient, the turbine's performance is affected, requiring regulation or shutdown. Turbines can adjust their inlet guide vanes and blades for flow control. Propeller turbines are ideal for small hydro projects, while larger projects use bulb-turbines or vertical shaft Kaplan turbines. Turbines are classified by size and power rating, with micro hydropower projects designed for specific sites. Projects for micro hydropower utilize available water resources at specific sites without the need for a dam. Water is channeled to a turbine through an intake structure, with a control valve regulating water flow and turbine speed. A minimum of three feet of head and 20 gallons per minute flow rate are required for efficient turbine operation. Various turbine technologies, including impulse and reaction turbines, as well as modernized water-wheels, are used in micro hydropower installations. New methods for capturing energy from water flow are also being explored. New hydropower technologies are emerging for capturing energy from river currents. Hydrokinetic turbines generate electricity by capturing the kinetic energy of water flow. These turbines are sturdier than wind turbines due to water's density. The first hydrokinetic project licensed by FERC faced challenges with tidal forces in New York's East River. The first hydrokinetic project licensed by FERC in 2009 was located at an existing hydroelectric dam on the Mississippi River in Hastings, Minnesota. The project featured a 12-foot-diameter, 100 kW turbine designed to work in one-directional water flow. Tidal turbines can be placed in tidal river estuaries to capture energy from ebb and flood currents. The largest tidal turbine with a capacity of 1,000 MW was scheduled for field-testing in northern Scotland in 2010. Researchers have developed \"fish-friendly\" turbines for field-testing in northern Scotland in 2010, designed to move fish through with reduced impacts. New designs are emerging for low head conditions, including structurally simple, non-regulated designs with a variable speed drive. Technologies such as various blade designs and better pressure distribution aim to reduce fish damage. Demonstration of these technologies is needed to prove concepts and balance power generation with environmental concerns. The development of hydropower projects requires careful consideration of site characteristics and structural works. Pre-design evaluations are crucial, especially for small and low-head hydro projects. These facilities typically rely on river or stream flows and can last for at least 50 years. Research into new technologies and regulations can help balance energy production with environmental concerns. Hydropower plants are dependent on river or stream flows, which can vary due to seasonal conditions. This can affect a plant's capacity factor and even lead to power generation stopping. Compliance with regulatory requirements and costs for environmental regulations and grid connection can be significant hurdles for small hydropower projects. Hydrokinetic projects are still in a demonstration phase, with their technical performance and potential impacts on aquatic environments being determined. Hydropower projects are decided based on technical and financial analysis. The absence of fuel costs makes large-scale hydro projects cost-effective. Incentive rates for electricity production may make small and low-head hydro projects feasible. Government incentives may be necessary to support the financial case for clean energy policy goals. National policies promoting clean energy are crucial for the widespread development of small and low-head hydropower projects."
