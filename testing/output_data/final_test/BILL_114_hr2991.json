    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Preparing More Welfare Recipients for Work Act\" and aims to improve the counting of required hours of participation in work activities. The \"Preparing More Welfare Recipients for Work Act\" aims to improve counting of required work activity hours by eliminating the distinction between core and non-core work activities and allowing states to receive partial credit for partial engagement. The \"Preparing More Welfare Recipients for Work Act\" allows states to request an alternate work participation rate calculation by counting partial engagement towards required work activity hours. The Secretary establishes guidelines for states to accurately record individual work participation hours, with an alternative calculation approved by the Secretary for compliance. The text discusses the requirements for recipients participating in work activities, based on minimum participation rates and hours per week. Additionally, modifications to counting job search as work are addressed. Modifications to counting job search as work are outlined in the text, specifying that participation in certain activities can count towards a maximum of half of the required hours for work activities. Additionally, a rule regarding participation due to secondary school attendance is also modified. Secondary School Attendance requirements under the Act are amended to extend the age limit to 26 years and remove specific marital status criteria. Additionally, a new provision mandates periodic meetings with individuals participating in job readiness activities for more than 3 months. The Act extends the age limit for Secondary School Attendance requirements to 26 years and removes specific marital status criteria.
