The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will implement a pilot program for an alternative appeals process to expedite appeal determinations. Claimants can elect to file a fully developed appeal by submitting necessary documents and arguments. The pilot program for an alternative appeals process allows claimants to elect to file a fully developed appeal, which can be reverted to the standard appeals process if needed without penalty. During the pilot program for an alternative appeals process, the Secretary conducts outreach to provide claimants with information on the advantages and disadvantages of the program, how to make an election, and the limitations on new evidence use. The Secretary collaborates with veterans service organizations to publish an online tutorial explaining the pilot program's advantages and disadvantages. Upon the election of a claimant to file a fully developed appeal, the Secretary will not provide a statement of the case or require a substantive appeal. The jurisdiction over the appeal will be transferred directly to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, which maintains fully developed appeals on a separate docket and decides them in the order received. The Board of Veterans' Appeals will decide fully developed appeals on a separate docket, aiming to decide each appeal within one year of the notice of disagreement filing. Adjustments may be made to the number of standard appeals decided for each fully developed appeal after the pilot program commences. The Board of Veterans' Appeals may adjust the number of standard appeals decided for fully developed appeals if deemed fair. Limitations on submitting new evidence for fully developed appeals are in place, requiring claimants to revert to the standard appeals process if new evidence is submitted. The Board of Veterans' Appeals allows adjustments to the number of standard appeals decided for fully developed appeals. New evidence gathered by the board will not apply to evidence developed through other means. Representatives of claimants have the opportunity to review and submit additional arguments or evidence during a specified period for fully developed appeals. The Board of Veterans' Appeals may develop federal records, independent medical opinions, or new medical examinations for fully developed appeals without remanding for additional development. The Board retains jurisdiction over the appeal and ensures the claimant and representative are informed. The Board of Veterans' Appeals establishes an office to develop necessary federal records, medical opinions, and examinations for fully developed appeals. Claimants are provided with copies of records and a 90-day period to submit additional evidence without needing to start the process over.
