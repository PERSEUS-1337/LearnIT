Businesses consider internal and external funding sources, weighing borrowing money against selling an ownership stake. Lenders examine financial returns and risks on a loan, comparing offers from different firms and considering alternatives like consumer loans or government bonds. This report analyzes factors influencing borrowing decisions for businesses, especially small businesses. When the economy is growing rapidly, businesses will seek to borrow more money for profitable projects with higher risk-adjusted returns. The supply and demand for loans fluctuate based on economic conditions and the number of profitable projects available. Changes in business sectors affect the supply and demand for capital. Businesses borrow for long-term investments and short-term needs, influenced by interest rates and economic outlook. Interest rates impact profitability, while economic conditions affect long-term borrowing. The economic outlook can impact sectors differently, influencing business demand for investment goods. Factors like cost, durability, and tax treatment play a role. Lenders have size limits on loans, with some having fees that may make borrowing small amounts impractical. The Small Business Administration offers a microloan program to address these concerns. Large loans may exceed financial capacity or legal limits. If a firm chooses debt financing, it can face challenges. When financing through debt, firms can take out loans or sell bonds to the public. Bonds offer the advantage of being sellable in the secondary market but come with high fixed costs, typically issued in large amounts. Consumers borrow for various purposes, with household income being a key factor influencing consumer borrowing. Influences on consumer loan demand include income fluctuations, seasonal factors, interest rates, and future expectations. Governments borrow to fund spending exceeding revenues, with federal government less affected by interest rate changes. State and local governments, needing balanced budgets, are sensitive to interest rates. Foreign governments are influenced by inflation, interest, and exchange rates. Borrowers also lend funds, sometimes to exploit interest rate differences or timing. Motivation to save depends on interest rates, inflation, and future income/expenditure timing. Financial intermediaries like banks borrow to lend to others. Financial intermediaries like banks borrow money to lend to others, collecting deposits from consumers for lending purposes. Consumers can deposit money in various accounts, including checking accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit, as well as specialized tax-favored vehicles like Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). Businesses also lend money to other businesses for various purposes, such as financing purchases or accumulating funds for future investments. Governments use financial intermediaries to lend short or long term, while foreign governments invest internationally through sovereign wealth funds. Investors can purchase ownership shares instead of borrowing for projects, with common stockholders entitled to dividends but no specific claim on money. Shareholders are entitled to dividends, but management can retain profits for future opportunities. Unhappy shareholders have limited recourse unless they convince the board of directors. Preferred stock combines characteristics of debt and equity, promising a certain dividend with a lower claim on company revenues than bonds. Lenders are entitled to specified interest payments and repayment according to the loan agreement. Lenders can force a company into bankruptcy if it fails to make payments and seize assets to pay off the loan. Collateral may be required to secure debt, and a sinking fund can be used to pay interest or principal. Small business lenders may require an SBA guarantee to reduce risk, with owners often pledging assets as collateral. Business interest payments are tax deductible, while dividends and interest are taxable. The SBA's SBIC program aims to stimulate private equity investments and long-term loans for small businesses. The JOBS Act aims to facilitate private equity investments and long-term loans for small businesses by making it easier for them to sell stock to investors. Small businesses, defined as having 500 or fewer employees by the Small Business Administration, have unique financing challenges compared to large firms due to their smaller scale and limited access to capital markets. Small businesses may face challenges in accessing financing due to limited options, higher interest rates, and stricter requirements compared to larger businesses. Reasons for this include higher risk due to economic fluctuations, higher failure rates, difficulty in assessing creditworthiness, and lack of standardized criteria for lending to small businesses. Limited financial information also contributes to the challenges small businesses face in obtaining loans. Small businesses often lack reliable financial information, are privately owned, and use staff for financial reporting. They have less collateral for loans, leading to personal real estate pledges. Financial institutions with existing relationships have an advantage in lending due to their familiarity with the business. The bank uses detailed information on owners, managers, markets, and potential of loan applicants to make better lending decisions and monitor financial health. Small business borrowing fluctuates over a business cycle, with lending declining during economic slowdowns and picking up during recoveries. Economic conditions impact small business borrowing, with lenders becoming more or less risk averse. SBA loan guarantees can help small businesses expand during slowdowns. Economic conditions also affect the risk-adjusted profitable opportunities for small businesses to invest. The 2007-2012 decline in house prices reduced collateral value for small businesses, impacting their demand for loans. Small businesses may become more risk averse and choose not to undertake projects with risk and profit characteristics that were previously considered. The SBA does not require collateral for its guarantees, and economic conditions influence the supply and demand for capital, determining the equilibrium interest rate. The supply curve shifts left during a slowdown, indicating less capital available at the same interest rate. The demand curve also shifts left, showing fewer business loans desired at the same interest rate. If supply declines more than demand, interest rates could rise. Supply and demand for business loans have both decreased, with supply declining more than demand. Loan volume falls overall, and businesses may pay higher interest rates based on their risk level. Information on small business borrowing is available from various sources, including the SBA's loan guarantee programs and the Federal Reserve's occasional research. The Federal Reserve conducts quarterly surveys on bank lending practices, including changes in lending terms for small businesses. The surveys are not based on the SBA's definition of \"small,\" but provide indicative results on small business lending. Additionally, the Federal Reserve releases a quarterly Survey of Business Lending on loans made by different types of banks to businesses, with information broken down by loan size. Small business lending can be affected by various events, leading to changes in lending standards. Declining employment in small businesses may be due to economic conditions and lack of demand for products. Expanding SBA loan guarantees could help in some cases, but may have little impact during a recession. Small business lending can be impacted by changing consumer tastes, leading to layoffs. Loans to update products or enter new markets may be more useful than loans to expand production. Competitive markets are beneficial for the economy, delivering goods at the lowest cost. Government intervention may be necessary to correct market failures without overcorrecting. Factors affecting small business loan supply and demand are independent of SBA guarantees. Forecasting the impact of the business cycle on the demand for SBA guarantees on loans to small businesses is challenging due to limited information and the uncertainty of how declining small business investment may affect lenders seeking to avoid risk."
