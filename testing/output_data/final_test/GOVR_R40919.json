    "content": "The report analyzes data on the nonprofit and charitable sectors, including organizations with federal tax-exempt status. The term \"charitable sector\" refers to organizations with 501(c)(3) public charity status. The Internal Revenue Code describes various types of tax-exempt organizations, such as charitable organizations, social welfare organizations, and educational institutions. The focus is on organizations eligible for 501(c)(3) status, including charities, religious organizations, hospitals, and educational institutions. The universe of charitable organizations is classified as either public charities or private foundations. Public charities have broad public support and provide charitable services directly, while private foundations are tightly controlled and make grants to other organizations. 501(c)(3) organizations are presumed to be private foundations unless they qualify for public charity status based on support and control tests. Form 990 is a primary source of data for these organizations, collecting information about finances, assets, and activities. For tax year 2009, public charities with specific financial thresholds must file different versions of Form 990. Private foundations use Form 990-PF. Churches and qualifying religious organizations are exempt from annual reporting. Tax-exempt organizations may also need to file a tax return for income from unrelated business activities. Nonprofit organizations are subject to tax on income from business activities unrelated to their exempt purpose, known as the unrelated business income tax (UBIT). They must file Form 990-T and pay employment taxes like for-profit employers. Table 1 shows that of the 1.5 million registered nonprofits, 64% are public charities, 8% are private foundations, and 29% are other nonprofits. Only 52% of charities file Form 990, with non-filers including religious organizations and small or inactive organizations. Employment data in the nonprofit sector is limited, with no systematic collection by government agencies. Two major studies have estimated employment in the nonprofit and charitable sector, with 12.9 million employed in nonprofits in 2005 and 9.4 million in charities in 2004. This accounts for nearly 10% of the total workforce in the US. Nearly 10% of America's workforce is employed in the nonprofit sector, with over 7% working for charities. Table 2 shows that more than half of nonprofit employment is in health care and social assistance. Between 1998 and 2005, nonprofit sector employment grew by 16.4%, outpacing the overall nationwide growth of 6.2%. Arts, entertainment, and recreation accounted for nearly 4% of nonprofit employment. Between 1998 and 2005, the professional, scientific, and technical services sectors saw the most growth in nonprofit employment, but still represent less than 1% of total nonprofit employment. Health care and social assistance, as well as education services, were the largest sectors in terms of nonprofit employment, with employment increases exceeding the overall nonprofit sector growth. Charities employ fewer people compared to nonprofits as a whole, with regional variations in employment distribution. In the northeast, a larger proportion of the workforce is employed by charitable organizations. The District of Columbia has the highest percentage of workers employed by charities at 16.3%, followed by Rhode Island at 13.6% and New York at 13.3%. The south has fewer workers employed by charities. In addition to paid workers, there were 4.7 million full-time equivalent volunteer workers in charitable institutions in 2004. Table 4 shows the revenue of 501(c)(3) public charities as of July 2009, with total revenues for 2009 amounting to $1.40 trillion. Revenue information is provided by 512,889 public charities filing Form 990 with the IRS, and it varies significantly across sectors. For example, nonprofit hospitals make up less than 1% of all filing organizations but contribute 41% of the total revenues reported by charitable organizations. Charitable hospitals and other health-oriented organizations contribute significantly to the revenue of the charitable sector, with hospitals alone accounting for 41% of revenues and holding over 29% of assets. Higher-education organizations, despite being a small percentage of charities, generate more than 11% of revenue and hold over 21% of assets in the charitable sector. This data indicates a disproportionate level of revenue and assets held by hospitals and higher-education institutions compared to other charitable organizations. Charitable organizations in arts, culture, and humanities have below-average revenue compared to health and education charities. These sectors represent a larger share in the number of organizations than in revenue generation or assets. The data in Table 4 shows that religious charitable organizations have limited information reported, with only 6.5% of organizations filing 990 being religious charities. These organizations hold $2.6 trillion worth of assets, with education charities standing out for holding nearly 33% of these assets. Education charities hold nearly 33% of assets held by charitable institutions, driven by higher-education institutions and large endowment holdings. Health-related charities also hold a disproportionate volume of assets, with nearly 36% held by only 5.5% of organizations in the health sector. Human services and housing sectors hold a smaller share of assets compared to their filing organizations. The human services sector and housing charities hold a small share of assets compared to their filing organizations. There is no adjustment for charity size in the revenue and asset data presented. Health and education sectors have higher revenue and assets due to their larger size, while arts, culture, and humanities organizations are smaller in comparison. Public charities represent 59% of nonprofit organizations but bring in 71% of revenue, holding $1.6 million in assets. Private foundations, making up 10% of nonprofits, hold nearly 15% of assets. Other nonprofits, comprising 32% of organizations, hold less than 20% of revenue and 24% of assets. In 2008, nonprofit institutions serving households (NPISH) generated 5.2% of U.S. GDP, totaling $751.2 billion. The share increased by 0.4 percentage points from 1998 to 2008. NPISH's output includes wages, rental value of assets, and rental income from tenant-occupied housing. The data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis provides the best representation of the nonprofit sector's economic share, but NPISH classification is a subset of all nonprofits, representing a smaller share of economic activity. The NPISH classification is not the same as the charitable sector, including organizations like social welfare groups and labor unions. Some 501(c)(3) organizations may not fall under NPISH, while others within NPISH may not be 501(c)(3). NPISH likely contributes more to GDP than the charitable sector but less than the nonprofit sector as a whole. Pricing charitable output is challenging, so the BEA estimates value using input costs, which also presents difficulties. The cost of inputs for charitable organizations, particularly employee wages, poses challenges in determining their overall costs. The method used by the BEA to measure the nonprofit sector's output only includes measurable input costs, excluding volunteer efforts which are significant in supporting many organizations. Despite imprecise data on the number of employees in the charitable sector, it was noted that there were nearly 13 million nonprofit employees in 2005 and an estimated 9.4 million employees in the charitable sector in 2004. In terms of employment, the charitable sector surpasses the construction sector. The charitable sector, larger than construction and finance sectors combined in terms of employment, contributes 5.2% to GDP. NPISHs represent $751.2 billion in GDP, surpassing construction and educational services. Charitable sector's importance in the economy varies based on measurement criteria. The charitable sector appears larger than construction, manufacturing, finance, insurance, real estate, and educational services in terms of employment. However, only construction and educational services had contributions to GDP lower than NPISHs in 2008. Direct comparison of nonprofit and charitable sectors' employment to NPISHs' GDP contribution is not appropriate. Establishment data comparing nonprofit firms to financial services and real estate industries show their relative size. Nonprofit establishments have fewer very large and very small establishments compared to all sectors. Only 6% of nonprofit establishments have more than 1,000 employees, while 52% have less than 10 employees. In comparison, 14.6% of all establishments have more than 1,000 employees, and 58.1% have less than 10 employees. Nonprofit establishments are more likely to be mid-sized. Charitable organizations, which are nonprofit establishments, are typically mid-sized with 10 to 1,000 employees. They raise revenue from fees, government grants, private contributions, and investments. In 2005, charitable organizations raised $1.2 trillion in revenue, with private payments for services being the largest source of revenue. In 2005, charities collected $590 billion in payments for services, which constituted 49% of total revenue. Government grants and payments made up the second largest revenue source at $351 billion, or 29% of total revenue. The government also provides indirect support to charities through tax benefits and other incentives. Private contributions to charitable organizations in 2005 totaled $143.77 billion, accounting for 12% of their revenue. Charities also generated $81 billion from investments, representing 7% of their total revenue. The recent recession has likely impacted investment income, with university endowments experiencing a 23% average loss. Charitable organizations receive revenue from various sources such as private contributions and investments. University endowments lost 23% on average between July 1, 2008, and November 30, 2008. Other revenue sources, totaling $30 billion in 2005, make up 3% of overall revenue. Different types of charities have varying reliance on revenue sources, with education and health care charities receiving the majority of their revenue from private payments. Charitable organizations, particularly in education and health care, rely heavily on private payments for revenue. Arts, culture, and environment charities depend most on private contributions. Charities heavily reliant on private funding are more vulnerable to economic fluctuations and changes in tax laws affecting individual giving. Education charities, including higher education institutions, generate a significant portion of revenue from investments. Overall, educational institutions, with a greater reliance on investment income, are more likely to be directly affected by financial market downturns. Charities that rely more on private contributions, such as arts, culture, and environment organizations, are more susceptible to fluctuations in private giving, especially due to changes in tax laws. Understanding the revenue sources of different charitable organizations can help policymakers anticipate how external economic conditions may impact the sector's well-being. Private payments to charitable organizations, particularly in the health care sector, have grown significantly between 1995 and 2005. This growth has helped offset revenue losses for charities that rely heavily on private giving, such as health care and education institutions. Total revenue received by charitable institutions increased by 68.6% during this time period, with private payments being a key driver of this growth. Private payments to charitable organizations, especially in the health care sector, have increased significantly between 1995 and 2005. Revenue from private contributions grew by nearly 69% overall, with some sectors experiencing growth exceeding 100%. Additionally, investment income saw the highest growth for charities in the education sector during this time period. Between 1995 and 2005, charities in the education sector saw the highest growth in revenue from investment income. Higher education institutions drove this trend, but their financial assets were negatively impacted in 2008. The international charitable sector experienced a 190% increase in revenue, while the environmental sector saw a 90% increase during the same period. Between 1995 and 2005, revenue in the environmental charitable sector increased by 90%. Private contributions to charitable organizations come from individuals, bequests, corporations, and foundations, totaling $307.65 billion in 2008. Giving in 2008 was 2% less than in 2007, marking the first decline since 1987. In 2008, charitable giving saw a decline, with individuals and bequests falling by over 6%, corporations by 8%, and foundations by less than 1% in real terms. Despite this, contributions in 2008 were still higher than a decade earlier, with gifts from individuals increasing by 25%, bequests by 32%, corporate giving by 30%, and gifts from foundations by 83% between 1998 and 2008. The ratio of charitable giving to GDP is used to evaluate society's generosity over time. The ratio of charitable giving to GDP is examined to evaluate society's generosity over time. Giving as a percentage of GDP was greater than 2% into the 1970s, then remained below 2% from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. It began to increase in the late 1990s, peaking at 2.37% in 2005 before falling. Giving by individuals and foundations drove the increase in the 1990s and 2000s. Individual giving as a percentage of GDP has not fallen below 1.6% since 1999, reaching 1.61% in 2008. Giving as a percentage of GDP by foundations has nearly tripled since the 1970s, reaching 0.29% in 2008. Corporate giving as a percentage of GDP in 2008 was 0.10%, remaining consistent with the 1990s. Bequests relative to GDP were 0.16% in 2008, lower than in the early 2000s. Private donations are the largest source of funding for arts, culture, and humanities, as well as for environment and animals charities, with both receiving over 40% of their revenue from private donations in 2005. Religious organizations receive the largest share of gifts, experiencing an increase in giving between 2007 and 2008, while overall giving fell by 5.7% during that period. Between 1998 and 2008, giving to grantmaking foundations, human services, and arts, culture, and humanities declined. Overall giving increased by 32% during this period, with significant increases in international affairs, environment and animals, and education sectors. Giving to religion grew modestly, while arts, culture, and humanities saw a 2% decrease despite being heavily reliant on private contributions. Various factors such as tax deductions, personal income fluctuations, and economic conditions can impact individual giving behavior. Individuals who itemize deductions have a greater incentive to give to charity, with those itemizing giving an average of 3.54% of their adjusted gross income in 2005. Non-itemizers gave an average of 1.34%. Charitable deductions are limited to 50% of modified adjusted gross income. Giving to charity varies across income groups, with higher-income households giving more. In 2004, households with income over $100,000 gave an average of $2,000 to charity, driven by a few making large gifts. The median gift was $775. Households earning over $100,000 gave three times more than those earning less than $50,000. Economists study the elasticity of charitable giving with income, producing varied results. The income elasticity of charitable giving is likely unit elastic, as individual contributions relative to GDP have remained constant over time. Charitable bequests are given by estates upon an individual's death, with about 120,000 estates leaving bequests each year. Giving via bequests is highly concentrated among the wealthiest decedents, with only 8,000 estates responsible for 85% of all giving in 2008. Recent work has shown that estate taxes and overall wealth impact bequests. Corporate giving can be done directly or through a foundation, with corporations typically giving 1% of pre-tax income to charity. Foundations have seen an increase in giving compared to individuals and corporations. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation donated $2.8 billion in 2008. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation increased its grants by $0.8 billion between 2007 and 2008, contributing to the overall stability of foundation giving. Government grants and payments to charitable organizations accounted for 29% of total revenue, with variations across different types of charities. Government grants account for about 9% of total revenue for charitable organizations, totaling around $100 billion in 2005. These grants may have performance requirements but are not allocated to specific individuals or services received. The majority of government payments in the charitable sector are for health services and are primarily due to fees. Government grants are significant in human services and international organizations, less so in health. Grants reflect the nature of specific charities and are more important where the government has a special interest. In 2007, the government provided around $20 billion in transfer payments for nonprofit organizations. Grant support is more crucial in sectors like human services and international organizations. Government funding to charitable organizations can come from the federal government, state, and local governments. In 2001, only 12% of grants and fees originated from state and local governments, 37% were financed by the federal government through state and local programs, and 51% were provided directly by the federal government. Excluding Medicare and Medicaid, states supplied only 9% of funding. Charities may face funding declines during economic downturns, with a decrease in charitable giving observed in the current recession. Nonprofits generally fare no worse than other sectors during downturns, but this recession may be more challenging due to falling asset values. Giving trends vary significantly across different sectors. During the recent economic downturn, human welfare organizations experienced the greatest decline in giving, with a 16% decrease in donations between 2007 and 2008. The recession also impacted assets held by university endowments and foundations, affecting charitable organizations' assets. Despite the fall in asset values, foundation grants to other organizations decreased less than individual giving, bequests, and corporate donations. During the recession, nonprofits faced challenges with decreased government support and delayed payments. Sectors producing durable goods suffered the most, while necessities like food and healthcare were more resilient. Charitable contributions were also impacted. Charitable contributions tend to decrease during recessions, but the percentage of GDP allocated to giving has remained stable over business cycles. Despite a 2% decline in nominal terms from 2007 to 2008, there has been an upward trend in giving as a share of output since the 1980s. During the recent recession, charitable giving declined by 2% in nominal terms from 2007 to 2008, with a 5.7% decrease adjusted for inflation. Foundation grants showed more stability in giving despite asset value losses. Different types of charities were affected differently, with religious giving increasing by 1.6% and public society benefit organizations also seeing an increase. Public society benefit organizations, including United Way, Jewish funds, and donor-advised funds, experienced a decline in giving during the recent recession. Foundations saw the largest decline, but their giving to other organizations remained stable. Human services had the greatest drop in contributions, while education, health, arts, and environment also experienced declines. International affairs had a smaller drop than average. Nonprofit organizations receiving charitable contributions also have other revenue sources. In 2005, public charities received charitable contributions as a share of total revenue, with health care sector receiving approximately 2% and arts, culture, and humanities organizations receiving about 43%. Nonprofit institutions may be resilient to cyclical pressures, and charitable giving is linked to endowments. Charitable organizations and giving are linked to endowments, which can be a source of funds in difficult times. The National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) tracks endowment sizes of colleges and universities. In 2008, there was a 0.5% rise in asset values, followed by a 22.9% decline from July to November. Foundations experienced a 28% drop in asset value in 2008, with total foundation assets estimated at $682 billion in 2007. In 2007, community foundation assets were $56 billion, with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation holding $39 billion. The top 10 foundations had $112 billion in assets. Charities in 2006 held $2.2 trillion in assets, with health-related organizations holding $867 billion and educational institutions holding $682 billion, half of which were in endowments. University endowments grew to $837 billion. In 2007, university endowments grew to $837 billion, surpassing charitable contributions for colleges and universities. The loss of asset value may lead to reduced individual giving, particularly from high-income donors. High-income donors are more likely to contribute to health, education, and arts nonprofits, as well as foundations, and less likely to donate to religious and human welfare organizations. As asset values decline, charitable contributions are expected to decrease. Annual data for 2009 is unavailable, but surveys have been conducted on how charities are faring. The National Council of Nonprofits published a report indicating that nonprofits are facing increased demand for services and decreasing revenue. More than a third of nonprofits have had to cut operations, with reduced government support being a major issue. State support is primarily falling, leading to funding cuts and delayed payments for contracted services. The National Council of Nonprofits reported that 35% of respondents experienced declines in government support and 37% faced delayed payments. Additional funds for charitable activities were provided in the 2009 federal stimulus plan, channeled through state and local governments. However, state governments may be contributing to financial difficulties for nonprofit organizations by not paying for contracted services. Various charitable activities are subsidized by the federal tax code or government grants, justified by economic theories on market failures. Government intervention in the charitable sector is justified by market failures such as public goods and externalities. Public goods are non-rival and non-excludable, leading to insufficient provision in the free market. Externalities occur when market participants do not bear the full cost or benefit of their actions. Public goods, like clean air, are unlikely to be provided by the market due to the free-rider problem. Individuals may wait for others to contribute, leading to insufficient provision. However, some public goods may be provided by the private market if demand is high enough. Once provided, public goods are available for all to enjoy. Individuals tend to give more towards providing public goods than standard economic models predict. Individuals tend to give more towards providing public goods than economic models predict, driven by altruism and the warm glow model. This motivates people to donate time and money to various causes like religious organizations, disaster relief, and educational institutions. Economists believe public goods are underprovided due to individuals not considering positive external effects of their contributions. Redistribution can benefit society as a whole, but market alone may not achieve optimal levels. Government intervention can help by subsidizing charitable activities to increase overall well-being. The government supports charitable organizations providing public goods through grants and tax breaks. Government intervention in the charitable sector is also justified by positive externalities, such as education benefiting society beyond the individual. The government supports charitable organizations through grants and tax breaks to promote public goods and positive externalities. Nonprofit hospitals in the US qualify for tax-exempt status by providing charity care and community benefits. Nonprofit hospitals in the US qualify for tax-exempt status by providing charity care and community benefits. However, there is debate over whether the benefits provided by these institutions justify the tax advantages they receive. Some argue that since hospital services are not a public good, hospitals should not receive the same tax benefits as other charitable organizations. Nonprofit hospitals in the US provide higher levels of uncompensated care, emergency room care, and labor and delivery care compared to for-profit hospitals. However, they offer less Medicaid care. The value of community benefits provided by nonprofit hospitals is uncertain, raising questions about the justification for their tax-exempt status. The government supports nonprofits through grants, transfers, and tax benefits, with federal initiatives focusing on social innovation involving nonprofits. Payments and grants from the government are a significant source of revenue for nonprofits, although the importance varies by organization type. The government provides significant support to the charitable and nonprofit sector through grants and tax subsidies, with estimates ranging from $245 billion to $280 billion. Federal tax subsidies amount to $115 billion to $130 billion, while state and local tax subsidies are around $30 billion to $50 billion. Nonprofit and charitable organizations benefit from tax exemptions on most income, including investment income, with the federal government overseeing charities mainly due to the tax benefits provided. Recent legislation has established a social innovation fund and the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation to coordinate efforts in the nonprofit sector. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act enacted in 2009 created a social innovation fund administered by the Corporation for National and Community Service, with a budget request for $50 million. A budget request for $50 million has been submitted for volunteer initiatives like VISTA. The White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation has been established to coordinate these efforts, aiming to develop partnerships with the private sector, support innovative ideas like the Harlem Children's Zone, and promote national service. Foundations differ from operating charities as they often have a single donor, and donations are made from earnings to maintain and grow the foundation. Tax laws require foundations to have a minimum payout rate of 5% to prevent indefinite growth. Penalties are imposed for self-dealing, failure to distribute income, risky investments, and taxable expenditures. Foundations face a 1% tax on investment income and an additional penalty for not meeting minimum distribution requirements. In recent years, concerns have been raised about charitable vehicles that have some of the same features as foundations: donor-advised funds and supporting organizations. Donor-advised funds are funds where donors make contributions to the fund and the institution holding the accounts makes contributions to charitable organizations with the advice of the donor. Supporting organizations do not actively engage in charitable activities but support organizations that do by contributing funds. Donor-advised funds and supporting organizations, similar to private foundations, have historically not been subject to certain restrictions. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 imposed regulatory requirements and mandated a Treasury study to evaluate their tax-exempt status due to concerns about potential abuses and lack of charitable payouts. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 imposed regulatory requirements on donor-advised funds and supporting organizations to evaluate their tax-exempt status. Donor-advised funds are prohibited from providing benefits to donors and must have a governance structure for grants to individuals. Contributions of closely held businesses must be sold quickly. Supporting organizations must specify their type, and some type III organizations will eventually have a minimum payout requirement. The Treasury Secretary will determine the details of this requirement, with a proposed 5% rate pending comments. Donor-advised funds currently do not have a payout requirement. Endowments share characteristics with foundations, with deductions for contributions made in advance and tax-exempt earnings. There is no payout requirement for endowments, but concerns have been raised about the growth of university endowments and discussions on possible payout requirements. Senate Finance Committee hearings in 2007 addressed the use of offshore hedge funds by major university endowments and whether they were avoiding taxes. Witnesses also discussed the relationship between endowments and affordability in universities and colleges. A small increase in payouts from universities' large endowments could prevent tuition hikes and boost student aid. The Senate Finance Committee surveyed colleges with over $500 million endowments for more information. While charitable deductions are available to all taxpayers, those who take the standard deduction may not utilize this benefit. Individual taxpayers can deduct up to 50% of their income for most charities, but only 30% for certain nonprofits. Individuals can contribute property and cash to foundations and institutions for the benefit of members. Contributions of appreciated assets have favorable treatment, with the value deductible without including capital gains in income subject to tax. Gifts of appreciated property are limited to 30% of a donor's adjusted gross income for general charitable donations and 20% for organizations with more restricted giving limits. Deductions for inventory property used in a business are generally limited to production cost. Costs of volunteering for charitable purposes can also be deducted, including out-of-pocket expenditures. In addition to deducting costs of volunteering for charitable purposes, individuals can deduct out-of-pocket expenditures, vehicle costs, and travel expenses without a significant personal element. Volunteers can deduct 14 cents per mile for operating an automobile, which is lower than rates for medical and moving purposes (24 cents) and business purposes (55 cents). Corporate contributions are generally limited to 10% of taxable income, with enhanced deductions for donations of food inventory to organizations serving the needy. Temporary provisions, known as extenders, also exist in the tax code. The tax code includes temporary provisions, known as extenders, that provide more generous tax treatment for certain contributions. The most significant extender is the IRA rollover provision, allowing individuals aged 70\u00bd to contribute to charity directly from their retirement plans without including the distribution in income. This benefits non-itemizers and helps lower adjusted gross income triggering certain provisions like the taxation of social security benefits. Challenges in administering the charitable deduction tax provision include lack of third-party reporting to verify deductions and concerns about valuations of property, including gifts of vehicles and household furniture. Recent legislative initiatives have increased recordkeeping requirements and placed restrictions on non-cash charitable contributions, including gifts of vehicles and household furniture. The cost of the tax exemption for investment income for nonprofits is estimated at $45 billion based on data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The lack of tax on earnings of nonprofit organizations is not considered a tax expenditure, and estimates of the cost of this provision are not provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The estimate does not include net rent or some capital gains income of religious organizations. Data from Form 990 shows $170 billion income in FY2006, resulting in a $60 billion revenue loss at a 35% rate. Charitable organizations with contributions deductible under 501(c)(3) accounted for 55% of investment income, with foundations at 32%. Half of the investment income went to the education sector, with a significant portion in higher education, and about 30% in the health category. University endowment income increased before declining during the recession, with total increases of $88 billion in FY2007. During the recession, university endowments saw total increases of $88 billion in FY2007, with 30% projected as unrealized capital gains. Income reached about $53 billion, compared to $34 billion the previous year. However, earnings fell sharply as the economy declined. Estimates suggest endowment income could have been $55 billion in 2009 with a normal growth rate, or closer to $70 billion using Form 990 data. Exempting this income from taxation would cost more than the charitable contribution deduction of approximately $50 billion. Asset income estimates cover foundations, supporting organizations, and endowments, excluding donor-advised funds. Investment income varies across different types of charitable organizations. On average, charities report that investment income is less than 7% of revenue. However, for higher education and supporting organizations, that portion of income is close to 20%. In the arts, culture, and humanities sector, investment income is 9%, but less than 3% for environment, animals, health, human services, and international organizations. Health organizations rely more on fees for services rather than investment income. In the education sector, investment income is about twice as large as charitable contributions. Investment income for nonprofits varies by sector, with education having twice as much income as charitable contributions. Tax provisions like bonus depreciation and health insurance relief do not benefit nonprofits due to their tax-exempt status. Table 14 shows the estimated cost of provisions benefiting the charitable sector, with tax savings from deducting charitable contributions. The tax savings from deducting charitable contributions in the charitable sector is estimated at approximately $50 billion, with the majority reflecting deductions for individual income tax. There are also provisions for nonprofit educational institutions and hospitals to issue tax-exempt bonds, and exemptions for housing allowances of ministers from tax. Additionally, there is a charitable contribution deduction for the estate tax estimated at $4.3 billion. The value of charitable contribution subsidies is separately estimated for education and health sectors, with 14% accruing to education and 9% to health-oriented charities. Foundations give a larger share to education and health, accounting for 13% of contributions. Higher-income individuals, who itemize deductions, contribute more to education, health, and the arts, but less to religious organizations and basic needs. For example, households with income over $1 million provide 59.1% of charitable giving to health. The 0.2% of households with income over $1 million is responsible for 20.3% of total giving, with a focus on health. Higher-income individuals contribute more to education, health, and arts, but less to religious organizations and basic needs. Bequests are disproportionately given to education, health, and arts and culture, with foundations giving a larger share to education and health. State and local governments provide benefits to nonprofits through mechanisms such as grants and tax subsidies, including income and estate tax provisions, property tax exemptions, and sales tax exemptions. These subsidies aim to support charities and nonprofit organizations. State and local governments provide tax subsidies to nonprofit organizations, including income taxes, property tax exemptions, sales tax exemptions, and state inheritance taxes. The property tax exemption offers the most significant tax savings, especially for organizations with substantial real property assets like churches, educational institutions, housing nonprofits, and art museums. The value of these subsidies is challenging to determine due to variations in state tax systems and revenue sources. State and local governments provide tax subsidies to nonprofit organizations, including income subsidies and sales tax exemptions, totaling $30 billion to $50 billion. Government grants may displace individual contributions or lead to more private contributions, with crowd-out being a key issue for policymakers. Crowd-out is expected to be partial, impacting the government's spending on increasing the supply of public goods. Most economists expect crowd-out to be partial, where government spending on public goods may lead to a decrease in private funding. Empirical evidence on crowd-out effects is mixed, with some studies showing partial crowding-out and others showing crowding-in. Despite inconsistent findings, trends are emerging in understanding crowd-out dynamics. Some trends are emerging in understanding crowd-out dynamics. Crowding-out varies by charity type, with crowd-out found for public radio, shelter, and human services, and crowd-in found for crime and legal-related charities. Government grants can crowd-in donations for libraries, hospitals, scientific research, and higher education. Crowding-out also depends on levels of support and the source of funding, with theaters experiencing crowding-in with low public support and crowding-out with higher government support. Recent research suggests that government support can have a crowding-in effect on charitable activity, especially at the federal level. However, local support may initially crowd in at low levels but start to crowd out at higher levels. Policymakers should consider the possibility of crowding-out when trying to boost charitable activity. Government grants can lead to reduced fundraising efforts by charities, which may have a greater impact than crowding out private donations. Private contributions and fundraising efforts in the arts increased when government funding was cut. Fund-raising efforts in the arts increased when government funding was cut. This may have implications for policy, suggesting that government grants to charitable organizations could be tied to increased fund-raising efforts. Alternatively, grants could include a clause requiring organizations to maintain their fund-raising efforts. Increased private funding can help mitigate the loss of government funding for charities. Collaboration between government and charities can be efficient, with outside organizations sometimes better suited to provide goods and services. The government may find it more cost-effective to partner with nonprofit and charitable organizations to provide goods and services, as these organizations may have better community insights and a focus on quality services rather than profit. This collaboration can be efficient and not crowd out private support, especially as social welfare spending by governments has increased in recent decades. Government funding of nonprofits or charitable activities can serve as a signal of institutional quality, leading to an increase in private funding as well. This phenomenon, known as crowding-in, has been observed empirically. While there is debate on whether government spending crowds out or crowds in private giving, empirical literature suggests that government support can be beneficial for nonprofit and charitable organizations. Government support can either complement or substitute private funding, depending on circumstances like initial funding levels and government spending sources. Targeted government grants to the charitable sector should consider potential crowding effects. The impact of tax subsidies on charitable giving depends on inducing additional donations. Policymakers should understand the effectiveness of tax incentives in stimulating charitable contributions. The relationship between charitable giving and tax subsidies depends on the price elasticity of giving, defined as the percentage change in quantity given divided by the percentage change in price (tax rate). Elasticities are expected to be negative, indicating that an increase in the price of giving (decrease in tax rate) leads to decreased giving. If the elasticity is less than one, induced giving may be less than the cost of the deduction, potentially generating more funds for the charitable sector. The price elasticity of charitable giving by living individuals suggests that a dollar of revenue loss induces $0.50 of giving, with a central estimate of 0.5. The $50 billion loss from itemized deductions is expected to induce increased giving of $25 billion. Giving from estates is affected by the estate tax rate and the wealth of individuals, with the price elasticity in giving from estates being greater than one. The price elasticity in giving from estates is greater than one, suggesting that charitable organizations receive more giving than the revenue loss from tax deductions. Revenue losses from estate deductions are around $4 billion annually. Various policy issues are considered, stemming from legislative proposals, current debates, and report findings. Nonprofit executives indicate their top policy priorities through the Johns Hopkins Listening post project survey. The Johns Hopkins Listening post project surveyed nonprofit executives in various sectors, revealing top priorities such as restoration of federal funds, tax incentives for charitable giving, federal grant support for training, and reform of reimbursements under healthcare programs. Other proposals included tax incentives for volunteering, student loan forgiveness for nonprofit workers, and estate tax restoration. The nonprofit sector's priorities include restoration of federal funds, tax incentives for charitable giving, federal grant support for training, reform of reimbursements under healthcare programs, tax incentives for volunteering, student loan forgiveness for nonprofit workers, and estate tax restoration. Other proposals include expansion of national service programs, replacement of charitable contribution deduction with tax credits, and clarifying the community benefits standard for nonprofit hospitals. The Independent Sector, representing the charitable community, has proposed various policy reforms including tax incentives for charitable giving, health insurance tax credits, and training funds for small nonprofits. They also suggested specific tax proposals such as extending IRA rollover provision and revising the excise tax on foundation income. Loan forgiveness for nonprofit workers was also recommended. The Independent Sector proposed various policy reforms for nonprofits, including loan forgiveness, scholarships for service, training assistance, relief from funding obligations, lobbying rule modifications, and access to healthcare subsidies. They also suggested revising anti-terrorism restrictions to encourage international charity. The government is urged to consider the effectiveness and efficiency of nonprofits in relation to government funding. Suggestions include improving governance and skills, collecting comprehensive data, and addressing legislative proposals on tax treatment of charitable contributions. Assessing the adequacy of federal grants for nonprofits is challenging but essential. The government is advised to evaluate the efficiency of nonprofits compared to government funding, considering factors like crowding-out effects and the effectiveness of subsidies tied to specific charity features. This assessment should be done on a project-by-project basis to determine the most efficient approach. The government can assess the desirability of activities through tax subsidies and grants, with a focus on education and arts. Evidence suggests crowding-in with grants. However, recent data shows the government spends more than a dollar to induce an additional dollar in charitable contributions. Policies should aim to maximize revenue for nonprofits with minimal cost. Automatic subsidies triggered by contributions or investment income require no administrative oversight. Some argue that the federal government may need to provide a general subsidy for charities, considering the difficulty in judging the value of different options. Proposals for reform could impact funding levels and sources for charities, such as taxing investment income for charitable organizations like university endowments. However, determining the best use of such revenue, like aiding poor students or funding research grants, is challenging in practice. The consequences of new initiatives in the charitable sector can vary and should be considered. One proposal is to forgive student loans for nonprofit sector employees, which could favor charities with younger, less experienced workers. Another proposal is to establish a federal oversight agency to support the nonprofit sector. A federal oversight agency could support the nonprofit sector by conducting research, data collection, advocacy, and providing information on foundations, grant applications, and donor-advised funds. It could also offer outreach efforts, training, grants, and low-interest loans to assist small nonprofits with organization management. An oversight agency for the nonprofit sector could provide federal grants for training and capacity building, low-interest loans, and represent nonprofits' interests. The agency could address issues such as research, data collection, advocacy, and improved oversight. An oversight agency for the nonprofit sector could potentially provide federal grants and loans, but the costs would be relatively small compared to tax subsidies and grants. The Small Business Administration's budget in FY2009 was $923 million, with a significant portion allocated to loan guarantees and disaster loans. It is important to consider that other organizations and educational institutions can also provide information on the charitable sector. The charitable sector can benefit from more efficient data collection and analysis by other organizations and educational institutions rather than creating a government agency. An alternative to an executive agency could be a congressional committee or agency focused on advocating for the nonprofit sector's health. During economic downturns, the nonprofit sector faces challenges that need to be addressed. During economic downturns, foundations can play a stabilizing role by increasing grants or maintaining current levels. One policy option is to remove tax impediments that discourage foundations from making large one-time grants. Currently, foundations face an additional 1% tax on investment income if their payout ratio falls from one year to the next. Removing this disincentive could encourage more direct funding to nonprofits as economic stimulus. To address disincentives in foundation investment, altering excise tax treatment to a single rate could help. Allowing foundations to carryforward excess payouts for future use or providing a refundable credit during recessions could help smooth giving during economic downturns. Incentives should be put in place to prevent funding cuts to nonprofit organizations during crises. To prevent funding cuts to nonprofits, incentives like setting up a fund to maintain funding levels and timely payments could be implemented. An advocacy agency in the federal government could help monitor state support and contract payments, potentially offering low-cost loans for cash flow issues. The federal government may provide low-cost loans to states or nonprofits for cash flow stresses. The main goal of a government stimulus in a recession is to boost spending through monetary expansion and fiscal policies like direct spending or tax cuts. Stimulus money may not flow quickly and effectively through charities to increase demand for goods and services during recessions. Stimulus funds may not flow efficiently through charities to meet increased demand and provide economic stimulus. Eligibility issues limit which organizations can receive funds, leading to disbursement based on formulas rather than individual identification. Existing nonprofits are more likely to effectively stimulate the economy than new organizations. During economic downturns, government policies can target specific groups impacted by the slowdown, such as through expanded unemployment payments. Nonprofits, lacking automatic funding mechanisms, could receive stimulus funds through established policies during times of distress. Nonprofits could benefit from government funds through pre-registration for expedited grant processes. Stimulus funds to state and local governments may indirectly support nonprofits. Investment subsidies could be extended to nonprofits through tax forms. The government could provide subsidies to nonprofits through tax forms, based on factors like number of employees or wages. Proposals have been made regarding itemized deductions for charitable contributions, including a recent proposal to cap all deductions. However, a report suggested that the impact on charities would be minimal, as evidence shows that the response of charitable contributions to tax incentives is small. Recent evidence suggests that charitable contribution deductions are not very efficient, with the government spending more than a dollar to induce a dollar of contributions. High-income taxpayers, who tend to claim the deduction, are favored by the current system. Suggestions have been made to allow all taxpayers to deduct charitable contributions or convert the deduction to a credit available to everyone, which could be designed to be revenue neutral. A potential policy option to address the issue of charitable contributions favoring higher-income individuals is to impose a floor on deductions. This could involve only allowing deductions for charitable contributions exceeding 2% of adjusted gross income, making it available to all taxpayers. This change could increase revenue and efficiency without significantly impacting charitable giving. According to the Congressional Budget Offices Options Report, a 2% floor on charitable contributions could raise $22 billion annually over the next 10 years. Lower-income individuals may have smaller price elasticities, with many donations going to religious organizations. Extending the deduction for non-itemizers may cost more than it generates, and converting to a credit could impact charitable contributions. This section addresses various tax issues related to charitable contributions and organizations. The tax system provides incentives for businesses but excludes nonprofits due to their tax-exempt status. Stimulus proposals and health reform bills offer tax credits for small businesses, but nonprofits receive no assistance. However, a separate credit or grant could be provided for nonprofits. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes a 35% credit for small nonprofits to provide health insurance for low-income employees. The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions proposal does not use the tax system for health insurance subsidies. The tax system provides incentives for businesses but excludes nonprofits due to their tax-exempt status. Stimulus proposals and health reform bills offer tax credits for small businesses, but nonprofits receive no assistance. However, a separate credit or grant could be provided for nonprofits. Job tax credits could be credited against payroll taxes for nonprofits. Donor-advised funds and supporting organizations face issues related to private benefits by donors and payout rates. While some changes have been made, others are still possible, with no payout requirements for donor-advised funds and certain supporting organizations. The Treasury is studying issues related to deductions for contributions to donor-advised funds and supporting organizations, including distribution requirements and completion of gifts. Legislative changes may impose payout requirements on college endowments. This could have implications for charities in general. The Treasury is considering changes that may affect deductions for charitable gifts, including imposing payout requirements on university endowments. One proposal is to only allow the deduction of the basis of the property, rather than the fair market value, which could generate $2 billion annually. Another option is for taxpayers to sell assets and donate the proceeds to charity to avoid capital gains tax. Alternative valuation methods like \"baseball arbitration\" have also been suggested. Some in Congress are interested in nonprofit hospitals and their tax-exempt status. Concerns have been raised about the level of charity care provided by these hospitals. Hearings have been held to discuss the issue, with concerns including establishing and publicizing charity care. The IRS released a report on nonprofit hospitals in July 2007, revealing that the median share of revenue spent on charity care was 3.9%. Concerns have been raised about the lack of precise definition for the \"community benefit\" standard that nonprofit hospitals must meet to maintain tax-exempt status. Several charitable provisions, including the IRA rollover deductions, are temporary and up for debate on whether to extend, make permanent, or expand. Charitable organizations have concerns about retaining the estate tax, with President Obama proposing to maintain it permanently at current rates and exemptions. Empirical evidence suggests that tax incentives impact bequests more than lifetime giving and charitable contributions. The impact of tax incentives on bequests is greater than on lifetime giving, potentially leading to a decrease in charitable contributions. The efficiency of the charitable deduction for estate taxes depends on the retention of the estate tax and its features. Data on revenue sources for charitable organizations is presented in Table A-1, which was used to create Figure 5 in the text."
