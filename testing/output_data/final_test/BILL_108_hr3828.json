The Congress acknowledges the decline in US university nuclear science, engineering, and health programs, leading to a shortage of professionals. The number of nuclear engineering programs has decreased by 50%, with a majority of faculty being 45 years or older. Additionally, universities struggle to fund research and training reactors, resulting in a 50% decline in small training reactors since 1980. The United States has seen a decline in nuclear reactors by over 50%, most of which were built in the late 1950's and 1960's. This decline is impacting the country's ability to address future nuclear challenges, including waste storage, reactor operation, and nuclear event response. The lack of investment in human resources and training programs is hindering the development of a competent nuclear workforce. Future neglect in the Nation's investment in human resources for the nuclear sciences will lead to a downward spiral as departments shrink, faculties age, and training reactors close. Current projections show a significant percentage of the nuclear workforce retiring soon, highlighting the urgent need for a new supply of trained scientists and engineers. The Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy, Science, and Technology is crucial in maintaining tomorrow's human resource and training investment in the nuclear sciences. The Office of Nuclear Energy, Science, and Technology supports research and development in nuclear sciences. It funds basic and applied collaborative research, refuels training reactors, and maintains a program for student training. The Office of Nuclear Energy, Science, and Technology supports research and development in nuclear sciences, funds collaborative research, refuels training reactors, and maintains a program of student fellowships for nuclear science, engineering, and health physics. The Department of Energy program supports research and development in nuclear sciences, collaborative research, training reactors, and student fellowships. The Secretary of Energy will establish a program to invest in human resources and infrastructure in nuclear sciences, engineering, and health physics fields. This includes creating fellowship programs for students, grants for recruiting new faculty, and supporting research in these areas. The Education Research Program aims to promote collaborative nuclear research and training, support communication and outreach in nuclear science, engineering, and health physics. Activities include converting research reactors to low-enrichment fuels, upgrading instrumentation, providing technical assistance for relicensing and upgrading training reactors, and funding innovations in nuclear. The program aims to promote collaborative nuclear research and training, support communication and outreach in nuclear science, engineering, and health physics. It includes providing funding for reactor improvements, developing sabbatical fellowship and visiting scientist programs for professors and National Laboratory staff, and offering fellowships for students to spend time at National Laboratories in nuclear areas. The program offers funding for research projects at higher education institutions involving nuclear science, engineering, and health physics. Grants require independent merit review and can be used to offset operating costs of research reactors. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
