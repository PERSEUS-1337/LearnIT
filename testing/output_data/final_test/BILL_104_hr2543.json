    "content": "The \"Tuition Tax Deduction Act of 1995\" allows for a deduction for tuition and fees for undergraduate and postsecondary vocational education under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Tuition Tax Deduction Act of 1995\" allows individuals to deduct qualified educational expenses paid to eligible institutions, limited to $5,000 per year. Qualified expenses include tuition and fees required for enrollment at an educational institution. The portion of expenses attributable to meals, lodging, or similar expenses must be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. An institution must certify to the Secretary that it is an eligible educational institution to be treated as such for any academic year. The percentage increase in tuition for an academic year will not exceed the applicable percentage increase in the cost-of-living. The percentage increase in tuition is the difference in tuition and fees between the current and previous academic years. The applicable percentage increase in cost-of-living is the percentage change in living expenses for the academic year. The CPI for any academic year is determined by the percentage difference in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) between the last calendar year and the calendar year before it. Special rules apply for adjusting qualified educational expenses by reducing amounts received from scholarships and veterans benefits. The text discusses the exclusion of certain amounts received by an individual, such as qualified scholarships and educational assistance allowances, from being considered as qualified educational expenses for tax purposes. Amounts paid for educational expenses are only eligible if they are for courses that lead to a recognized degree or certificate at an institution of higher education or vocational school. The deduction for qualified educational expenses is only allowed if the individual is at least a half-time student and not part of a graduate program. Additionally, the taxpayer must be carrying at least half the normal full-time workload for the course of study pursued. No deduction is allowed for taxpayers who are dependents of another taxpayer. The deduction for qualified educational expenses is allowed for a taxpayer if they are not a dependent of another person for the taxable year. No deduction is allowed for the spouse unless the taxpayer is entitled to an exemption for the spouse or files a joint return. This section does not apply to deductions allowable without regard to this section. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations for this section, allowing a deduction for tuition and related expenses. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. Sec. 220 outlines tuition and fees for undergraduate and postsecondary vocational education, while Sec. 221 provides a cross-reference. The amendments made by this section will apply to payments made after December 31, 1995, for education provided after that date."
