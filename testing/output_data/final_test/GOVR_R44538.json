    "content": "The Family First Prevention Services Act of 2016 amends child welfare programs to provide federal support for services to prevent children from entering foster care and restrict support for children in group settings. It also extends funding for child and family services programs and revises the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program. The Family First Prevention Services Act of 2016 amends child welfare programs under Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act to support youth in foster care transitioning to adulthood. Administered by the Children's Bureau, these programs aim to help all youth in foster care make a successful transition. States, territories, and tribes with a federally approved Title IV-E plan receive federal support for providing assistance to eligible children. The Title IV-E program provides federal support for eligible children in foster care, including those who are adopted or placed in kinship guardianship. The federal share of program costs ranges from 50% to 83%. Children must be removed from low-income homes and placed in licensed foster care to be eligible. States must make \"reasonable efforts\" to prevent children from entering foster care. The Title IV-E program provides federal support for eligible children in foster care, adoption, and guardianship. States are prohibited from using funds for counseling or treatment. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and seven tribes have an HHS-approved Title IV-E plan. The federal cost for FY2016 was $7.6 billion, with $4.8 billion for foster care and $2.8 billion for adoption and guardianship. Under Title IV-B, states, territories, and tribes receive federal funds to ensure children's safety and well-being. Title IV-B programs support families and children in foster care, promoting reunification and adoption. There are no federal eligibility criteria for services, with funding provided on a capped mandatory and discretionary basis. States receive 75% federal funding, with a requirement to match $1 in non-federal funds for every $3 in federal funds. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and additional territories receive Title IV-B funding. In FY2016, Congress allocated $668 million for Title IV-B programs. In FY2016, $575 million in formula grants and $93 million for specified programs were allocated under Title IV-B funding authorities. This included funding for the Court Improvement Program, Regional Partnership Grants, Monthly Caseworker Visit grants, and research activities. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) is authorized under Section 477 of the Social Security Act, providing funds to states, territories, and tribes for services to children aging out of foster care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides services to help children aging out of foster care transition to adulthood. Education and Training Vouchers (ETVs) are also available for eligible youth to cover higher education costs. Funding is provided on a capped entitlement basis with a required state match of non-federal funds. The Family First Prevention Services Act (H.R. 5456) introduced in 2016 allocated $183 million in federal funding for the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) and Education and Training Vouchers (ETVs). The bill was supported by Representative Vern Buchanan and passed by the House Ways and Means Committee. Senator Hatch also endorsed the bill. On June 16, 2016, Senator Hatch introduced the Senate companion to the Family First Prevention Services Act (S. 3065). On June 21, 2016, the full House passed H.R. 5456 with strong support from various stakeholders, including child welfare advocacy groups, substance abuse treatment providers, pediatricians, social workers, and courts. The bill has received praise from over 50 national, state, and local organizations and agencies. The bill would authorize new open-ended Title IV-E support for evidence-based mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services, in-home parent skill-based programs, and foster care prevention activities for children at risk of entering foster care. States can use funds to support kinship navigator programs and provide foster care maintenance payments for children placed with their parents in residential treatment facilities. The bill authorizes new Title IV-E support for mental health and substance abuse treatment, parenting programs, and foster care prevention. It allows funding for children placed in residential treatment facilities with their parents, without income tests. However, Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments will be restricted for children not in foster family homes unless for clinical needs, limited to two weeks in non-family settings. The bill aims to amend the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program to extend support for youth in foster care up to age 23 and access to education and training vouchers up to age 26. It also focuses on serving youth who have experienced foster care at age 14 or older and supports their transition to adulthood. Additionally, the Family First Prevention Services Act extends funding for programs like Title IV-B and Child Welfare Services. The bill, H.R. 5456, proposes changes to child welfare services programs, extending authority for various grants and programs to support children and families in foster care. It includes provisions to increase adoption rates and guardianship incentives. The bill is estimated to reduce federal spending by $66 million over the next 10 years. The bill, H.R. 5456, proposes changes to child welfare services programs, including increasing adoption rates and guardianship incentives. CBO estimates a total 10-year increase in direct federal spending for the Title IV-E program of $1.574 billion, offset by reductions in spending under the same program. This includes funding for foster care prevention services, kinship navigator programs, technical assistance, Court Improvement Program, and competitive grants for retention and recruitment of foster care. The bill, H.R. 5456, aims to increase adoption rates and guardianship incentives in child welfare services programs. CBO estimates a 10-year increase in direct federal spending for the Title IV-E program by $1.574 billion, offset by reductions in spending. This includes funding for foster care prevention services, kinship navigator programs, technical assistance, Court Improvement Program, and competitive grants for retention and recruitment of foster parents. The bill would limit direct federal spending under the Title IV-E program by $1.640 billion over the same period, with reductions expected in foster care maintenance payments and Medicaid spending. Additionally, there would be a delay in the full phaseout of an income test for Title IV-E adoption assistance eligibility, resulting in reduced federal spending for adoption assistance. The bill, H.R. 5456 / S. 3065, allows states to use federal funds from Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act to support children and families and prevent foster care placements. It amends the Title IV-E program to provide open-ended federal support for services that help children stay safely at home or with kin caregivers. States and tribes have the option to use Title IV-E for prevention activities like mental health and substance abuse services, parent skill-based programs, and counseling. Title IV-E prevention services and programs can be provided for up to 12 months to children at risk of entering foster care, pregnant or parenting youth in foster care, and their parents/kin caregivers. No income test is required. Mental health and substance abuse services, as well as in-home parent skill-based programs, must be trauma-informed, included in a prevention plan, and meet specific criteria to receive Title IV-E support. Title IV-E prevention services require reliable studies to show superiority in achieving improved child and parent outcomes. States must include a prevention component in their HHS-approved plan, detailing monitoring, services provided, intended outcomes, and evaluation methods. The state must continuously monitor and evaluate its provision of prevention services, train child welfare workers effectively, and update the prevention component every five years for HHS approval. Data on children receiving services must be reported to ensure maintenance of effort spending. Title IV-E support for promising prevention services starts in FY2020. Beginning in FY2020, federal support for Title IV-E prevention services in states would be 50% of the total cost, increasing to the state's FMAP starting in FY2026. The FMAP varies annually from 50% to 83% based on state income levels. There is no income test for claiming federal support, but at least 50% of spending must be on well-supported practices. The Title IV-E prevention services and programs spending must be for well-supported practices to be eligible for federal reimbursement. Federal support for program administration and training related to these services would be available at 50%. States choosing this option must maintain spending levels for foster care prevention services at FY2014 levels as a requirement. HHS would determine foster care prevention services under various programs, including Title IV-B, TANF, and SSBG. Tribes with approved Title IV-E plans can offer similar prevention programs. HHS must specify requirements for tribes, consistent with state measures, allowing culturally adapted services. HHS would issue guidance to states by October 1, 2018, with a pre-approved list of services meeting Title IV-E prevention criteria. Technical assistance and a public clearinghouse for research would be provided to support implementation of these services. Research and data collection would assess the impact of Title IV-E prevention services on reducing foster care placement and improving child outcomes. The bill aims to reduce foster care placement, promote kinship care, and enhance child well-being. It requires HHS to provide reports to congressional committees and allocate $1 million annually for these efforts. Starting in FY2021, HHS must establish performance measures for Title IV-E prevention services, focusing on cost and the percentage of at-risk children who avoid entering foster care. The bill allows for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payment support for a child placed with a parent in a licensed residential family-based treatment facility for up to 12 months. The child must be recommended for this placement in their foster care case plan, and the facility must provide trauma-informed parent education and counseling as part of substance abuse treatment. No income test applies for these payments, and the federal support level is based on the state's FMAP. The bill allows for Title IV-E support for kinship navigator programs, which assist relative and kin caregivers in accessing resources. The program must meet certain criteria defined by HHS, and states can claim 50% federal support for these services. There is no income test, and the bill also renames and redefines family reunification services. The bill would rename and redefine time-limited family reunification services under the Title IV-B Promoting Safe and Stable Families program. It would allow these services to be available to a child in foster care and their parents regardless of the child's length of stay in care. Additionally, spending under this service category would be permitted for post-reunification services for the first 15 months after the child returns home. By October 1, 2026, states operating a Title IV-E program must include the use of an electronic interstate case processing system. The bill proposes using an electronic interstate case processing system for Title IV-E programs to facilitate timely placement of children across state lines. It allocates $5 million in FY2017 discretionary funding for the Title IV-B Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program to help states, tribes, and territories connect with the system for safe interstate placements. HHS must report to Congress on states' progress in achieving this goal. The bill requires HHS to assess the use of an electronic interstate case-processing system to improve Title IV-E agencies' ability to conduct background checks for foster and adoptive parents. It also mandates the continuation of regional partnership grants for five years. The bill suggests using Regional Partnership Grants (RPGs) to address the needs of children and families affected by heroin and opioid substance use disorders, implement effective Title IV-E prevention services, and focus on improved outcomes for families. Additionally, every funded partnership must include the state agency administering the federal substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant, and the court handling child welfare cases for children in out-of-home care. The bill proposes using Regional Partnership Grants (RPGs) to address the needs of children and families affected by heroin and opioid substance use disorders. Grants would be dispersed in two phases: planning and implementation, with a maximum annual award of $1 million. The partnerships must include the state agency administering the federal substance abuse prevention grant and the court handling child welfare cases for children in out-of-home care. The bill aims to revise RPG application requirements to focus on improving family well-being and implementing evidence-based prevention services under Title IV-E. Applicants must outline sustainability plans post-funding and may be required to provide additional information. RPGs can still use funds for substance abuse disorder treatment, including medication-assisted and in-home recovery. The bill requires the HHS Secretary to establish core performance indicators for RPG grantees related to child safety, parental recovery, and family well-being. Grantees must provide semi-annual reports on services, progress towards goals, and other necessary information. States must have licensing standards for foster family homes consistent with national recommendations. The bill mandates HHS to establish model standards for licensing foster family homes by October 1, 2017. States must align their licensing standards with these models by April 1, 2018, and provide reasons for any inconsistencies. States can waive non-safety standards for relative foster caregivers, with a requirement to report on the use of this authority by the same deadline. The bill requires states to document steps taken to gather information on child maltreatment deaths and develop a statewide plan to prevent fatalities under the Title IV-B Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services program. States can waive non-safety standards for relative foster caregivers and must report on the use of this authority. The bill requires states to develop a statewide plan to prevent child maltreatment fatalities involving various agencies. It includes renaming Title IV-E to reflect support for adoption, kinship guardianship, and prevention services. Amendments would be effective on October 1, 2016. The amendments regarding licensing standards for foster family homes would be effective on the date of enactment. States, tribes, or tribal entities needing time to comply with new requirements will be granted additional time by HHS. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments for a foster child not placed in a foster family home would only be available if the child met all eligibility criteria. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments would remain available for eligible children placed in various settings such as qualified residential treatment programs, specialized prenatal or parenting support centers, supervised independent living settings, or licensed residential family-based treatment centers. Payments would continue if an assessment within 30 days of placement deems it appropriate. The bill defines a foster family home as the residence of a licensed foster parent providing care for up to six children. States can place more than six children in a foster family home to keep siblings together or accommodate special circumstances. The bill reorganizes the definition of child care institutions for youth in foster care, allowing them to stay with their child, with a family with special skills for children with disabilities, or with established relationships. Child care institutions must meet state licensing standards and may house up to 25 children if public. Children over 18 can be placed in independent living settings meeting HHS standards. The term child care institution for youth in foster care has been redefined to allow them to stay with their family or in specialized settings. Public institutions can house up to 25 children, excluding detention facilities or training schools. A qualified residential treatment program under Title IV-E must have a trauma-informed treatment model, licensed clinical staff available 24/7, and involve outreach to the child's family members. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for a qualified residential treatment program for youth in foster care, including outreach to family members, post-discharge planning, and accreditation. The program must maintain sibling connections and contact information for biological and fictive kin. The Court Improvement Program provides grants to assess and improve the child welfare system at the state level. The bill requires each state to improve handling of child abuse and neglect cases to receive CIP funds. Training on federal child welfare policies is mandatory for judges and attorneys. States must certify that limiting access to Title IV-E payments for foster children in non-family settings won't increase juvenile justice involvement. The bill mandates improvements in the state's juvenile justice system, requiring a report on the impact of limiting Title IV-E for children not in foster homes. States must implement case review procedures for children in foster care, including assessments for those in residential treatment programs. The bill mandates assessments for children in residential treatment programs to determine appropriate placement settings and goals. A family and permanency team must be established for the child, including relatives and other important individuals. The bill requires assessments for children in residential treatment programs to determine appropriate placement settings and goals. It also mandates that the state child welfare agency provide evidence at each foster care status review and permanency hearing to show that the qualified residential treatment program remains the most suitable placement for the child. The bill mandates assessments for children in residential treatment programs to determine appropriate placement settings and goals. States must develop a health oversight plan under the Title IV-B Child Welfare Services program to ensure children are not inappropriately placed in non-family settings due to misdiagnoses. States must also document efforts to prepare children to transition to family settings and submit information to the HHS Secretary for children in qualified residential treatment programs for specific durations. The bill requires HHS to analyze state compliance with diagnosing children in foster care correctly and report to Congress by January 1, 2019. It revises current law on reporting data on foster children's placements and services, including more types of non-family settings and requesting information on gender and race/ethnicity. The bill sets effective dates for provisions related to federal Title IV-E support based on a child's foster care placement setting, with some provisions effective on October 1, 2019, and others on October 1, 2016. States needing to enact legislation for compliance would have additional time to do so. The bill redefines family support services under the Title IV-B program to include community-based services for foster families. It appropriates $8 million in FY2018 for grants to states or tribes to place children in high-quality family settings. Funding is available through FY2022. The bill extends funding authority for the Title IV-B Child Welfare Services program for five years (FY2017-FY2021) at $325 million annually. Mandatory funding is set at $345 million per year and discretionary funding at $200 million per year. Total funding for the program in FY2016 was $381 million.

This includes $60 million in discretionary funding. HHS must reserve $20 million for Monthly Caseworker Visit grants and $20 million for grants to regional partnerships to improve outcomes for children affected by parental substance abuse. Additionally, HHS is required to reserve funding for Court Improvement Program grants. The bill extends funding for the Court Improvement Program (CIP) for five years, distributing funds to eligible state courts and tribes. It also allows states to use Chafee Foster Care Independence Program funding for former foster care recipients up to age 23. The bill would expand services and supports for youth in foster care aged 14 or older, allowing them access to various resources such as education, employment preparation, health services, and life skills training. The bill expands services for youth in foster care aged 14 or older, providing opportunities for daily living skills, connections with caring adults, positive youth development, and experiential learning. Services for children likely to remain in foster care until age 18 are ensured, while former foster care recipients aged 18 to 21 receive financial, housing, counseling, employment, and education support. Services are also available for children who left foster care at age 16 or older for kinship guardianship or adoption. The bill allows HHS to redistribute unspent CFCIP and ETV funds to states and tribes based on the number of children in foster care. It extends eligibility for Chafee ETVs up to age 26, with a limit of five years per youth. The bill would extend eligibility for Chafee ETVs up to age 26, with a limit of five years per youth. It would also rename the program as the John H. Chafee Foster Care Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood and focus on youth development for caregivers and child welfare workers. The bill requires HHS to submit a report on factors related to foster care entry and experiences for 17-year-olds compared to those who left care before age 17. It also analyzes the impact of placement settings and time in foster care on outcomes at ages 19 and 21, provides benchmarks for poor outcomes, and examines the effectiveness of federal foster care support for youth beyond age 18. The bill requires states to provide official documentation to youth aging out of foster care to prove their former status as a child in foster care for eligibility in federal programs. This documentation is necessary for those who have been in foster care for at least 6 months and are being discharged from the system. The bill extends the authority of states to earn Adoption and Legal Guardianship Incentive Payments for five fiscal years, with annual funding of $43 million. Funds can remain available until FY2021. It also revises provisions related to data exchange standards.

It delays the expansion of eligibility for Title IV-E adoption assistance and defines \"special needs\" for the program. The bill delays the expansion of eligibility for Title IV-E adoption assistance for children with special needs under the age of four. Children between two and four years old at the time of adoption agreement would be eligible as of April 1, 2019, and all special needs children would be eligible as of April 1, 2020. A GAO study would assess state compliance with spending requirements for child welfare.
