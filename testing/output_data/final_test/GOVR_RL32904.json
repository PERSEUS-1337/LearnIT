    "content": "After the FY2006 Agriculture Appropriations Act was signed into law, Congress enacted emergency supplemental appropriations for hurricane recovery and pandemic influenza. The agriculture appropriations bill received $1.08 billion for hurricane recovery and $111 million for avian influenza. The supplemental act also included targeted rescissions totaling $66 million to agriculture accounts and a 1% across-the-board rescission to discretionary spending. The regular FY2006 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act was signed into law on November 10, 2005, totaling $100.1 billion, which is $15.0 billion above FY2005 levels. The $100.1 billion FY2006 Agriculture Appropriations Act is $15.0 billion above FY2005 levels, with $17.03 billion in discretionary spending and $83.07 billion for mandatory programs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has various responsibilities through 30 internal agencies and offices with 100,000 employees. USDA spending is not just for farm programs and includes other agencies like the Food and Drug Administration. USDA gross outlays for FY2005 were $100.5 billion, with food mission area having the largest spending at $52.2 billion. The largest mission area in USDA spending for FY2005 was food and nutrition programs, totaling $52.2 billion, which included the food stamp program, child nutrition programs, and WIC. The second-largest area was farm and foreign agricultural services, with $31.1 billion in spending. Other spending included $8.5 billion for natural resource and environment programs, with the majority going to the Forest Service. The USDA's Forest Service is funded through the Interior appropriations bill, unlike other USDA agencies. USDA spending also includes rural development, research and education, marketing and regulatory activities, meat and poultry inspection, and departmental administration. Mandatory and discretionary spending differ in how they are controlled in the budget process. The USDA's spending includes mandatory and discretionary programs. Mandatory programs have specific dollar amounts allocated each year and eligibility is written into law. Discretionary programs are funded through annual appropriations acts. Approximately 80% of USDA spending is classified as mandatory, with the majority going towards food stamps, child nutrition programs, and farm commodity support programs. The USDA's budget includes mandatory programs funded by specific dollar amounts each year and discretionary programs funded through annual appropriations acts. Approximately 80% of the budget is for mandatory programs such as food stamps, child nutrition programs, and farm commodity support programs. The remaining 20% is for discretionary programs, with the exception of the Forest Service which is funded separately. The FY2006 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-97, H.R. 2744) was signed into law on November 10, 2005. It includes USDA (excluding the Forest Service), the Food and Drug Administration, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The act funds various programs such as conservation, rural development, research, education, agricultural credit, WIC, international food aid, meat and poultry inspection, and food marketing and regulatory programs. The House and Senate passed the conference agreement on October 28, 2005. The FY2006 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-97, H.R. 2744) was signed into law on November 10, 2005. The House and Senate passed the conference agreement on October 28, 2005, with votes of 318-63 and 81-18 respectively. The House approved its version on June 8, 2005, by a vote of 408-18, after adopting 10 amendments and deleting three provisions. The Senate approved its version on September 22, 2005, by a vote of 97-2, after adopting 38 amendments. P.L. 109-97 provides for a total of $100.099 billion. The FY2006 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-97) was signed into law on November 10, 2005, with a total budget of $100.099 billion. The discretionary spending is $17.031 billion, while mandatory programs receive $83.068 billion, with most of the increase over FY2005 levels attributed to mandatory programs affected by economic or weather conditions. The discretionary amount is 1.2% above FY2005 levels and slightly lower than the Senate-passed bill. The conference agreement set a discretionary cap of $17.090 billion. The FY2006 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-97) had a total budget of $100.099 billion, with $17.031 billion for discretionary spending and $83.068 billion for mandatory programs. USDA requested increases for the Commodity Credit Corporation and mandatory domestic food assistance programs. Appropriators placed limitations on authorized spending levels for various mandatory conservation, rural development, and research programs. In P.L. 109-97, appropriators reduced authorized FY2006 spending levels for conservation, rural development, and research programs by nearly $1.5 billion. These savings were used to meet the discretionary allocation. Scorekeeping adjustments in the bill included budget authority for $101 billion in programs, exceeding the final cost of $100.1 billion. The agriculture appropriations bill typically includes 600-700 earmarks totaling about $500 million. The appropriations bill typically includes 600-700 earmarks totaling about $500 million, or 3% of the discretionary total. The Senate adopted an amendment to improve earmark transparency, but it was not included in the final bill. The joint explanatory statement allows House and Senate report language to stand unless specifically addressed by conferees. The regular FY2006 Agriculture Appropriations Act does not include specific emergency or disaster funding for hurricane relief. Congress later passed emergency supplemental appropriations for hurricane recovery and pandemic influenza. The regular agriculture appropriations bill allocated $1.08 billion for hurricane recovery and $111 million for avian influenza. The supplemental act provides $1.08 billion for hurricane recovery and $111 million for avian influenza. It also includes targeted rescissions totaling $66 million to agriculture accounts and a 1% across-the-board rescission to discretionary spending. Amounts for agriculture in the hurricane recovery supplemental include $500 million for conservation and watershed protection, $404 million for a forestry conservation reserve program, $118 million for various rural development programs, $10 million for food and nutrition, $35 million for department administration, and $9 million for agricultural research facilities. Amounts for agriculture and related agencies in the pandemic influenza supplemental include $91 million for USDA, $71 million for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and $20 million for the Food and Drug Administration. The targeted rescissions from agriculture accounts include $35 million from foreign food aid. The $170 million across-the-board 1% rescission to USDA discretionary accounts will be prorated across all accounts. The FY2006 budget agreement includes reconciliation instructions for agriculture authorizing committees to find program changes to save $173 million in FY2006 and $3.0 billion over FY2006-FY2010. The budget reconciliation process is separate from the appropriations process. The conference agreement on the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 includes net reductions of $2.7 billion over five years for USDA mandatory programs. This includes reductions in farm commodity support, conservation spending, research programs, and rural development programs. MILC was extended for two years at a cost of $998 million, with no reductions to food stamp spending. Final action is expected shortly after the 109th Congress returns for its second session. The appropriations bill for agriculture and related agencies covers USDA except for the Forest Service, funded through the Interior appropriations bill. Most spending for USDA's mandatory agriculture programs is authorized by the 2002 farm bill and funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation. The CCC can borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury to finance ongoing spending. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) borrows funds from the U.S. Treasury to finance various agriculture programs and emergency supplemental spending. The CCC must repay the borrowed funds and replenish its losses through congressional appropriations to maintain its $30 billion borrowing authority. Funding needs are difficult to estimate due to fluctuating economic and weather conditions. The CCC receives an indefinite appropriation for funding needs, estimated at $25.690 billion for FY2006. This is a $9.2 billion increase from FY2005, tracking net realized losses from the previous year. The appropriation does not reflect expected outlays and is funded initially through borrowing authority. The Administration projects CCC net outlays to be $21.7 billion in FY2006, compared to $19.5 billion in FY2005. Budget reconciliation in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 includes net reductions of $1.7 billion in farm commodity support programs over five years, mainly by changing the timing of direct payments without reducing overall payments to farmers. The conference agreement reduces advance payment rates for farmers from 50% to 40% in 2006 and 22% in 2007. It does not include across-the-board cuts in farm commodity payments but reauthorizes the Milk Income Loss Contract for two years. The agreement also eliminates the upland cotton step-2 program in response to a WTO challenge by Brazil. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offers free catastrophic insurance to producers of insurable crops. Producers can purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate through approved private insurance companies. The annual agriculture appropriations bill provides funding for RMA expenses and the Federal Crop Insurance Fund, which covers premium subsidies and indemnity payments. The federal crop insurance program, funded through the Federal Crop Insurance Fund, includes premium subsidies, indemnity payments, and reimbursements to private insurance companies. The FY2006 budget estimates $3.159 billion for the Fund, subject to revision based on weather conditions and farmer participation rates. Additionally, $77.05 million is allocated for FY2006 RMA salaries and expenses. The final FY2006 budget for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund is $77.8 million, above the Senate-passed level of $73.45 million. It is also above the enacted FY2005 level of $71.47 million but below the Administration's FY2006 request of $87.8 million. The conference level includes $3.6 million for reducing waste and abuse in the crop insurance program. $1 million is allocated for various new IT initiatives, compared to the $12 million requested increase. The final FY2006 budget for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund is $77.8 million, higher than the Senate-passed amount. The bill prohibits the implementation of the premium discount plan for the 2007 reinsurance year and any related regulations or guidance. The plan allows insurance companies to offer discounted policies if they show cost savings. The PDP reduces commissions for independent insurance agents selling crop insurance online, impacting profitability. Some farm groups fear cherry-picking of customers and potential uninsured smaller farmers. Proposed legislative changes in the FY2006 budget aimed to save $140 million annually but were not addressed by Congress. The omnibus budget reconciliation act did not include any modifications to the crop insurance program. The Commodity Credit Corporation funds farm income support and disaster assistance programs, with administration by USDA's Farm Service Agency. FSA also manages farm loan programs, conservation programs, and food assistance programs. Administrative funds are consolidated into one account, including transfers from various programs. For FY2006, P.L. 109-97 allocated funds for program administration and other FSA functions. For FY2006, P.L. 109-97 allocated $1.340 billion for all FSA salaries and expenses, a 3.4% increase from FY2005. The legislation includes language prohibiting the closure of county offices without notifying Congress and holding public meetings. USDA is urged to be cautious in any office closures, following negative reactions to the \"FSA Tomorrow\" plan to close hundreds of offices without consultation. The FY2006 House report expressed concern about USDA's plans to shut down or consolidate FSA county offices without consulting Congress. The Senate took action to prevent office closures unless FSA can prove cost-effectiveness and program improvement. The National Agricultural Imagery Program would receive a $24 million increase in funding. Additional funds were allocated to maintain staffing levels and hire more farm loan officers. The USDA provides farm loans to family farmers as a lender of last resort, offering direct loans and loan guarantees for real estate purchases, operating expenses, and disaster recovery. Some loans have subsidized interest rates, with an annual appropriation covering loan subsidies related to interest rate subsidies and projected losses. Loan authority determines the amount of loans that can be made each year. The USDA provides farm loans to family farmers as a lender of last resort, offering direct loans and loan guarantees for real estate purchases, operating expenses, and disaster recovery. The loan authority for FY2006 is $3.785 billion, with an appropriation of $151.3 million to subsidize the cost. The loan subsidy is 3.4% below FY2005 levels, but the loan authority has increased by 1.8%. The growth in loan authority is mainly due to a $59 million increase in unsubsidized guaranteed farm operating loans. The conference agreement for farm loans in FY2006 adopts higher Senate levels for direct farm ownership loans and adjusts subsidized and unsubsidized guaranteed operating loans. The subsidized guaranteed operating loan program will be reduced by 3% compared to FY2005 due to high demand exceeding available funds. Emergency loan authority requested by the Administration is not funded. The conference report for farm loans in FY2006 does not fund the Administration's request for $25 million in emergency loan authority or the request to reduce the boll weevil eradication loan program by 40%. It notes that sufficient loan authority should exist from carryover funding. Additionally, P.L. 109-97 provides more funds for discretionary conservation programs than the Senate-passed or House-passed bills, with a small increase from the FY2005 appropriation and a substantial increase from the Administration's FY2006 request. The agreement rejects many of the Administration's proposed reductions. The agreement for FY2006 funding rejects many of the Administration's proposed reductions for discretionary programs. Funding for selected mandatory conservation programs will decrease slightly. The largest program, Conservation Operations, receives $839.5 million, an increase from both the Senate and House bills, as well as the FY2005 appropriation. The Administration's request for a reduction was based on not funding earmarks. The conference agreement for FY2006 funding rejects the Administration's proposed reductions for discretionary programs. It includes earmarks totaling over $122 million, with potential savings of $114.3 million in FY2006. The agreement requires a report on earmarked projects by July 1, 2006. Funding for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations is set at $75 million, $15 million more than in the House and Senate bills, but $75 million more than the Administration requested. The conference agreement for FY2006 funding includes $30 million for technical assistance, $6.1 million for Watershed Surveys and Planning, $31.6 million for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program, and $51.3 million for the Resource Conservation and Development Program. These amounts exceed the Administration's request and include priority projects using funds from Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations. The conference agreement for FY2006 funding includes priority projects using funds from the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations account, without earmarking specific amounts. The Administration's proposal to phase out federal support to RC&D councils after 20 years was rejected, with funding decisions now based on effectiveness and performance rather than council age. No funding was provided for the two mentioned projects. The FY2006 funding agreement prioritizes projects using funds from the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations account. Funding decisions for RC&D councils are now based on effectiveness and performance rather than council age. No funding was provided for the two emergency conservation programs. Overall funding for mandatory conservation programs slightly decreases from FY2005. The Conservation Reserve Program is not subject to funding or enrollment limits, aligning with the Administration's request. Program spending is estimated to increase by $79 million. In FY2006, program spending is estimated to increase by $79 million to $2.021 billion. Reductions in funding include the Grasslands Reserve Program and the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program would receive the same funding in FY2006 as in FY2005. In FY2006, the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program would receive $26.5 million less than its authorized level, while the Wetland Reserve Program would enroll 100,000 acres less than authorized. The Conservation Reserve Program and Conservation Security Program saw significant increases in funding. Additionally, $2.5 million was allocated for the Healthy Forest Reserve program. The Healthy Forest Reserve program received $2.5 million in funding in FY2006. Congress later provided additional funds for hurricane damage in 2005, allocating $199.8 million to the Emergency Conservation Program and $300 million to the Emergency Watershed Program. Allocation of funds among hurricane-damaged states was not specified. Congress allocated funds for the Emergency Watershed Program and created the Emergency Forestry Conservation Program with $404.1 million in funding. Recipients must pay 25% of the clean-up cost, and the new program aims to reduce erosion and reestablish timber stands. $10 million was rescinded from the Conservation Operations Program. Title V of P.L. 109-97 provides $1.483 billion for USDA's international activities, including food aid programs. The conference report rejected the President's proposal to purchase commodities from markets near countries in need, instead of U.S. producers. The Senate did not approve amendments for the $300 million requested by the President for non-U.S. commodities for famine relief. USDA's international activities, funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation, include food aid programs, export credit guarantees, market development programs, and export subsidies. The total program value for FY2006 is estimated to be over $6 billion. Export subsidies, credit guarantees, and food aid are part of agriculture negotiations in the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization. P.L. 109-97 provides $147.9 million for FAS, which administers USDA's international programs. The House bill recommended an appropriation of $148.2 million for FAS, while the Senate measure recommended $147.9 million. For P.L. 480 foreign food aid programs, P.L. 109-97 provides $1.230 billion, including $77 million for P.L. 480 Title I and $1.150 billion for P.L. 480 Title II. The P.L. 480 Title II appropriation is $265 million more than requested in the President's budget. The conference report adopted an appropriation of $1.230 billion for P.L. 480 programs, rejecting the President's proposal to shift $300 million to USAID's International Disaster and Famine Assistance account. This proposal faced opposition from various groups involved in food aid distribution. The conference report addressed the issue of converting a portion of P.L. 480 commodity food aid into cash. The conference report included an appropriation of $1.230 billion for P.L. 480 programs, rejecting the President's proposal to shift $300 million to USAID's International Disaster and Famine Assistance account. The conferees advised against proposals that could jeopardize the interests of international food assistance programs. Amendments to increase emergency food aid were defeated during House committee deliberations. The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program received an appropriation of $100 million, supporting school feeding and child nutrition activities in poor countries. The President's budget includes $13.2 million more in budget authority for food aid activities, such as the Food for Progress Program and Section 416(b) commodity donations. $137 million of CCC funds would go to the Food for Progress program, while $151 million of CCC-owned nonfat dry milk would be available for food aid programming under Section 416(b). The House bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make $25 million of commodities available to assist in mitigating the effects of HIV AIDS. The BEHT currently holds 1.4 million metric tons of wheat and $107 million in cash. Section 738 limits to $20 million the amount of FY2005 P.L. 480 appropriations that may be used to reimburse the CCC for the release of commodities from the BEHT. U.S. food aid programs are under discussion in the WTO Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Negotiators in the WTO are discussing more stringent regulations on food aid to prevent displacement of commercial sales. U.S. negotiators support the idea that food aid should not interfere with commercial sales, while defending bilateral food aid programs to enhance food security in developing countries. The President's budget estimates $4.4 billion for export credit guarantees, with most guarantees for short-term commercial credits. The conference report provides $5.3 million to FAS and the Farm Service Agency to administer export credit guarantee programs, including short-term repayment terms and supplier credits for U.S. agricultural products. The United States is working to eliminate trade-distorting aspects of these programs in exchange for the removal of agricultural export subsidies by the European Union. USDA is adjusting its export credit guarantee programs to comply with WTO rulings. USDA is making changes to its export credit guarantee programs to comply with WTO rulings, including terminating intermediate credit guarantees. The budget allocates $125 million for the Market Access Program (MAP) and $34.5 million for the Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP). A Chabot amendment to restrict MAP funding failed. Export subsidy programs receive $28 million in the budget. The budget allocates $28 million to the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and $52 million to the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP), with DEIP subsidies exceeding their FY2005 level by $46 million. A preliminary agreement in the Doha Round calls for export subsidies like EEP and DEIP to be eliminated by a certain date. The President's request also includes $90 million for Trade Adjustment Assistance to Farmers. In FY2006, $35 million was rescinded from the P.L. 480 Title I Ocean Freight Differential Grants program. USDA's research, education, and economics function is carried out by four agencies, including the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES). For more information on USDA's international activities, refer to CRS Issue Brief IB98006. The USDA's Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) distributes federal funds to land grant Colleges of Agriculture for research, education, and extension programs. The agency's budget remained flat from FY1972 to FY1991, then increased by 25% from FY1992 to FY2000. Annual increases have since moderated, with a 10% increase in FY2001 mainly due to funds for anti-terrorism activities. States must provide matching funds for research and extension projects. State appropriations for research and extension programs are crucial as they require 100% matching funds for federal funds. Fluctuations in state-level appropriations can impact program levels, even if federal funding remains stable. Legislation in 1998 and 2002 aimed to boost competitive grants in the REE mission area by tapping into mandatory funds, but subsequent agriculture appropriations acts prohibited the use of these funds for that purpose. In FY2006, appropriations conferees provided more funding for ongoing REE programs than in previous years. However, these increases do not result in significant growth in agricultural research spending when adjusted for inflation. Concerns are raised by agricultural scientists, stakeholders, and partners regarding long-term funding due to high budget deficit levels and lower tax revenues. P.L. 109-97 allocated $2.67 billion for USDA's research, extension, and economics mission area, slightly higher than the FY2005 appropriation. $1.27 billion was provided for ARS, which is above the House provision and similar to the Senate proposal. In FY2006, the appropriations for ARS totaled $1.27 billion, with $1.13 billion supporting research programs. The conference report allocated $131.2 million for modernization and construction of ARS laboratory facilities, including funding for the National Centers for Animal Health in Ames, Iowa. Additionally, ARS is set to receive $9.2 million in emergency supplemental funding from the FY2006 Defense appropriations act. In FY2006, ARS received $9.2 million from the Defense appropriations act for repairs to laboratories in hurricane-devastated areas. The total FY2006 appropriations for CSREES were $1.19 billion, with allocations for state-level research, Extension programs, and integrated programs. The conference agreement rejected the Administration's proposal to cut formula funds for state agricultural programs. The bill rejected the Administration's proposal to cut formula funds for state agricultural experiment stations by 50% and instead provided $75 million for competitively awarded grants and $70 million for the National Research Initiative. This decision was made to support core agricultural research programs in each state and maintain stability in funding. Additionally, the proposal to shift formula funds for cooperative forestry research to competitive grants and eliminate formula funds for animal health and disease research was also turned down by both the Senate and the House. The National Academy of Science recommended a greater proportion of USDA research money be distributed competitively. The FY2006 budget proposed shifting funding mechanisms towards more competitive grants. House and Senate Agriculture Committees have raised funding levels for competitive grants in past farm bills. The FY2006 conference agreement maintains the customary proportion between competitive and non-competitive mechanisms for distributing federal funds. The FY2006 conference agreement maintains the customary proportion between competitive and non-competitive mechanisms for distributing federal agricultural research dollars. Funding levels for cooperative state research, cooperative forestry research, and research at historically black land grant colleges remain level with FY2005. The NRI competitive grants program receives $183 million, slightly higher than FY2005 but below the House and Senate bills. Additionally, approximately $188 million is allocated for grants directed by Members to designated institutions for specific research projects. The conference agreement for FY2006 provides funding for various extension programs and institutions. This includes $500,000 for a school loan repayment program, $455.9 million for extension activities, $33.9 million for extension programs at 1890 institutions, $12 million for Native American post-secondary institutions, $3.27 million for extension programs at 1994 institutions, and $62.6 million for the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program. The FY2006 conference agreement provides $62.6 million for the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP). CSREES administers grant programs funded by mandatory transfers of unobligated government funds, including the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems (IFAFS) which is authorized to receive $160 million but has been blocked from operation since FY2002. The FY2006 conference report continues to block mandatory IFAFS funding, except for administering previously awarded grants, and allocates 22% of NRI competitive grant funds for IFAFS purposes. The goal of both IFAFS and the NRI is to support fundamental research. The FY2006 conference agreement provides $75.9 million for USDA's Economic Research Service, a $1.76 million increase over FY2005. The funding supports a cooperative study with the National Academy of Sciences on the U.S. sheep industry and ongoing program development. The conference committee provides $140.7 million for the National Agricultural Statistics Service, directing $29 million for the Census of Agriculture. $837.8 million is appropriated for USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service in FY2006, below the President's request but above the FY2005 enacted level. The Administration's proposal for new user fees is not endorsed in the conference version. The Administration's proposal for new user fees to cover inspection costs beyond a plant's primary approved shift is not endorsed in the conference version. Congress has consistently rejected the idea, stating that ensuring food safety is a taxpayer-funded federal government responsibility. Administration officials argue that the fees are necessary for budgetary savings without compromising oversight, with minimal impact on producer and consumer prices. The appropriations committees have reminded the Administration that user fee proposals fall under the authorizing committees' jurisdiction. FSIS has been authorized to charge user fees since 1919, generating approximately $123 million in income in FY2006. The conference agreement includes increases for laboratory capabilities, training, biosurveillance, hiring additional inspectors, and microbiological studies for raw meats and poultry. The Senate committee report allocates $2 million for microbiological studies on raw meats and poultry to monitor pathogens, and $4 million for incorporating the Humane Activities Tracking system in U.S. slaughter plants. The appropriation also includes $20.7 million for regulatory and scientific training within FSIS. A Senate-approved amendment to ban nonambulatory livestock from human food was not included in the final bill. Supporters of the Senate amendment argue that downer animals, including sheep, swine, goats, horses, and other equines unable to stand, pose food safety hazards like BSE and Salmonella. Opponents question the ban's scientific basis and its impact on BSE surveillance. Some suggest distinguishing between animals with dangerous diseases and those that are safe for consumption. Conferees direct the Secretary of Agriculture to consult with Congress before taking any actions related to the ban. The USDA is required to consult with Congress before weakening the regulation on the slaughter of nonambulatory cattle for human food. This regulation was initially linked to humane slaughter concerns before the emergence of BSE. Some in Congress believe that banning the inspection of these cattle for human consumption would incentivize better treatment. Additionally, there is a provision prohibiting funds for the inspection of horses intended for human consumption. The provision prohibiting funds for the inspection of horses destined for human food was added during floor consideration in both the House and Senate. Last year, foreign-owned plants in Texas and Illinois slaughtered approximately 66,000 horses for human consumption, with the meat primarily exported to Europe and Japan. The effective date of the prohibition is delayed until 120 days after enactment, after which these plants may no longer process horses for human food unless other arrangements are made. The final House-Senate report states that the Department is obligated to inspect meat for human consumption, but funding limitations may allow horse slaughter to continue under different arrangements, such as voluntary FSIS inspection funded by industry user fees. The Meat Inspection Act was amended in 2006 to change the definition of livestock subject to mandatory inspection for human food to \"amenable species.\" This includes species covered by the Act before 2006 and any additional species deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The largest USDA appropriation for marketing and regulatory programs goes to APHIS, responsible for safeguarding U.S. agriculture from pests. APHIS, the agency responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases, received $820.5 million in FY2006, below the Administration's request of $860.2 million. The conference report specified how the agency should allocate funds, including $39 million for boll weevil management, exceeding the Administration's request of $14.3 million. The conference report allocated funds for various agricultural diseases and pests in FY2006. Johne's disease received $13.2 million, chronic wasting disease received $18.7 million, and USDA was directed to publish regulations for CWD control. Concerns were raised about funding for emerging plant pests, with arguments for more funding to address issues like the emerald ash borer, Asian long-horned beetle, and sudden oak death. In FY2006, $18.9 million was added to APHIS's emerging plant pest program budget, bringing the total to $100.1 million. The Secretary is expected to use his authority to transfer funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to help states eradicate plant and animal pests threatening agriculture. The Senate Appropriations Committee also encourages the use of CCC funds to address pest and disease outbreaks. The Committee report encourages the Secretary to use CCC funds to respond to plant and animal health threats, including compensating producers for losses. The House and Senate bills do not include the Administration's proposal for new user fees for animal welfare inspection. Most of USDA's BSE-directed funding is through APHIS. APHIS is receiving $17.2 million for BSE activities, with plans to test 40,000 animals. Over 500,000 cattle have been tested so far under a special program. Other agencies are also funding research on BSE-related topics. The final version designates $33 million for the development of a National Animal Identification System (NAIS) to trace animals in case of disease outbreaks. USDA has been funding pilot projects since 2004. Some animal ID money will go to projects like the Farm Animal Identification and Records program. Industry leaders are concerned about the slow progress. Some animal industry leaders are concerned about the slow implementation of a USDA-coordinated program for animal identification. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association is working on a privately-run animal database for disease purposes, but there is division in the industry over funding, confidentiality, and privacy issues. Other agencies like the FDA also have responsibilities related to BSE. The conference measure includes nearly $30 million for the FDA's BSE efforts. The FDA is allocated nearly $30 million for BSE activities in FY2006, focusing on enforcing animal feeding restrictions and researching decontamination of BSE prions. A Senate amendment to block USDA from allowing Japan to export beef to the US was dropped. The USDA banned Japanese beef imports in 2001 due to BSE cases. Despite a proposed rule in 2005, Japan has not allowed U.S. beef imports. Lawmakers urge ongoing negotiations for market reopening. Bills may impose $3.14 billion in restrictions if no resolution. Recent bills (S. 1922; H.R. 4179) propose imposing $3.14 billion in punitive tariffs on Japanese imports if the market remains closed by December 15, 2005. Japan was a significant market for U.S. beef before the BSE case, accounting for 37% of total beef exports in 2003. The FY2006 appropriation for APHIS' avian flu program is $13.8 million, with additional funds available for farmer indemnification in case of an outbreak. In addition to regular appropriations, Congress allocated $91.4 million in emergency funds for avian flu, with APHIS receiving $71.5 million. Funds will be used for surveillance, diagnosis, vaccine stockpiles, and international technical assistance. Unused funds can be carried forward to future fiscal years under a special directive. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is responsible for promoting U.S. agricultural products in domestic and international markets. P.L. 109-97 provides $115.3 million for AMS programs, including $79.2 million in direct budget authority and $36.1 million from USDA's Section 32 account. The Administration requested $101.5 million for AMS in FY2006, with the FY2005 enacted level at $94.7 million. Within the AMS total, $3.8 million was approved for state marketing activities, with $2.5 million earmarked for a specialty markets grant to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture. The conference agreement for FY2005 includes a new $1 million appropriation for the Farmers Market Promotion Program under AMS. This program, authorized by the 2002 farm bill, provides grants for farmers' markets and direct marketing activities. The agreement does not support the Administration's proposal for new AMS user fees to replace funding for commodity grade standards development. The committee will consider user fees for the development of grades, in addition to existing fees paid by industry for AMS activities. P.L. 109-97 postpones the requirement for country of origin labeling for certain products until September 30, 2008. The 2002 farm bill mandated Country-of-Origin Labeling (COOL) to take effect by September 30, 2004. Congress is considering a new farm bill in 2007, with bills proposing to replace mandatory meat labeling with a voluntary program. The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 required USDA to establish national organic standards, which were finalized in 2000. In 2005, the Senate approved an amendment directing USDA to evaluate the impact of a court decision on the National Organic Program. The federal court decision in June 2005 called on USDA to tighten rules for the National Organic Program, prohibiting synthetic substances in organic products and requiring 100% organic feed for dairy herds. The USDA evaluation also includes assessing the impact on organic farmers, processors, and consumers, analyzing synthetic ingredient use, expedited petitions for organic commodities, and considering crops from dairy farms in their third year of organic management. H.Rept. 109-255 details these evaluations. The provision in H.Rept. 109-255 aims to restore the National Organic Program to its pre-court decision state. It includes amendments to the Organic Foods Production Act, such as allowing synthetic substances up to 5% in \"USDA Organic\" products, establishing an expedited petition system, and permitting feed from cropland in transition to organic production for dairy cattle. The split within the organic community has grown since the court decision, with some supporting new regulations for a \"purer\" standard while others fear confusion and economic harm. One branch of the agency sets U.S. standards for commodities, while another focuses on fair-trading practices in livestock and meat products. The latter branch is improving oversight of livestock markets amidst increasing concentration and changes in business relationships. The conference version allocates $38.4 million for GIPSA in FY2006, higher than the $37 million appropriated for FY2005. The Administration's proposal of $40.4 million included new user fees to cover $24.7 million, which was not supported by the House or Senate. USDA is proposing new legislation for collecting fees for grain standardization and Packers and Stockyards licensing activities. Congressional interest in GIPSA's study of livestock marketing practices, initiated in F2003 with a $4.5 million appropriation, continues. The GIPSA study on livestock marketing practices, funded with a $4.5 million appropriation in F2003, is expected to be completed in mid-2006. The House committee report raises concerns about data confidentiality, use, and costs, directing GIPSA to address these issues in their reports. USDA's rural development mission area includes the Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and Rural Utilities Service, with an Office of Community Development providing support. P.L. 109-97 allocates $2.528 billion for discretionary rural development programs, an increase from previous years.

Directed spending recommendations are made within the RCAP accounts. There are $1-2 million dollar increases or decreases in several programs over House or Senate recommendations. Neither House nor Senate bill recommends appropriations for the Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities program. The conference report recommends $21.4 million for the Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities program and $88.2 million for RBS loan subsidies and grants in FY2006, an increase of $4.5 million from FY2005. Additionally, $20.5 million in discretionary funding is recommended for the program, an increase of $5.0 million from FY2005. The conference report also supports prohibiting the use of authorized mandatory funds for Value-Added Agricultural Product Development grants and Renewable Energy. The conference report recommends $23.0 million in discretionary funds for the Renewable Energy Grants program, cancelling $100.0 million for the Rural Strategic Investment Fund. It also recommends $11.2 million for communities in the Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Program, and $97.8 million for RUS with a loan level of $6.619 billion for FY2006.

Additional funding is included for new child nutrition program initiatives. The WIC program would have received $5.510 billion, but the Administration revised its projection downward due to lower participation and food costs. The conference agreement appropriates $5.257 billion for FY2006, including funds for a contingency reserve, unused funding carryover, rescinded unobligated funds, breastfeeding support, state management information systems, and WIC infrastructure projects.
