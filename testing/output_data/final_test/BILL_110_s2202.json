    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Renewable Fuel Standard Extension Act of 2007\" and addresses the renewable content of gasoline. Congress finds that the renewable fuel standard has significantly increased domestic biofuels production, reducing dependence on foreign oil. Ethanol production has exceeded targets ahead of schedule, but challenges remain with the availability of ethanol pumps for motorists. The automotive industry's failure to produce ethanol-capable vehicles has hindered ethanol distribution to consumers, leading to an excess in the marketplace that depresses prices and threatens the financial stability of smaller ethanol plants. This jeopardizes 20 years of progress in the biofuel industry and the transition to next-generation cellulosic biofuels. Congress must increase the renewable fuel standard to safeguard the path to cellulosic fuel production. The Clean Air Act is amended to define advanced biofuel as fuel derived from renewable biomass other than corn starch ethanol. This includes ethanol derived from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin. The Clean Air Act defines advanced biofuel as fuel derived from renewable biomass other than corn starch ethanol, including ethanol from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin, waste materials, diesel-equivalent fuel from renewable biomass, and biogas produced from various sources. The Clean Air Act defines advanced biofuel as fuel derived from renewable biomass, including butanol, other alcohols, and other fuels from cellulosic biomass. Cellulosic biomass ethanol refers to ethanol derived from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin from renewable biomass. Renewable biomass includes nonmerchantable materials or precommercial thinnings. Precommercial thinnings are byproducts of preventive treatments, such as trees, wood, brush, chips, and slash, removed to reduce hazardous fuels, contain disease or insect infestation, or restore forest health. These thinnings are harvested from National forests and would not be used for higher-value products. Precommercial thinnings are harvested from National Forest System land or public land in accordance with applicable land management plans and requirements for old-growth maintenance and restoration. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for large-tree retention under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003, including the use of organic matter from non-Federal land or land belonging to Indian tribes. The curr_chunk discusses various feed grains, agricultural commodities, plants, trees, algae, and waste materials including crop residue, vegetative waste material, animal waste, and byproducts. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the Clean Air Act regarding renewable content of gasoline, including the addition of advanced biofuel. The curr_chunk outlines the applicable volume of renewable fuel for calendar years 2008 through 2016 as per the Clean Air Act amendments. The applicable volume of renewable fuel for calendar years 2008 through 2016 as per the Clean Air Act amendments is as follows: 8.5 billion gallons in 2008, 10.5 billion gallons in 2009, 12.0 billion gallons in 2010, 12.6 billion gallons in 2011, 13.2 billion gallons in 2012, 13.8 billion gallons in 2013, 14.4 billion gallons in 2014, 15.0 billion gallons in 2015, and 18.0 billion gallons in 2016. The applicable volume for calendar year 2016 for advanced biofuel shall be determined according to a specific table. The applicable volume of advanced biofuel for calendar year 2016 is 3.0 billion gallons. The regulations for 2017 have been updated to reflect this change. In 2016, the volume of advanced biofuel was updated to 3.0 billion gallons. The regulations for 2017 have been adjusted accordingly."
