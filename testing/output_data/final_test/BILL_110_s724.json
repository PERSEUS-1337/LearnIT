    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians Restoration Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians is a political successor to signatories of the Pembina Treaty of 1863, ceding land in North Dakota to the United States. The Tribe, along with other Chippewa tribes, has been recognized by the Federal Government. Members of the Little Shell Tribe have lived in Montana for over 100 years, and the Tribe has a history of petitioning in the 1930s and 1940s. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Little Shell Tribe petitioned the Federal Government for reorganization under the Indian Reorganization Act. Federal agents and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs acknowledged the Tribe's eligibility for trust land, but due to lack of funding during the Depression, the Bureau of Indian Affairs couldn't purchase land for the Tribe. The Little Shell Tribe, despite the lack of funding from the Federal Government, continued to exist as a separate community with clear political leadership. They, along with other tribes, filed lawsuits under the Indian Claims Commission Act to seek compensation for land ceded to the United States. The Little Shell Tribe sought compensation for land ceded under treaties with the United States in 1863 and 1892. They received awards in 1971 and 1982. In 1978, the Tribe petitioned for Federal recognition, which is still pending. The Tribe has had continuous dealings with the Federal Government, the State of Montana, and other recognized Indian tribes since the 1930s. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
