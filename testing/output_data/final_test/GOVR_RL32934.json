    "content": "The U.S.-Mexico bilateral economic relationship is crucial due to proximity, cultural ties, and NAFTA. Common interests include trade, investment, and regulatory cooperation. The two countries share a border, Gulf connections, and links through migration, tourism, and environmental issues. Congress is interested in NAFTA renegotiations, USMCA, trade relations, Mexico's economic reforms, presidential elections, border management, and other issues. The Mexican 2018 presidential elections, U.S.-Mexico border management, and economic policies of Mexico's new President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador are key areas of interest for Congress. Former President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto implemented economic and political reforms, including opening up the energy sector to private investment and increasing infrastructure investment. This report provides an overview of U.S.-Mexico economic relations and trade trends. Mexico is a key trading partner of the United States, ranking second in exports and third in total trade. Since NAFTA in 1994, trade between the two countries has significantly increased. Mexico has the second-largest economy in Latin America and a population of 129 million people. Mexico is the second-largest economy in Latin America with a population of 129 million people. Its GDP was $1.15 trillion in 2017, about 6% of the US GDP. Per capita income is significantly lower than in the US, but still relatively high by global standards. Mexico's economy heavily relies on exports to the United States. Mexico's economy, in the upper-middle income category, heavily relies on exports to the United States. In 2017, exports equaled 37% of Mexico's GDP, with 80% going to the US. Since NAFTA in 1994, US exports to Mexico increased from $41.6 billion to $265.0 billion in 2018, while imports from Mexico increased from $39.9 billion to $346.5 billion. The trade balance went from a surplus of $1.7 billion in 1993 to a deficit of $74.3 billion in 2007. The United States trade deficit with Mexico increased from $74.3 billion in 2007 to an all-time high of $81.5 billion in 2018. In 2017, the US had a services trade surplus with Mexico of $7.4 billion, with exports totaling $32.8 billion and imports at $25.5 billion. Leading US imports from Mexico in 2018 included motor vehicles, motor vehicle parts, computer equipment, oil and gas, and electrical equipment. Oil and gas imports from Mexico have decreased sharply. In 2018, U.S. had a trade deficit of $81.5 billion with Mexico. Oil and gas imports from Mexico dropped from $39.6 billion in 2011 to $7.6 billion in 2016 due to decreased production and lower oil prices globally. U.S. exports to Mexico in 2018 included petroleum products, motor vehicle parts, computer equipment, semiconductors, and basic chemicals. Foreign direct investment from the U.S. to Mexico has increased significantly since NAFTA implementation. The stock of U.S. FDI in Mexico increased significantly from $17.0 billion in 1994 to $109.7 billion in 2017, while Mexican FDI in the U.S. rose from $2.1 billion to $18.0 billion during the same period. Mexico's liberalization of restrictions on foreign investment in the late 1980s and early 1990s attracted U.S. investment. NAFTA provisions on foreign investment further boosted investor confidence. NAFTA investment provisions have increased investor confidence for North American investors from the United States, Mexico, or Canada. The agreement may have encouraged U.S. FDI in Mexico, but much of the growth would have likely occurred regardless due to Mexico's ongoing liberalization of foreign investment laws. NAFTA has been credited with helping U.S. manufacturing industries, particularly the auto industry, become more globally competitive through the development of supply chains that cross national boundaries for increased efficiency. The reduction in tariffs affects prices in sectors and industries that purchase intermediate inputs. Analysts emphasize the importance of these linkages for trade and welfare gains from free trade agreements. Production sharing between the United States and Mexico has led to vertical supply relationships, especially along the border, increasing the flow of intermediate inputs and finished products. The U.S.-Mexico border region has become a crucial production site for various industries like automotive, electronics, appliances, and machinery. Trade expansion has created vertical supply relationships in the auto sector, making North America a significant production site for automobiles with multilayered connections between U.S. and Mexican suppliers. The flow of auto merchandise trade involves parts from multiple producers in different countries crossing borders multiple times. The North American auto industry is highly integrated, with products incorporating components from multiple producers in different countries. In 2017, 99% of U.S. motor vehicle imports from Mexico entered duty-free under NAFTA. Mexico's export-oriented assembly plants, mostly with U.S. parent companies, are closely linked to the industry. Export-oriented assembly plants, mainly with U.S. parent companies, are a significant part of Mexico's trade with the United States, particularly in labor-intensive industries like auto parts and electronics. These plants, established under Mexico's maquiladora program in the 1960s, heavily rely on imported materials to produce goods for export to the U.S. market. Factors like NAFTA, trade liberalization, wages, and economic conditions have contributed to the growth of these manufacturing facilities. The growth of export-oriented assembly plants in Mexico, particularly in labor-intensive industries like auto parts and electronics, has been influenced by factors such as NAFTA, trade liberalization, wages, and economic conditions. These operations help U.S. companies remain competitive by producing goods at competitive prices, with a higher degree of U.S. content in the final product. Critics argue that these plants take jobs from the U.S. and depress wages for low-skilled workers. Changes in Mexican regulations post-NAFTA merged the maquiladora industry and Mexican domestic assembly-for-export plants into the Maquiladora Manufacturing Industry and Export Services (IMMEX) program. The NAFTA rules for the maquiladora industry were implemented in two phases, with the first phase covering the period 1994-2000 and the second phase starting in 2001. Phase II introduced new North American rules of origin for duty-free status of U.S. and Canadian products exported to Mexico for maquiladoras, replacing previous special tariff provisions. The initial maquiladora program ceased to exist, and the same trade rules applied to all. The elimination of duty-free imports by maquiladoras from non-NAFTA countries under NAFTA caused initial uncertainty. Remittances from workers in the United States are a significant source of foreign currency for Mexico, with most going to southern states where poverty levels are high. In 2017, remittances to Mexico reached a record high of $28.8 billion, a 7.5% increase from 2016. The rise is attributed to the devaluation of the Mexican peso after President Trump's election and his threat to block money transfers for a border wall. This has negatively impacted the purchasing power of the peso, leading families to rely more on remittances from the US. Remittances from the United States to Mexico have been a significant source of income since the late 1990s, with a peak of $26.1 billion in 2007. The growth rate is influenced by factors like frequency of sending, exchange rate fluctuations, and employment in the US. Electronic transfers and money orders are popular methods for sending money. Remittances play a crucial role in the Mexican economy, covering general consumption and housing expenses in some regions. Households use the money for food, clothing, healthcare, and other expenses, with some also being invested as capital. The economic impact of remittance flows from the United States to Mexico is concentrated in poorer states and is used for general consumption, housing, clothing, healthcare, and microenterprises. Bilateral efforts between the United States and Mexico, as well as Canada, focus on border security, trade facilitation, economic competitiveness, regulatory cooperation, and energy integration. The High Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) was launched in 2013 to promote mutual economic growth, job creation, and global competitiveness through Cabinet-level cooperation. The High Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) between the United States and Mexico aims to promote competitiveness in sectors like transportation, telecommunications, and energy, as well as two-way investment. It focuses on promoting entrepreneurship, innovation, and human capital development for the 21st-century economy, along with strengthening economic development in the U.S.-Mexico border region. Another bilateral effort is the U.S.-Mexico High-Level Regulatory Cooperation Council (HLRCC), launched in 2010. The High-Level Regulatory Cooperation Council (HLRCC) was launched in May 2010 by the United States and Mexico. The official work plan, released in February 2012, focuses on regulatory cooperation in various sectors such as food safety, e-certification for plants, commercial motor vehicle safety standards, nanotechnology, e-health, and offshore oil and gas development. U.S. agencies involved include the FDA, USDA, DOT, OMB, DOI, and OSHA. Additionally, both countries are engaged in a border management initiative to manage the U.S.-Mexico border cooperatively. The U.S. and Mexico are working together to manage the 2,000-mile border by expediting trade and travel, enhancing public safety, managing security risks, engaging border communities, and setting policies for collaboration. A Bilateral Executive Steering Committee has been established with representatives from various government departments in both countries. The initiative focuses on expediting commerce and travel through investments in personnel, technology, and infrastructure. Since 2005, the United States, Canada, and Mexico have increased cooperation on economic and security issues through trilateral summits known as the North American Leaders' Summits (NALS). President George W. Bush, President Barack Obama, and leaders of Mexico and Canada participated in these summits focused on economic competitiveness, climate change, clean energy, and the environment. The North American Leaders' Summits (NALS) have focused on economic competitiveness, climate change, clean energy, environment, cooperation, security, and defense. President Trump's Administration has not confirmed continuation of NALS efforts. The US, Canada, and Mexico have collaborated on initiatives like the North American Competitiveness Work Plan (NACW) and the North American Competitiveness and Innovation Conference (NACIC) to address mutual interests in regionalism, prosperity, innovation, energy, climate change, and security. Some critics argue that North American leaders should enhance the effectiveness of their meetings with more action-oriented follow-up mechanisms. Others believe that human rights issues and drug-related violence in Mexico are not adequately addressed in trilateral efforts. Mexico's economy is closely tied to the U.S. economy, with slow growth in recent years. Economic forecasts predict growth above 2%, but it falls short of addressing poverty and job creation needs. Mexico's economy has had low growth in the past 30 years, with GDP increasing by 2.4% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2016. Structural reforms have been beneficial, but events like the U.S. recession in 2001 and the global downturn in 2009 have hindered progress. The OECD predicts potential growth in 2018, citing improvements in fiscal performance, monetary policy, manufacturing exports, foreign investment, and government reforms in various sectors. Full implementation of reforms could boost annual growth by 1%. Mexico's structural reforms could increase annual growth by 1%, but challenges remain in poverty alleviation, reducing informality, strengthening institutions, addressing corruption, and boosting labor productivity. The economy is closely tied to the U.S., with 80% of exports going there. Government reforms aim to make growth more inclusive, reduce inequality, improve education, and combat poverty. Mexico's informal sector is significant, estimated to make up a large portion of total employment. Estimates vary widely, with some sources suggesting it accounts for one-third to two-thirds of the workforce. Formal sector workers are salaried employees covered by social security, while informal sector workers are usually self-employed and have varying access to social protection programs. Salaried workers can be found in industries like construction, agriculture, and services, while nonsalaried workers are often socially marginalized or excluded. Employees in Mexico's informal sector, such as agricultural producers, seamstresses, artisans, street vendors, and car washers, face poverty as a major economic challenge. The government's poverty reduction efforts focus on conditional cash transfer programs like Prospera, which aims to improve nutrition, health, and education to break the cycle of poverty. Prospera provides cash transfers to 6.9 million Mexican households in poverty, promoting education and health. The program has been replicated in many countries worldwide. It also offers nutrition support to pregnant women and children. Some experts see the informal sector as a barrier to economic growth, while others believe social programs benefitting this sector have increased informal employment. Mexico is urged to implement political and economic reforms for improvement. Mexico has implemented significant political and economic reforms to stimulate economic growth, with a focus on improving administrative capacity, judicial institutions, and addressing human rights, rule of law, and corruption issues. The OECD emphasizes the need for full implementation of these reforms to boost living standards, reduce income inequality, and drive economic growth. According to a 2014 study by the McKinsey Global Institute, Mexico's economy is described as \"dualistic,\" with modern, competitive industries in some sectors but technologically backward and unproductive firms in others. Despite three decades of economic reforms focusing on privatization, trade liberalization, and foreign investment, overall GDP growth has not significantly improved. Mexico's economy is described as \"dualistic,\" with modern industries flourishing but traditional sectors struggling with rising informality and plunging productivity. The country's long-term economic outlook depends largely on the energy sector, where oil production has been declining since 2005. Despite potential resources for recovery, Mexico lacks the technical capability and financial means for deepwater projects or shale oil deposits. The 2013 energy reforms aimed to reverse these trends by opening the sector to production-sharing. The Mexican Congress enacted reforms opening Mexico's energy sector to production-sharing contracts with private and foreign investors while maintaining state control of hydrocarbons ownership. These reforms are expected to boost U.S.-Mexico energy trade and create opportunities for U.S. companies in the hydrocarbons sector. NAFTA previously excluded foreign investment in Mexico's energy sector, but the renegotiations allowed for potential changes in this area. In the NAFTA renegotiations, the United States aimed to strengthen investment and market access for energy production. Mexico called for modernizing NAFTA's energy provisions. The USMCA recognizes Mexico's national ownership of hydrocarbons. The North American oil and gas industry's relationship with Mexico is crucial, with the U.S. having a trade surplus in 2016. Mexico's reforms have driven investment in new natural gas-powered electricity generation and the retail gasoline market, leading to a growth in U.S. energy exports to Mexico. Observers believe that NAFTA and USMCA dispute settlement mechanisms will protect U.S. investments in Mexico, with a weakening of these provisions potentially impacting investor confidence. Mexico's commitment to trade integration is growing. Mexico has a strong commitment to trade integration and liberalization through FTAs since the 1990s. It signed the TPP but after the US withdrew, Mexico and 10 other countries signed the CPTPP in 2018. The CPTPP, a trade agreement involving 11 countries, is set to take effect on December 30, 2018. Mexico, Canada, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore have ratified the agreement. It will reduce barriers on goods, services, and agriculture, enhancing Mexico's trade relationships with various countries. Mexico already has 11 free trade agreements with 46 countries. Mexico has negotiated free trade agreements with 46 countries, including the United States, Canada, Chile, Colombia, and the European Union. Amid rising protectionist sentiment, Mexico is actively seeking to deepen existing agreements and negotiate new ones. The country has also modernized its FTA with the EU, covering areas such as government procurement, energy trade, and intellectual property rights. This new agreement is expected to replace the previous one from 2000. The EU and Mexico are expected to have a new agreement allowing duty-free movement of goods, including agricultural products. Mexico is part of the Pacific Alliance, aiming for regional integration and stronger ties with the Asia-Pacific region. NAFTA has been in effect since 1994, marking Mexico's shift to a more open, export-oriented economy. The USMCA, signed on November 30, 2018, aims to revise and modernize NAFTA. It requires approval from Congress and ratification from Mexico and Canada before coming into effect. The agreement was notified to Congress on August 31, 2018, to allow for signing before Mexico's new president took office on December 1, 2018. The USMCA, signed on November 30, 2018, aims to revise and modernize NAFTA. It contains notification and reporting requirements that may delay implementation until the 116th Congress. USMCA retains most of NAFTA's chapters but makes changes to market access for autos and agriculture, as well as rules on investment, government procurement, and intellectual property rights. New issues like digital trade, state-owned enterprises, anticorruption, and currency misalignment are also addressed. Many U.S. manufacturers, services providers, and agricultural producers opposed withdrawing from NAFTA and urged the Trump Administration to avoid causing harm in the negotiations. President Trump intends to withdraw from NAFTA, which could have significant implications for U.S. trade policy and economic relations with Mexico. An analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics predicts that a NAFTA withdrawal would cost the U.S. 187,000 jobs reliant on exports to Mexico and Canada. President Trump's plan to withdraw from NAFTA could result in the loss of 187,000 jobs in the United States that depend on exports to Mexico and Canada. This would impact various states and sectors, with estimates of job losses ranging from 256,000 to 1.2 million in three to five years. Additionally, Canadian and Mexican employment of low-skilled workers would also decline significantly. The authors estimate a decline in U.S. GDP of 0.64% (over $100 billion) if NAFTA is terminated. The Coalition of Services Industries (CSI) argues that NAFTA is a success for U.S. services providers, with potential risks of losing $88 billion in annual U.S. services exports to Canada and Mexico. Critics argue NAFTA has led to job losses and wage pressure in the U.S., with estimates of 682,900 U.S. jobs displaced by trade deficits with Mexico as of 2010. AFL-CIO calls for stronger protections in trade agreements. The AFL-CIO criticizes current U.S. FTAs for lacking strong enforcement mechanisms. If the U.S. withdraws from NAFTA, Canada and Mexico may maintain the agreement between themselves. U.S.-Canada trade could be governed by CUSFTA or WTO commitments. The CUSFTA and NAFTA have common agreements, with some commitments like intellectual property rights continuing in the WTO. The future of CUSFTA is uncertain as it would require both parties' assent. The United States and Mexico have had trade disputes over sugar, country of origin labeling, tomato imports, dolphin-safe tuna labeling, and NAFTA trucking provisions. Currently, they are in a trade dispute over U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, with the U.S. citing national security concerns and Mexico arguing against protectionist measures inconsistent with WTO agreements. President Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, citing national security concerns. The tariffs were set at 25% for steel and 10% for aluminum, with some countries temporarily excluded. Trading partners had until May 1 to negotiate alternative solutions to address the national security threat posed by these imports. The US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports citing national security concerns. After the temporary exemption expired, tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum were imposed on Mexico and Canada. The proposed USMCA did not address these tariffs, leading to ongoing discussions that may result in import quotas. Mexico retaliated by imposing tariffs on $3.7 billion worth of US products. In 2017, Mexico ranked second among U.S. trading partners for steel and aluminum, with a total trade value of $10.3 billion. A trade dispute between the United States and Mexico under the WTO involves dolphin-safe labeling provisions and tuna imports. Mexico can now impose trade restrictions on U.S. imports worth $163.2 million per year based on a WTO arbitrator's decision. The United States faces a trade dispute with Mexico over dolphin-safe labeling provisions for tuna imports. Mexico can impose trade restrictions worth $163.2 million per year based on a WTO arbitrator's decision. The issue revolves around U.S. labeling rules that affect Mexican tuna access to the U.S. market. Mexico has requested the United States to expand its dolphin-safe rules for tuna fishing. Environmental groups argue that Mexican tuna may not be truly \"dolphin-safe\" due to potential harm to dolphins during the fishing process. Industry representatives from major U.S. tuna processors disagree, stating that U.S. companies would likely still purchase Mexican tuna. The tuna labeling dispute between Mexico and the United States began over 10 years ago when the Clinton Administration lifted an embargo on Mexican tuna under relaxed standards for a dolphin-safe label. However, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that the standards of the law had not been met, and the Federal Appeals Court sustained the ruling in July 2001. Under the Bush Administration, the Commerce Department ruled that the dolphin-safe label may be applied if qualified observers certify that no dolphins were harmed in the netting process. Environmental groups filed a suit to block the modification of dolphin-safe label standards. The U.S. District Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Bush Administration's modification, reinstating the original standards. Mexico initiated WTO dispute proceedings against the United States in late October 2008. Mexico filed a WTO dispute against the United States over tuna labeling requirements. The WTO panel found the U.S. labeling provisions to be more restrictive than necessary, leading to an appeal by the Obama Administration. The WTO's Appellate Body overturned key findings from the panel in May 2012. The WTO dispute panel found that U.S. tuna labeling requirements violated global trade rules by treating imported tuna from Mexico less favorably. The Appellate Body rejected Mexico's claim that the requirements were more trade-restrictive than necessary. The United States amended its dolphin-safe labeling requirements by July 2013 to comply with the ruling. Mexico requested a WTO compliance panel in November 2013, and in April 2015, the panel ruled against the United States. In 2015, the WTO ruled against the United States for unfair discrimination against Mexico's fishing industry. The US expressed concerns with the ruling, stating that Mexico did not dispute or apply certain measures. Mexico announced retaliatory tariffs of $472.3 million, while the US argued for $21.9 million in concessions. The US later revised its dolphin-safe label requirements on tuna products to comply with the WTO decision. The US revised labeling rules for tuna products to comply with the WTO decision, increasing regulations for tuna caught globally. The new rules did not change existing requirements for labeling tuna as \"dolphin-safe.\" The Humane Society International praised the US for enhancing dolphin protections. Additionally, the US Department of Commerce signed agreements with Mexico to suspend investigations on sugar imports, altering trade dynamics between the two countries. The US Department of Commerce signed agreements with Mexico to suspend investigations on sugar imports, imposing volume limits and minimum price levels. Two US sugar companies requested continuation of the investigations, claiming \"interested party\" status. The International Trade Commission upheld the suspension agreement between the US and Mexico. On March 19, 2015, the ITC upheld the agreement between the United States and Mexico that suspended sugar investigations. Mexican Economy Minister praised the decision, stating it supported the Mexican government position. The dispute began on March 28, 2014, when the American Sugar Coalition filed a petition alleging Mexico was dumping and subsidizing sugar exports to the US, harming US producers and workers. The DOC initiated investigations on April 18, 2014, and the ITC issued a preliminary report on May 9, 2014, indicating injury to the US sugar industry. In August 2014, the DOC found that Mexican sugar exports to the US were unfairly subsidized, leading to the imposition of duties ranging from 2.99% to 17.01% under the CVD order. Additional provisional duties of 39.54% to 47.26% were imposed following preliminary AD findings. The final determination was expected in 2015 but had not been issued when suspension agreements were signed. The Sweetener Users Association (SUA) argues that the U.S. sugar market distortion is caused by the U.S. government's sugar program, leading to high sugar prices between 2009 and 2012. This resulted in sugar growers increasing production, creating a surplus and lowering sugar prices. The SUA has criticized the U.S. sugar program for years. In 2006, the U.S. and Mexico resolved a trade dispute over sugar and high fructose corn syrup under NAFTA. In late 2001, Mexico imposed a 20% tax on soft drinks made with corn syrup sweeteners to support the domestic cane sugar industry, despite U.S. objections. The U.S. Trade Representative initiated WTO dispute settlement proceedings against Mexico's HFCS tax in 2004, leading to a final decision by the WTO panel in October 2005. In October 2005, the WTO panel supported the U.S. position on Mexico's tax on soft drinks made with corn sweeteners. Mexico appealed, but the WTO Appellate Body upheld the ruling in March 2006. By January 1, 2007, Mexico eliminated the tax, and in August 2006, an agreement allowed duty-free trade of sugar and HFCS between the U.S. and Mexico until January 1, 2008. The United States was involved in a trade dispute with Mexico and Canada over country-of-origin labeling (COOL) requirements for animal products. Mexican and Canadian meat producers argued that the labeling requirements created barriers to trade. A WTO appellate panel ruled against the United States in June 2013, leading to an appeal by the U.S. The WTO appellate body issued findings rejecting the U.S.'s appeal on May 18, 2015. The WTO appellate body rejected the U.S.'s arguments against the panel's findings on country-of-origin labeling requirements for animal products. Mexico and Canada were considering retaliatory tariffs on various U.S. exports, including fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy, machinery, furniture, and appliances. The issue was resolved with the repeal of mandatory COOL requirements for certain beef and pork products in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. The USDA removed country-of-origin labeling requirements for these products, resulting in significant economic benefits according to the USDA. The dispute over country-of-origin labeling provisions for beef and pork products resulted in significant cost avoidance for producers, processors, wholesalers, and retailers. The dispute began in 2008 when Canada and Mexico requested WTO consultations with the United States. The U.S. labeling provisions required informing consumers of the country of origin for certain commodities, which was opposed by livestock and food industry groups. The issue was resolved in 2016 with the repeal of mandatory COOL requirements, leading to economic benefits. In 2011, Mexico argued that COOL had a discriminatory impact on livestock trade to the U.S., violating WTO commitments. The WTO panel found that COOL treated imported livestock less favorably and did not provide complete origin information to consumers. The U.S. appealed the ruling in 2012, and the WTO upheld the discrimination but reversed the information provision finding. The trade restrictiveness of COOL was inconclusive. The USDA issued a revised COOL rule in 2013, requiring meat producers to specify where each animal was born, raised, and slaughtered on retail packaging. Canada and Mexico challenged the labeling rules before a WTO panel, which sided with them. The implementation of NAFTA trucking provisions was a major trade issue between the United States and Mexico due to delays in trucking commitments. The proposed USMCA would limit Mexican trucks from operating between two points within the United States, allowing only cross-border hauling. Existing Mexican carriers with NAFTA authority can still operate in the US. Delays in implementing NAFTA trucking provisions led to disputes between the US and Mexico, with a resolution panel supporting Mexico's objections in 2001. President Bush showed willingness to comply with the provisions. The U.S. and Mexico resolved issues over cross-border trucking through pilot programs and talks. In 2015, Mexican motor carriers were allowed to conduct long-haul services in the U.S. The Teamsters filed a lawsuit in 2015 regarding this decision. The Brotherhood of Teamsters filed a lawsuit in 2015 to halt the FMCSA's move allowing Mexican carriers to operate in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the lawsuit in 2017, stating that the FMCSA had the discretion to grant operating authority to Mexican carriers. The U.S. Court of Appeals initially ruled that full environmental impact statements were needed for Mexican trucks on U.S. highways, but the Supreme Court overturned this decision in 2004. In 2007, the Bush Administration launched a pilot project allowing Mexican trucks from 100 companies to access U.S. highways. The Department of Transportation also started a pilot program allowing approved Mexican carriers to travel beyond the border region. 29 Mexican motor carriers were granted operating authority in the U.S. during the 18-month program. In FY2008, 103 Mexican trucks were used in a pilot program despite Congress prohibiting funding for it. The DOT issued a report in March 2008, noting that the FMCSA would check trucks for safety standards at the border, there was lower participation than expected, and safety assessments were implemented. In early August 2008, DOT extended a pilot program for Mexican trucks for two more years. The House passed a bill in September 2008 to prohibit Mexican trucks from accessing U.S. highways beyond the border. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act terminated the pilot program in March 2009. The FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act allowed funds for a long-haul Mexican truck pilot program under certain conditions. In response to the termination of the pilot program in 2009, Mexico retaliated by imposing tariffs on 90 U.S. products worth $2.4 billion. The tariffs ranged from 10% to 45% and covered various goods like fruits, vegetables, and consumer products. The tariffs were eventually eliminated in two stages in 2011 after negotiations between Mexico and the United States. A bipartisan group of Members wrote to the US Trade Representative and DOT Secretary requesting a resolution to the trucking issue due to devastating impacts on local industries, especially in agriculture. Mexican tariffs led to a 50% decline in US potato exports to Mexico, causing US exporters to lose market share to Canada. The Mexican government revised the list of retaliatory tariffs in 2010, adding 26 products and removing 16, totaling 99 products from 43 states with a $2.6 billion export value. In 2010, Mexico revised its list of retaliatory tariffs, adding 26 products and removing 16, totaling 99 products from 43 states with a $2.6 billion export value. The revised tariffs ranged from 5% to 25%, with products like pork, cheese, sweet corn, pistachios, and oranges being affected. U.S. producers expressed concerns over potential losses in sales due to the ongoing trucking dispute. In March 2011, an agreement was reached between President Obama and Mexican President Calder\u00f3n to resolve a trucking dispute, leading to Mexico suspending retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports. The Obama Administration proposed a new long-haul trucking pilot program with safety inspection requirements for Mexican carriers. The program would involve an application process for Mexican carriers interested in operating in the U.S. and would bring in thousands of trucks. The long-haul trucking pilot program for Mexican carriers in the U.S. involved a vetting process by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, safety audits, documentation of Mexican commercial driver's license process, and evidence of financial responsibility. Operations elements included monitoring procedures, regular inspections, electronic monitoring, follow-up reviews, compliance reviews, and FMCSA reviews. Transparency elements included Federal Register notices and a publicly accessible website providing information on participating carriers. On July 6, 2011, the US and Mexico signed a Memorandum of Understanding to resolve a dispute over long-haul cross-border trucking. Mexico suspended retaliatory tariffs on US exports, with the remaining tariffs lifted after Mexican trucking companies received US operating authority. In October 2011, Mexico fully suspended the tariffs. In February 2013, an agreement on cross-border trade in tomatoes was reached between the two countries, averting a potential trade war. An agreement was reached between the US and Mexico on cross-border trade in tomatoes, avoiding a potential trade war. The Department of Commerce and the Mexican government signed the agreement, suspending an antidumping investigation on fresh tomatoes from Mexico. The dispute began when Florida tomato growers requested the termination of an antidumping duty suspension pact on Mexican tomatoes, which could have led to an antidumping investigation. Mexico's Ambassador to the US warned that such action would harm the trade relationship between the two countries. The suspension pact between the US and Mexico on fresh tomatoes dates back to 1996 when the Department of Commerce filed an antidumping petition against Mexican tomato growers. Under pressure from Florida tomato growers, an agreement was reached where Mexican growers agreed to set a minimum reference price to eliminate the injurious effects of tomato exports to the US. Mexico's Ambassador to the US warned of retaliatory tariffs to defend the Mexican tomato industry. The 2013 suspension agreement between the US and Mexico covers all fresh and chilled tomatoes, setting reference prices to reflect market changes. US tomato producers petitioned to end the agreement, citing unfair competition from Mexican producers. The US and Mexico are in a dispute over the tomato suspension agreement, with US producers seeking to end it to eliminate predatory actions by Mexican producers. Business groups are divided, with some urging caution due to potential price increases and retaliatory measures. Mexican producers have enlisted support from US businesses like Wal-Mart. Policymakers are monitoring trade issues related to USMCA and NAFTA withdrawal by President Trump. The proposed USMCA is being considered under TPA to assess its impact on U.S.-Mexico trade relations. Economists believe it may not significantly affect trade, investment, jobs, wages, or economic growth. The U.S. International Trade Commission is investigating the potential economic impacts of the USMCA as part of the TPA process. The US International Trade Commission is conducting an economic evaluation of the USMCA, with a focus on the motor vehicle industry due to changes in rules of origin. Motor vehicles and parts account for a significant portion of US imports from Mexico. The US International Trade Commission is evaluating the USMCA, focusing on the motor vehicle industry due to changes in rules of origin. Motor vehicles and parts make up a significant portion of US imports from Mexico, with concerns about potential higher costs and impact on U.S. vehicle sales. Manufacturers with a strong presence in Mexico, like General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, may be more affected. Provisions in the new USMCA agreement, including customs regulation, digital trade, and labor enforcement, are seen as an improvement over NAFTA. However, there are concerns about heightened IPR protections and limited ISDS provisions, which may only apply to certain U.S. contracts in Mexico's energy sector. Investors under USMCA can only file ISDS claims for breaches of national treatment, most-favored nation treatment, or expropriation. President Donald Trump intends to notify Canada and Mexico of his plan to withdraw from NAFTA in six months. Private sector groups are urging him to stay in NAFTA until the USMCA is in force, warning of negative consequences. Congress may assess the impact of withdrawal on the economy and foreign relations with Mexico. If the US withdraws from NAFTA, it may affect ISDS claims for breaches of national treatment, most-favored nation treatment, or expropriation. If the United States withdraws from NAFTA, it could return to WTO most-favored-nation tariffs. The United States and Canada have low average MFN rates, while Mexico has higher rates. Without NAFTA, there is a risk of tariffs on U.S. exports to Mexico reaching up to 36.2%. U.S. farmers would face double-digit tariffs in both Mexico and Canada. Mexico and Canada likely would have higher tariffs on labor-intensive goods and agriculture products. If the United States withdraws from NAFTA, it could return to WTO most-favored-nation tariffs. Mexico and Canada likely would maintain duty-free treatment between themselves through a bilateral NAFTA or CPTPP commitments. Certain commitments, such as Services Access, would be affected if the US withdrew from NAFTA without USMCA entering into force. The NAFTA government procurement chapter outlines standards for government purchases of goods and services, with opportunities for firms to bid on contracts. Membership in the WTO Government Procurement Agreement is optional, and Mexico is not a member. U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA could impact U.S. firms competing for Mexican contracts. The investment chapter in the WTO does not provide similar provisions as in NAFTA. The investment chapter in the WTO lacks the same level of investor protection as NAFTA and other trade agreements. If the US withdraws from NAFTA, investors would lose protections in Mexico, facing challenges in resolving disputes. Canada and Mexico may maintain investor protection through other agreements. Policymakers should focus on improving cooperation with Mexico in various areas through the HLED and HLRCC. Some policy experts stress the significance of U.S.-Mexico trade in intermediate goods and supply chains, advocating for improved cooperation and investment in border infrastructure to mitigate disruptions caused by increased security measures along the border."
