The \"Chinook Nation Restoration Act\" recognizes the historical contributions of the Chinook Nation to the Lewis and Clark expedition. Despite being recognized as an Indian tribe in treaties, the Chinook people suffered harm and lost their lands on the Columbia River due to the United States' failure to protect them. The Chinook Nation faced poverty and disease in the 19th century. Congress aimed to provide restitution through land allotments on Indian reservations, upheld by the Supreme Court. The Western Oregon Termination Act of 1954 named four Chinook tribes, leading to the termination of the Federal relationship with the Tribe. The Chinook Nation remains active in the Lower Columbia River and Willapa Bay area. The Chinook Nation, known for their language and culture, has survived neglect by the United States. Congress should restore their Federal tribal status. The Chinook Nation, composed of various tribes, is defined in the Act. The Act also defines terms like \"member,\" \"Secretary,\" \"Tribe,\" \"State,\" and \"State territorial waters.\" Federal recognition is extended to the Chinook Indian Nation, allowing them to receive federal services and benefits. All applicable laws and regulations for Indians will also apply to the Tribe and its members. The Chinook Indian Nation and its members are granted federal recognition, making them eligible for all services and benefits provided by the Federal Government to federally recognized tribes. The Tribe's service area includes specific counties in Washington and Oregon. Upon approval of their constitution and bylaws, the Nation will have civil jurisdiction over its members residing in the designated service area. The Chinook Indian Nation and its members are granted federal recognition under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1978, allowing them to access services and benefits provided to federally recognized tribes. The Tribe must submit a membership roll to the Secretary within 9 months of the Act's enactment. Additionally, the Tribe must establish a constitution and governing body. The Tribe must adopt a constitution and bylaws within 1 year of the Act's enactment through a secret ballot election. Until then, the interim governing documents will be in effect. Within 6 months of adopting the constitution, the Tribe must elect a governing body following the procedures outlined in the constitution and bylaws. The governing body of the Tribe will be elected according to the election procedures outlined in the interim governing documents. SEC. 7. LAND IN TRUST. The Secretary must take land in trust for a Tribe if the Tribe transfers all rights to the land. The Secretary is also required to negotiate with the tribal governing body to establish a reservation and develop a plan for it within two years of the enactment of the Act. Consultation with state and local officials is necessary to address their interests. The Secretary must consult with State and local officials and landowners adjacent to proposed reservation lands to address their interests and provide complete information on the plan, including restrictions. Consultation includes sharing information on the size, location, and anticipated effects of the reservation. The anticipated effects of the proposed reservation on State and local expenditures and tax revenues, State or local service to the Tribe, Federal services to be provided to the Tribe in the future, and services to be provided by the Tribe to its members on or off the reservation will be considered in the plan developed in accordance with subsection (c) and submitted to Congress for approval. Upon tribal governing body approval, the Secretary submits the plan to Congress for distribution to relevant committees. The plan includes a detailed statement on how all interested parties were notified. The Secretary submits a plan to Congress detailing consultations, testimony, and written comments received. Real property transferred to the Secretary for the Tribe must be held in the name of the United States for the Tribe's benefit, and must be located within certain restrictions. The Tribe can acquire privately owned lands for their benefit through willing-seller, willing-buyer transactions, without using eminent domain authority.
