    "content": "We introduce an adversarial exploration strategy in imitation learning, using a deep reinforcement learning agent and an inverse dynamics model. The agent generates challenging samples for the model to learn from, creating a competitive dynamic. A reward structure ensures the agent collects moderately difficult samples for effective imitation. Imitation learning has been successfully applied in various domains, including robot learning, autonomous navigation, manipulation tasks, and self-driving cars. The traditional approach involves training an imitator with expert demonstrations to learn a control policy. A large set of high-quality demonstrations is necessary for effective learning. Our method introduces an adversarial exploration strategy using a deep reinforcement learning agent and an inverse dynamics model to generate challenging samples for effective imitation. Experimental results show that our method is comparable to directly trained expert demonstrations and superior to other baselines without human priors. In state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms like DAgger and GAIL, high-quality demonstrations are crucial for effective training. However, a major challenge is the reliance on human supervision and the tendency for the learned policy to overfit to demonstration data. To address these issues, various methods have been explored to enhance generalizability, data efficiency, and reduce the need for human supervision. Initial efforts have focused on meta learning, where the imitator is trained from a meta learner to quickly adapt to new tasks. In state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms, high-quality demonstrations are essential for effective training. To overcome challenges like overfitting and reliance on human supervision, self-supervised imitation learning has emerged. This approach allows the imitator to collect training data autonomously, reducing the need for human intervention and expert supervision during training. It only requires demonstrations during inference, significantly decreasing the time and effort required from human experts. Recent research efforts in self-supervised imitation learning have focused on addressing challenges related to multi-modality and multi-step planning. Techniques such as forward consistency loss and forward regularizer have been explored to improve task performance. The issue of multi-step planning is often tackled using recurrent neural networks and step-by-step demonstrations. While these approaches show promising results, there is still room for further advancements in this field. Self-supervised IL approaches in BID13 show promise but have limitations. Inefficient data collection leads to poor exploration, affecting robustness and generalizability. Human bias in data sampling is common. Curiosity-driven exploration in BID12 focuses on novel states, not directly influential to the inverse dynamics model. It lacks applicability to continuous control domains and struggles in high dimensional action spaces. In this paper, a self-supervised IL scheme called adversarial exploration strategy is proposed to improve sample quality without dealing with multi-modality or multi-step planning. The model is trained with a deep reinforcement learning agent and an inverse dynamics model competing with each other to explore the environment efficiently and effectively. The proposed adversarial exploration strategy involves a deep reinforcement learning agent and an inverse dynamics model competing to collect training data efficiently. The DRL agent is rewarded for failing the inverse dynamics model, leading to the agent sampling harder examples. However, overly difficult examples can cause biased exploration and learning instability. To stabilize the learning curve of the inverse dynamics model, a reward structure is proposed to encourage moderate exploration difficulty. The self-regulating feedback between the DRL agent and the model constructs an exploration curriculum. Experiments validate this strategy on various robotic arm and hand manipulation tasks in OpenAI gym environments. The performance of the inverse dynamics model is examined and compared against self-supervised IL schemes, showing that it is more effective and data-efficient. The method is found to be comparable to expert demonstrations and superior to other self-supervised IL schemes, even without human priors. Additionally, the method is evaluated in environments with action space perturbations and achieves satisfactory success rates. The contributions of this work include introducing an adversarial exploration strategy for self-supervised IL, employing a competitive scheme for efficient exploration, introducing a reward structure for training stability, demonstrating the method on robotic manipulation tasks, and validating its generalizability to high-dimensional action spaces. The paper introduces an adversarial exploration strategy for self-supervised IL and validates its generalizability to tasks with high-dimensional action spaces. It is organized into sections covering background material, the proposed exploration strategy, experimental results, and a conclusion. The Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework is briefly reviewed, emphasizing the training of an agent to interact with an environment by taking actions based on a policy represented by a neural network. The agent aims to learn a policy to maximize rewards using policy gradient methods like Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). TRPO addresses high variance in gradient estimates, but is complex, while PPO is a newer method that approximates TRPO. Policy optimization (PPO) is an approximation to TRPO, offering superior generalizability and sample complexity while maintaining stability and reliability. An inverse dynamics model predicts the action required to reach the next observation from the current one, with trainable parameters iteratively updated to minimize loss during training. In the testing phase, observations from an expert demonstration are fed into the model at each timestep. The proposed adversarial exploration strategy involves a DRL agent P and an inverse dynamics model I, where I predicts actions based on observations generated by P exploring E using a policy \u03c0. The training methodology includes collecting training samples and stabilizing the training process. The inverse dynamics model I is modified to include an additional hidden vector h t for encoding information recurrently. The proposed framework involves an adversarial exploration strategy with a DRL agent P and an inverse dynamics model I. I is updated to minimize a formulated loss function, and the reward for P is based on this loss. The goal is to improve data collection efficiency and performance by maximizing rewards for P and minimizing a specific equation for I. The proposed framework involves an adversarial exploration strategy with a DRL agent P and an inverse dynamics model I. P focuses on exploring difficult samples to increase rewards, while I learns optimal parameters to minimize a specific equation. Training methodology is described in Algorithm 1, with P's policy parameterized by \u03b8 P and I's by \u03b8 I. Buffers Z P and Z I store training samples, and hyperparameters are set accordingly. The framework involves an adversarial exploration strategy with DRL agent P and inverse dynamics model I. Hyperparameters are set, and at each timestep, P perceives observations, takes actions, and updates parameters \u03b8 P. Samples are stored in buffers Z P and Z I, and \u03b8 P is updated every T P timesteps. At the end of each episode, \u03b8 I is updated using samples from Z I based on loss function L I. The training technique proposed involves reshaping r t to address the issue of overly difficult samples for learning. This technique is implemented through an adversarial exploration strategy with DRL agent P and inverse dynamics model I. The strategy includes initializing parameters, perceiving observations, predicting actions, and updating model parameters. Samples are stored in buffers Z P and Z I, with parameter updates occurring at specified timesteps. The technique reshapes r t to limit overly difficult samples for learning, using an adversarial exploration strategy with DRL agent P and inverse dynamics model I. Samples are stored in buffers Z P and Z I, with parameter updates at specified timesteps. The technique imposes a restriction on r t range, influencing learning speed and performance. The impact of a pre-defined threshold value \u03b4 on learning curve is analyzed in Section 4.5, with a supplementary example provided to illustrate the technique's effect. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the method in various robotic tasks, including low-and high-dimensional observation spaces, environments with high-dimensional action spaces, data efficiency compared to baseline methods, and robustness against action space perturbations. The study includes an experimental setup, results of robotic arm and hand manipulation tasks, and ablative analysis to validate design decisions. Evaluation was done on OpenAI gym BID3 environments simulated by MuJoCo. The study evaluates the effectiveness of a method for robotic manipulation tasks using OpenAI gym BID3 environments with low-and high-dimensional observations. The imitator model infers actions for arm and hand manipulation tasks based on gripper and target object positions and velocities. Visual observations from camera images are also used for experiments. The study evaluates a method for robotic manipulation tasks using OpenAI gym BID3 environments with low-and high-dimensional observations, including camera images. The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed adversarial exploration strategy in collecting training data for the imitator model. The strategy is compared against various self-supervised data collection methods, with experimental results evaluated and averaged over 20 trials. The experimental results are evaluated and averaged over 20 trials with different initial seeds. An imitator is trained using data from a self-supervised method, receiving expert demonstrations at the start of each episode. The imitator's performance is evaluated every 10K timesteps, and task-relevant settings are randomly configured before collecting successful demonstrations. The study compares a proposed methodology with four baseline methods in experiments involving training an imitator with expert demonstrations. The baseline methods include Random, Demo, and Curiosity, each utilizing different approaches for collecting training samples. The implementation details of the expert agent and the method for filtering out trivial episodes are provided in supplementary material. The study compares a proposed methodology with four baseline methods in experiments involving training an imitator with expert demonstrations. The proposed method trains a DRL agent using curiosity BID12 to collect training samples, replacing the DRL algorithm with PPO for fair comparison. Another baseline injects noise into the parameter space of a DRL agent for exploration without extrinsic rewards. Performance is compared on robotic arm manipulation tasks in continuous control domains. The study compares a proposed methodology with four baseline methods in experiments involving training an imitator with expert demonstrations. In FetchSlide, the movement of the object on the slippery surface is affected by friction and the force exerted by the gripper. The experimental results in low-and high-dimensional observation spaces are discussed, with learning curves plotted in Figs. 2 and 3. The proposed method shows superior or comparable performance to baselines in low-dimensional observation spaces. In FetchReach, all methods achieve a success rate of 1.0, indicating no need for complex exploration strategies. Our method learns faster than Demo. In FetchPush, our method is comparable to Demo and outperforms other baselines. It learns significantly faster in all tasks, especially in tasks requiring an accurate inverse dynamics model like FetchPickAndPlace. In high-dimensional observation spaces, our method outperforms all baselines in FetchPickAndPlace. However, in FetchSlide, none of the methods, including Demo, can successfully learn an inverse dynamics model, indicating challenges when the outcome is not solely dependent on the action. Curiosity performs poorly in FetchPush and FetchSlide compared to Random, while Noise fares even worse in all tasks. This suggests that Curiosity is not suitable for continuous control tasks, and parameter space noise strategy is not directly applicable to self-supervised IL. Further qualitative results are discussed in the supplementary material. Our method outperforms baseline methods in high-dimensional observation spaces, particularly excelling in FetchPickAndPlace. Curiosity and Noise perform poorly in these settings, with Curiosity even underperforming Random. Pre-training with 30K random samples is necessary for these methods to avoid early training errors. In the HandReach task, Demo outperforms all other methods significantly, with our method also surpassing baseline methods by achieving a success rate of 0.4 compared to their 0.2. The limited range of state space covered by self-supervised data-collection strategies hinders the training of inverse dynamics models in high-dimensional action spaces. The inverse dynamics models trained with data only imitate trivial poses, resulting in poor success rates. An imitator trained in an environment with action space perturbations validates the robustness of the adversarial exploration strategy. Noise is injected during training to assess the proposed data collection strategy's robustness. Performance change rates for different tasks are reported in Table 1, with the highest success rates with and without action space perturbations compared. Our method shows robustness to action space perturbations during training, maintaining performance in most tasks. It even improves performance in some cases, making it a practical choice for real-world settings. Ablative analysis is provided to evaluate the effectiveness of our method through investigation of training loss. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated through an analysis of the training loss distribution, stabilization technique, and the impact of \u03b4. The default value of \u03b4 is set to 1.5. The training loss distribution is visualized using a probability density function (PDF) plot, showing that the method concentrates on higher loss values compared to a random approach. The proposed stabilization technique motivates DRL agents to favor moderately hard samples, as shown in FIG3. The reward structure helps regulate the learning curve, as seen in FIG4. The stabilization technique significantly improves the learning curves of the DRL agent, as shown in FIG4. Despite the unbounded rewards, the technique ensures that rewards are regulated around \u03b4, leading to better performance compared to without stabilization. The proposed adversarial exploration strategy effectively collects difficult training data for the imitator, while the stabilization technique leads to superior performance by guiding the DRL agent to collect moderately hard samples, resulting in a stable learning curve. The value of \u03b4 plays a crucial role in the success rates of tasks, with a moderate value being necessary for the stabilization technique. The adaptive scaling technique for adjusting \u03b4 dynamically is a future direction. The adversarial exploration strategy presented in this paper enhances the training efficiency of a DRL agent and an inverse dynamics model by collecting difficult training data. Experimental results show improved data collection efficiency in robotic manipulation tasks and enhanced performance in both low- and high-dimensional observation spaces. The method is generalizable to environments with high-dimensional action spaces and robust to action space perturbations. Ablative analysis validates the effectiveness of the design. The adversarial exploration strategy improves training efficiency by focusing on interacting with objects in robotic manipulation tasks. This leads to a curriculum that enhances learning efficiency and biases data collection towards more significant samples. The method is effective in high-dimensional action spaces and robust to perturbations. The method discussed focuses on the exploration behavior of robotic arms, particularly in comparison to other exploration strategies like Random and Curiosity. It highlights the importance of extrinsic rewards in achieving success and effectiveness in data collection, especially in self-supervised IL. PPO is used as the RL agent for training sample collection due to its ease of use and good performance in minimizing the cost function while maintaining policy consistency. In this work, the PPO algorithm is used with a clipped surrogate objective to minimize the cost function with small policy deviations. The adaptive penalty on KL divergence is also discussed, but the clipped surrogate objective is chosen for better empirical performance. The experiments use the same network architecture for the inverse dynamics model across all methods, with different architectures for low-dimensional and high-dimensional observation settings. In the observation setting, a 3-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used with specific configurations. The features extracted by the CNNs are then passed to a fully connected layer with 512 hidden units. The DRL agent is updated periodically with a batch of transitions split into mini-batches. The hyperparameters are listed in Table 2. The baseline Curiosity is based on a curiosity-driven RL agent proposed in a previous work for efficient data collection. The curiosity-driven RL agent BID12 focuses on efficiency of data collection by using curiosity as an intrinsic reward signal. It formulates curiosity as the error in predicting the consequence of actions through a forward dynamics model. The network parameters are optimized by minimizing a loss function, and different architectures are used for low and high-dimensional observation settings. In high-dimensional observation settings, features extracted by the RL agent's CNNs are shared with \u03c6, a FC with 512 hidden units. The Demo baseline in FetchReach consists of 1,000 episodes, showing a significant performance gap compared to 100 episodes. Adding noise to actions during training tests the method's robustness. Adding noise to actions during training tests the method's robustness. The actual noisy action executed by the robot is defined as: \u00e2 t := \u00e2 t + N (0, \u03c3), where \u03c3 is set as 0.01. Our stabilization technique transforms rewards to negative distance to a specified \u03b4, encouraging the DRL agent to pursue rewards close to \u03b4 for higher rewards."
