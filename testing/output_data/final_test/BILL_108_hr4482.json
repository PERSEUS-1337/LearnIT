    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Long Island Sound Protection Act\" and prohibits the dumping of dredged material. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 is amended to include a prohibition on dumping dredged material in specific bodies of water, including Long Island Sound and its tributaries. The term 'means' in the context refers to various types of dredging projects, including Federal projects, non-Federal projects producing over 25,000 cubic yards of material, and multiple non-Federal projects in a covered body of water within a 180-day period. The term 'plan' is defined as the dredged material management plan. The term 'plan' refers to the dredged material management plan required for covered projects. Dredged material cannot be dumped into covered bodies of water unless it meets specific chemical concentration criteria and all requirements under this title. No dredged material can be dumped into covered bodies of water without approval from the Administrator and a determination that no feasible alternative to ocean disposal is available. This requirement is in accordance with section 227.6 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations. Before designation of any dredged material disposal site in a covered body of water, a dredged material management plan must be developed in consultation with various agencies and states. The dredged material management plan aims to identify sources, quantities, and contamination levels of dredged material for disposal. It also includes actions to reduce sediment and contaminant loading in dredged areas, as well as assess alternative disposal locations and treatment technologies. The dredged material management plan aims to identify sources, quantities, and contamination levels for disposal, including alternative disposal methods and beneficial uses such as upland disposal, containment, beach nourishment, and habitat construction. The dredged material management plan includes strategies to reduce sediment loading, analyze sources of sediment contamination, and recommend management measures to limit or reduce contamination levels. The dredged material management plan includes analysis of options for reducing dredging needs, decontamination technologies, and alternative methods of disposal and use of dredged material. The dredged material management plan includes public hearings in Connecticut and New York, federal agency support, and approval by the states within 60 days. After receiving the plan, the Governors of Connecticut and New York must inform the Secretary and Administrator of their approval or disapproval. Dredged material from a covered project cannot be dumped in a covered body of water unless it conforms to an approved plan by the Governors of Connecticut and New York. The dredged material must be dumped in a designated disposal site approved by the States of Connecticut and New York. No previously designated sites can be used until the plan is approved by both states. Authorization of $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 for paragraph implementation in Connecticut and New York."
