    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site Act of 1994\" and defines terms such as \"historic site,\" \"Museum,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Congress finds that the Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street in New York City is a significant survivor of buildings that housed immigrants during a major wave of immigration in American history. Millions of immigrants entered the US through New York Harbor, with many settling in the Lower East Side. The Lower East Side of New York City was a major destination for immigrants, with the Museum dedicated to interpreting immigrant life in the area. The tenement building at 97 Orchard Street is a National Historic Landmark with exceptional historical significance, recognized by the National Park Service. The Lower East Side Tenement is to be nationally significant and protected as an affiliated area of the National Park System while remaining under private ownership. The Act aims to preserve and interpret the themes of early tenement life, housing reform movement, and tenement architecture in the United States. It also ensures the continuation of the Lower East Side Tenement for interpreting the immigrant phenomenon associated with the area's history. The Act aims to enhance the interpretation of Castle Clinton National Monument and Ellis Island National Monument through cooperation with the Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site. The Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street, New York, is designated as a national historic site to further the purposes of the Act. The Secretary may enter into a cooperative agreement with the Museum to provide technical and financial assistance for the historic site, including restoration, interpretation, and maintenance. The agreement must include specific provisions to further the purposes of the Act. The Secretary, through the National Park Service, has access to public areas of the property for visitor tours and interpretation. Changes to the property require mutual agreement between the Secretary and other parties involved in the agreement. The Museum must provide an annual report to the Secretary and Congress detailing the use of assistance received. $6,400,000 is authorized for the purposes of this Act, with funds remaining available until expended. The title of the bill is amended to establish the Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site."
