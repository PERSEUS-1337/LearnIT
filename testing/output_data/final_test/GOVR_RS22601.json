    "content": "In October 2000, a coalition of democratic parties defeated Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in presidential elections, leading to a transition towards Western democratic and free market standards. Despite holding free and fair elections, Serbia faces challenges such as the global economic crisis, organized crime, and high-level corruption. The country aims for EU integration but faces obstacles due to concerns over relations with Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008. Serbia's recent elections in May 2012 saw the nationalist Serbian Progressive Party winning the majority of seats in the parliamentary vote. The Democratic Party led a pro-EU coalition that won 68 seats, while the Socialist Party of Serbia exceeded expectations by winning 45 seats. Other parties like the Democratic Party of Serbia and the Liberal Democratic Party also secured seats in the Serbian parliament. In the presidential election, outgoing President Tadic of the DS faced Tomislav Nikolic from the SNS. Tadic won first place with 26.7% of the vote, while Nikolic came in second with 25.5%. A runoff election was held between Tadic and Nikolic, resulting in Nikolic's victory with 49.55% of the vote. Tadic's defeat may have been due to low turnout among his supporters, possibly due to dissatisfaction with the country's economic situation and government corruption. Nikolic, formerly holding extreme nationalist views, has shifted towards the center and now aligns with the DS on EU membership. Negotiations for a new government saw the Progressives ceding the Prime Minister position to the Socialists, despite having more seats. Aleksandar Vucic took over leadership of the Progressives after Nikolic. The Serbian government, led by Aleksandar Vucic, faces economic challenges but has gained popularity through an anti-corruption campaign. Key officials include Defense Minister Vucic, Foreign Minister Ivan Mrkic, and speaker of the parliament Nebojsa Stefanovic. The government's efforts to combat corruption have been praised, but maintaining the rule of law is crucial. The Serbian government, under Aleksandar Vucic, is praised for its anti-corruption efforts, but it is crucial to maintain the rule of law in all investigations and trials. Changes in the political and legal systems are necessary to prevent future corruption. There is also a political controversy regarding the powers of the autonomous region of Vojvodina in northern Serbia. Ethnic tensions persist in the Presevo Valley region in southern Serbia, with sporadic incidents since a guerrilla conflict in 2000-2001. After sporadic incidents and problems in Kosovo, local Albanians claim discrimination and lack of funding from Belgrade. Some ethnic Albanian leaders want the region to join Kosovo, opposed by the US and international community. In the Presevo valley, leaders demand rights similar to Serbs in northern Kosovo after a 2013 agreement between Serbia and Kosovo. Serbia's economic growth was impacted by the global economic crisis starting in late 2008, fueled by loose monetary and fiscal policies. Serbia's economy was negatively impacted by the international economic crisis, leading to slow growth and high unemployment rates. The IMF expects a modest GDP increase in 2013 and 2014. Serbian net salaries are low, and the currency has depreciated sharply. The country is seeking a precautionary loan arrangement with the IMF to support its policies. The IMF wants Serbia to make credible efforts to cut its budget deficit and public debt before approving a new loan agreement. The economic crisis led to a drop in foreign direct investment in Serbia, prompting the government to buy the Smederovo steel works and OTE's 20% share in Telekom Srbija to prevent job losses. Serbia faces pressure from the IMF to privatize state-owned firms due to budgetary problems. The government bought OTE's 20% share in Telekom Srbija to prevent job losses. Serbia's diplomatic efforts regarding Kosovo faced challenges, with the ICJ ruling in 2010 that Kosovo's independence declaration was legal. After the ICJ ruling in 2010, Serbia agreed to talks with Kosovo under EU mediation. The dialogue initially focused on technical issues but later shifted to the main political issue of Kosovo's independence. Prime Minister Dacic and Kosovo Prime Minister Thaci met in October 2012 to elevate the talks to a higher political level. Technical agreements have been reached on various issues such as free movement of persons, customs stamps, and civil registries. Implementation of various agreements on border management and regional cooperation has been slow. A technical protocol on integrated border management between Kosovo and Serbia was established in 2012. Difficulties persist regarding the status of Serbian-majority municipalities in northern Kosovo, with talks of potential partitioning. The current situation involves discussions about potential partitioning in the Presevo valley and northern Kosovo, but the Kosovo government strongly opposes it. Serbian leaders have faced pressure from the United States and EU countries to refrain from pursuing partition, as it could destabilize the region. The key EU countries have warned Serbia that continuing to consider partition as an option would harm its EU membership prospects. Serbia currently controls northern Kosovo, but the international community opposes any partition plans. Belgrade maintains de facto control over northern Kosovo through parallel institutions, opposed by Kosovo government and international community. Kosovo demands dissolution of parallel institutions and control over the region. US, Germany, and other countries call for dismantling of Serbian military and intelligence structures in Kosovo. In December 2012, EU member states agreed that any agreement should ensure Kosovo has a \"single institutional and administration set-up.\" Serbia pushed for an association of Serb municipalities in northern Kosovo with executive powers, but Kosovar leaders rejected giving it significant powers to prevent de facto partition. In the 10th round of their EU-mediated dialogue, Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci initialed a 15-point agreement for the normalization of relations. The agreement includes the creation of an \"Association/Community of Serbian-majority municipalities\" in Kosovo with oversight in various areas. The police in northern Kosovo will be part of Kosovo's unified police force and paid by Pristina, with a Kosovo Serb as the police commander selected by Pristina. The ethnic composition of the local police in the north will reflect the local population. The judicial system in northern and southern Kosovo will operate under Kosovo's legal framework, with a majority of Kosovo Serb judges in the Appellate Court in Pristina. New municipal elections in the north will be held in 2013 under Kosovo law. Kosovo's parliament and the Serbian government approved the agreement, despite initial opposition in Serbia. Despite initial opposition in Serbia, the government approved the agreement with Kosovo on April 22. The Serbian parliament overwhelmingly supported the negotiations with Kosovo on April 29, with most opposition parties also backing the report. However, Serbia still does not recognize Kosovo as an independent state, viewing it as an autonomous province. The agreement between Serbia and Kosovo faces challenges in implementation, with strong opposition from Serb leaders in northern Kosovo who reject Kosovo government presence. Kosovo Serb leaders organized a referendum in 2012 rejecting Kosovo government institutions. Prime Minister Dacic aims for voluntary agreement but also considers other options. The Serbian government wants northern Kosovo leaders to agree to implementation voluntarily, with the ability to pressure them by cutting off salaries. Progress must be made by June for EU membership negotiations. Key EU countries emphasize dismantling Serbian security structures in Kosovo. Holding new local elections in northern Kosovo under Kosovo laws is challenging due to potential low Serb turnout. KFOR is expected to play a role in the agreement's implementation. Serbia demanded Kosovo pledge not to deploy the Kosovo Security Force during talks. Serbia demanded that Kosovo pledge not to deploy the Kosovo Security Force or its special police units in northern Kosovo without local leaders' consent. Prime Minister Dacic received a letter from NATO Secretary General pledging that such deployments would only occur with KFOR's consent, in cases of natural disaster, and in consultation with local Serbian leaders. Serbia's foreign policy focuses on EU integration and hindering international recognition of Kosovo's independence through legal and diplomatic means. Serbia has tried to navigate relationships with EU countries recognizing Kosovo's independence while strengthening ties with Russia and China for economic benefits and to maintain opposition to Kosovo's independence. US-Serbian relations have improved since US recognition of Kosovo's independence in 2008, but the issue still affects relations. The EU signed a trade agreement with Serbia in 2008. The EU signed a trade agreement with Serbia in 2008, granting trade concessions and enhancing cooperation in various fields. The Netherlands initially blocked implementation until Serbia showed cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Serbia began implementing trade provisions unilaterally in 2009 to support EU integration. Serbia's cooperation with the ICTY led to the EU allowing key trade provisions of the SAA to be implemented before ratification. Most EU countries ratified the accord by April 2013, with only Lithuania remaining. Serbia applied for EU membership in December 2009, but progress has been slow due to meeting stringent requirements and \"enlargement fatigue\" in some EU countries. Kosovo remains a significant issue for Serbia's EU membership prospects. The EU countries have differing stances on recognizing Kosovo's independence, with Serbia rejecting EU membership if it's a condition. Despite divisions, the EU has pushed Serbia to cooperate with EULEX in Kosovo and engage in talks with the Kosovo government since 2008. In October 2011, the European Commission recommended that Serbia be given the status of a membership candidate if it re-engages in dialogue with Kosovo and implements agreements already reached. Serbia may be pressured by influential EU states to recognize Kosovo's independence or give up its EU membership hopes. Serbia has taken steps to normalize relations with Kosovo, including respecting regional cooperation principles, Energy Community Treaty provisions, and agreements reached. In February 2012, they agreed on Kosovo's participation in regional institutions as \"Kosovo*,\" acknowledging UN Resolution 1244 and a 2010 ICJ ruling. They also reached a protocol on Integrated Border. In March 2012, the EU accepted Serbia as a membership candidate after reaching agreements on Integrated Border Management. The EU made it clear that the start of negotiations would depend on energy and telecommunications agreements. In April 2013, the European Commission recommended granting Serbia a starting date for EU membership talks, pending approval by EU member states in June 2013. Serbian citizens have been allowed to travel visa-free to the EU since December 2009. Since 2009, Serbian citizens can travel visa-free to the EU, seen as a significant benefit of the pro-EU policy. The EU may suspend visa-free travel if there is a surge in illegal immigration, but Serbia has not been affected yet due to measures against illegal migrants. In 2006, Serbia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program to enhance cooperation with NATO. Serbia has pledged to enhance cooperation with NATO through the Partnership for Peace program, supporting KFOR in Kosovo but criticizing its role in overseeing the Kosovo Security Force. Serbian leaders back NATO membership for other countries in the region but not for Serbia due to low public support stemming from memories of NATO's 1999 bombing and anger over Kosovo's independence. Less than 20% of the Serbian public favor NATO membership. Serbia's relations with neighboring countries have improved, but tensions persist over issues like genocide accusations. In 2007, the ICJ cleared Serbia of genocide but found it in violation of international law for not preventing the Srebrenica massacre. Serbia later filed its own ICJ suit against Croatia. Bosnian leaders have criticized Serbia for not reining in Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik. Serbia maintains it respects Bosnia's sovereignty. Serbia respects Bosnia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, abiding by the Dayton Peace Agreement. President Tadic urged the Serbian parliament to condemn crimes in Srebrenica. President Nikolic expressed regret for the atrocities but also made statements straining relations with Bosnia. Serbia played a significant role in U.S. Balkan policy post-Yugoslavia's collapse. U.S. officials viewed the Milosevic regime as a catalyst for regional wars in the 1990s, leading to economic sanctions. The United States played a significant role in the negotiations that ended the war in Bosnia in 1995 and bombed Serbia in 1999 to force Belgrade to relinquish control of Kosovo. U.S. aid to Serbia has declined in recent years, reflecting changing global priorities and Serbia's EU membership candidacy. Serbia is seen as an important part of the U.S. goal of a Europe \"whole, free, and at peace.\" In FY2011, Serbia received $45 million in U.S. aid for political and economic purposes. In FY2011, Serbia received $45 million in U.S. aid for political and economic reforms, including funding for Foreign Military Financing (FMF), IMET military training, and Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining and Related (NADR) aid. The aid continued in FY2012 and FY2013, with decreasing amounts allocated for political and economic reform, FMF, IMET, and NADR funding. The U.S. aid for political reform aims to strengthen Serbia. The U.S. aid for Serbia includes funding for political reform, strengthening democratic institutions, the rule of law, and civil society. It also supports the justice system, local governments, anti-corruption efforts, independent media, and citizen involvement in government. Aid is used to improve the free market economy, reform the financial sector, enhance investment climate, strengthen export and border controls, and participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Military aid helps prepare for peacekeeping missions and allows for greater bilateral military cooperation. The United States provides security assistance and military cooperation with Serbia, including joint exercises and military-to-military contacts. Despite U.S. urging, Serbia did not contribute troops to the NATO-led ISAF peacekeeping force in Afghanistan. The U.S. granted duty-free treatment to some Serbian products in 2005. The main issue in U.S.-Serbian relations is Kosovo, with the U.S. recognizing Kosovo's independence in 2008. Serbian rioters attacked the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade in response to this decision. In response to Kosovo's independence, Serbian rioters attacked the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade. Serbian police were absent initially, leading to speculation of deliberate withdrawal. U.S. officials expressed outrage and warned Serbian leaders of consequences. President Tadic condemned the attack and promised an investigation. Twelve individuals faced trial for the incident in April 2013. The U.S. continues to press Serbian authorities on the unresolved case of the Bytyqi brothers, U.S. citizens murdered by Serbian troops in 1999. In May 2009, Vice President Joseph Biden visited Serbia and emphasized the importance of improving ties with the country. He stated that the United States did not expect Serbia to recognize Kosovo's independence but urged cooperation to find solutions benefiting all people in Kosovo, including the Serbian minority. Biden's visit set the tone for the Obama Administration's policy towards Serbia. Biden emphasized improving ties with Serbia, urging cooperation for the benefit of all in Kosovo, including the Serbian minority. The US supports Serbian EU membership and expanding security cooperation. Clinton praised progress in Serbia-Kosovo negotiations. In June, Secretary of State Clinton praised progress in Serbia-Kosovo negotiations and supported Serbia's path towards EU integration. She congratulated Nikolic on his presidential victory and emphasized the importance of establishing transparent relations with Kosovo. US diplomats visited Belgrade to reinforce the message of EU integration and normalizing relations with the new government. The new government in Serbia is urged to continue EU integration and normalize relations with Kosovo, including dismantling the Serbian security presence in northern Kosovo. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited the region in late 2012, emphasizing solidarity between Brussels and Washington on Balkan policy and stressing the importance of negotiating in good faith in EU-brokered talks. The United States supports talks to normalize relations between Serbia and Kosovo for EU integration. Clinton emphasized Kosovo's sovereignty as non-negotiable. Kerry praised an agreement on northern Kosovo and urged its speedy implementation. The US remains committed to the region's integration into a peaceful Europe. Threats of the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on Kosovo-Serbia relations. Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan Moore expressed strong Administration support for the April 19 agreement and emphasized close U.S.-EU policy coordination. Subcommittee Chairman Representative Dana Rohrabacher expressed skepticism about the agreement, supporting referendums in Serb-majority areas of northern Kosovo and ethnic Albanian-majority areas of southern Serbia. Moore reiterated the Administration's opposition to this approach, citing potential for further conflict in the region."
