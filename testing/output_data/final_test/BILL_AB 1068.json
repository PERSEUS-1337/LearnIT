    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Priority Project Parity Act of 2015, also known as CEQA, aims to disclose environmental impacts of projects and require feasible mitigation measures. Mitigation measures must align with project objectives, fall under the lead agency's jurisdiction, and be easily implemented. If a project would have a significant unavoidable adverse impact on the physical environment, an agency may approve it by explaining the overriding benefits that informed the decision. California courts have ruled that lawsuits challenging compliance with CEQA can be brought by any party for any reason, including those seeking competitive advantage, protecting private property values, or opposing projects that may benefit lower income or diverse populations. The Governor\u2019s Office of Planning and Research has identified over 100 environmental impact topics for CEQA compliance, leading to increased cost and complexity. Their guidance has raised uncertainty and litigation risks by proposing requirements that advocate for regulatory reversals and ambiguous advice. Three private sector law firms found that lead agencies often fail to comply with CEQA requirements in nearly half of all cases, even with detailed environmental impact reports. Projects approved through a less rigorous process face even higher rates of judicial challenges. The majority of adverse court decisions required project approval to be vacated for further environmental studies under CEQA. Despite widespread confusion and abuse of litigation tactics in CEQA compliance, the Legislature has not implemented systematic reforms to address interpretation issues alongside other environmental mandates in California's complex legal framework. The presence of a lawsuit challenging CEQA compliance, coupled with unfavorable judicial outcomes, hinders timely access to funding for the project. Legislative leadership sponsors last-minute legislation for favored projects, exempting them from CEQA or limiting judicial remedies. These projects, like sports facilities and prisons, are sheltered from scrutiny, regardless of sustainability requirements. This process is known as the \"transactional\" model for implementing CEQA. The transactional model for implementing CEQA allows legislative leaders to exempt priority projects from environmental scrutiny, regardless of sustainability requirements. A new compliance pathway is proposed for projects identified as priorities by each Member of the Senate and Assembly. Section 21168.10 of the Public Resources Code allows each Member of the Legislature to nominate a priority project in their district annually. The Governor can designate a project as a priority if it creates 100 new jobs, aligns with the region's sustainable communities strategy, and commits to staying in the location for at least five years. A project can be designated as a priority project within 30 days of approval by the lead agency, following the submittal of the project proposal for environmental review. Within 10 days of project designation, the Governor notifies the lead agency and Office of Planning and Research. The lead agency must inform the public and stakeholders in all relevant project documents or notices. If no such documents exist, the lead agency must notify the public and stakeholders directly. The lead agency for a priority project must complete all required notices and an environmental impact report, which may tier from an earlier report and focus on new or more severe adverse impacts. A new environmental impact report is not needed for a priority project already included in a prior report, but an addendum must be prepared. The court cannot stop a priority project unless it poses an imminent threat to public health and safety. The court can only enjoin specific activities of a priority project if it poses a threat to public health and safety or adversely affects important Native American artifacts, historical, archaeological, or ecological values. SEC. 4. This act will not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
