    "content": "The post-World War II era has seen a global push towards liberalizing trade and establishing frameworks for resolving disputes. Trade agreements aim to align government policies with citizens' interests, addressing issues like trade policy failure and power imbalances in negotiations. International trade law has evolved to enforce compliance despite domestic pressures. International trade law has evolved to enforce compliance despite shifting domestic pressures, with an interplay between domestic and global trade law. Trade agreements have broadened to encompass aspects of domestic policymaking and establish dispute settlement mechanisms, leading to criticism of infringing national sovereignty. The legal framework governing trade-related measures includes international agreements and domestic laws, with a focus on those most commonly implicated by U.S. trade interests and policy. The report discusses international trade agreements, including the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements and free trade agreements, focusing on obligations to liberalize international trade. Trade issues such as dumping are governed by both international agreements and federal laws. After World War II, developed nations aimed to establish an open trade network to boost the global economy. This led to the creation of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs 1947 (GATT 1947) as a temporary measure until the International Trade Organization (ITO) Charter could be negotiated. Trade agreements can be multilateral, plurilateral, bilateral, or regional, each with its corresponding body of domestic law. The GATT 1947 was intended as a temporary measure until the ITO Charter could be established, but the ITO never materialized. Despite its provisional nature, the GATT 1947 became a permanent fixture in international trade. It was not considered a comprehensive trade agreement and mainly consisted of the commercial policy provisions of the ITO charter. Contracting Parties engaged in rounds of multilateral trade negotiations over the years to address concerns about the GATT 1947's strength and breadth. The Uruguay Round (1986-1994) and subsequent Doha Development Round aimed to liberalize markets, lower tariffs, and address trade barriers. The Uruguay Round led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) through the Marrakesh Agreement, which includes various multilateral agreements on trade in goods, services, and intellectual property rights. Additionally, the Dispute Settlement Understanding was created to resolve disputes among WTO Members. The Marrakesh Agreement established the World Trade Organization (WTO) and includes various agreements on trade. The GATT 1994, part of the WTO Agreement, sets maximum tariffs and includes the GATT 1947, protocols, waivers, and interpretations. The agreements must be accepted by countries for WTO membership. The Uruguay Round Agreements Act implemented these agreements in U.S. law in 1994. The GATT, part of the WTO Agreement, sets maximum tariffs and disciplines trade-restricting measures. It prohibits discrimination between \"like products\" based on origin, outlined in Articles I and III. The term \"like product\" lacks a precise definition in the GATT. The GATT does not provide a precise definition of \"like product.\" WTO panels analyze products on a case-by-case basis to determine if they are in a competitive relationship based on properties, end uses, consumer preferences, and tariff classification. Article I of the GATT requires MFN treatment, meaning any advantage granted to one country must be granted to all WTO Members for similar products. The GATT does not define \"like product\" precisely, but WTO panels assess products case by case to determine if they are in a competitive relationship based on properties, end uses, consumer preferences, and tariff classification. Article I of the GATT mandates MFN treatment, requiring any advantage given to one country to be extended to all WTO Members for similar products. Advantage under Article I:1 can include variations in procedural and administrative import requirements, such as licensing requirements. WTO panels ruled in EC \u2013 Bananas III that the EU's additional licensing requirements on imports from certain WTO Members constituted an origin-discriminatory advantage. Measures can be considered advantageous even if they are origin neutral, and products can be deemed \"like\" under Article I:1 even if they have different tariff classifications or are not exact duplicates. Panels and the Appellate Body determine the \"likeness\" of products. WTO panels and the Appellate Body assess the \"likeness\" of products by examining their characteristics, end-uses, tariff classification, and consumers' tastes. If a measure confers a trade advantage on \"like\" products, it must be unconditional to comply with Article I:1. Different interpretations of the term have been adopted by WTO panels. The WTO panels have different interpretations of the term \"unconditionally\" when assessing trade advantages for \"like\" products. Conditions attached to an advantage must not discriminate based on countries of origin or destination. Measures must be origin-neutral to avoid violating the MFN principle. In the Canada - Autos case, a WTO panel examined a measure with potential discriminatory impacts on imports from certain WTO Members. In Canada - Autos, a WTO panel found that a duty exemption for car imports created origin-based discrimination among WTO Members due to criteria favoring U.S.-owned manufacturers expanding production in Canada. The panel ruled the exemption violated Article I:1. The WTO panel ruled that Canada's import duty exemption and Indonesia's measure exempting certain cars from import duties were both found to be inconsistent with Article I:1 due to their discriminatory effects favoring specific sources of auto imports. The WTO panel ruled that tax advantages discriminated against products from WTO Members based on their origin, violating Article III's national treatment principle. Article III prohibits using internal taxes and regulations to protect domestic industries. Article III of the WTO prohibits discrimination against products from WTO Members based on their origin, whether through internal taxes or regulations. This includes measures that treat foreign products less favorably than domestic ones in internal transactions. Examples of such measures include local content requirements and advertising bans. Article III of the WTO prohibits discrimination against products based on their origin, including local content requirements, advertising bans, and labeling requirements. Measures that tax particular products are governed by Article III:2, while measures that tax taxpayers for engaging in specific behavior are assessed under Article III:4. Border measures can also be subject to Article III:4 if they affect importation or exportation. The conditions of competition between domestic and imported products in the internal market determine whether a law, regulation, or requirement is covered by Article III:4. WTO panels have found that these conditions can be modified by measures regulating products, manufacturers, or producers. Thailand implemented measures to regulate the sale of imported cigarettes, imposing more requirements on resellers compared to domestic cigarettes. The aim was to ensure both domestic and imported products were subject to the same regulatory regime and legal liabilities, as importers were not responsible for paying taxes on their cigarettes, posing a risk of tax evasion. Thailand argued that the measures were necessary to prevent this and ensure fair competition. Thailand's measures regulating the sale of imported cigarettes were found to be inconsistent with WTO rules, as they imposed additional requirements on resellers of imported cigarettes compared to domestic ones. The measures raised operating costs for selling imported cigarettes, leading to less favorable treatment for imported products. The WTO panel and Appellate Body agreed that these measures violated Article III:4 of the GATT. The GATT aims to reduce tariffs over time and requires WTO Members to adhere to their submitted tariff schedules. Tariffs on goods from other Members must not be higher than the listed rates. Exceptions include internal taxes and antidumping duties. Despite the challenges in enforcing Article II of the GATT, which governs tariff schedules, countries must rely on these schedules to determine the appropriate tariff rate for goods. Disagreements often arise among WTO Members regarding the classification of specific products, as seen in the EC \u2013 Chicken Classification case where Brazil contested the EU's classification of fresh chicken packed in salt. The EU regulation distinguishes between salted and fresh chicken cuts based on salt impregnation levels. GATT Article VIII prohibits fees that protect domestic products or tax imports for fiscal purposes. The GATT Article VIII prohibits fees that protect domestic products or tax imports for fiscal purposes. One early dispute involved a processing fee charged by the U.S. Customs Service on commercial merchandise entering the United States, which was found to be inconsistent with GATT rules. The fee was based on the appraised value of the merchandise, not on the actual costs incurred by the Customs Service. The U.S. processing fee and Argentina's ad valorem duty on textile and footwear imports were found to be inconsistent with GATT Article VIII:1 as they exceeded the approximate cost of services provided to individual importers. Argentina calculated minimum duties based on average import prices, which was deemed a violation of the GATT rule. Argentina applied specific minimum duty or ad valorem duty on imports, with the ad valorem duty being higher. The panel ruled this practice inconsistent with Article VIII:1 as it had no fixed maximum fee. In another case, the US was barred from increasing bonding requirements on imports from the European Communities to secure future additional import duties. The United States was found in non-compliance with a WTO decision regarding increased bonding requirements for early release of merchandise. Article IX of the GATT regulates marks of origin laws, ensuring most favored nation treatment in labeling requirements for products. Article IX of the GATT regulates origin marking laws to ensure fair labeling requirements for products, aiming to reduce trade barriers. In a GATT panel case, Mexico's claims against the US Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act were rejected, which imposed penalties for misleading labels on tuna products related to dolphin-friendly harvesting methods. The GATT panel agreed with the United States that labeling provisions for dolphin-friendly tuna were subject to nondiscrimination rules, not marks of origin rules. Article XI of the GATT prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports and exports. Quantitative restrictions, such as embargoes and quotas, hinder the entry of products into a country's market. Article XI of the GATT prohibits such restrictions, emphasizing a preference for tariffs over non-tariff barriers. Tariffs are seen as more transparent and less disruptive to trade compared to quantitative restrictions. Import and export restrictions, unlike quantitative restrictions, can be reduced over time and are frequently challenged in WTO dispute settlement proceedings. In a specific case involving a U.S. ban on shrimp imports, the WTO panel found it inconsistent with GATT obligations, raising concerns about similar measures that restrict imports based on specific criteria. WTO panels have also deemed discretionary licensing requirements as prohibited quantitative restrictions. Discretionary licensing requirements are considered prohibited quantitative restrictions under WTO rules. Even if licenses are granted universally to eligible applicants, the authority's unfettered discretion to deny a license can still violate Article XI:1. A GATT case highlighted that lengthy approval processes for licenses can also restrict exports, even without mandatory laws or regulations. For example, Japan's three-month delays in the export licensing process were found to hinder exports, leading to a violation of Article XI:1. The licensing agency faced a surge in applications after raising the threshold for semiconductor exports without a license. This led to significant delays in processing applications, violating WTO rules on quantitative restrictions. Despite exceptions in Article XI, the three-month delays were deemed to hinder exports. The GATT articles address issues such as grading, marketing, and import restrictions in international trade. Article XX provides exceptions to GATT provisions, requiring measures to not discriminate or restrict trade unjustifiably. Article XX provides exceptions to GATT provisions, including measures necessary for public morals, human/animal/plant health, prison labor products, national treasures protection, and conservation of natural resources. It serves as an affirmative defense in WTO disputes, with the defending Member needing to prove that the measures fall within the exceptions outlined in Article XX. The defending Member must demonstrate that the measure falls under an Article XX exception by proving its necessity to achieve a specific goal, such as protecting human, animal, or plant health. This involves showing that the measure is important, contributes to the intended ends, and that its impact on international commerce is outweighed by its benefits. The complaining Member can challenge this by presenting less restrictive alternatives, which the defending Member must then prove to be ineffective or unfeasible. The defending Member must show that a measure under Article XX exceptions satisfies the \"chapeau\" by avoiding discrimination between countries and not being a disguised restriction on trade. The chapeau imposes strict requirements to differentiate legitimate interests protection from circumventing WTO obligations. Few reports have detailed standards for identifying disguised trade restrictions. The analysis of a measure as a disguised restriction on international trade involves scrutinizing the intent behind its application for signs of protectionism. WTO panels may also consider discriminatory effects on foreign industries. Predicting if a measure is indefensible under Article XX due to being a disguised trade restriction is challenging due to the rudimentary nature of WTO jurisprudence in this area. The WTO panels and Appellate Body have declared measures inconsistent with Article XX due to arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination. They prefer measures agreed upon internationally over unilateral or coercive ones. Their interpretation of \"discrimination\" and \"arbitrary or unjustifiable\" influences their decisions. The WTO panels and Appellate Body assess discriminatory measures to determine if they are arbitrary or unjustifiable. They consider whether the discrimination has a legitimate cause in line with Article XX objectives. For example, in U.S. \u2013 Shrimp, the Appellate Body reviewed a measure prohibiting shrimp imports from uncertified countries. The Appellate Body found the U.S. shrimp import ban unjustifiable due to discrimination in negotiations with WTO Members and lack of international cooperation efforts. In a subsequent decision, U.S. \u2013 Shrimp (Article 21.5), the Appellate Body clarified international cooperation. Malaysia challenged the adequacy of U.S. measures in implementing the decision. The Department of State revised guidelines for shrimp imports certification based on environmental impact and regulatory effectiveness compared to U.S. standards. The United States engaged in international negotiations with Malaysia and other countries regarding shrimp fishing conditions. Despite not reaching an agreement with Malaysia, the discrimination caused by the U.S. embargo and shrimp import certification procedures was deemed not \"arbitrary or unjustifiable\" due to the U.S.'s efforts to avoid it. Article XXI of the GATT allows for exceptions in cases of national security interests. Article XXI of the GATT allows for exceptions in cases of national security interests, permitting noncompliance in certain situations deemed necessary to protect essential security interests. This provision aims to remove legitimate national security matters from GATT obligations and discourage the use of the exception for measures with commercially inspired goals. Some countries, like the United States, interpret Article XXI as \"self-judging,\" allowing each WTO Member to determine if a particular matter is contrary to its essential security interests. Article XXI of the GATT allows for exceptions in cases of national security interests, permitting noncompliance in certain situations deemed necessary to protect essential security interests. Each WTO Member may determine if a matter is contrary to its essential security interests, and this determination cannot be reviewed by WTO panels or the Appellate Body. Despite the absence of case law, Article XXI has influenced diplomatic discourse and has been used to justify measures such as the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. The LIBERTAD Act strengthened the embargo against Cuba, holding parties liable for trafficking in expropriated property from U.S. citizens. The European Union raised concerns at the WTO, arguing that the Act violated trade agreements by restricting E.U. companies trading with Cuba. The U.S. defended the Act under Article XXI, which allows exceptions for national security interests. The U.S. defended the LIBERTAD Act under Article XXI at the WTO, arguing it was justified by national security concerns. The dispute was resolved diplomatically with a Memorandum of Understanding, avoiding WTO proceedings under Article XXIII for dispute settlement. The GATT allows recourse to WTO dispute settlement procedures when a benefit is nullified or impaired, often due to a violation of obligations. Proving nullification or impairment requires showing affected imports benefiting from a WTO agreement concession and their competitive position being upset by the challenged measure. Disputes over non-violative actions are less common than those alleging violations of WTO agreements. The GATT allows recourse to WTO dispute settlement procedures when a benefit is nullified or impaired by a challenged measure violating WTO obligations. If a Member demonstrates a violation, there is a presumption of nullification or impairment, shifting the burden to the defending Member to disprove it. Participation in free trade agreements and customs unions may conflict with the MFN obligation due to granting preferential treatment. Parties in free trade agreements and customs unions can offer preferential treatment to each other's goods under Article XXIV of the GATT. This article allows for the formation of customs unions or free trade areas as a defense for measures that would otherwise be inconsistent with GATT rules. The criteria for justifying these measures under Article XXIV are still unclear, particularly regarding how a WTO panel would determine if a measure meets the standard. Members of these agreements must eliminate duties and trade restrictions on \"substantially all\" trade between them. The \"substantially all\" standard in customs unions and free trade areas allows flexibility in liberalizing trade. In Argentina \u2013 Footwear case, Article XXIV:8(a) did not prohibit safeguard measures on customs union members. WTO agreements from the Uruguay Round are binding on Members, implemented in U.S. law through the URAA signed by President Clinton in 1994. The WTO agreements discussed here were signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994. These agreements impose substantive requirements on WTO Members and are frequently cited in disputes. Article VI of the GATT addresses dumping practices that harm domestic industries in other Member territories. The Antidumping Agreement under the GATT 1994 provides requirements for conducting antidumping investigations and imposing duties on dumped exports. A domestic industry can trigger an investigation by submitting a written application supported by producers of \"like products\" representing a greater percentage and at least 25% of total production. The WTO Members must inform the Committee on Antidumping Practices when initiating anti-dumping actions and provide reports on ongoing investigations. Dumping is defined as selling a product in a foreign market at a price lower than its normal value. Calculating the dumping margin involves determining the normal value and export price of the product, with flexibility in methodology allowed under certain circumstances. Article 2.7 of the AD Agreement allows the use of surrogate country data for price comparisons in anti-dumping investigations. The dumping margin is calculated by comparing the export price with the normal value of the product. Fair comparisons at the same level of trade and time are required. Disputes often arise over the methodology used to calculate the dumping margin, with \"zeroing\" being a contentious issue. The practice of \"zeroing\" in assessing dumping margins is a common issue in WTO disputes. Dumping must cause injury to the domestic industry to warrant anti-dumping duties. Factors like import volume, price effects, and impact on domestic producers are considered. The term \"domestic industry\" refers to domestic producers of a like product. Additional factors are relevant when investigating threats of injury. The WTO AD Agreement requires a Member to prove that dumping causes injury to the domestic industry. It mandates a non-attribution requirement to separate injurious effects from other factors. The antidumping duty imposed should be adequate to remove the injury and lifted when no longer necessary. Members must review the need for continued duty when requested. The Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement) expands on the original provisions of the GATT, addressing measures to offset subsidies and requiring Members to notify and discuss limiting subsidies causing harm. However, it lacks clear definitions and comprehensive rules for subsidies. The SCM Agreement was developed to discipline Members' use of subsidies and their responses to countering the effects of certain subsidies. It provides a more precise definition of subsidy as a financial contribution by a government within a WTO Member's territory that confers a benefit. The SCM Agreement defines a subsidy as a financial contribution by a government that confers a benefit. WTO panels interpret \"benefit\" broadly to include favorable terms compared to the marketplace. Members can respond to subsidized imports by seeking withdrawal of the subsidy through dispute settlement or imposing countervailing duties. The SCM Agreement categorizes subsidies into prohibited and actionable. Prohibited subsidies are contingent on export performance or using domestic over imported products. If deemed prohibited, the WTO recommends immediate withdrawal. Actionable subsidies may lead to dispute settlement if they cause adverse effects on the complaining Member's interests. The WTO dispute settlement process allows for countervailing duties to be imposed on subsidized imports if they cause injury to domestic industries, nullification of WTO benefits, or serious prejudice to a Member's interests. These duties aim to restore benefits under WTO agreements and can be imposed without prior consultations in certain cases. The WTO allows countervailing duties on subsidized imports without prior consultations if the investigation follows SCM Agreement rules. The \"Boeing-Airbus cases\" involved disputes between the US and EU over subsidies to Airbus and Boeing. The U.S. provided subsidies to Boeing, including tax incentives, access to NASA and DOD facilities, and payments for research. Safeguard measures are temporary restrictions on imports to help domestic industries adjust. These measures can include quotas, tariffs, and tariff rate quotas, but must be product-specific. Members affected by safeguards are entitled to trade compensation. The foundation for domestic and international safeguard law is Article XIX of the GATT, allowing Members to apply safeguards when imports are increasing and causing serious injury to domestic producers. Both U.S. law and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards are based on Article XIX, outlining substantive and procedural requirements for safeguard measures. Today, all safeguard measures must comply with both Article XIX of the GATT and the Agreement on Safeguards. The Agreement on Safeguards requires a Member to apply safeguard measures only when increased imports cause serious injury to the domestic industry. The legality of a safeguard measure depends on recent, significant increases in imports, with precedence given to the most recent import data. Older import trends are not considered for imposing safeguards. Rules of origin determine the source of imported goods and the restrictions and duties that apply. It can be challenging to determine a product's country of origin due to global supply chains. Preferential rules of origin allow goods to enter a country on better terms based on trade agreements. Nonpreferential rules of origin establish a product's country of origin. Nonpreferential rules of origin determine a product's country of origin for various purposes, including trade agreements and duties. Different countries have varying standards for determining origin, such as the \"substantial transformation\" standard used by the United States. The WTO Agreement on Rules of Origin aims to establish a uniform approach among member countries. The WTO Agreement on Rules of Origin aims to establish a uniform set of nonpreferential rules of origin among member countries. However, negotiations are delayed, and Article 2 of the Agreement provides guidance during the transition period, including national treatment and MFN requirements, and restrictions on using rules of origin for protectionist purposes. The WTO Agreement on Rules of Origin aims to establish nonpreferential rules of origin, with Article 2 providing guidance during the transition period. Members have discretion in designing rules of origin until harmonization is completed, but transparency is required through notification to the WTO Committee on Rules of Origin. Agricultural support policies are governed by the Agreement on Agriculture (AA) and other WTO Agreements, with the objective of progressive reductions in support and protection over time. The Agreement on Agriculture (AA) governs agricultural support programs, which must conform to Members' commitments. Export subsidies are regulated under the AA, prohibiting certain types of subsidies for unscheduled agricultural products and exceeding reduction commitment levels. The Agreement on Agriculture (AA) regulates export subsidies, prohibiting certain types of subsidies for unscheduled agricultural products and exceeding reduction commitment levels. In the U.S. \u2013 Upland Cotton case, Brazil challenged U.S. policies supporting various agricultural industries, including \"Step 2 payments\" to domestic purchasers and exporters of U.S. cotton. The Panel found that Step 2 payments for U.S. cotton were export subsidies under the Agreement on Agriculture because exporters had to prove they exported U.S. cotton to receive them. These payments were inconsistent with U.S. commitments under the Agreement. The Panel did not need to consider if the payments circumvented U.S. commitments. In contrast, the WTO Appellate Body found that U.S. tax benefits for Foreign Sales Corporations circumvented but did not violate U.S. export subsidy commitments. The WTO Appellate Body found that U.S. tax benefits for Foreign Sales Corporations circumvented, but did not violate, U.S. export subsidy commitments by allowing for an unlimited amount of subsidy to scheduled agricultural products already receiving the maximum level of subsidies specified by the U.S. Schedule. The United States threatened to circumvent Article 3.3 of the AA by not complying with reduction commitments for domestic subsidy programs under the FSC measure. Domestic subsidy programs must either be \"green box\" programs or not exceed the de minimis level to be exempt from reduction commitments. Green box programs must have minimal trade-distorting effects. The Annex 2 of the AA outlines requirements for different domestic agricultural support programs, including food aid, disaster relief, and environmental payments. These programs must be included in a Member's calculation of its \"Current Total\" Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS) reported annually to the WTO. The AMS total is compared to reduction commitments to ensure compliance, such as the United States' commitment to limit AMS to $19.1 billion per year. The WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) aims to balance regulatory autonomy with preventing trade obstacles. Measures regulating product characteristics or production methods can hinder international trade but serve legitimate objectives like environmental protection or quality assurance. If the United States exceeds its $19.1 billion AMS commitment, it may violate the Agreement on Agriculture (AA). The WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) aims to balance regulatory autonomy with preventing trade obstacles. Measures regulating product characteristics or production methods can hinder international trade but serve legitimate objectives like environmental protection or quality assurance. In EC \u2013 Sardines, Peru challenged an EU regulation prescribing common marketing standards for preserved sardines, which the WTO Appellate Body held prescribed product-related characteristics. The TBT Agreement classifies measures that regulate on the basis of a product's characteristics or PPM as technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessment procedures. In EC \u2013 Asbestos, the Appellate Body found that measures framed in the negative can also be TBT measures, as seen in the case of a French decree criminalizing the sale, import, and use of asbestos-containing products. The TBT Agreement categorizes measures regulating product characteristics or PPMs as technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessment procedures. Technical regulations mandate compliance with product characteristics or related processes, while standards are voluntary. Conformity assessment procedures ensure compliance with standards and regulations. The TBT Agreement outlines commitments for these measures, but WTO decisions have mostly focused on technical regulations and standards. The WTO panel and Appellate Body decisions have mainly focused on technical regulations under the TBT Agreement. These regulations must adhere to MFN status, national treatment principle, international standards, equivalence of regulations, and specification of technical regulations. The TBT Agreement requires technical regulations to meet domestic regulations, focus on performance rather than design, and not be more trade-restrictive than necessary for legitimate objectives like national security and health. WTO panels analyze if regulations are necessary for achieving a Member's goals. The TBT Agreement requires technical regulations to meet domestic regulations, focusing on performance rather than design, and not be more trade-restrictive than necessary for legitimate objectives like national security and health. WTO panels compare regulations to less trade-restrictive alternatives to determine compliance with the agreement, without providing a general or national security exception. The TBT Agreement emphasizes the importance of international standards and transparency in technical regulations to avoid trade interference. It provides mechanisms for resolving concerns without formal disputes and requires publication of proposed regulations for comments from other Members. The TBT Agreement emphasizes international standards and transparency in technical regulations to avoid trade interference. The Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade allows WTO Members to consult and resolve concerns related to the TBT Agreement. Sanitary and phytosanitary measures protect human, animal, or plant health from food-safety risks and pests. SPS measures are distinct from TBT measures and are mutually exclusive. SPS measures covered by the SPS Agreement are those that may affect international trade, including protective measures for animal and plant health, human health risks from additives or diseases, diseases carried by animals or plants, and measures to prevent damage from pests. Articles 2 and 5 of the SPS Agreement outline Members' basic rights. Article 2 and 5 of the SPS Agreement outline Members' rights and obligations regarding SPS measures, emphasizing the necessity for measures to be based on scientific principles and not discriminate unjustifiably between Members. This language also aligns with Article XX of the GATT. Article 5.3 and 5.6 of the SPS Agreement require WTO Members to avoid unjustifiable distinctions in sanitary measures that restrict international trade. Measures must not be more trade-restrictive than necessary for protection. Compliance with international standards is mandated for SPS measures. The three international sources for SPS measures are the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CODEX), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO). Compliance with these standards is necessary for SPS measures, and if no international standard exists, measures must be based on sufficient scientific evidence. Members can provisionally adopt measures with insufficient evidence but must seek more information for a thorough risk assessment. Members must base their SPS measures on a risk assessment of the risks to human, animal, or plant life or health, using techniques developed by relevant international organizations. The WTO panel clarified that a Member satisfies this obligation by conducting a risk assessment meeting the SPS Agreement's definition and basing the measure on that assessment. The Member imposing the measure does not need to perform the risk assessment themselves as long as it meets the criteria in Annex A of the SPS Agreement. The type of risk assessment required depends on the purpose of the SPS measure, such as evaluating the likelihood of entry, establishment, or spread of pests or diseases. The WTO panel determines if an SPS measure was based on a risk assessment that reasonably supports the measure, even if it reflects divergent views. The WTO panel assesses if SPS measures are based on a scientific risk assessment and if they warrant imposition, without substituting its judgment for that of the risk assessor. Some measures can be imposed without a risk assessment, as seen in the EC \u2013 Biotech Products case. The WTO panel found that the EU's moratorium on approving new genetically modified organisms did not require a risk assessment but violated other provisions of the SPS Agreement. The Agreement aims to prevent SPS measures from hindering international trade and provides a platform for resolving concerns related to such measures. The SPS Agreement establishes measures for resolving concerns related to SPS regulations without formal dispute settlement. It requires notification of new regulations affecting trade, sets up the Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, and aims to facilitate consultations among Members. The GATS focuses on liberalizing trade in services, which is governed by internal regulations that may restrict certain activities. The GATS regulates a wide range of domestic measures, with provisions on market access and national treatment limited by each country's commitments. It includes annexes for specific service sectors and defines services in four \"modes\" of supply. The GATS regulates trade in services through various modes of supply, including delivery to consumers in different countries and services provided by entities with commercial presence abroad. Measures affecting trade in services encompass activities related to the purchase, payment, and use of services, as well as the presence of individuals for service supply in foreign territories. The GATS applies broadly to measures affecting trade in services, not just direct regulations. Members can specify how they reduce market access barriers, with GATS-inconsistency depending on national schedules of commitments. Unlike the GATT, the GATS allows exemptions from MFN treatment and specific service sector commitments to national treatment obligations. Each Member limits discrimination between services provided by firms. The GATS allows WTO Members to modify or withdraw commitments after three years, with transparency requirements for publishing laws and regulations. It does not mandate privatization or prohibit monopolies, focusing on increasing transparency in service sectors. The GATS aims to improve transparency in service sectors, especially for international business. U.S. service providers face obstacles due to lack of transparency in foreign regulations. TRIPS sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights, with developing countries having delayed compliance periods. The TRIPS Agreement extends most-favored-nation status and national treatment to intellectual property rights, ensuring equal IPR protection for nationals of all WTO Members. Prior to TRIPS, WIPO treaties regulated intellectual property rights internationally. The TRIPS Agreement incorporates WIPO treaty obligations into its framework, with additional minimum obligations in areas such as copyright, trademarks, geographical indications, patents, and trade secrets. It also includes exception clauses allowing WTO Members to authorize certain forms of IPR infringement. An early dispute involved the U.S. Copyright Act and its compatibility with the TRIPS Agreement. The U.S. argued that exceptions in the Copyright Act were permissible under the TRIPS Agreement, but the panel found that exceptions must be clearly defined, not create economic competition, and not cause unreasonable loss of income to copyright owners. The panel found that the \"homestyle\" exception in Section 110(5) met the requirements of Article 13 by allowing small restaurants and retail outlets to play music without authorization or payment, as long as they use commonly available stereo systems. The WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes significantly strengthened the earlier GATT dispute settlement mechanism by creating a Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) with representatives of all WTO Members. If a Member wants to challenge another Member's trade practices, it submits a written request for consultation to the DSB. A consultation is an opportunity to settle the dispute without a panel being established and is confidential. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) allows for consultations to resolve disputes before a panel is established. If consultations fail, a panel can be requested. The panel receives pleadings, hears arguments, and issues reports. Parties can appeal to the Appellate Body, with findings adopted unless rejected by consensus. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) allows for consultations to resolve disputes before a panel is established. If consultations fail, a panel can be requested. The panel receives pleadings, hears arguments, and issues reports. Parties can appeal to the Appellate Body, with findings adopted unless rejected by consensus. Once adopted, a Member in violation of a WTO obligation is given time to comply. If compliance is disputed, negotiations for compensation may occur, followed by potential retaliation if negotiations fail. Multilateral agreements in the Marrakesh Agreement are mandatory for WTO membership, while plurilateral agreements are not required. The WTO plurilateral agreements are not mandatory for membership, with only some Members, like the United States, participating. There are two agreements in Annex 4 of the Marrakesh Agreement, with the International Dairy and Bovine Meat Agreements ending in 1997. The Agreement on Government Procurement (AGP) aims to increase foreign access to government procurement, with 41 countries signed and China negotiating accession. The Agreement on Government Procurement (AGP) aims to eliminate discrimination against foreign products in government contracts. The AGP applies to government contracts meeting specific criteria, excluding procurements below monetary thresholds and those necessary for government contracts. The Agreement on Government Procurement (AGP) only applies to procurements between parties to the AGP, with exceptions negotiated for some government entities. The procurement must involve covered goods or parties not exempted by their schedule. While most goods are covered, services are generally not, but the United States offers comprehensive coverage. Article III of the AGP requires parties to provide access to products, services, and suppliers of other parties. The Agreement on Government Procurement (AGP) mandates that parties must treat products, services, and suppliers of other parties no less favorably than domestic ones. Discrimination based on foreign affiliation or country of production is prohibited. Rules of origin and affirmative defenses apply, as outlined in Article IV and Article XXII of the AGP. The AGP allows parties to take action for essential security interests or protect public morals, order, safety, and health. The United States exempts certain government agencies and procurements from the AGP under the national security exception. Another exception allows measures to protect various aspects of society, as long as they are not applied in a discriminatory manner. Article IX of the AGP requires transparency in procurement processes, including publishing invitations to participate and providing necessary information. Additionally, Article XX and XXI govern the procedures for procurement. Article IX of the AGP mandates transparency in procurement processes, while Articles XX and XXI outline procedures for challenging breaches of the AGP. Parties must offer suppliers the opportunity to challenge alleged breaches, with the option for their challenges to be heard by a court or impartial review body. If a Party wishes to challenge another Party's failure to fulfill AGP obligations, the Dispute Settlement Understanding can be utilized. WTO panels have issued few decisions in government procurement, with a notable case involving a Massachusetts law. The European Union disputed a Massachusetts law that prohibited state entities from procuring goods or services from businesses doing business with Burma. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law was pre-empted by a federal statute imposing sanctions on Burma. The Aircraft Agreement, predating the WTO, is one of two plurilateral agreements within the WTO. The Aircraft Agreement is a plurilateral agreement within the WTO involving thirty countries, including major aircraft manufacturing nations. It aims to promote technological development in aeronautics, ensure fair competition among civil aircraft producers, and eliminate trade barriers such as tariffs on aircraft and related parts. The Aircraft Agreement, a plurilateral agreement within the WTO involving thirty countries, aims to promote technological development in aeronautics, ensure fair competition among civil aircraft producers, and eliminate trade barriers. Signatories are forbidden from pressuring airlines to procure aircraft from a specific source, and quantitative restrictions on imports and exports are not allowed. The Agreement also requires the application of the SCM Agreement to civil aircraft industries. Marrakesh Agreement marked the completion of the Uruguay Round and led to negotiations on agriculture and services in the 21st century, resulting in a new WTO Round in early 2000. The Doha Ministerial Declaration in early 2000 expanded into a new WTO Round the following year, focusing on developing countries' concerns. Negotiations must be transparent and open to all Members and states in the process of accession. All agreements must be adopted as one final agreement. Concluding the Doha Round has been challenging due to the number of countries involved and their differences. The United States has reciprocal trade agreements with 19 countries, including nations in Asia, the Middle East, South and Central America, and Africa. Free trade agreements are non\u2013self-executing and require congressional approval. The only two regional free trade agreements the US is a part of are NAFTA and the Dominican-Republic Central America-United. The United States has reciprocal trade agreements with 19 countries, including nations in Asia, the Middle East, South and Central America, and Africa. Free trade agreements require congressional approval and the US is a party to NAFTA and the Dominican-Republic Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement. The United States negotiates trade agreements based on the \"model FTA,\" which is influenced by NAFTA and the WTO Agreements. The United States pursues trade liberalization through provisions on nondiscrimination, tariff reduction, rules of origin, and other obligations resembling GATT and WTO agreements. The model FTA covers trade in services, investment, government procurement, intellectual property rights, and dispute settlement. Labor rights, environmental protection, and electronic commerce obligations are now standard in FTAs. Countries reserve exceptions to obligations in annexes. Congress has influenced the evolution of the model FTA through Trade Promotion Authority statutes and the \"Bipartisan Trade Deal,\" which required certain provisions in trade agreements. This modified the model FTA, impacting countries that had already passed agreements. The Bipartisan Trade Deal modified the model FTA, impacting countries that had already passed agreements. Key provisions include labor standards based on the 1998 International Labor Organization Declaration and a dispute settlement system for labor and environmental violations in free trade agreements. The model FTA has evolved in its chapters on investment, intellectual property, and labor, reflecting changes in language and provisions over time. Investment provisions have been renegotiated to address concerns about limiting government regulatory power. Intellectual property rights have expanded beyond TRIPS and NAFTA requirements. Labor issues have also evolved in the model FTA. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Canada, and Mexico entered into force on January 1, 1994. NAFTA includes tariff reduction schedules, provisions to reduce nontariff barriers to trade, and distinct dispute settlement provisions. The model FTA's approach to labor issues has evolved to incorporate them into the final agreement and subject allegations to the same dispute settlement system as trade violations. Foreign investment in NAFTA and subsequent U.S. trade agreements aimed to protect companies from expropriation and government intervention. Chapter 11 of NAFTA provides key protections for investors, including national treatment, compensation for expropriation, and restrictions on performance requirements. Articles 1110 and 1105 are frequently cited in NAFTA investment disputes. Articles 1110 and 1105 of NAFTA are key provisions in investment disputes, prohibiting nationalization or expropriation of investments except for public purposes, non-discriminatory basis, due process, and payment of compensation. Article 1105 requires fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security for investments. Article 1139 of NAFTA defines \"investment\" as limited to various forms of enterprise, securities, loans, real estate, and capital commitments. Intellectual property rights are excluded from this definition. Chapter 11 provides substantive protections for covered investments, allowing investors to enforce provisions through investor-state arbitration. Under NAFTA's Chapter 11, investors can file for arbitration if they believe a Party has breached an obligation, without needing their government's permission. They must wait six months from the event, give 90 days' notice, and waive other legal actions. Investors choose the arbitration rules under the ICSID Convention or Additional Facility Rules. NAFTA's Chapter 17, influenced by the WTO's TRIPS Agreement, covers intellectual property. It includes provisions on required IP laws, domestic enforcement, and dispute resolution. Article 1701 mandates parties to provide effective IP protection to each other's nationals. Each party in NAFTA must comply with international agreements on intellectual property, ensuring protection for copyrights, trademarks, patents, and other rights. National treatment is required for enforcement of another party's intellectual property rights. Articles 1715, 1717, and 1718 of NAFTA require parties to provide civil and criminal procedures for intellectual property rights holders, including the ability to petition for importation bans on infringing goods. Disputes can be settled through the general dispute settlement mechanism, allowing for trade sanctions in cases of noncompliance with intellectual property rights protection obligations. NAFTA includes a side agreement on labor called NAALC, which outlines labor standards and enforcement procedures. However, labor unions cannot use the NAALC dispute settlement mechanism to resolve disputes with NAFTA parties. Each party must enforce its own labor standards through fair and transparent procedures. NAALC establishes a mechanism for resolving disputes related to labor standards among NAFTA parties. An arbitral panel may be established if there is a persistent pattern of failure to enforce occupational safety, child labor, or minimum wage standards. If the offending party does not comply with the panel's decision, a monetary enforcement assessment may be imposed. Each NAFTA party must have a National Administrative Office to monitor labor rights issues. In the United States, this office is the Office of Trade and Labor Affairs (OTLA). The NAALC establishes a mechanism for resolving labor disputes among NAFTA parties. The U.S. NAO, OTLA, investigates complaints, seeks consultations, and submits information to the NAALC Secretariat. The Commission for Labor Cooperation oversees the Agreement's implementation, develops recommendations, and manages enforcement assessments. The U.S. signed the CAFTA-DR with several countries in 2004. The CAFTA-DR, signed by the U.S. with several countries in 2004, is the first free trade agreement with smaller developing economies. It includes tariff reduction schedules, provisions to reduce nontariff barriers, and distinct dispute settlement provisions. Unlike NAFTA, CAFTA-DR has dedicated chapters for labor and environmental protection, with enforceable protections for investors. Key protections include national treatment for foreign investors, compensation for property expropriation, and adherence to a \"Minimum Standard of Treatment.\" CAFTA-DR clarifies and expands upon key protections for investors, such as the \"Minimum Standard of Treatment\" and compensable expropriation. It specifies that \"fair and equitable treatment\" does not require treatment beyond customary international law and includes the obligation to accord \"due process\" in adjudicatory proceedings. This reflects U.S. experience with NAFTA's interpretation of fair and equitable treatment. CAFTA-DR expands on investor protections, including expropriation provisions that exempt regulatory actions for public welfare objectives. It allows investor-state arbitration with a broader definition of \"investment\" compared to NAFTA. CAFTA-DR has a broader definition of \"investment\" than NAFTA, including intellectual property rights. Dispute settlement provisions in CAFTA-DR are similar to NAFTA, requiring a negotiation period and written notice before arbitration. Investors must waive legal actions against challenged measures before arbitration. CAFTA-DR's dispute settlement mechanism allows investors to bring claims for breach of investment authorization or agreement, expanding the scope beyond NAFTA's Chapter 11. Unlike NAFTA, CAFTA-DR parties have committed to waive legal actions before arbitration. CAFTA-DR's dispute settlement mechanism expands beyond NAFTA's Chapter 11, allowing investors to bring claims for breach of investment authorization or agreement. CAFTA-DR parties have committed to creating an appellate body to review arbitral tribunals' awards, enhancing coherence in interpreting investment provisions. Chapter 15 of CAFTA-DR strengthens intellectual property rights obligations by requiring parties to join and give effect to more international agreements compared to NAFTA. CAFTA-DR, like NAFTA, specifies protection levels for intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, and Internet domain names. Each party must provide national treatment for the intellectual property rights of another party's nationals. The term \"protection\" includes availability, scope, maintenance, enforcement, and prohibition on circumvention of technological measures. CAFTA-DR requires parties to establish criminal penalties for counterfeit goods and limits liability of Internet service providers for copyright infringements. CAFTA-DR allows Internet service providers limited liability for copyright infringements and disputes can be settled through a general dispute mechanism. Unlike NAFTA, CAFTA-DR includes labor provisions within the agreement. The CAFTA-DR agreement allows parties to set their own labor standards and enforce them through specified procedures. Enforcement proceedings must be fair, equitable, and transparent. Dispute resolution under CAFTA-DR is limited to violations of specific labor laws, ensuring trade is not affected. The CAFTA-DR agreement allows parties to enforce their own labor standards through fair and transparent procedures. Unlike NAFTA, CAFTA-DR does not allow for the suspension of trade benefits for nonpayment of enforcement assessments in labor disputes. Instead, a monetary assessment can be imposed on a defending party for noncompliance with a panel's decision, with funds going towards labor and environmental initiatives managed by the Free Trade Commission. The CAFTA-DR agreement, overseen by cabinet-level representatives, saw the first formal complaint filed by the US against Guatemala in July 2010. The complaint alleged Guatemala's failure to enforce labor laws on collective bargaining, freedom of association, and working conditions. In December 2009, the USTR notified Congress of negotiations for the Trans Pacific trade agreement. The USTR notified Congress of negotiations for the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement, involving countries like Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. Malaysia joined later, with Canada, Japan, and Mexico expressing interest. The USTR intends to proceed with TPP negotiations under the terms of the Trade Act of 2002. The TPP negotiations were announced in November 2011, with the goal of completing a text by the end of 2012. The agreement will cover investment, intellectual property, and labor, allowing arbitration of investor-state disputes with safeguards. Australia opposes investor-state dispute settlement clauses, and the U.S. trade agreement with Australia does not include them. The TPP aims for high standards in intellectual property compared to previous U.S. trade agreements. The TPP negotiations aim for high standards in intellectual property and digital economy, with the U.S. proposing expanded copyright terms and a notice-and-takedown system. However, other TPP countries are resisting these proposals. The U.S. also seeks higher labor standards in the agreement compared to the Bipartisan Trade Deal. The International Labor Organization commitments in the Bipartisan Trade Deal specify how TPP countries should address labor violations, including measures to reduce forced or child labor. In the U.S., trade laws are enacted by Congress and enforced by the Executive, with roles sometimes reversed in international trade agreements. Congress has the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations under Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution. Congress has the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations under Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution. This includes duties, imposts, and excises, as well as making laws necessary for carrying out these powers. Over time, Congress has expanded its control over trade policy, including negotiating trade agreements, implementing them, providing remedies for domestic industries, and imposing trade sanctions. The President, with Senate approval, has the authority to make treaties and appoint ambassadors under Article II of the Constitution. The President's authority in conducting foreign relations includes negotiating trade agreements and enforcing laws affecting foreign commerce. Congress and the executive branch have exercised their constitutional authorities over trade policy, with historical examples like the Tariff Act of 1930. The Tariff Act of 1930 established high tariffs, leading to other countries closing off their markets. In response, Congress passed the Trade Agreements Act of 1934, allowing the President to negotiate reciprocal agreements to reduce tariffs. Congress has periodically renewed and expanded the President's negotiating authority in international trade since then. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants the President expedited congressional consideration for trade agreements, enhancing flexibility and credibility in negotiations. Originating from the Trade Act of 1974, TPA statutes typically authorize the President to enter reciprocal international agreements reducing tariffs. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows the President to enter reciprocal international agreements reducing tariff and nontariff barriers, with fast track procedures in Congress for timely consideration. TPA was last granted in 2002 and expired in 2007. Some worry that without TPA, foreign governments may hesitate to negotiate trade deals with the US. The Tariff Act of 1930 and Trade Act of 1974 are key sources of modern U.S. trade remedy laws aimed at mitigating import competition's adverse impact on domestic industries. The primary U.S. trade remedy laws include countervailing duty, antidumping, and safeguard laws, with the first two in the Tariff Act of 1930 and safeguard law in the Trade Act of 1974. The first U.S. trade remedy law was a response to Germany subsidizing sugar exports. The U.S. trade remedy laws, including countervailing duty and antidumping laws, were developed in response to foreign companies selling products in the U.S. at prices lower than in their home market. The countervailing duty law was amended to set the duty amount equal to the subsidy granted, while the Antidumping Act of 1921 imposed duties on articles sold below market price. The U.S. trade remedy laws, including countervailing duty and antidumping laws, were developed in response to foreign companies selling products in the U.S. at prices lower than in their home market. The current model imposes an offsetting duty on articles exported to the U.S. at a price less than that charged in the home market, incorporated into Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930. Safeguards laws were developed in the mid-20th century in response to tariff reductions from international agreements, with an \"escape clause\" codified in the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 tightened \"escape clause\" standards, later loosened with the Trade Act of 1974. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is responsible for trade negotiations, implementing trade policy, handling Section 301 complaints against unfair trade practices, overseeing trade law administration, and reviewing recommendations from the International Trade Commission. The International Trade Administration (ITA) in the U.S. Department of Commerce reviews recommendations from the International Trade Commission on safeguards and intellectual property infringement. The ITA determines subsidies in countervailing duty cases and sales at less than fair value in anti-dumping cases. The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) investigates the effects of dumped and subsidized imports on domestic industries and conducts safeguard investigations. The International Trade Commission (ITC) handles investigations related to safeguard measures under the Trade Act of 1974 and intellectual property rights infringement under the Tariff Act of 1930. It also manages the Harmonized Tariff Schedule used by Customs Services for tariff assessment on imported goods. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), part of the Department of Homeland Security, enforces intellectual property rights, ensures proper duties and fees are paid, and secures trade against terrorism. CBP, along with the Food and Drug Administration, also works to protect the U.S. from contaminated or harmful food and plants. The United States Court of International Trade (CIT) handles cases related to international trade, with jurisdiction over civil actions involving the U.S., its officers, or agencies. It was established in 1980 and has nine judges appointed by the President with lifetime tenure. The CIT is located in New York City and may hold hearings in foreign countries. Appeals can be made to the United States Court of Appeals. The Court of International Trade reviews decisions by administrative agencies with deference, especially regarding antidumping duties. The Trade Act of 1974 requires the USTR to impose sanctions on countries violating trade agreements. The USTR has the authority to impose trade sanctions on foreign countries with unreasonable or discriminatory practices that burden U.S. commerce. This process involves determining if a country's acts violate U.S. rights under trade agreements before imposing sanctions. The USTR has the authority to impose trade sanctions on foreign countries with unreasonable or discriminatory practices that burden U.S. commerce. If a country's acts violate U.S. rights under trade agreements, the USTR may suspend benefits, impose duties, or enter agreements with the country. For example, in 2010, the USTR investigated China for WTO-inconsistent policies in the green energy sector, leading to an agreement in 2011. In June 2011, the United States and China reached an agreement to terminate a subsidy program. The USTR can take action if U.S. rights are violated, but may not act if satisfactory measures are taken by the foreign country or if it would harm U.S. national security. Interested parties can file petitions with the USTR under Section 301, which will review allegations and publish determinations in the Federal Register. The USTR can initiate investigations to determine if a matter is actionable under Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930. This governs the process for imposing countervailing duties (CVDs) on subsidized imports that cause harm to U.S. industry. The U.S. International Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce jointly investigate allegations of countervailable subsidies. The U.S. International Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce investigate countervailable subsidies when a petition is filed alleging harm to the U.S. industry by subsidized imports sold below fair value. Interested parties can file both antidumping and countervailing duty petitions for the same merchandise. The petition must be filed by or on behalf of the industry, with domestic producers or workers supporting it accounting for at least 25% of total production. The U.S. International Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce investigate countervailable subsidies when a petition is filed alleging harm to the U.S. industry by subsidized imports sold below fair value. The agencies must make preliminary determinations on the existence of a material injury to domestic industry and of a countervailable subsidy by the foreign country. The ITC evaluates whether there is a \"reasonable indication\" of a material injury to the domestic industry. If no reasonable indication is found, the investigation does not proceed. The investigation is terminated if the ITC finds no reasonable indication of material injury. If affirmative determinations are made by both the ITA and ITC, importers must post bond for the estimated subsidy. The ITA makes its determination first before both agencies make final determinations. The ITA determines if a countervailable subsidy is provided for merchandise. The ITC then decides if the domestic industry is injured by subsidized imports. If both agencies find injury, the Department of Commerce issues a countervailing duty order. The countervailing duty order requires the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to collect cash deposits equal to estimated subsidization amounts on imported merchandise. Final duties are determined through administrative reviews, similar to the process for investigating dumping allegations. The procedures for assessing and collecting antidumping duties are outlined in Title VII. Procedures for assessing and collecting antidumping duties are prescribed in Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930. Interested parties can petition the Department of Commerce for investigations, which can also be self-initiated. Investigations are jointly administered by the Department of Commerce and the ITC in two rounds, with preliminary determinations made in the first round. Final determinations are made in the second round by the ITA and the ITC. The second round involves final determinations by the ITA and ITC on antidumping duties. If affirmative, ITA issues orders for cash deposits of AD duties. Dumping margins are calculated using \"zeroing\" by the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce's use of \"zeroing\" to calculate dumping margins led to complaints from WTO Members. Despite the Court of International Trade supporting this practice, the WTO deemed it a violation of U.S. obligations. In 2012, the U.S. agreed with the EU and Japan to end \"zeroing,\" resulting in a new rule where zeroing will be abandoned in certain reviews, except when deemed appropriate. The Department of Commerce will calculate weighted-average margins of dumping and antidumping duty assessments with offsets for non-dumped comparisons. A timetable for modifying practices in five-year \"sunset\" reviews of AD orders was adopted to eliminate reliance on WTO-inconsistent methodology. Sections 201 through 204 of the Trade Act of 1974 provide authority for import relief to aid domestic industries in adjusting to import competition. Adjustment is defined as successful competition or orderly resource transfer. Under Section 201, increased imports causing substantial harm can trigger action. The President can take action to help domestic industries adjust if increased imports cause serious harm. The ITC can be petitioned to determine if imports are causing injury, considering factors like import increase and market share decline. If a determination is affirmative, the ITC can recommend actions like imposing duties or quotas. The President can take action to assist domestic industries in adjusting to increased imports causing harm. The ITC can recommend actions such as imposing duties, quotas, or other measures to address import competition. Additionally, Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 provides country-specific safeguards for relief from market disruption, including temporary safeguards negotiated with China. The President can take action to assist domestic industries in adjusting to increased imports causing harm. Two temporary China-specific safeguards were negotiated, set to expire in 2013. The first \"China safeguard\" allows the President to increase duties to remedy import surges threatening domestic producers. In 2009, the Obama Administration imposed additional duties on Chinese tires due to market disruption. The second safeguard, Section 422 of the Trade Act of 1974, is an import monitoring provision. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) was enacted by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 to identify duty rates for imported and exported goods. It is divided into three columns for different types of products and trade agreements. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) categorizes duty rates for imported and exported goods based on ad valorem, specific, or compound rates. Chapters 98 and 99 of the HTS allow duty-free entry under special provisions. The U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) under Title V of the Trade Act of 1974 provides duty reductions for certain goods. The U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) provides duty-free tariff treatment to products from designated developing countries. Producers can petition to remove countries or products from the program, and the President has authority to withdraw or limit duty-free entry. Argentina was suspended from the GSP in 2012 for failing to pay arbitration awards to the U.S. The GSP program provides duty-free tariff treatment to products from designated developing countries. Certain countries are ineligible for the GSP, including those that fail to pay investor-state arbitration awards, communist states meeting specific criteria, nations colluding to disrupt the world economy, and countries not upholding worker rights or involved in terrorism. The President has discretion over which countries receive beneficiary status under the GSP program, considering factors like workers' rights, intellectual property protection, market access, and trade barriers. Despite a country's shortcomings in these areas, it may still qualify for duty-free entry if it benefits the national economic interest of the United States. The GSP program allows for disqualification, reinstatement, and graduation of beneficiary nations based on economic factors. The President must notify Congress before designating a country as a beneficiary or making changes to its status. Certain products, like textiles and apparel goods, are ineligible for duty-free entry under the GSP program. The GSP program has limitations on duty-free entry for certain products, including textiles, apparel, watches, footwear, electronics, steel, and glass. There are competitive need limitations based on export volume and percentage, but the President can waive them. The U.S. also has similar duty-free entry programs for specific regions. The United States has various non-reciprocal duty-free entry programs for specific regions, such as the Caribbean Basin Initiative, Andean Trade Preference Act, and African Growth and Opportunity Act. Economic sanctions have become more common in U.S. foreign policy, typically imposed by the President through Executive Orders. Economic sanctions in the United States are often imposed through Executive Orders by the President, with Congress also enacting legislation at times. The U.S. Department of Treasury and the U.S. Department of Commerce primarily implement these sanctions. Key sources of statutory authority for country-specific sanctions include the Trading with the Enemy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Sanctions must comply with domestic laws, customary international law, and WTO obligations. The Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) was initially intended for country-specific sanctions during wartime, later expanded for national emergencies. In 1977, the authority for sanctions during emergencies was shifted to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Despite changes, TWEA still serves as the basis for some U.S. sanctions programs, granting the President wide-ranging powers. The Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) grants the President broad powers to investigate, regulate, and prohibit transactions involving property subject to U.S. jurisdiction and foreign interests. TWEA's prohibitory language is often reflected in economic sanctions regulations. IEEPA replaced TWEA in 1977 as the source of authority for the President to issue economic sanctions during declared national emergencies. The President must declare a national emergency and consult with Congress before exercising IEEPA authorities. The question of what constitutes a national emergency triggering IEEPA-based sanctions is nonjusticiable, but Congress can terminate a Declaration of National Emergency with a joint resolution. Under IEEPA, the President has broad powers to investigate, regulate, prevent, or prohibit foreign economic transactions. The USA Patriot Act expanded these powers to include blocking property and confiscating assets of foreign entities engaged in hostilities against the United States. The President has significant control over international transactions and the authority to define terms such as \"U.S. person.\" IEEPA grants the President authority to define terms like \"U.S. person\" for sanctions. It has been used for country-specific sanctions since Carter's response to the Iranian hostage crisis. President Bush used it post-9/11 for terrorism-related sanctions. Current sanctions programs under IEEPA include Myanmar, Cote d'Ivoire, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria."
