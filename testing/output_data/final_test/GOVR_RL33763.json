    "content": "The CLEAN Energy Act of 2007 (H.R. 6) introduced by House Democratic leadership aims to revise tax and royalty policies for oil and natural gas to support energy efficiency and renewable energy. Title I proposes to repeal certain oil and gas tax subsidies, generating $7.7 billion for the reserve over 10 years. Critics argue it could reduce production, lead to job losses, and increase gasoline prices. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry, creating new incentives. Proponents argued that record profits showed these incentives were unnecessary, while opponents feared job losses and higher fuel prices. The bill passed the House on January 18, 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry, creating new incentives on top of existing ones. The report discusses the origin, evolution, and details of these tax provisions, including revenue loss estimates. It also covers other pre-existing oil and gas tax subsidies that were not affected by the 2005 act, as well as additional tax provisions benefiting the industry. The tax provisions benefiting the oil and gas industry include expensing of intangible drilling costs, percentage depletion allowance, and capital gains treatment of property sales. These subsidies reduce tax rates, production costs, and encourage investment in locating reserves. During the 1930s, discoveries of vast reserves in Texas led to overproduction of oil and gas, causing declines in prices and the need for prorationing. Energy tax policy shifted towards conservation and alternative fuels from the 1970s to the 1990s. Rising petroleum prices from 2000 onwards led to spikes in prices, electricity crises, and blackouts, prompting policymakers to take action. The energy crisis in the early 2000s led policymakers to focus on increasing energy production and supply, including tax incentives for the oil and gas industry. The EPACT05 provided relief for small producers dealing with low oil prices, with proposals for production tax credits and other fossil fuel supply provisions. Subsequent legislation like H.R. 4 in the107th Congress expanded on these incentives to secure America's energy future. The Securing America's Future Energy Act of 2001 included significant energy tax breaks, totaling $33.5 billion, aimed at boosting domestic production capacity and supply. These incentives were larger than those proposed in EPACT05 and focused on stimulating the supply of conventional fuels through capital investment incentives. This legislation evolved into broader energy bills like H.R. 6 in the 109th Congress. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, known as EPACT05, was approved by the House and Senate in July 2005 and became law in August (P.L. 109-58). It was enacted during a period of high oil and gas prices, leading to public and congressional criticism. Proposals were made to revoke incentives, repeal tax subsidies, and impose new taxes on the industry. One tax subsidy, allowing two-year amortization of geological and geophysical costs, was scaled back in response to public outcry. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included a tax subsidy for geological and geophysical activity costs, which was reduced in value by the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2006. This subsidy allowed for faster amortization for major integrated oil companies, but independent oil companies could still amortize costs over two years. Calls to roll back oil and gas tax subsidies persist despite this minor cutback. The House Democratic leadership proposed rolling back 2005 energy act tax subsidies for oil and gas companies due to high petroleum prices and industry profits. Nancy Pelosi urged Congress to repeal these tax breaks, with many bills introduced in the 109th Congress focusing on the expensing of intangible drilling costs subsidy for oil and gas exploration and development. The bill introduced by Senators Wyden and Bennett aimed to provide consumers with discounts on fuel-efficient vehicles by reducing tax deductions for major oil companies. Senate Democrats proposed comprehensive energy legislation that would eliminate expensing of intangible drilling costs and other tax benefits for the oil and gas industry. H.R. 5234 focused on repealing three fossil fuel tax provisions from the 2005 act. H.R. 5218 aimed to deny oil and gas companies the new domestic manufacturing deduction under IRC \u00a7 199. The 110th Congress may scrutinize fossil fuel tax breaks more closely due to the need to pay for legislative priorities. EPACT05 included various incentives to boost oil and gas production from unconventional sources like Alaska and deep water reserves. EPACT05 provides tax incentives totaling $14.5 billion over 11 years to stimulate domestic fossil fuel production and distribution, including oil and gas. These incentives aim to reduce demand for fossil fuels through energy efficiency and alternative fuel production. Title XIII, subtitle B, includes incentives for oil and gas production, transportation, distribution, and refinery capacity expansion. Some incentives are production tax credits, while others are for natural gas infrastructure. Coal incentives are not included in this subtitle. Tax incentives worth $2.6 billion over 11 years are provided to the oil and gas industry for increased supply incentives, including accelerated depreciation of natural gas pipelines. These incentives are based on production quantities and capital investments, targeting both unconventional and conventional oil and gas supply. Exploration and development costs incur different tax treatments depending on the activities. The tax treatment of upstream exploration and development (E&D) costs varies based on the type of activity and whether they are incurred by an integrated or independent producer. E&D costs can be categorized into geological and geophysical costs (G&G), mineral acquisition or lease rights expenses, and drilling costs for exploratory and development wells to assess deposit size. The tax treatment of upstream exploration and development (E&D) costs varies based on the type of activity and whether they are incurred by an integrated or independent producer. E&D costs can be categorized into geological and geophysical costs (G&G), mineral acquisition or lease rights expenses, and drilling costs for exploratory and development wells to ascertain the magnitude of the deposits. These activities have associated various types of drilling costs, including tangible drilling costs for equipment with salvage value and intangible drilling costs (IDCs) for fuel, labor, repairs, materials, and other necessary expenditures for drilling and site preparation. The 2005 act required both integrated and independent producers to amortize the G&G component of dry hole costs over two years, reducing the incentive for G&Gs associated with dry holes but increasing it for successful wells. This provision became effective for G&G amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after the date of enactment. Integrated producers must now amortize G&G costs over five years, while independent producers still have a two-year amortization period. Amortization allows for deductions of costs evenly over a specified period, similar to straight-line depreciation. Depletion, like depreciation, allows firms to recover their capital investment in mineral reserves as they are physically and economically depleted. The income tax allows for the deduction of mineral reserve costs through cost depletion or percentage depletion methods. Cost depletion recovers the actual capital investment over the reserve's income-producing period, while percentage depletion deducts a fixed percentage of gross income from mineral sales. Total deductions under percentage depletion typically exceed the capital investment. The income tax allows for deduction of mineral reserve costs through cost or percentage depletion methods. IRC \u00a7 613 states that mineral producers must claim the higher of cost or percentage depletion. The percentage depletion rate for oil and gas is 15% and is limited to average daily production of 1,000 barrels of oil or its gas equivalent. Percentage depletion is not available to integrated major oil companies, only for independent producers and royalty owners. Beginning in 1990, the percentage depletion rate was raised on production from marginal wells. The percentage depletion rate for oil and gas is 15% for stripper wells producing up to 15 barrels per day. It increases by one percentage point for each whole $1 that the reference price of oil is less than $20 per barrel. This higher rate is limited to independent producers and royalty owners, with a maximum rate of 25%. Small independents operate nearly 400,000 stripper wells, representing about 16% of total domestic production in the United States. The deduction is limited to 65% of taxable income and a 100% net-income limitation applies to each individual producer. The 100% net-income limitation for oil and gas production from marginal wells was suspended by the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 through December 31, 2005. The percentage depletion allowance varies for different types of fuel minerals and ranges from 10% to 22%. Oil shale and geothermal deposits qualify for a 15% allowance. The net-income limitation for coal and other fuels is 50%, compared to 100% for oil and gas. Percentage depletion on coal mined by corporations is reduced by 20% under code section 291. EPACT05 raised the daily limit for independent oil producers to 75,000 barrels and changed the refinery limitation to average daily production. EPACT05 changed depreciation rules for natural gas distribution lines to a 15-year recovery period for property placed in service after April 11, 2005. Refineries now calculate average daily runs for tax purposes, and the double declining balance method for oil refinery assets was replaced with a 10-year depreciation period under MACRS. The 2005 act allows refineries to expense 50% of qualified refinery property cost to increase investments and product output. The deduction is allowed when the refinery is placed in service, with the remaining 50% eligible for regular cost recovery. To qualify, the property must have its original use with the taxpayer, meet construction timelines, and be placed in service before January 1, 2008. The EPACT05 allows refineries to expense 50% of qualified refinery property cost to increase investments and product output. The property must be placed in service before January 1, 2012, meet production capacity requirements, and comply with environmental laws. Certain refineries, like asphalt plants, are not eligible. Cooperative owners can allocate the deduction based on ownership interests. The provision became effective on August 9, 2005. Bond-financed prepayments for natural gas supply contracts do not violate tax code arbitrage restrictions. These prepayments are not considered private loans and do not count as investment-type property. However, safe harbor provisions do not apply if the utility intentionally exceeds the needed volume of natural gas. This provision applies to obligations issued after the enactment of EPACT05. EPACT05 assigned natural gas gathering lines a seven-year recovery period for MACRS depreciation deductions, defined as pipes, equipment, and appurtenances determined by FERC. This change resolved previous ambiguity in tax treatment, where pipelines had a 15-year recovery period and distribution lines had a 20-year period reduced to 15 years. The IRC \u00a7 45H provision allows a small refiner to claim a tax credit for producing low-sulfur diesel fuel in compliance with EPA regulations. The credit is $2.10 per barrel produced, limited to 25% of capital costs. The Section 179B provision allows small refiners to claim a tax deduction for capital costs incurred in producing low-sulfur diesel fuel in compliance with EPA regulations. The deduction is up to 75% of the costs and is phased out as refining capacity increases. The taxpayer's basis in the property receiving the exemption is reduced by the production tax credit amount. Small business refiners are defined as those with refining capacity between 155,000 and 205,000 barrels per day and employing not more than 1,500 employees directly in refining. EPACT05 introduced incentives for small refiners in the petroleum industry with refining capacity below 205,000 barrels per day and employing less than 1,500 employees. These incentives allowed for tax deductions on capital costs related to EPA sulfur regulations compliance. Additionally, Section 45K of the IRC provided a production tax credit of $3 per barrel of oil-equivalent for certain alternative energy sources. The production tax credit for alternative energy sources under Section 45K of the IRC is available for gaseous and solid fuels from non-conventional sources. The credit amount varies based on oil prices, with a range of $23.50 to $29.50 per barrel. In 2005, the credit was $6.79 per barrel of oil equivalent and $1.23 per thousand cubic feet for gaseous fuels. The credit for tight sands gas remains fixed at the 1979 level. The credit for tight sands gas is fixed at $3 per barrel of oil equivalent (about $0.50 per mcf) and is not indexed to inflation. In 2005, qualifying fuels for the credit include synthetic fuels produced from coal and gas from various sources. Synthetic fuels from coal must undergo a significant chemical transformation to qualify for the credit. The \u00a7 45K tax credit applies to synthetic fuels produced from coal, such as coke used in steel-making operations. The credit is up to $26 per ton and $3 per barrel of oil equivalent for coke and coke gas. The credit is available until December 31, 2007, for gas produced from biomass and synthetic fuels from coal or lignite. The section 45K tax credit applies to synthetic fuels like coke used in steel-making, with credits available until December 31, 2007. The credit for coke and coke gas is also available for plants placed in service before January 1, 1992, and after June 30, 1998. The credit for oil produced from shale, tar sands, and coalbed methane ended on December 31, 2002. The section 45K credit is part of the general business credit and is subject to limitations. The section 45K tax credit is subject to limitations and may be offset by government subsidies. It is nonrefundable and cannot be used to offset alternative minimum tax liability. Unused credits generally cannot be carried forward or back to another taxable year. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made amendments to the credit, moving its provisions to a new section in the tax code. The tax credit for coke and coke gas was moved from section 29 to section 45K. The credit is available for qualified facilities producing coke or coke gas placed in service before January 1, 1993, or after June 30, 1998, and before January 1, 2010. Production of coke and coke gas is eligible for a reduced credit of $3.00 per barrel of oil equivalent, indexed for inflation from 2004. Facilities previously receiving a credit under section 29 are not eligible for the new credit under section 45K. The tax credit for coke and coke gas was moved from section 29 to section 45K. The new provision requires that the amount of credit-eligible coke produced not exceed an average barrel-of-oil equivalent of 4,000 barrels per day. The 2005 legislation made the general business limitations applicable to the tax credit, allowing unused credits to be carried back one year and forward 20 years. These new rules were effective for fuel produced and sold after December 31, 2005. Table 1 displays revenue effects of tax provisions in EPACT05, signed into law on August 8, 2005, by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). Revenue loss estimates may differ today due to changes in energy prices and economic conditions. JCT projected revenue losses over 11 years (FY2005 to FY2015) for oil and gas industry subsidies, including upstream and downstream operations. The 2005 act provides $2.6 billion in tax cuts for the oil and gas industry over 11 years, with $1.1 billion for upstream operations and $1.5 billion for refining and distribution. In comparison, energy conservation and efficiency receive about $1.3 billion in tax incentives, while renewables get around $4.5 billion in subsidies under EPACT05. The oil and gas industry received $4.5 billion in subsidies under EPACT05, with tax breaks not justified by economic theory. Despite high oil and gas prices, these subsidies are relatively small compared to the industries' gross product. Most historical tax subsidies for the industry have been eliminated or reduced since the 1970s. EPACT05 includes four tax increases, two of which are minor, while the other two are significant tax increases for the oil and gas industry. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included tax increases for the oil and gas industry, totaling roughly $2.8 billion over 11 years. This resulted in a net tax increase of about $200 million on the industry, with a significant portion affecting oil and gas refineries. Some proposals aim to roll back preexisting tax subsidies for the industry. The preexisting federal tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry, in effect before the 2005 act and still ongoing, are listed in Table 2 with corresponding revenue loss estimates. These subsidies are specific to the oil and gas industry and not applicable to others, as defined in the tax law. Current-law tax provisions benefiting non-oil and gas businesses but also benefiting the industry are not included in this discussion. The tax code includes loopholes that are not considered tax expenditures. Examples of possible revenue raisers include accelerated depreciation deductions, with an estimated $6.7 billion revenue loss in FY2006. The domestic oil and gas industry benefits from these deductions, but specific estimates are unavailable. The tax code includes loopholes like accelerated depreciation deductions, benefiting industries like the oil and gas sector. One example is the domestic production deduction under IRC \u00a7 199, allowing taxpayers to deduct a percentage of income from qualified production activities. The deduction is expected to result in a loss of $4.8 billion in federal revenue in FY2007 and $76 billion over the first 10 years. The tax code includes loopholes like accelerated depreciation deductions, benefiting industries like the oil and gas sector. A fraction of tax benefits from deductions will go to the domestic oil and gas industry. The JCT estimated revenues gained by repealing the deduction at about $0.2 billion in FY2007 and $2 billion from FY2007-FY2012. The \"last-in/first-out\" (LIFO) system of inventory accounting under IRC \u00a7 472 reduces taxable income and tax liabilities. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-222) eliminated a provision that would have increased taxes on major integrated oil companies by $3.5 billion in FY2006. The foreign tax credit is a federal tax credit against U.S. tax liabilities for income taxes paid to foreign countries, aimed at preventing double taxation of foreign source income. The Senate version of H.R. 4297 (109th Congress) proposed denying the foreign tax credit for major integrated oil companies with gross receipts over $1 billion under certain conditions. This provision, which aimed to increase taxes on these companies by $0.8 billion over a 10-year period, was ultimately removed from the final law, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-222). Table 2 excludes targeted taxes on the domestic oil and gas industry, such as motor fuels excise taxes and oil spill liability trust fund excise tax. These taxes are imposed on refiners but are mostly paid by consumers. Motor fuels excise taxes collected about $36 billion in FY2006, while revenues from the oil spill liability excise tax were estimated at $0.150 billion by the JCT."
