    "content": "Cybersecurity is a major concern for financial services providers and federal regulators, as it is an extension of physical security. They aim to prevent theft of money, assets, and intellectual property, as well as minimize human error and unauthorized access to sensitive electronic equipment. The federal government recognizes the importance of cybersecurity in the financial services industry. The report provides information on federal laws and regulatory agencies overseeing cybersecurity in the financial services industry. Different laws delegate authority for regulations and enforcement actions among various agencies, with some laws assigning all authority to a single agency. The report discusses how federal laws delegate authority to regulatory agencies in the financial services industry, including the use of guidance documents with legal force. Federal regulators issue various types of guidance, such as policy statements and letters, to interpret their regulatory authority. State law and private sector initiatives also play a role in cybersecurity oversight. The curr_chunk discusses federal laws imposing IT and cybersecurity requirements on financial services providers to protect data integrity. Financial services include deposits, loans, payments, insurance, and securities trading. Banking institutions are subject to comprehensive regulation. Banking institutions are subject to comprehensive prudential regulation based on the type of charter and activities they engage in. Different regulatory regimes and regulators oversee depositories, securities firms, and insurance companies. Financial services are considered critical infrastructure, with the federal government having arrangements to prevent disruptions to the economy. Commercial banking involves accepting deposits and making loans to businesses. In this report, the term \"bank\" refers to depository institutions including banks, savings associations, thrifts, and credit unions with federally insured deposits. The term \"commercial bank\" specifically refers to national and state-chartered banks, excluding savings and loans or credit unions. When discussing nonbank subsidiaries of holding companies, the report will specify the type of organization involved. Currently, there are multiple federal regulators overseeing different types of financial organizations such as stock exchanges, insurance companies, securities firms, and mortgage brokers. While insurance companies are primarily regulated by states, publicly traded insurance companies must also comply with securities laws. Certain insurance company subsidiaries of financial holding companies may be subject to regulations imposed by the Federal Reserve. Prudential regulation of depositories and holding companies now includes a focus on cybersecurity, covering various aspects of their capitalization, management, operations, and services. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is the primary federal regulator of national banks and federal savings associations, with authority to impose cybersecurity requirements. Congress created the OCC to oversee national banks, while states can also charter banks. The Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 established a separate depository charter for savings and loan associations. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 transferred responsibility for chartering federal savings and loans to the OCC, while the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 gave the Fed regulatory authority over state-chartered banks. The Fed also regulates bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies. The Fed, regulated by the Dodd-Frank Act, oversees state banks, U.S. branches of foreign banks, international operations of U.S. banks, holding companies, and systemically significant financial institutions. It also regulates wholesale payment systems like Fedwire Funds Service. The Fed oversees the Fedwire Funds Service and CHIPS, while also supervising designated financial market utilities. SWIFT is overseen for cybersecurity as a communications system. The FDIC and NCUA are federal regulators overseeing cybersecurity requirements for banks and credit unions, respectively. The FDIC insures bank deposits and regulates state-chartered banks, while the NCUA regulates federal and state-chartered credit unions. The NCUA imposes cybersecurity requirements on federally insured credit unions, chartered as cooperative organizations that accept deposits and offer consumer credit. The Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 authorized federally chartered credit unions, replaced by the NCUA in 1978. The CFP Act of 2010 created the CFPB within the Federal Reserve System with rulemaking powers over consumer financial matters. The CFPB has rulemaking, enforcement, and supervisory powers over consumer financial products and services, with authority to develop identity theft guidelines and issue regulations under financial consumer protection laws. Unlike other bank regulators, it lacks authority under GLBA to promulgate safeguards for customer records. The CFPB has authority to issue rules against unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices, similar to the FTC. This authority was used in a cybersecurity enforcement action in 2016. However, the CFPB's jurisdiction is limited to consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has supervisory powers over larger depositories and certain nonbanks, including mortgage companies, payday lenders, and private education lenders. It can also supervise \"larger participants\" in specific consumer financial markets and nonbanks posing risks to consumers. Customer data protection is a priority for the CFPB. The CFPB prioritizes customer data protection and has collaborated with federal banking regulators to create a cybersecurity assessment tool for financial services firms. The FFIEC, established in 1978, sets uniform principles for examining financial institutions and promotes supervision uniformity. Federal depository institution regulators, as FFIEC members, conduct safety and soundness examinations, including comprehensive reviews of information technology and cybersecurity under the GLBA privacy title. The GLBA privacy title mandates federal banking regulators, except the CFPB, to establish safeguards for customer data security and confidentiality. Banks undergo periodic on-site examinations to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system. The level of federal oversight varies based on the bank's size and operations. The degree of federal oversight of a bank depends on its size and operations. One aspect of bank examination is the information technology examination, following Interagency Guidelines for Information Security Standards. Banks are advised to notify law enforcement and regulators promptly in case of a security breach involving customer information. The FFIEC has issued an IT examination handbook covering various cybersecurity areas. The federal oversight of banks includes supervision of technology services, retail and wholesale payment systems, and information security. Other federal regulators oversee securities, markets, and consumer protection. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulate securities and commodities. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires publicly traded companies to disclose material financial information to the public. The SEC oversees financial disclosures of both financial and nonfinancial publicly traded companies. The securities laws aim at investor protection, maintaining fair markets, and facilitating capital formation by providing clear rules for honest dealing and disclosure requirements. The SEC enforces prohibitions against insider trading, accounting fraud, and providing false information about securities. Two key SEC regulations on cybersecurity are Regulation SCI and Regulation S-P. Regulation SCI requires SROs to implement policies for technological systems and notify the SEC of any problems. Regulation S-P implements safeguards to protect customer information under GLBA. The SEC's Regulation SCI and Regulation S-P aim to enforce cybersecurity measures to protect customer information. The regulation applies to brokers, dealers, investment companies, and advisers registered with the SEC. The SEC's OCIE issues Risk Alerts to highlight areas of concern, including governance, access controls, data loss prevention, vendor management, training, and incident response. In 2015, the OCIE emphasized the importance of cybersecurity in the securities industry through its examinations. The SEC's OCIE published \"summary observations\" of examinations on broker-dealers and investment advisors for cyberattack vulnerability. CFTC regulations require entities to comply with Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act privacy safeguards to protect customer information. CFTC regulations mandate entities to adopt policies for safeguarding customer information, incorporating cybersecurity standards and requiring prompt incident notification and recovery procedures. These practices align with FTC, SEC, and banking regulators' guidelines. Certain self-regulatory organizations (SROs) like FINRA and the National Futures Association (NFA) are concerned about cybersecurity and oversee stock exchanges and futures exchanges to protect investors. FINRA, an independent organization authorized by Congress, ensures fair and honest operations in the securities industry by writing and enforcing rules for securities firms and brokers. FINRA, created by the merger of NASD and NYSE's regulatory arm, oversees SROs. NFA regulates individuals and companies trading on U.S. futures exchanges and in the retail forex market. NFA provides guidance on cybersecurity for members. State regulators investigate data breaches in the insurance industry, while federal laws like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act impose cybersecurity requirements on insurance companies. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act imposes cybersecurity requirements on insurance providers, enforced by state authorities. Each state regulates insurance companies, products, and market conduct, with the NAIC setting national standards through model laws. States must enact these models for legal effect. The Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 made significant changes to financial regulation in the US, but left state-centered insurance regulation intact. It established new regulatory authorities, consolidated oversight of holding companies, and created the Federal Insurance Office within the Treasury Department. The Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 made changes to financial regulation in the US, including creating the Federal Insurance Office within the Treasury Department. The Federal Trade Commission enforces consumer protection laws and privacy provisions, including those under the GLBA. The FTC requires financial institutions to adopt standards to safeguard customer information. It has brought over 50 cases against companies for failing to protect personal data. The FTC published a guide for businesses on data breaches and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created the Federal Insurance Office. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to oversee Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship in 2008, giving it broad control over the two enterprises. FHFA issued an Advisory Bulletin on Cyber Risk Management for the GSEs, outlining seven principles for managing cyber risks. The federal government established the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) in 1916 to oversee the Farm Credit System (FCS) and Farmer Mac, which provide financing for agricultural loans. The Farm Credit Act of 1971 consolidated farm credit provisions to extend credit to farmers through cooperatively owned banks. Farmer Mac is a stockholder-owned agricultural GSE that facilitates secondary financing. The Farmer Mac, a stockholder-owned agricultural GSE, was created by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 to establish a secondary market for agricultural real estate mortgages, rural housing mortgages, and rural utility cooperative loans. The Farm Credit System Reform Act of 1996 expanded Farmer Mac's authority to purchase and pool loans and issue mortgage-backed securities with guaranteed payment. The FCA is considering revisions to current information technology regulations to address cybersecurity. The FCA conducts periodic examinations of Farm Credit System institutions, focusing on cybersecurity. Examinations include assessing security measures over facilities, systems, and data. Major laws impacting data security in the financial industry are Dodd-Frank, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, and Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The cybersecurity requirements of financial institutions are influenced by various laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. Additionally, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act prohibits financial institutions from sharing customer information with third parties. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) imposes obligations on financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customers' nonpublic personal information. Federal banking and securities agencies, the FTC, and state insurance regulators enforce requirements for entities to comply with GLBA's privacy title, including implementing safeguards to ensure data security and prevent unauthorized access. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) requires financial institutions to safeguard customer information to prevent harm or inconvenience. The CFPB issues regulations, while enforcement is shared among federal banking regulators, security regulators, state insurance commissioners, and the FTC for financial institutions. The FTC enforces provisions for any institution providing financial services. The safeguards rule under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act applies to various financial institutions providing services to customers nationwide, including check-cashing businesses, payday lenders, and credit reporting agencies. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires annual reports to include a management evaluation of internal controls, potentially extending to IT controls of publicly-traded companies. The disclosure provisions discussed here apply to corporations required to file reports under Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including companies with stock traded on national exchanges, foreign and domestic private issuers, and issuers of asset-backed securities. Bank holding companies, thrift holding companies, and insured depositories must file similar reports with regulators. The FACT Act amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require regulatory agencies to develop identity theft guidelines, including \"red flag\" guidance and regulations. The FACT Act amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require regulatory agencies to develop identity theft guidelines, including \"red flag\" guidance and regulations outlining patterns and activities indicating possible identity theft. The Bank Protection Act directs federal bank regulators to establish security standards to prevent robberies and assist in identifying perpetrators. The Bank Service Company Act authorizes regulators to oversee companies providing services to banks. The NCUA issued a regulation requiring credit unions to develop a written security program, similar to regulations for banks. The HIPAA sets national standards for healthcare providers and their business associates to comply with privacy and security requirements. The HIPAA sets standards for healthcare providers and their associates to comply with privacy and security requirements for medical records. Covered entities must notify individuals of data breaches and report breaches to the Department of Health and Human Services. Presidential Policy Directive 21 addresses the critical role of financial services in the national economy. Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) designated the Department of the Treasury as the sector-specific agency for critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services. PPD-21 outlined strategic imperatives to strengthen critical infrastructure security and resilience. Executive Order 13636 ordered the development of a cybersecurity framework by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for voluntary adoption by critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services. Executive Order 13681, \"Improving the Security of Consumer Financial Transactions,\" directed federal agencies to enhance cybersecurity by using chip and PIN payment terminals and cards. This system is more secure than chip and signature, especially when both terminals and cards have PINs. Most new payment cards issued in the United States lack PINs, except for official government payment cards. Financial institutions may be subject to state consumer protection data security laws in addition to federal laws. State requirements are likely to apply to various financial firms not comprehensively regulated by the federal government. State securities laws cover securities not publicly traded and registration of broker-dealers and stock brokers. The scope of this report does not include state regulation of financial services. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and the North American Association of Securities Administrators provide information on state banking and securities regulations. While there are data breach bills in Congress, there is no federal law requiring financial institutions to notify customers of breaches. However, most states have laws mandating consumer notification of data breaches compromising PII. The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that 47 states plus the District of Columbia have data breach notification laws affecting financial services. New York State law has significant influence over the financial system due to Wall Street's presence. The New York State Department of Financial Services regulates over 35 types of financial institutions. The New York State Department of Financial Services regulates various financial institutions and has issued reports on cybersecurity, focusing on areas such as third-party service providers and cybersecurity policies. DFS is considering proposing cybersecurity regulations for financial institutions, including requirements for multi-factor authentication and notifications of cybersecurity incidents. The Payment Card Industry's Security Standards Council develops and updates Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) for entities handling cardholder data. These standards set requirements for organizations processing payment transactions and software developers. Regulations for financial institutions are being considered by the New York State Department of Financial Services, focusing on cybersecurity measures like multi-factor authentication and incident notifications. The PCI DSS standards set requirements for entities handling cardholder data, including banks, merchants, and processors. The 2015 version comprises key security procedures such as avoiding default passwords, encrypting data, monitoring access, and testing systems regularly. Compliance is assessed by qualified security assessors, and enforcement is through contracts with card brands like MasterCard and Visa. The financial services industry operates through a series of private contracts between card brands, banks, and retailers. Oversight of cybersecurity in this sector involves a complex web of state and federal laws, regulators, and regulations. Maintaining data confidentiality and security is crucial for the economy. The financial sector relies on data security for trust and sustainability. Regulators focus on cybersecurity through regulations and guidance. Federal oversight includes cybersecurity measures for depository institutions and securities regulators overseeing disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies. The financial sector relies on data security for trust and sustainability. Regulators oversee cybersecurity measures for publicly traded companies and financial institutions to safeguard critical information. Federal agencies and laws mandate disclosure and consumer protections in the securities industry. Congress and the executive branch encourage voluntary cooperation for cybersecurity practices in critical infrastructure. Increased attention to cybersecurity is expected at both federal and state levels, with a focus on protecting critical information essential for U.S. national security."
