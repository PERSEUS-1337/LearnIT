    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Regional Comprehensive Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Coordination Act of 2003\". Congress finds that responders to the 9/11 terrorist attacks required coordination and support from various jurisdictions, agencies, and sectors to effectively respond to emergencies. Coordination, mutual support, and effective communication are essential for regional planning and response efforts. The need for consistent national standards in allocating homeland security grant money is highlighted. Regional councils of governments are deemed accountable and experienced in developing comprehensive regional plans for emergency recovery involving various stakeholders. The purpose of this Act is to encourage and facilitate the development and implementation of regional emergency and disaster preparedness, response, and recovery coordination plans among Federal, State, and local governments and the private sector within the region to enhance preparedness and mitigation efforts. Coordination, training, equipment acquisition, and planning are crucial for effective regional preparedness and mitigation. The Act aims to promote regional emergency preparedness and coordination among different levels of government and the private sector. The Act defines key terms such as \"region,\" \"regional council,\" \"local government,\" \"State,\" and \"stakeholder\" for the purpose of promoting regional emergency preparedness and coordination. The Act defines key terms for promoting regional emergency preparedness and coordination, including stakeholders from various entities such as government officials, emergency management agencies, law enforcement, health professionals, schools, universities, and the business community. The regional plan, as defined in the Act, involves coordination among representatives from the business community, port and airport officials, utilities officials, transportation departments, American Red Cross chapters, volunteer organizations, and other stakeholders identified by the stakeholders. SEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL PLANS. Each regional council must coordinate the development of a regional plan involving local governments, stakeholders, and various entities. In states without regional councils, the Governor should organize a regional approach with local officials. Governors in states with areas not covered by a regional council may assign those areas to one. The regional plan must include assessments of natural disasters, response equipment, equipment needs, and a communication system among stakeholders. The regional plan includes a secure information repository and emergency coordination information such as response resources and contact details for medical facilities, fire, police, and emergency services. The regional plan includes locations and contacts for key military personnel, response resources, and support facilities such as shelters, schools, and public buildings. The regional plan includes key details on infrastructure such as water treatment facilities, utilities lines, communication facilities, and radio/television studios. The regional plan includes details on infrastructure like water treatment facilities, utilities lines, communication facilities, radio/television studios, shortwave radio facilities, major bridges and dams, educational facilities, transportation facilities, ports, airports, and transportation routes. Other infrastructure facilities are also identified by regional stakeholders. The regional plan includes details on at-risk populations, potential targets, and infrastructure identified by regional stakeholders. This includes large population concentrations, major public events, venues capacities, population statistics, school enrollment numbers, locations of elderly, infirm, and disabled persons, and other at-risk populations. The regional plan includes identifying hazardous chemical concentrations, fuel depots, munitions, potential targets like nuclear power plants, and debris disposal locations. The regional plan involves analyzing disaster possibilities, assessing hazards using geographic information systems, and gaining approval from the region council's governing body and the appropriate Governor or Governors. The regional council must update its regional plan annually with revised threat assessments, trainings, and drills. The information in the plan should only be accessible to officials and agencies responsible under the plan for security purposes. The council should use appropriate technology to secure key resources and critical infrastructure outlined in the plan. The regional plan must protect key resources and critical infrastructure in coordination with various agencies and stakeholders. The regional council will continuously review and analyze policies for information security and sharing with relevant entities in homeland security. The regional plan focuses on enhancing security coordination among Federal, State, and local government agencies, as well as the private sector. SEC. 5. FUNDING. To oversee regional plan development, the Secretary of Homeland Security will allocate $0.05 per resident to each State for fiscal years 2005-2007, and necessary sums for 2008-2009. States will receive between $50,000 and $1,000,000 annually. Regional councils will also receive apportionments to meet Act requirements. The regional council will receive funding based on the number of residents in the area for fiscal years 2005-2007, with additional funding possible for critical infrastructure. The Secretary of Homeland Security will allocate necessary sums for 2008-2009 to update regional plans and maintain data. The regional council will receive funding ranging from $50,000 to $1,000,000 per fiscal year. The Secretary may withhold funding if noncompliance with the Act is determined. The Governor of a State may assume responsibility for organizing a regional approach if a regional council fails to comply with the Act. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 to carry out this section. Apportionments required by this section are subject to the availability of appropriations. If funds are insufficient in a fiscal year, the Secretary will proportionally reduce the amounts to be apportioned."
