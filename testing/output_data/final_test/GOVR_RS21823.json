    "content": "Libya announced in December 2003 its decision to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs and open the country to verification inspections. This included eliminating chemical and nuclear weapons programs, ballistic missiles, and chemical weapons stocks. Libya also agreed to abide by international treaties and guidelines such as the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Chemical Weapons Convention, Missile Technology Control Regime, and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Libya's decision to abandon its WMD programs in 2003 was influenced by economic sanctions, the potential for increased international investment, and the need to normalize relations with the United States. Various factors, including President Bush's national security strategy and the interdiction of centrifuge parts, played a role in Libya's decision. Offers to renounce WMD programs had been made as early as 1992 and 1999. Accounts record Libyan offers to renounce its WMD programs dating back to 1992 and 1999. Despite Libya's membership in the NPT and the BWC, observers believed Libya was pursuing WMD programs. The Bush Administration expressed concerns about Libya's efforts to pursue nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. Libya denied having a BW program but had a well-known chemical weapons capability. Its ballistic missile arsenal included Scud Bs, North Korean Scud-Cs, and the development of the Al Fatah missile. The Al Fatah program in Libya reportedly continued in the 1990s despite international sanctions. There were conflicting reports about Libya receiving No Dong missiles from North Korea. In 2001, it was assessed that Libya's missile program relied on foreign support. Libya signed the International Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation in 2002 and approached British officials in 2003 to give up their WMD programs. Inspections of Libyan weapon sites took place in October 2003. Libya's extensive nuclear and chemical activities were discovered during inspections in Taranto, Italy. Despite shortages of parts and technical expertise due to sanctions, Libya provided valuable information on its programs, including details on foreign suppliers. The revelations about A.Q. Khan's nuclear black market dealings aided inspections in Iran and prompted Pakistan to investigate Khan. Libya's nuclear weapons program was previously discounted due to difficulties in procuring key components. Libya's nuclear weapons program, previously discounted due to procurement difficulties, received assistance from A.Q. Khan in acquiring centrifuges and a nuclear weapons design. Khan's involvement helped Libya progress in its enrichment capabilities, with a design resembling a Chinese warhead handed over to IAEA inspectors in 2003. Libya's nuclear weapons program received assistance from A.Q. Khan, acquiring centrifuges and a Chinese warhead design. Libya declared production of mustard agent and pledged to eliminate ballistic missiles. In 2004, Libya relinquished North Korean Scud-C missiles. Libya's missile program transitioned from Scud-B missiles to shorter-range defensive missiles. In 2005, Libya requested to sell 417 Scuds to the US, with only ten purchased for testing. The Al Fatah program's current status is unknown. The US removed sensitive aspects of Libya's WMD and missile programs, including nuclear weapons design information and components airlifted to Oak Ridge, Tennessee in 2004. Libya declared and dismantled its nuclear program, including uranium hexafluoride containers, centrifuges from Pakistan, and missile parts. IAEA confirmed Libya's declarations and access to requested locations. Additional centrifuge and missile parts were shipped out in 2004. Russia removed highly enriched uranium supplied in the 1980s. Libya continues dismantling its chemical weapons program, requesting US assistance for destruction. OPCW supervised destruction of unfilled shells, but mustard agent destruction requires a special facility. Cost estimated at $100 million due to remote desert location. Libya received extension to destroy all chemical weapons and production capacity. Libya received an extension to destroy all chemical weapons and production capacity by April 29, 2007. The Trilateral Steering and Cooperation Committee (TSCC) was established to oversee the final stages of elimination of Libya's WMD and MTCR-class missile programs. Cooperation with the United States and the UK led to the lifting of sanctions on Libya. President Bush made determinations in 2004 allowing certain sanctions to be lifted. President Bush made determinations in 2004 regarding Libya's receipt of nuclear enrichment equipment and design information for nuclear explosive devices. He determined that the termination of assistance under the AECA would harm U.S. interests, but also found it in the national interest for the Export Import Bank to support U.S. exports to Libya. Additionally, he rescinded the national emergency with respect to Libya. President Bush lifted trade, travel, and commercial restrictions on Libya, releasing $1.3 billion in frozen assets and providing OPIC guarantees. Direct flights between Libya and the United States were allowed, and Libya was removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2006. U.S. assistance in WMD dismantlement in Libya was funded by the State Department's Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund, totaling $34.2 million since 2004 for equipment removal, scientist retraining, export control, and securing radiological sources. State Department officials estimate that about $20 million more will be required to help Libya destroy the rest of its chemical stockpile. Senator Lugar has stated that the NDF \"does not have the size, scope, or experience to do dismantlement operations, to employ nuclear scientists, or undertake longer term nonproliferation efforts.\" One possibility is to use Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) funds for these activities, which became theoretically possible with the expansion of the application of CTR funds since FY2004, but which was impossible in a practical sense before July 2006 because of Libya's status as a state sponsor of terrorism. CTR funds may also contain more restrictions than NDF funds, particularly in contractual requirements. Congress may wish to consider whether to provide additional assistance. Congress may need to consider providing additional assistance to Libyan disarmament to meet contractual requirements."
