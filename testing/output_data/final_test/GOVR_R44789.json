    "content": "President Trump's Executive Order 13768 raises questions about withholding federal grant funds from sanctuary jurisdictions that do not comply with immigration laws. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the discretion to designate a jurisdiction as a sanctuary and restrict grant funding for non-compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373. Legal questions about the interpretation of the EO and defining sanctuary jurisdictions have been raised. The report discusses questions regarding the implementation of Executive Order 13768, which directs federal grant-making agencies to withhold funding from designated sanctuary jurisdictions. Key questions include what qualifies as a federal grant, which programs are affected, and how recipients in sanctuary jurisdictions may be impacted. The Attorney General and Secretary are tasked with ensuring compliance with the order, specifically for law enforcement purposes. The Executive Order will impact federal grant funding to sanctuary jurisdictions. The Office of Management and Budget defines federal grant awards as financial assistance from federal agencies. Data on grant outlays is provided by the FY2017 Historical Tables of the Budget of the United States Government. The Executive Order will impact federal grant funding to sanctuary jurisdictions, with estimated FY2017 outlays for grants to state and local governments at $596.7 billion. OMB issues guidance on government-wide policies for grants, with at least 998 federal programs listed. The EO directs the Attorney General and the Secretary to define which federal grant programs are affected. The Executive Order will impact federal grant funding to sanctuary jurisdictions based on the definition of \"federal grants\" by the Attorney General and the Secretary. The scope of affected grant programs could vary depending on the interpretation and implementation of the EO by federal agencies. The EO excludes designated sanctuary jurisdictions from federal grants, but lacks clarity on what constitutes a \"sanctuary jurisdiction.\" The Executive Order impacts federal grant funding to sanctuary jurisdictions, but lacks clarity on what defines a \"sanctuary jurisdiction.\" It raises questions about the eligibility of federal grant recipients in designated sanctuary jurisdictions, such as entitlement communities, and how funding would be affected in areas where only a portion of a city or state falls within a sanctuary jurisdiction. Federal grant applicants, including sanctuary jurisdictions, are subject to shared responsibilities in implementing federal laws. Designating sanctuary jurisdictions for federal grants can lead to implementation issues due to the lack of uniform characteristics. Federal agencies have the authority to evaluate eligibility and impose conditions on grant awards. The Executive Order makes designated sanctuary jurisdictions ineligible for federal grants, requiring agencies to review potential recipients' eligibility before awarding grants. The federal agencies have the authority to review the eligibility of grant applicants, including sanctuary jurisdictions, before awarding federal grants. This evaluation includes assessing the risks posed by the grant application and the ability to comply with statutory, regulatory, or other requirements. Designated sanctuary jurisdictions could be deemed ineligible for federal grant programs if they fail to meet these requirements, such as compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373. However, federal agencies may interpret the \"other requirements\" more narrowly to only include those directly related to the specific grant program, potentially leading to inconsistent application of the eligibility criteria. The decentralized structure of federal grant-making laws may lead to inconsistent application of the \"relationship test\" across agencies unless clear guidance is provided by the Attorney General and the Secretary. Federal awarding agencies must ensure that funding is used in accordance with statutory and public policy requirements, including those protecting public welfare and prohibiting discrimination. The federal awarding agencies must incorporate national policy requirements, including executive orders and statutory compliance, into grant awards. This includes imposing general terms and conditions on grant recipients to ensure compliance with relevant laws. The EO requires federal agencies to condition grant awards to sanctuary jurisdictions, evaluating compliance after the grant period. Noncompliance could impact future grant eligibility. Agencies may adjust grant conditions for agreements executed post-EO issuance. Implementation may affect FY2017 grant funds distribution. The implementation of the EO could impact federal grant funding for sanctuary jurisdictions due to the complexity of centralized policy implementation in the decentralized structure of federal grants administration. The impact depends on discretion exercised by the Attorney General and the Secretary in defining federal grants, determining exemptions for law enforcement purposes, and identifying sanctuary jurisdictions. Grant awarding agencies' discretion in administering programs and reviewing eligibility could also affect the impact of the EO on federal grant funding."
