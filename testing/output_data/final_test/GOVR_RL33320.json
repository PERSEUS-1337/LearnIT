    "content": "Five statutory provisions grant government agencies, mainly the FBI, the authority to issue National Security Letters (NSLs) for obtaining customer and consumer information in national security investigations. Congress has struggled to balance the effectiveness of NSLs with preventing abuse, stemming from dissatisfaction with the privacy exceptions in the Right to Financial Privacy Act. Initially, Congress acted to narrow the exception's scope without clear analysis, leading to the creation of NSL authority. The Right to Financial Privacy Act removed restrictions on customer information release by financial institutions but allowed them to refuse FBI access, especially in states with privacy laws. The first NSL statute was passed as an amendment to the Right to Financial Privacy Act, giving the FBI access to financial institution records in certain foreign intelligence cases. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act also provided the FBI with access to telephone company and communications service provider customer information. These NSL provisions allowed the FBI access to communications and financial business records under limited circumstances for foreign intelligence purposes. The NSL provisions granted the FBI access to communications and financial records held by telephone carriers and banks for foreign counter-intelligence investigations. Additional NSL provisions were added in the mid-1990s, allowing NSL use in government employee leak investigations and granting FBI access to credit agency records under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. These provisions lacked explicit enforcement mechanisms or penalties for non-compliance. The FBI requested an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act to improve its access to bank records for counterintelligence investigations. This access is crucial for utilizing the FBI's authority under the Right to Financial Privacy Act, but identifying the relevant financial institutions can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring various investigative techniques. The National Security Act NSL provision authorized access to credit and financial institution records of federal employees with security clearances for investigations of classified information leaks, serving as a deterrent to espionage for financial gain without burdening investigative agencies with unproductive recordkeeping. The Fair Credit Reporting Act and National Security Act sections have dissemination restrictions, safe harbor provisions, and nondisclosure provisions. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded FBI issuing authority for NSL statutes. The Fair Credit Reporting Act section allows for judicial enforcement. The USA PATRIOT Act amendments expanded NSL authority, allowing quicker and wider use by various government agencies for investigations related to international terrorism or foreign spying. The amendments also removed the requirement for information to pertain to a foreign power or its agents. The USA PATRIOT Act amendments expanded NSL authority to allow various government agencies investigating international terrorism access to consumer reports and information in a consumer's file. This authority was granted through a written certification by the government agency, similar to the FBI's authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The 2006 USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization statutes addressed concerns raised by court decisions regarding NSL authority, emphasizing the need for judicial review and permissible disclosure by recipients to comply with the First and Fourth Amendments. The 2006 USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization statutes amended the NSL statutes to create a judicial enforcement mechanism, establish penalties for non-compliance, allow recipients to consult an attorney, ease the nondisclosure requirement, expand congressional oversight, and call for an Inspector General's audit of NSL use. The 2006 USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization statutes amended the NSL statutes to create a judicial enforcement mechanism, establish penalties for non-compliance, allow recipients to consult an attorney, ease the nondisclosure requirement, and expand congressional oversight. Inspector General audits of NSL use were conducted, revealing a significant increase in FBI NSL requests and a majority of requests targeting American individuals' telephone or email communications. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) NSL statute allows the FBI to obtain telephone toll billing records and subscriber information through national security letters. This information helps identify individuals with frequent contact with the investigative subject, leading to investigations to uncover potential terrorist cells. The main objective of ECPA NSLs is to gather evidence for FISA orders. The Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) NSL statute, 12 U.S.C. 3414(a)(5), allows authorities access to a wide range of information for FISA orders. The FBI used this statute in a counterterrorism investigation involving convenience store owners sending funds to Hawaladars in the Middle East, suspected of having ties to Al Qaeda affiliates. Various violations were uncovered, including money laundering, fraud, and tax violations. The FBI issued national security letters to investigate various financial crimes such as unemployment insurance fraud, welfare fraud, immigration fraud, income tax violations, and sale of counterfeit merchandise. Bank account records revealed money transfers to suspicious individuals, aiding in overseas investigations. The Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL statutes provide insight into subjects' daily activities and financial behaviors relevant to counterterrorism efforts. The FBI used national security letters (NSLs) for various purposes, including determining if further investigation is needed, generating leads for other agencies, and corroborating information. However, the FBI was criticized for using NSLs in violation of statutes and policies, and for issuing \"exigent letters\" to obtain phone records without following proper procedures. The FBI obtained billing records and subscriber information from telephone companies without proper authorization, including obtaining consumer credit reports and financial records without following procedures. Numerous violations were found, including issuing over 700 exigent letters that circumvented laws and internal policies. The FBI division initiated over 300 NSLs without effective review, with 60% showing violations of internal control policies. Signed copies of NSLs were not retained, clear guidance on the least-intrusive investigative technique standard was lacking, and the interpretation of toll billing information in the ECPA NSL statute was unclear. SAC supervision made attorneys reluctant to question approved investigations, and misuse of NSL authority did not constitute criminal conduct. NSL use was considered indispensable, and information from NSLs fed into FBI systems. Prior to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), the Supreme Court ruled that customers had no Fourth Amendment privacy rights in telephone records. Fourth Amendment requirements may be eased in exigent circumstances, but satisfying them does not always comply with statutory prohibitions. The ECPA prohibits certain actions related to electronic communications. The ECPA prohibits communication service providers from disclosing customer records without exceptions like grand jury subpoenas or NSLs. Violations may lead to civil liability, not criminal penalties. The FBI obtained telephone records using \"exigent letters\" before serving NSLs or subpoenas, but claimed to have stopped this practice. The FBI may request emergency disclosures under 18 U.S.C. 2702(c)(4) if immediate danger justifies it. The Justice Department advised that ECPA may allow voluntary disclosure of call detail records to the FBI under certain circumstances. The second IG Report reviewed the FBI's use of national security letter authority in 2006 and corrective measures taken. The second IG Report found that the FBI's use of national security letters in 2006 continued to increase, with a significant rise in requests involving U.S. persons. The FBI and DOJ are working to address compliance issues identified in the first report, but it is uncertain if the new systems will fully resolve the problems. The third IG Report focused on the FBI's use of exigent letters and informal methods to obtain customer information from communication service providers. During 2003-2007, the FBI's use of exigent letters for acquiring customer records from communication service providers became casual and unsupervised. Employees sometimes created exigent letters for FBI personnel to sign, and sneak peeks were given without proper justification. This informality was facilitated by employees being assigned to FBI offices. The FBI's casual and unsupervised use of exigent letters for acquiring telephone records led to widespread violations of guidelines and policies. Employees made informal requests without legal process, used improper methods like sneak peeks and hot-number searches, and provided inaccurate information to the FISA Court. Recommendations were made to prevent further misuse. The IG's Report criticized the FBI's initial response to the misuse of exigent letters but acknowledged appropriate action was taken to address the issue. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York found that revised NSL procedures violated First Amendment and separation of powers principles, leading to an injunction against Justice Department officials. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit allowed limited use of the communications NSL statute. The Court of Appeals considered whether the nondisclosure features of the NSL communications statute should be subject to First Amendment strict scrutiny and if judicial review under the executive branch certification posed constitutional concerns. Previous cases had determined that the statute worked as a prior restraint on speech and was subject to strict scrutiny. Under strict scrutiny, the government must show that the nondisclosure requirement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. The government argued that not all instances of apparent prior restraint should be considered constitutionally suspect, citing examples like pre-trial discovery gag orders and grand jury secrecy. The courts have been hesitant to classify all cases of prior restraint as constitutionally suspect. The Supreme Court assessed the First Amendment validity of a pre-trial discovery gag order, considering whether it furthers a governmental interest unrelated to suppressing expression and if the limitation on First Amendment freedoms is necessary. The Second Circuit panel debated whether the NSL statute constituted prior restraint subject to strict scrutiny or a less demanding standard. Despite the lack of consensus, the government agreed to strict scrutiny analysis, leading to the same result under both standards. The panel agreed that the government's interest in national security is compelling and that the NSL statutory procedure must undergo real judicial review to conform to First Amendment standards. The procedure should require the government to show a good reason for disclosure related to authorized investigations to protect against terrorism or intelligence activities. The court emphasized the importance of real judicial review in the NSL statutory procedure to uphold First Amendment standards, rejecting the executive's conclusive certification of harm. It stated that deference to the executive to prohibit speech without scrutiny would reduce strict scrutiny to no scrutiny, except in cases of bad faith. The court suggested a procedure where NSL secrecy provisions could survive without requiring the government to initiate judicial review of nondisclosure requirements. The Government can assume a nondisclosure obligation without additional legislation, using a reciprocal notice procedure for judicial review. Time limits on the nondisclosure requirement must be applied to make the review procedure constitutional, limiting it to a 10-day period for the NSL recipient to contest. This conforms to First Amendment requirements and ensures real judicial review. The Government can impose a nondisclosure requirement on NSL recipients, with a 30-day period for Government review and a 60-day court adjudication period. If the recipient does not request judicial review, the nondisclosure requirement continues, with annual challenge opportunities. The court upheld the NSL statute and Section 3511(b) but found exclusive presumptions in Section 3511 invalid. The court declared Section 3511 binding on the review court could not survive, but the First Amendment finds no offense in the remainder of the two sections except for the lack of Government-initiated judicial review. The government responded to the partial invalidation ruling by using the suggested reciprocal notice procedure. On remand, the government submitted a declaration of the senior FBI official regarding the need for secrecy concerning the NSL. The district court granted the plaintiff's motion for an unclassified, redacted summary of the FBI declaration after an ex parte, in camera hearing. The Ninth Circuit raised a conflicting view on the constitutionality of NSL confidentiality and judicial review provisions. The court found the NSL confidentiality and judicial review provisions constitutionally suspect, but the statutory language and congressional intent were too clear to be interpreted differently. Congress aimed to give the government broad powers to issue NSL nondisclosure orders and prevent thorough judicial review. The provisions could not be narrowed to save their constitutionality, as evidenced by Congress amending and reenacting the statute to maximize government authority. The district court found that the NSL confidentiality and judicial review provisions were unconstitutional, leading to a ban on the government's use of NSL authority. This decision was influenced by leaks regarding the NSA's data collection program and recommendations from the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology. The Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology recommended changes to NSL procedures to align them more closely with FISA \"business record\" court orders. They proposed court approval for all NSLs except in emergencies, limiting Section 215 orders to international terrorism and espionage cases, amending NSL statutes to meet Section 215 minimization requirements, and increasing oversight and reporting for both NSLs and Section 215 orders. FISA's Section 215 allows court orders for tangible items in foreign intelligence cases, while NSLs provide government access to business records in intelligence investigations. The Review Group recommended aligning NSL procedures with FISA court orders, requiring judicial approval for NSLs except in emergencies, limiting Section 215 orders to terrorism and espionage cases, and increasing oversight. They argued that NSLs should only be issued upon judicial finding of relevance to authorized investigations, not by the FBI itself. The Review Group recommended aligning NSL procedures with FISA court orders, requiring judicial approval for NSLs except in emergencies. They argued that NSLs should only be issued upon judicial finding of relevance to authorized investigations, not by the FBI itself. The Group suggested that judicial approval for NSLs would be a step towards symmetry with other surveillance orders, but acknowledged the challenges of overwhelming the FISA court with the current volume of NSLs issued by the FBI. The Review Group recommended aligning NSL procedures with FISA court orders, requiring judicial approval for NSLs except in emergencies. They suggested that NSLs should only be issued upon judicial finding of relevance to authorized investigations. The Group also proposed limitations on how information generated by Section 215 orders can be used, stored, shared, and kept or disposed. The Group recommended aligning NSL procedures with FISA court orders, requiring judicial approval except in emergencies. They proposed limitations on how information from Section 215 orders can be used, stored, shared, and disposed of. Additionally, they suggested greater oversight and public disclosure for NSLs, Section 215 orders, trap and trace orders, Section 702 orders, and orders related to NSA bulk meta-data collection. They recommended detailed information availability to Congress and the public, with limitations on nondisclosure orders issued to recipients. The President's Review Group recommended limiting gag orders to cases involving human safety or diplomatic relations. Recipients could disclose the number of NSLs received, and the government should issue regular public reports. The USA FREEDOM Act addresses NSL shortcomings by eliminating bulk metadata collection, revising nondisclosure provisions, and increasing transparency through reporting requirements. The USA FREEDOM Act enhances transparency by limiting NSL demands to specific information, allowing judicial review of nondisclosure orders, and permitting disclosure to necessary parties despite a nondisclosure order. The USA FREEDOM Act amends Section 3511 to require the issuing agency to petition for judicial review upon request of the recipient for a nondisclosure order. The petition must demonstrate specific risks such as national security, interference with diplomatic relations, or physical harm. The court can issue the order if it believes disclosure would pose these risks during the specified time period. The USA FREEDOM Act amends Section 3511 to require the issuing agency to petition for judicial review for a nondisclosure order, with specific risks like national security. The final adjustment involves public disclosures, requiring the Director of National Intelligence to annually post the number of NSLs issued. Recipients can also publicly report the total number of FISA orders and NSLs. The NSL statutes have common attributes but differ in the businesses they target. For example, the Electronic Communication Privacy Act NSLs are for communications providers, while those under the Right to Financial Privacy Act can be directed to financial institutions. The Fair Credit Reporting Act NSLs may target consumer credit reporting agencies. The National Security Act NSLs can be sent to financial institutions, consumer credit reporting agencies, and any commercial entity with information on agency employee travel. FBI officials can provide certification for NSL issuance under five statutes, with exclusive authority in three instances. Certification requirements vary, with the Director of the FBI, senior FBI officials, or Special Agents in Charge needed for some statutes. Other statutes allow certification by officials from a wider range of agencies. The Credit Reporting Act NSL section allows certification by a wider range of agencies and officials, including senior officials like Assistant Secretary or Assistant Director. The purpose of NSLs is to acquire information related to national security concerns, such as protecting against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. The Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL section allows certification by designated supervisory officials of agencies authorized to conduct investigations or intelligence activities related to international terrorism. The Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL sections allow for the requesting intelligence agency to seek information for investigations, activities, or analysis. The National Security Act NSL authority is used for law enforcement investigations, counterintelligence inquiries, and security determinations. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act authorizes NSLs for relevant information, with similar standards for other NSL statutes. NSL provisions specify the information that may be requested, such as a customer's name, address, length of service, and billing records. The older Fair Credit Report Act section authorizes NSLs to acquire name, address, place of employment, and financial institution details. The Right to Financial Privacy Act covers financial records, while the more recent Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL provision includes consumer reports and other consumer information. The National Security Act provision is the most inclusive, allowing NSLs for financial and consumer information, as well as travel information. It limits the information provided to that pertaining to the target. The NSL statutes were amended in the 109th Congress to limit information disclosed to that relevant to the agency's investigation and approved by the target. Prior to this, the statutes had open-ended confidentiality clauses, such as the communications NSL provision prohibiting disclosure of FBI access to information. The early courts found this permanent nondisclosure command constitutionally unacceptable. After amendment, NSL recipients are only bound to secrecy upon certification by the requesting agency and court agreement if disclosure may endanger national security, diplomatic relations, ongoing investigations, or individual safety. Recipients can disclose to comply with the request, consult with attorneys, or with government approval, while advising them of the secrecy requirements. The recipient must comply with secrecy requirements and disclose to authorized parties. If an NSL includes a nondisclosure notice, the recipient has the right to seek judicial review. Failure to comply with a nondisclosure order can result in contempt of court or imprisonment. The federal courts have the authority to review and enforce NSL requests, with a fine of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). Recipients can petition to modify or set aside an NSL if compliance is deemed unreasonable, oppressive, or unlawful, similar to the standard for subpoenas. Compliance with NSLs may be burdensome, but there are few recognized privileges. The Rule also requires relevancy in the context of a grand jury investigation. The Rule imposes a relevancy requirement in the context of a grand jury investigation. A motion to quash an NSL will be denied unless it can be shown that the requested materials will not produce relevant information. The court has the authority to modify or set aside an NSL if it is unlawful, and failure to comply can result in contempt of court. Attorney General guidelines govern the sharing of information obtained through NSLs. The Fair Credit Report Act limits dissemination of information acquired in response to NSLs. The National Security Act allows sharing of NSL information within the FBI, with other agencies for foreign counterintelligence investigations, or with military investigators. The Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL section lacks restrictions on dissemination. NSL statutes offer incentives like immunity from civil liability and fees for compliance costs. Confidentiality is a key aspect of NSLs. Regular reports on the use of NSL authority must be made to congressional committees, and audits are conducted to ensure compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act. The USA FREEDOM Act requires the Director of National Intelligence to publish annual reports on the number of NSLs issued. The Director of National Intelligence is required to publish annual reports on the number of National Security Letters (NSLs) issued, allowing recipients to disclose publicly the number of NSLs and requests they have received. The chart summarizes the differences among the five NSL sections."
