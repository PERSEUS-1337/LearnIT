    "content": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides federal grants to states, territories, and tribes to address child poverty by assisting needy families, promoting work and marriage, reducing out-of-wedlock births, and supporting two-parent families. TANF allows states broad discretion in spending funds to meet federal goals. TANF is a federal program that helps states fund cash assistance programs for needy families with children. It is associated with welfare reform policies from 1996, imposing work requirements and time limits on families receiving assistance. TANF's performance is measured based on state welfare-to-work efforts, with a focus on work participation standards. However, only 27.6% of TANF funding in FY2013 went towards basic cash assistance. Many families receiving TANF cash assistance in FY2013 were not subject to work requirements or time limits, including families with disabled parents receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and immigrant parents. The report examines the TANF cash assistance caseload, focusing on changes in family composition and characteristics since the 1996 welfare reform law. It discusses the shift from predominantly single parents to a diverse caseload including disabled parents on SSI, immigrant parents with eligible children, and nonparent relative caregivers. The report provides details on the TANF caseload characteristics in FY2013, showing a shift from predominantly single parents to a diverse caseload with different routes to benefits. It complements data released by HHS and does not include TANF rules or current statistics on caseload or expenditures. The origins of assistance for needy families with children date back to early-1900s \"mothers' pension programs,\" which provided aid to families headed by a mother. Federal involvement began during the Great Depression with the Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) program, which aimed to help families with dependent children. The purpose of ADC payments was to allow mothers to stay at home rather than work. The Social Security Act provided aid to families with dependent children, aiming to release mothers from work to care for their children. Changes in social policy and economic circumstances made cash assistance controversial, with programs like welfare facing scrutiny. The Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) primarily assisted single mothers, with the option for two-parent families to receive aid starting in 1961. However, the majority of TANF cash assistance recipients remain single mothers. There was debate over whether lone mothers should work, as some were expected to work despite the program's original intent for them to stay home and raise their children. In the late 20th century, there was a shift towards encouraging work among single mothers receiving AFDC benefits. This led to an increase in poverty rates among children, especially those in single-mother households. Research highlighted a minority of mothers being on welfare for extended periods, prompting welfare-to-work initiatives in the 1980s. The welfare reform in the late 20th century aimed to move single mothers off benefit rolls and into jobs through work requirements and job preparation activities. This led to changes in aid for low-income families with children, including the creation of TANF with time limits and revamped work requirements. Today, TANF policy reflects the history of cash aid to needy families with children and policy debates of the 1980s and 1990s. The trend in cash assistance caseload from 1959 to 2013 shows periods of rapid growth in the mid-1960s to mid-1970s and from 1989 to 1994, followed by declines in the late 1990s and from 2001 to 2008. The caseload increased again from 2008 onwards. The cash assistance caseload increased from 2008 through 2010 during the economic slump of the 2007-2009 recession, albeit at a slower rate. The growth in caseload from 1989 to 1994 and its subsequent decline were associated with changes in the caseload characteristics, with a significant increase in the share of families with no adult recipients by FY2013. In FY2013, the cash assistance caseload consisted mostly of families with eligible children but ineligible adults, primarily headed by single mothers. The average family size was 2.5 recipients, with 51.0% having only one child. Women made up 85.7% of adult recipients, although men slowly increased in representation over time. Most families had young children, with 56.6% having a child under six and 12.0% having an infant. The majority of TANF families have young children, with 56.6% having a child under six and 12.0% having an infant. Hispanic children became the largest group of recipients by FY2013, making up 36.3% of child recipients. The share of Hispanic children receiving TANF has grown over time, reflecting their increasing representation in the general population and among poor children. The incidence of TANF cash assistance receipt among Hispanic children has actually declined over time. The TANF assistance caseload has seen a shift in the types of families receiving aid from FY1988 to FY2013. The classification divides families into six categories based on the circumstances of the adults in the household. Two main categories include families with adult recipients who are not employed, which used to dominate the caseload but now represent less than half, and families with employed adult recipients who still qualify for TANF due to low wages or short employment duration. The TANF assistance caseload has shifted in the types of families receiving aid. There are six categories based on adult circumstances. \"Child-only\" families have adults caring for children who are not TANF recipients but receive benefits on behalf of the children. These families include parents receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and ineligible noncitizens. States use TANF funds to provide benefits for children of SSI parents. The TANF program provides benefits for children of SSI parents, including ineligible noncitizens. States can use state funds to help federally ineligible noncitizens who are lawfully present. Unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for TANF aid, but children in \"mixed status\" families may qualify regardless of their parents' immigration status. The first goal of TANF is to assist needy families so children can be cared for in their own homes or with relatives, even if the caretaker is not financially responsible for the child. The TANF program provides benefits for children of SSI parents, including ineligible noncitizens. States can use state funds to help federally ineligible noncitizens who are lawfully present. Unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for TANF aid, but children in \"mixed status\" families may qualify regardless of their parents' immigration status. Nonparent relatives caring for children can receive financial assistance from the state. The cash assistance caseload increased from 3.7 million to 5.0 million per month from FY1988 to FY1994, with most growth in families with an ineligible parent or work-eligible adult. In FY1988 to FY1994, the cash welfare caseload grew from 3.7 million to 5.0 million families per month, with a significant increase in families with an ineligible parent or work-eligible adult. The \"child-only\" categories also saw growth, representing 10% in FY1988 and 17% in FY1994. However, from FY1994 to FY2001, the TANF caseload declined rapidly to 2.2 million families per month, with a notable decrease in families with an adult recipient and no employment, dropping from close to 3.8 million to less than 1 million. This group was closely associated with welfare dependency during the welfare reform debates of the 1980s and 1990s. During the FY2001 to FY2013 period, the TANF cash assistance caseload became more diverse, with families with unemployed adult recipients or work-eligible individuals making up 44.7% of the caseload. Another 17.3% of the caseload consisted of families with employed adult recipients or work-eligible parents. The \"child-only\" category, which was not a focus during the welfare reform debates of the 1980s and 1990s, became a larger share of the overall caseload. The TANF cash assistance caseload became more diverse from FY2001 to FY2013, with families consisting of unemployed adult recipients or work-eligible individuals making up 44.7% of the caseload. The \"child-only\" category, not previously focused on, grew to be a significant portion of the caseload, with three main groups including children with nonparent relative caretakers, ineligible noncitizen parents, and SSI recipient parents. The composition of TANF families varies by state due to demographic characteristics and policies. The TANF cash assistance caseload has become more diverse, with families categorized into five major groups. These include families with employed or unemployed adult recipients, \"child-only\" families with SSI parents or nonparent relative caretakers, and those with ineligible immigrant parents. Family size varies among these categories, with the most common family having one child. The \"child-only/other\" category lacks important data for analysis. TANF families with employed adults tend to be larger due to higher eligibility thresholds and benefit amounts for larger families. Families with ineligible noncitizen parents are also larger and more likely to retain eligibility for benefits. Earnings of noncitizen parents are considered in determining eligibility and benefits for the family. In FY2013, TANF child-only families with caretaker relatives were mostly single child cases. The majority of TANF families have young children, with a focus on families with an adult not employed, often having preschool children. TANF law allows exemptions for single parents with a child under 1 from work requirements. In FY2013, around 18.2% of TANF families with an unemployed adult had an infant. In FY2013, close to one-fifth (18.2%) of TANF families with an unemployed adult had an infant. Child-only families with an SSI parent or nonparent relative tended to have older children, with 30.5% and 28.9% having teenagers as their youngest child, respectively. The majority of TANF cash assistance recipients are racial and ethnic minorities, with Hispanic children making up the largest group at 36.3% in FY2013. African American children are the largest group in two family categories that include TANF adults. The largest group of children in child-only families cared for by nonparent relatives is non-Hispanic white, while historically, African American children were more likely to be in TANF child-only families cared for by nonparent relatives. However, the share of African American children in such families has declined over the years. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program was established in 1996 as part of welfare reform, emphasizing the expectation for single mothers to work. While the TANF law remains largely unchanged since its creation, states have used it to fund various services beyond cash assistance. The size and composition of the TANF caseload have also evolved over the years. The TANF cash assistance caseload has significantly changed since welfare reform in the mid-1990s, with a much smaller size of 1.7 million families in FY2013 compared to 5.0 million in FY1994. Families with an unemployed adult recipient, the focus of welfare reform debates, now make up less than half of all families on the rolls. In FY2013, 17.3% of the caseload had an adult reported as working, double the share in FY1994, often representing families in transition from welfare to work or with very low earnings. The TANF cash assistance caseload has changed significantly since welfare reform in the mid-1990s, with a much smaller size of 1.7 million families in FY2013 compared to 5.0 million in FY1994. In FY2013, 17.3% of the caseload had an adult reported as working, often representing families in transition from welfare to work or with very low earnings. Transitional benefits were discussed during welfare reform debates, showing that continued assistance for working families increased family income. States are incentivized to provide cash assistance to families with earnings under TANF's work participation standards. Since welfare reform in the mid-1990s, the TANF cash assistance caseload has significantly decreased. In FY2013, 17.3% of the caseload had working adults, showing a transition from welfare to work. States are encouraged to provide cash assistance to working families under TANF's work participation standards. There has been an expansion of earnings supplements and aid to working families through refundable tax credits, subsidized child care, and health insurance coverage. However, little attention has been given to how cash assistance to working families aligns with other earnings supplements like the EITC to achieve TANF goals. Many \"child-only\" TANF assistance families are impacted by TANF policy and other social policies, including the child welfare system. Congress has focused on relative caregiving through child welfare legislation, creating a program to help states reimburse kin who take legal guardianship of children eligible for federal foster care assistance. There is interest in promoting coordination between TANF and other federal and state programs serving TANF families, especially in terms of coordinating information between TANF and child welfare programs. The Department of Health and Human Services is required to develop data reporting standards for sharing information between TANF and other programs, including child welfare. Congress is considering requiring states to outline how they will coordinate services between TANF and child welfare programs in their state plans. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of TANF assistance for relative caregivers compared to foster care, and low rates of TANF receipt among eligible families with SSI parents. The May 2013 GAO report recommended giving explicit attention to each component of the TANF caseload, including \"child-only\" families. It suggested requiring states to provide additional information on the status and needs of these families in TANF state plans. Congress could establish goals and performance measures for the well-being of children in \"child-only\" families and require annual reporting on these goals to HHS. Annual reporting by states to HHS must include a statement on how goals for \"child-only\" families are being met, along with performance measures related to these goals."
