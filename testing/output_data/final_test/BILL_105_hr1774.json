It introduces a deduction for qualified higher education expenses under section 221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Families Educational Opportunity Act of 1997\" introduces a deduction for qualified higher education expenses under section 221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The deduction allows individuals to deduct the amount of qualified higher education expenses paid during the taxable year, with limitations such as a maximum deduction of $10,000 and reductions based on modified adjusted gross income. The term 'modified adjusted gross income' is defined as the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year, excluding specific sections and after applying certain adjustments. Inflation adjustments apply for taxable years after 1998 to certain amounts mentioned in the deduction for qualified higher education expenses. The $60,000 amounts in subparagraph (A) are increased annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment determined for the calendar year. Adjusted amounts are rounded to the nearest $1,000. The term 'qualified higher education expenses' refers to tuition and fees required for enrollment at an eligible educational institution on a full-time basis for the taxpayer, spouse, child, or legal guardian. Sports, games, or hobby-related education expenses are excluded. No deduction for education expenses related to sports, games, or hobbies unless part of a degree program. Special rules prevent double benefits for education expenses. A deduction for qualified higher education expenses is allowed only if the expenses exceed the amount excludable under section 135 for the taxable year. The deduction is limited to expenses related to attendance during the taxable year or an academic term beginning in the taxable year or the first three months of the next taxable year. The deduction is allowed without the need for itemization. The deduction for qualified higher education expenses is allowed without itemization, and the amendment allows for this deduction in the taxable year. The deduction for qualified higher education expenses is allowed without itemization and applies to payments made after December 31, 1997."
