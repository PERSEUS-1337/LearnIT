    "content": "The \"Small Business Opportunity and Growth Act of 2003\" allows for an exception from tax on recognized built-in gain of S corporations. The \"Small Business Opportunity and Growth Act of 2003\" provides an exception for existing S corporations with net recognized built-in gains, limiting the tax imposed on such gains if certain conditions are met. The Small Business Opportunity and Growth Act of 2003 allows S corporations to reduce tax on recognized built-in gains by making qualified expenditures. If no tax is due because of anticipated expenditures in the following year, but tax is later owed due to failure to make those expenditures, payment of tax is required. The tax imposed by the Small Business Opportunity and Growth Act of 2003 for the first taxable year of the nonrecognition period may be increased by 10 percent if qualified expenditures are not made. Qualified expenditures include amounts for property used in the S corporation's business, payments on pre-effective date debt, and distributions to shareholders. Payments of principal as part of a refinancing of pre-effective date debt shall not be taken into account under subparagraph (B). The term 'nonrecognition period' refers to the taxable year in which an S corporation has a net recognized built-in gain and the following taxable year. 'Pre-effective date debt' includes debt incurred before March 27, 2003, and debt incurred on or after that date. The text discusses rules regarding refinancing debt to prevent abuse, limiting the principal amount of refinanced indebtedness. Additionally, an anti-abuse rule is mentioned for determining distributions to shareholders during the recognition period. The amendment limits recognized built-in gain to specified amounts and requires immediate increase in account and shareholder basis if not permitted. The term 'existing S corporation' is defined. The amendment applies to taxable years starting after the enactment date, only for built-in gain recognized after that date."
