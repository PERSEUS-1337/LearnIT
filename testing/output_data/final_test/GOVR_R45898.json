    "content": "The United States and China are in a trade stand-off and competition across various areas, straining ties on the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations. Both countries are global leaders in economy, defense, and greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump Administration's strategy towards China is influenced by the National Security Strategy, which sees China as challenging American power and interests. The U.S. National Defense Strategy views China as a strategic competitor seeking regional hegemony and global preeminence. The Indo-Pacific Strategy Report highlights inter-state strategic competition as the primary concern for U.S. national security. The Trump Administration criticizes China's economic practices, accusing them of unfair trade policies. China's top leaders are focused on building their manufacturing base, which has led to tensions with the United States. They have refrained from direct criticism but acknowledge the complex and sensitive nature of the current U.S.-China relationship. The Vice Foreign Minister emphasized the need for coordination, cooperation, and stability in the relationship, pushing back against the idea that China is responsible for U.S. challenges. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq weakened U.S. strategic strength, while the global financial crisis exposed imbalances in the U.S. economy. China should not be blamed for economic issues like wealth gap and aging infrastructure. U.S.-China tensions existed before the Trump Administration, with longstanding frictions over Taiwan, trade, and human rights. Previous administrations were frustrated with China's failure to fulfill market-opening commitments made when joining the WTO in 2001. During the Trump Administration, competition has dominated the U.S.-China relationship, with tariffs imposed on Chinese imports. Global supply chains have been affected, and negotiations have not resolved the dispute. In August 2019, China was labeled a currency manipulator for the first time in 25 years. The Trump Administration has placed restrictions on U.S. firms supplying Huawei and warned against business dealings with China. President Trump ordered American companies to find alternatives to China, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The rising friction in the US-China relationship is attributed to the Trump Administration's confrontational approach and China's assertive behavior under President Xi Jinping. Xi has been in power since 2012, overseeing the construction of military outposts in the South China Sea, launching the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and implementing national security legislation that restricts civil liberties and foreign business operations. China's \"Made in China 2025\" plan aims to reduce reliance on foreign technology. In 2017, Xi Jinping directed resources towards developing Chinese firms in strategic industries and tasked the military to become a \"world-class\" force by mid-century. His government also forced over 1 million Turkic Muslims into reeducation camps. In 2018, term limits were removed, allowing Xi to stay in office indefinitely. The US and China are drawing countries into competing camps through BRI cooperation agreements. China's influence is evident in global alliances and business dealings, with countries divided on their stance towards China. Secretary of State Pompeo highlights China as a unique challenge due to its authoritarian regime integrated economically with the West. Despite tensions, areas of cooperation between the US and China include pressuring North Korea, supporting Afghanistan peace efforts, addressing public health issues, and combating the influx of China-produced fentanyl. The Trump Administration's critics share concerns about China's policies but disagree with the framing and specific policies. An open letter warns against treating China as an economic enemy, as it could isolate the US. Former Obama officials caution against assuming engagement with China was a mistake. Kurt M. Campbell and Jake Sullivan caution against assuming competition with China will succeed where engagement failed. They advocate for a balanced approach of coexistence with elements of competition and cooperation in military, economic, political, and global governance domains. Peter Varghese emphasizes the importance of the US lifting its game rather than thwarting China to maintain leadership. Many analysts criticize the Trump Administration for losing leverage against China by withdrawing from international agreements and institutions, neglecting relationships with allies, and sending mixed messages on trade and human rights. The Administration withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017 and the U.N. Human Rights Council in 2018. A letter urges the President to continue countering Communist China despite calls for engagement. The letter urges the President to continue countering Communist China despite calls for engagement. Policymakers believed the PRC would become a 'responsible stakeholder' with economic modernization, but this has not happened under the CCP rule. The letter welcomes measures taken to confront Xi's government and decouple the U.S. economy from China's efforts to weaken it. China, established by the CPC 70 years ago, is the world's most populous nation, largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and second-largest economic power. China is the world's second-largest economic power with a GDP of $13.6 trillion and the only Communist Party-led state in the G-20. Xi Jinping has been China's top leader since 2012, holding multiple key positions. In 2018, the National People's Congress amended the constitution to include \"Xi Jinping Thought\" and removed term limits for the state presidency. Xi Jinping holds multiple key positions in China, including the state presidency with no term limits, making him the top official in the Communist Party's decision-making body. He chairs various policy committees and is often referred to as the \"chairman of everything.\" Other members of the Politburo Standing Committee lead different political institutions in China. Xi Jinping holds multiple key positions in China, including the state presidency with no term limits, making him the top official in the Communist Party's decision-making body. The Communist Party maintains firm control over all political institutions in China, including the Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). China is comprised of 34 provincial-level administrative units, including provinces, autonomous regions with significant ethnic minority populations, municipalities reporting directly to the central government, and special administrative regions like Hong Kong and Macau. Taiwan, an island democracy, is also included in China's count of provinces. The PRC includes Taiwan in its count of provinces, even though it has never controlled the island. Provinces in China have their own revenue streams and are responsible for most public expenditure, including education and healthcare. They can pass their own laws as long as they don't conflict with national laws. Beijing allows provinces to adopt policies for economic growth and approved policy experiments. However, provinces do not have their own constitutions or the power to appoint their own leaders. President Xi aims to unite China around the \"China Dream of Great Rejuvenation.\" President Xi aims to rally China around the \"China Dream of Great Rejuvenation,\" which includes goals of building a prosperous society by 2021 and a modern socialist country by 2049. The vision also includes a strong military and promotes a \"community with a shared future for mankind.\" In a 2017 speech at the U.N. office in Geneva, Xi emphasized the \"community with a shared future\" to establish a fair international order. He called for non-interference in countries' internal affairs and the right to choose their own development path. Xi also criticized big countries for imposing their will on smaller ones and warned against willfully waging wars. The concept was later incorporated into the CPC's charter at the 19th Congress. Xi highlighted China's increased international influence and ability to shape global affairs. China's rise in international influence and power to shape global affairs was highlighted by Xi Jinping in a 2017 speech at the U.N. office in Geneva. In 2018, China incorporated the concept of a \"community with a shared future for mankind\" into its state constitution, with Xi pledging to lead global governance reform and build global partnerships. The history of U.S.-China relations includes the recognition of Chiang Kai-shek's ROC government by the U.S. after the Communist Party took power in China in 1949, as well as their opposing roles in the Korean War. In 1971, the Nixon Administration shifted U.S. policy towards China, leading to President Nixon's historic visit in 1972. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter normalized relations with the People's Republic of China. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter established diplomatic relations with China, acknowledging Taiwan as part of China. Carter also signed the Taiwan Relations Act, committing the US to sell defensive arms to Taiwan. Deng Xiaoping launched a program of \"reforming and opening\" to transform China's economy. In the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S.-China relationship focused on countering the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union's collapse, President Clinton and China's leader Jiang Zemin saw benefits in expanding economic ties. Clinton signed a law in 2000 granting China permanent normal trade relations, leading to its entry into the WTO in 2001. The Trump Administration later criticized the terms of China's WTO entry. The George W. Bush Administration supported China's entry into the WTO, but the terms were ineffective in promoting an open, market-oriented trade regime. After 9/11, the U.S. settled on counterterrorism cooperation with China, but China complicated this by labeling Uyghur separatists as terrorists. During the Obama Administration, despite mounting tensions over various issues, the U.S. and China focused on cooperation to address global challenges. The U.S.-China relationship has faced challenges over the past four decades, including the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989 and the U.S. allowing Taiwan's president to visit in 1995-1996. Despite these tests, cooperation between the two countries has been crucial in addressing global issues like the JCPOA nuclear deal and the Paris Agreement. The Third Taiwan Strait Crisis was sparked by a private visit to the US by a Taiwanese official, leading to China conducting missile exercises around Taiwan. In 1999, a US B-2 bomber mistakenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, causing anti-US demonstrations in China. In 2001, a collision between a Chinese fighter plane and a US reconnaissance plane further strained US-China relations. In 2001, a collision between a Chinese fighter plane and a US reconnaissance plane strained US-China relations. In February 2012, a Chinese Vice Mayor sought refuge in the US consulate in Chengdu, sharing information about his boss, leading to a political scandal. In April 2012, the US Embassy in China rescued blind legal advocate Chen Guangcheng from house arrest in Shandong Province. In May 2012, blind legal advocate Chen Guangcheng was moved from a Beijing hospital to the United States after high-stakes negotiations between U.S. and PRC diplomats. Presidents Trump and Xi have met face-to-face five times, with Trump often describing Xi as \"my friend\" despite criticizing PRC policies. In April 2017, Trump and Xi agreed to establish four high-level dialogues to manage the U.S.-China relationship. In 2017, Trump and Xi agreed to establish four high-level dialogues to manage the U.S.-China relationship, with only the Diplomatic and Security Dialogue convening in 2018. U.S.-China trade relations have expanded significantly over the past three decades, with China being the largest trading partner of the United States in 2018. The economic relationship has grown increasingly tense, with the Trump Administration launching an investigation into China's policies on intellectual property and technology. The Trump Administration imposed tariffs on Chinese imports in 2018, leading to a sharp decline in trade. President Trump announced further tariffs on remaining imports, later increasing the tariff rate to 15%. There is perceived ambivalence towards the trade relationship due to the persistent U.S. trade deficit with China. The U.S. trade deficit with China in 2018 was $380.8 billion, with exports totaling $178.0 billion and imports at $558.8 billion. President Trump expressed willingness to stop trading with China to save money. Exports to China accounted for 7.2% of all U.S. goods exports, with top exports being capital goods, industrial supplies, and automotive products. Imports from China accounted for 21.1% of all U.S. goods imports, with consumer goods, industrial supplies, and automotive products being the main imports. China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural and food products, leading to a significant decline in exports to China, particularly soybeans. Total U.S. agricultural exports to China decreased by 53.0% in 2018. In 2018, China's agricultural imports from the U.S. were $4.9 billion, up 8.9% from 2017. U.S. services exports to China totaled $57.1 billion, while imports of services from China were $18.3 billion. The bilateral trade surplus in services was $38.8 billion. Travel was the largest category of U.S. services exports to China, accounting for 56.1%. In 2018, U.S. services imports from China totaled $5.3 billion, with transport and travel being the leading categories. Despite increased U.S. FDI in China post WTO entry, investment levels have remained low due to China's regulatory regime favoring state-owned enterprises. Chinese FDI in the U.S. has slowed since 2016, with net U.S. FDI flows to China in 2018 at $7.6 billion. In 2018, U.S. FDI flows to China were $7.6 billion, down 22.9% from 2017, while net Chinese FDI flows into the U.S. were negative at -$754 million. The stock of U.S. FDI in China was $116.5 billion, and China's FDI in the U.S. was $60.2 billion. China holds approximately 2.0% of total U.S. FDI stock abroad, with $1.1 trillion of China's U.S. holdings in Treasury securities. In 2009, China surpassed Japan as the largest foreign holder of Treasury securities, with holdings increasing significantly. Military ties between the United States and China were established in 1979 but were strained after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Despite efforts to resume military relations in 1993, they never reached previous levels of cooperation. China has suspended military ties with the U.S. on occasions when its interests were perceived to be harmed. In 1999, Congress placed restrictions on military relations with China due to national security risks. U.S.-China military exchanges have included high-level visits, exchanges between defense officials, and academic exchanges, but the frequency has declined in recent years. The two militaries also engage in multilateral fora and coordinate occasionally. The U.S. and China occasionally engage in multilateral military exercises and coordinate activities such as counterpiracy patrols. U.S. objectives for military relations with China have shifted to focus on risk reduction. Tensions have arisen, with 18 incidents of unsafe interactions between U.S. and Chinese military forces since 2016. In 2018, the U.S. disinvited China from a maritime exercise due to ongoing concerns. In response to China's militarization of the South China Sea, the U.S. sanctioned the PLA's Equipment Development Department for arms purchases from Russia. Despite tensions, both countries remain committed to military engagement, with high-level meetings between U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe in 2018. The U.S. and China recognize the importance of their military-to-military relationship for overall bilateral stability. Since 2001, U.S. assistance efforts in China have focused on supporting human rights, democracy, rule of law, and environmental programs, as well as promoting sustainable development and environmental conservation. The U.S. government does not provide assistance to PRC government entities or Chinese NGOs directly, with grants mainly going to U.S.-based NGOs and universities. Between 2001 and 2018, the U.S. government provided approximately $241 million for programs in China administered by the Department of State's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL); $99 million for Tibetan programs; $72 million for rule of law and environmental efforts in the PRC; $43 million for health programs in China focused on HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment; and $8.0 million for criminal justice reform. DRL programs in China have supported rule of law development, civil society, government transparency, public participation in government, and internet freedom. Peace Corps volunteers have been engaged in environmental awareness programs and teaching English as a second language in China since 1993. Congress has also appropriated funds for Tibetan communities in India and Nepal since 2015. Since 2018, Congress has allocated an additional $3 million annually to support institutions and governance in Tibetan exile communities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provided an estimated $25.8 million for programs in China, including funding for human rights and democracy programs. The FY2020 Department of State foreign operations budget justification does not include a funding request for programs in China, as appropriations for such programs are determined by congressional foreign operations appropriations. In March 2018, the USTR released findings of an investigation into PRC policies on technology transfer, IP, and innovation. The investigation identified four IP rights-related PRC policies justifying U.S. action. Subsequently, the Trump Administration imposed increased tariffs on imports from China, leading to retaliatory tariffs from China. Negotiations to resolve the standoff broke down in May 2019. Following the breakdown of negotiations in May 2019, President Trump ordered increased tariffs on imports from China. Additional 10% tariffs were announced in August 2019, with exemptions for certain items and a delay for others until December 15. China responded to the announcement. China responded to President Trump's tariff announcements by allowing its currency to weaken against the U.S. dollar, suspending new purchases of U.S. agricultural products, and imposing retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of imports from the United States. Tariffs on some products took effect on September 1, 2019, with the rest scheduled for December 15, 2019. Additionally, China announced restoration of tariffs on U.S. autos and auto parts, set to go into effect on December 15, 2019. In response, President Trump stated he would increase the tariff rate on $250 billion worth of imports from China from 25% to 30%, effective October 1, 2019. President Trump announced an increase in tariffs on imports from China from 25% to 30% effective October 1, 2019. He also raised the proposed tariff rate for remaining imports from China from 10% to 15%, with some products affected on September 1, 2019, and others on December 15, 2019. Trade negotiators are set to meet for further negotiations in September 2019. China responded to previous tariffs by imposing retaliatory tariffs and pursuing legal action at the WTO. The U.S. Treasury Department labeled China a currency manipulator and announced plans to address China's actions. President Trump has raised concerns about U.S. trade imbalances with China, citing trade barriers and currency manipulation as issues. The IMF stated there is little foreign exchange intervention by China's central bank. Some argue that bilateral trade deficit data is misleading due to global supply chains, where products are developed in one country but manufactured elsewhere using imported components. Trade deficit size is attributed to U.S. macroeconomic policies rather than foreign trade barriers. The Trump Administration and others accuse China of employing various policies to gain trade advantages. The Chinese government implements policies like \"Made in China 2025\" to support domestic firms, especially state-owned enterprises, which could distort global markets and harm U.S. firms' competitiveness. Concerns also arise about Chinese firms in global supply chains, posing risks to U.S. national security due to their relationships with the Chinese state. U.S. officials view Chinese IPR violations as a significant source of economic losses, with lax enforcement being a major challenge for U.S. firms operating in China. The challenges of doing business in China include lax IPR enforcement, viewed as a deliberate advantage for domestic firms. China has expansive efforts to acquire U.S. technology, leading to economic espionage charges against Chinese state actors. In 2014, five PRC military officers were indicted for hacking into U.S. firms. In 2015, the US and China agreed to not support cyber theft of intellectual property. Despite lower cyber activity post-agreement, China was accused of massive IP theft in 2018. In 2019, China was identified as the top cyber espionage threat by the US intelligence community. The Trump Administration has prioritized national security concerns. The Trump Administration has raised national security concerns over global supply chains of advanced technology products, particularly focusing on China as a major producer and supplier. President Trump has taken actions such as blocking a Chinese acquisition of a U.S. semiconductor firm and signing Executive Order 13873 to ban certain technology transactions involving \"foreign adversaries.\" Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. has been under scrutiny, with the U.S. Department of Commerce adding Huawei and its affiliates to the Entity List, requiring U.S. companies to apply for an export license for technology sales or transfers. The U.S. Department of Commerce added Huawei and its affiliates to the Entity List, requiring export licenses for technology sales. The decision was based on national security concerns and Huawei's indictment for violating Iran sanctions. A temporary general license was issued to ease the impact, but additional non-U.S. Huawei affiliates were later added to the list. China responded with plans for an \"unreliable entities list\" in June 2019. Ministry of Commerce announced plans for its own \"unreliable entities list\" in June 2019, targeting foreign entities that harm Chinese firms. Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo have urged allies to avoid working with Huawei due to security concerns. Pompeo warned European allies not to jeopardize shared security interests. Australia is the only U.S. ally to have banned Huawei so far. The Huawei issue has strained U.S.-Canada and Canada-China relations. In 2018, the U.S. requested Canada to detain Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou for financial fraud. China retaliated by detaining Canadians and cutting off imports. President Trump issued a memorandum on reforming developing-country status in the World Trade Organization, criticizing the outdated dichotomy between developed and developing countries. He specifically targeted China, stating that their claim to developing-country status is unfounded. The USTR was instructed to reform the WTO self-declaration practice and may take unilateral actions if no progress is made within 90 days. China defended its developing-country status claim, stating it reflects core WTO values. President Xi launched projects to boost economic connectivity through the \"Silk Road Economic Belt.\" China's \"Belt and Road Initiative\" aims to enhance economic connectivity through infrastructure projects across continents, promoting diplomatic and security interests. The scale of financing and investments under the initiative is debated, with China not providing authoritative figures. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aims to address infrastructure shortfalls in recipient countries, but has faced criticism for rushed agreements, lack of feasibility studies, and unsustainable debt. Some countries have sought to renegotiate BRI agreements due to issues with Chinese developers cutting corners and evading responsibility. The Trump Administration has also taken a stance on BRI projects. The Trump Administration has criticized China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) for \"debt diplomacy\" and opaque loan terms. The BUILD Act of 2018 established the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation in response to BRI. Xi Jinping addressed concerns about project sustainability at the Second Belt and Road Forum in April 2019. Xi Jinping emphasized the need for transparency and zero tolerance for corruption in all Belt and Road Initiative projects to achieve intended goals. U.S. policymakers are concerned about China's military modernization program posing challenges to U.S. interests in Asia and beyond, impacting defense strategy, budgets, and overall relations with China. The PLA is transforming from a low-technology, ground forces-centric military to a high-technology, networked force with a focus on joint operations, maritime and information domains, offensive air operations, power projection, and cyber and space operations. It is expanding its global presence with counterpiracy patrols, regular patrols in the South China Sea and Indian Ocean, task group deployments worldwide, and establishing overseas military bases. President Xi has set deadlines for the PLA to complete its modernization by 2035 and become a \"world class\" military by 2049. China aims to build a strong military in line with its national defense goals. China's military aims to build a strong defense and challenge U.S. dominance in air, space, and cyberspace with advanced technologies. Chinese officials claim their military posture is defensive. China's Ministry of National Defense stated in January 2018 that China follows a path of peaceful development and upholds a defensive national defense policy, emphasizing that China is not interested in dominance. China has supported U.N. Security Council Resolutions imposing sanctions on North Korea, but the Trump Administration has criticized China for inconsistent implementation. The Treasury Department has designated Chinese companies and individuals for alleged violations. China, Hong Kong, and PRC nationals are accused of violating U.S. North Korea sanctions. Efforts to declare North Korea's procurement of petroleum products above permitted levels were blocked by China and Russia. North Korea obtained excess petroleum through illegal ship-to-ship transfers. President Trump's 2018 summit with Kim Jong-un improved China-North Korea relations. China advocates for a dual-track approach for a political settlement on the Korean Peninsula. China advocates for a \"dual-track approach\" for a political settlement on the Korean Peninsula, focusing on denuclearization and establishing a peace mechanism. The PRC is involved in a territorial dispute with Japan over the Senkaku Islands, which the US recognizes under Japanese administration due to the US-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security. The US conducts freedom of navigation operations in the region. China has increased patrols in the East China Sea to assert jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands and established an air defense identification zone. They also make extensive claims in the South China Sea with a \"nine-dash line\" and control the Paracel Islands. The South China Sea is a region with territorial disputes involving the Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, and Scarborough Shoal. China has built artificial islands in the Spratly chain and has conflicts with Vietnam and the Philippines over territorial claims. The area is strategically important for the U.S. Navy, and China has sought to block other countries from their exclusive economic zones. China has militarized artificial islands in the South China Sea, leading to tensions with the United States. The U.S. conducts Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) to challenge excessive maritime claims and assert its rights in the region. China has criticized these operations as a show of force by countries outside the region. China and ASEAN are negotiating a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea, with China setting a deadline of 2021. The draft includes language restricting joint military exercises with countries outside the region, potentially targeting U.S. exercises with ASEAN members. In 2013, the Philippines sought arbitration over maritime disputes. In 2013, the Philippines sought arbitration under UNCLOS over PRC actions in the South China Sea. An UNCLOS arbitral tribunal ruled in 2016 that China's nine-dash line claim had \"no legal basis\" and that China violated the Philippines' sovereign rights. China declined to participate in the arbitration process and declared the ruling \"null and void.\" Xi Jinping intensified party control over society since consolidating power in 2013. China has enacted new national laws strengthening state control since 2015. China's government has enacted new national laws to strengthen state control over social activities in the name of national security. The laws also authorize greater controls over the Internet and ethnic minority groups. Xi Jinping launched a policy called \"Sinicization\" in 2016, requiring religious populations to conform to Han Chinese culture and Communist Party policies. Authorities in Xinjiang have undertaken mass internment of Turkic Muslims since 2017 in the name of combating terrorism and religious extremism. The Chinese government has detained around 1.5 million Uyghurs and a smaller number of ethnic Kazakhs in reeducation centers. Detainees are forced to express loyalty to the Communist Party, renounce their religious beliefs, and endure harsh conditions including beatings and food deprivation. The camps are described as \"vocational education and training centers\" by Chinese officials. In July 2019, a Xinjiang official claimed that the majority of those who return from the camps find suitable jobs they like and can earn a satisfactory living. Many Uyghurs abroad still have not heard from missing relatives in Xinjiang. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called China's human rights crisis the stain of the century. Sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act against Xinjiang officials were reportedly set aside during US-China trade negotiations. In July 2019, 22 nations at the UNHRC called on China to stop detaining Uighurs in Xinjiang and allow international observers access. On July 12, envoys from 37 countries, including Muslim-majority nations, supported China's policies in Xinjiang. China claimed that 50 countries signed a letter in support. Hong Kong, a SAR of China, has a population of 7.5 million, including 85,000 U.S. citizens. The former British colony of Hong Kong reverted to the People's Republic of China in 1997 under the \"Joint Declaration\" treaty. The treaty promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, with its social and economic systems remaining unchanged for at least 50 years. The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was passed in 1990, serving as a mini-constitution. The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 provides separate treatment for Hong Kong as long as it remains sufficiently autonomous. Since June 2019, Hong Kongers have protested against extradition amendments, demanding full withdrawal, dropping charges, an independent police misconduct investigation, and universal suffrage as promised in the Basic Law. Chief Executive Carrie Lam suspended the amendments but labeled the protests as \"riots,\" leading to police use of force. China's state media accuses the US of instigating unrest in Hong Kong, circulating a photo of a US political officer meeting with opposition leaders. President Trump calls the protests in Hong Kong \"riots\" and praises President Xi's handling of the situation. He believes it is up to China and the HKSAR government to resolve the issue, but warns against violence like Tiananmen Square. The cochairs of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission and other Members of Congress have called for the Trump Administration to stop U.S. sales of tear gas, pepper spray, and other riot gear to the Hong Kong Police Force. Hong Kongers have protested against China's alleged failure to fulfill its obligations under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law in the past. Large protests occurred in 2003 and 2014, known as the \"Umbrella Movement,\" against proposed bills and restrictions. U.S. policy towards Tibet is also mentioned. The \"Umbrella Movement\" protests in Hong Kong have led to calls for the U.S. government to promote dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama, protect Tibet's cultural heritage, and support development projects in Tibet. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 requires the State Department to maintain a Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues and press for the release of Tibetan political prisoners. The U.S. government and human rights groups have criticized Chinese controls on religious practices in Tibet. The Chinese government has imposed strict controls on religious life in Tibetan areas since 2008, leading to arbitrary detentions, increased security in monasteries, and restrictions on Tibetan-language education. The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act was passed in response to limited access for foreigners, requiring annual reports on access granted to U.S. diplomats, journalists, and tourists. The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act prohibits individuals involved in policies restricting access to Tibet from entering the US. Concerns arise over China's control of the Dalai Lama's succession process, insisting on compliance with Chinese laws. China insists that the Dalai Lama's reincarnation must be found in China and approved by the central government in Beijing, despite the Dalai Lama asserting his sole authority over the process. China lobbies to prevent world leaders from meeting with the Dalai Lama, while US Presidents have historically met with him, except for President Trump. Chinese authorities are using advanced surveillance technologies to monitor and control their population, including ethnic Tibetans and Uyghurs. They are also developing a social credit system to incentivize trustworthy behavior and punish untrustworthy conduct. Chinese companies are exporting these technologies globally. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) launched a database mapping Chinese technology companies' overseas activities, including 5G network installations in 34 countries and \"safe cities\" surveillance technologies in 46 countries. Freedom House identified Chinese companies' involvement in internet and mobile networking equipment in 38 countries, intelligent monitoring systems in 18 countries, and media training in 36 countries. China was ranked last in internet freedom. The United States maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan under the \"one-China\" policy, upholding the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act for security commitments. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, leading to the termination of formal diplomatic ties when the US established relations with the PRC in 1979. China ranks last in internet freedom according to Freedom House's report. The United States maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan under the \"one-China\" policy, upholding the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act for security commitments. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and protests U.S. actions supporting Taiwan, including arms sales and Navy transits of the Taiwan Strait. President Trump reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the \"one-China\" policy in a 2017 phone call with President Xi. China also conducts military patrols near Taiwan, raising tensions in the region. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy reiterates the U.S. commitment to the \"One China\" policy regarding Taiwan. The language on Taiwan has evolved, with a 2019 report referring to Taiwan as a \"country\" and highlighting its partnership with the U.S. in upholding the international order. The United States upholds the rules-based international order and supports a strong, prosperous, and democratic Taiwan. In 2018, the 115th Congress passed the Taiwan Travel Act, allowing U.S. officials to travel to Taiwan for meetings and high-level Taiwan officials to visit the U.S. In 2019, the U.S. hosted a meeting between the U.S. and Taiwan National Security Advisors, the first such meeting since 1979. In July 2019, the Trump Administration allowed Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen to make high-profile \"transit\" visits through New York City and Denver, CO, on her way to and from visiting diplomatic allies in the Caribbean. Each visit spanned three days, including a brief closed-door speech at Columbia University, a walk in Central Park, and an event at Taiwan's representative office for the U.N. representatives of Taiwan's diplomatic partners. The Trump Administration has notified Congress of 11 Taiwan FMS cases with a combined value of about $11.76 billion. China's Ambassador to the United States warned against attempts to split China, stating that Taiwan is part of China. In response to the proposed sale of F-16C/D Block 70 fighter planes to Taiwan, the Chinese Foreign Ministry threatened to sanction U.S. companies involved in the arms sale. Both China and the United States are parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with pivotal roles in efforts to stabilize human-induced climate change. China and the United States are key contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions, with China emitting more CO2 than the US. However, China has been reducing its energy intensity more rapidly due to structural changes and policies. The US has higher emissions per person due to higher incomes and consumption, with some of its consumption leading to GHG emissions from manufacturing in China. China's emissions per person are rising with incomes and consumption, and its total emissions may continue to rise with economic growth. China and the United States are key contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions. China's emissions may continue to rise with economic growth, while the US emissions may remain flat through the 2020s and grow from the 2030s. China has set targets to peak its emissions before 2030, but it is uncertain if they will reach \"net zero\" emissions. Both countries have cooperated on environmental and energy projects for decades. China and the United States have cooperated on environmental and energy projects for decades. Joint research continues on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies, energy efficiency, vehicles, water-energy, and nuclear energy. China is developing a national GHG cap and emissions trading system, with a target start date of 2020. The future of U.S.-China relations on climate change is uncertain, with China maintaining or increasing its leadership under the UNFCCC's 2015 Paris Agreement, while the U.S. government intends to withdraw from the agreement in November 2020. Neither government has produced long-term national-level policies and plans to address climate change. China and the United States have cooperated on environmental and energy projects for decades, with ongoing joint research on key technologies. The lack of long-term national policies to address GHG emissions and climate change is a concern. The U.S. and China could play important roles in assisting less-developed countries in this regard. Friction in their relationship includes China's alleged violations of international conventions in handling U.S. citizens, such as using exit bans to pressure their relatives or associates wanted by Chinese law enforcement. The U.S. mission in China reports arbitrary detention and interrogation of U.S. citizens by PRC authorities for 'state security' reasons. The U.S. government seeks China's cooperation in issuing travel documents for repatriation of PRC nationals with criminal convictions. China consistently refuses to issue travel documents for the majority of these individuals. According to CDC data, synthetic opioids, mainly fentanyl, caused over 31,000 US overdose deaths in 2018. The DEA attributes the fentanyl epidemic to clandestine production in China and Mexico. China added fentanyl-related substances to a controlled list in response to US pressure, aiming to combat illicit drug trafficking globally. Li Yuejin from China's National Narcotics Control Commission emphasized the importance of international security and stability in this decision. In April 2019, China announced plans to control all fentanyl substances, welcomed by the DEA. However, President Trump criticized China in August 2019 for not stopping fentanyl from entering the US. China's Foreign Ministry stated that the root cause of the fentanyl issue lies with US demand, not Chinese supply. The U.S. opioid epidemic is driven by U.S. demand, not Chinese supply. Over 150 bills related to China have been introduced in the 116th Congress. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2020 includes provisions referencing China."
