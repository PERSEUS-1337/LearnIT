    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Recycling Investment Saves Energy\" or the \"RISE Act\". The Senate acknowledges the significant impact of recycling in the United States, with over 56,000 establishments employing 1.1 million people and generating billions in revenue. Recycling saves energy by reducing the need for virgin raw materials, with the energy wasted from not recycling various materials equaling the output of 15 power plants annually. The reuse of 500 steel drums per week yields 6 trillion Btu's per year, enough energy savings to power a city the size of Colorado Springs for 1 year. Unfortunately, the US recycling rate for many consumer commodities is stagnant or declining, leading to difficulties in obtaining recycled materials for businesses. This has resulted in manufacturing facilities closing or re-tooling to use virgin materials, with significant environmental impacts. Increased reuse and recycling offer significant environmental benefits, including cleaner air, safer water, and reduced production costs. For instance, between 2-5% of the waste stream is reusable, preventing waste creation and adverse impacts from disposal. Recycling various materials like office paper, aluminum, plastic, glass, and steel saves landfill space and prevents air pollutants from being released. A national investment in reuse and recycling industries is crucial to preserve and expand America's recycling infrastructure and save landfill space.

The solid waste disposal function ends at the point of final disposal, incineration for energy, or conversion into a sellable material. In cases of dual function facilities, the solid waste function is separate. The costs of a facility allocable to the solid waste disposal function are determined using any reasonable method based on facts and circumstances. If at least 65 percent of materials processed in a facility are solid waste materials, then all costs of the property used for the process are allocable to a solid waste disposal function.

The amendment applies to bonds issued before, on, or after the enactment date of the Act."
