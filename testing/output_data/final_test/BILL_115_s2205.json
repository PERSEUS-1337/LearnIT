    "content": "The \"Tribal Connect Act of 2017\" allows tribal libraries and qualifying anchor institutions to receive E-rate support. Section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to allow Tribal Libraries and Qualifying Anchor Institutions to receive E-Rate support for broadband Internet access services. The term 'E-rate support' refers to universal service discounts on eligible services for Tribal Libraries and Qualifying Anchor Institutions. 'Indian tribe' is defined as per section 20.1 of title 25, Code of Federal Regulations. A 'qualifying anchor institution' includes facilities owned by Indian tribes such as tribal government buildings. An Indian tribe eligible for Library Services and Technology Act support can designate a tribal library for E-rate support, regardless of state library assistance eligibility. The Library Services and Technology Act allows tribal libraries to receive E-rate support, regardless of state library assistance eligibility. The Commission will establish a pilot program called the Tribal Anchor Institution Program to provide E-rate support to Indian tribes for designated anchor institutions. Tribal governments must meet eligibility criteria to receive this support. The Tribal Anchor Institution Program provides E-rate support to Indian tribes for designated anchor institutions. To be eligible, a tribal government must not have an existing tribal library eligible for the program within the tribal community. E-rate support is only available if the proposed qualifying anchor institution is exclusively owned by the Indian tribe. The qualifying anchor institution aims to provide public Internet access for educational purposes to students, teachers, librarians, and community members. The Commission does not have the authority to modify eligibility requirements, and contributions to the Universal Service Fund are specified. The Tribal Connect Act of 2017 allocates $20,000,000 annually for the Universal Service Fund to support tribal schools and libraries. The Commission oversees the use of funds to ensure participation in the E-rate program. The Tribal Connect Act of 2017 allocates funds to support tribal schools and libraries in participating in the E-rate program through outreach, training, and technical assistance initiatives. The Commission reviews annual reports to determine additional steps for program effectiveness. The Tribal Connect Act of 2017 allocates funds to support tribal schools and libraries in participating in the E-rate program. The Commission aims to improve data reliability and develop performance goals to ensure affordable broadband access for tribal libraries. The Tribal Connect Act of 2017 requires stakeholders to develop goals and measures for broadband access in tribal schools and libraries, with a report due to Congress within a year of enactment."
