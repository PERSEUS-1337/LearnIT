    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Battlefield Protection Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to the protection of battlefields from these historical wars. The Congress finds that urbanization and development are threatening the preservation of significant Revolutionary War and War of 1812 battlefields. The National Park Service's 2003 Historical Preservation Study reveals that 13% of nationally significant Revolutionary War and War of 1812 battlefields are lost, 30% are in poor condition, and 27% may be destroyed or impaired within the next ten years, with 9% at risk within the next three years. Urbanization and development are threatening the preservation of these sites. The Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program aims to preserve Revolutionary War and War of 1812 battlefields threatened by urbanization and development. The American Battlefield Protection Act of 1996 is amended to include a Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program for Revolutionary War and War of 1812 battlefields. Eligible entities are defined as State or local governments, and eligible sites are those threatened by urbanization and development. The Secretary will establish a battlefield acquisition grant program for nationally significant Revolutionary War and War of 1812 battlefields. Grants will be provided to eligible entities to acquire interests in eligible sites for preservation and protection. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of the Interior through the American Battlefield Protection Program. The eligible entities can partner with nonprofit organizations to acquire interests in eligible sites for preservation. The non-Federal share of the acquisition cost must be at least 50 percent. The acquired sites are subject to limitations on land use. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on the activities within 5 years of the enactment of this subsection. The Secretary must update Congress on battlefield preservation activities at 871 sites within 3 years of enactment, detailing changes and developments. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate funds from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for grants related to battlefield preservation activities, with $10,000,000 allocated for fiscal years 2004 through 2008. Additionally, $500,000 is authorized for updating battlefield reports. Amendments specify the Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program for Battlefields of the Civil War. The program authorizes funds from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for battlefield preservation grants, with specific allocations for fiscal years 2004 through 2008. Amendments establish the Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program for Civil War battlefields, with changes to terminology and expiration dates."
