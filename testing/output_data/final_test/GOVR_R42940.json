    "content": "The integration of drones into U.S. skies is expected to bring commercial and societal benefits, with potential applications in inspecting pipelines, surveying crops, and monitoring weather. The FAA has been tasked with safely integrating drones into the national airspace system by September 2015. Lobbying groups and drone manufacturers are advocating for a more rapid expansion of drones in the domestic market. However, the full-scale introduction of drones will raise legal issues. The report explores legal issues surrounding the integration of drones into U.S. skies, including regulatory frameworks, property rights, privacy concerns, and potential congressional responses. It also discusses the historical theory of airspace rights and the FAA's approach to privacy concerns. The legal concept of \"ad coelum\" states that whoever owns the land also owns the space above it. This idea was incorporated into English and American common law. With the rise of commercial aviation, Congress passed laws asserting US sovereignty over its airspace and declaring a public right of freedom of transit. This conflicted with the common law notion that landowners owned the airspace above their property. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 centralized responsibility for civil aeronautics and established uniform rules for aviation operations in federal airspace. The FAA continues to set these rules, with Congress instructing them to integrate civil unmanned aircraft safely in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. The FAA is required to develop a plan for integrating civil unmanned aircraft into the national airspace system by September 30, 2015. FAA regulations specify minimum safe operating altitudes for different types of aircraft, including requirements for emergency landings and operating altitudes in congested and non-congested areas. Navigable airspace is defined as the airspace above minimum safe operating altitudes for aircraft. Helicopters have more flexibility in minimum altitudes compared to fixed-wing aircraft. The FAA does not currently regulate minimum operating altitudes for drones. Defining navigable airspace for drone operation may be a response to Congress's directive to integrate civil drones into the national airspace system. The FAA may create different classes of drones based on size and capabilities, with larger drones subject to similar altitude requirements as fixed-wing aircraft. Currently, all drone operators not exempt for recreational use must seek FAA permission to fly. Federal, state, or local agency-operated drones require a certificate of authorization or waiver from the FAA. The FAA conducts a review of drones and can place limits on their operation for safe airspace use. They have streamlined the process for obtaining COAs, allowing for temporary grants if needed. Civil operators must receive a special airworthiness certificate to operate commercially. The FAA is working towards integrating civilian drones into national airspace. The FAA is working towards integrating civilian drones into national airspace by the end of FY2015. Recreational users are encouraged to follow guidelines such as flying away from populated areas and notifying authorities when flying near airports. Compliance with these guidelines is voluntary. The FAA is tasked with creating a comprehensive plan for integrating civil drones into national airspace, including certification processes, sense and avoid capabilities, operator standards, and a phased-in approach to integration. The plan must ensure safe operation of civil drones alongside publicly operated drones. The FAA is directed by FMRA to develop rules for civil and public drone operations in national airspace, including certification requirements and updating policies. FMRA also mandates the implementation of standards for public unmanned aircraft systems by the end of 2015. Additionally, the FAA is prohibited from regulating certain model aircraft used for hobby or recreational purposes. The FAA is prohibited from regulating model aircraft used for hobby or recreational purposes if they meet certain criteria, such as being less than 55 pounds and flown within line of sight. Operators must notify airports if flying within five miles. Enforcement actions can be taken against those endangering airspace safety. FMRA also directs the FAA to establish test ranges for drone integration. The FAA is directed by the FMRA to establish six test ranges for drone integration, designated for both manned and unmanned flights. The test ranges will develop certification and air traffic standards, coordinate with NASA and the Department of Defense, and address civil and public drone operations. Geographic and climactic diversity, as well as ground infrastructure, are factors for site selection. The overall purpose is to gather data for safe drone operation in the National Airspace System. The FAA is in the process of selecting test range sites for drone integration, considering factors like geographic diversity and ground infrastructure. The FAA also announced privacy requirements for operations at these sites. The United States v. Causby case established ownership rights of airspace above private property. The Takings Clause prohibits the government from taking private property for public use without compensation. In the United States v. Causby case, the military planes flying over a chicken farm caused noise and glare, leading to the farm owners giving up their business. The Court had to determine whether the loss of property from military planes flying over a chicken farm constituted a taking without just compensation. The Court rejected the common law conception of airspace ownership, noting Congress's declaration of a public right of transit in air commerce and national sovereignty in the airspace. This conflict could subject aircraft operators to countless trespass suits. The Court rejected the common law conception of airspace ownership, noting Congress's declaration of a public right of transit in air commerce and national sovereignty in the airspace, which could subject aircraft operators to trespass suits. The Court found that the landowner owns as much space above the ground as they can occupy or use in connection with the land, regardless of physical occupation. The Court found that the landowner owns the airspace in the immediate reaches of the surface necessary to use and enjoy the land. Invasions of this space are considered the same as invasions of the surface. The airspace above these immediate reaches is part of the public domain, but the Court did not establish a clear boundary. The government's argument about flights in navigable airspace was deemed irrelevant as the flights over Causby's land were not within navigable airspace. The Court suggested that even if the flights were within navigable airspace, the inquiry would not immediately end. The Court concluded that flights over private land are not a taking unless they directly interfere with the land's use and enjoyment. In the case of the Causbys' chicken farm, the military flights imposed a servitude on the land, diminishing its value and preventing its use as intended. This marked a shift from the idea that landowners owned their vertical slice of airspace. The court case established factors for takings claims related to flights over private land, questioning the intersection of navigable airspace and private property rights. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the extent of private property rights in relation to airspace and the impact of lawfully operated aircraft on takings claims. The court case established factors for takings claims related to flights over private land, questioning the intersection of navigable airspace and private property rights. Subsequent cases have brought various legal claims, including trespass and nuisance, to address intrusions upon airspace. Courts use Causby as a starting point for analyzing property-based challenges to airspace intrusions, leading to different interpretations and standards for airspace ownership. The expansion of the federal definition of \"navigable airspace\" impacts property owners' claims to airspace ownership. The strict separation between navigable airspace and airspace owned by landowners has been questioned by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court disavowed the idea that a landowner can claim airspace ownership. In Braniff Airways v. Nebraska State Board of Equalization & Assessment, the Court mentioned the possibility of a taking based on flights in navigable airspace. In Griggs v. Allegheny County, the Court ruled that low flights over a property constituted a taking under the Fifth Amendment due to noise and fear, making the property undesirable for residential use. Flights over a property were deemed to have caused an \"undesirable and unbearable\" situation for residents, leading to a taking despite proper operation within federal regulations and navigable airspace. Some courts still support a fixed-height ownership theory, while another interpretation of the case suggests a presumption of non-taking for overhead flights in navigable airspace, which can be rebutted with evidence of interference with surface use. Some courts believe that the altitude of overhead flights can impact whether a taking has occurred, while others argue that it has no determinative effect. One court stated that government liability for a taking is not affected by flights in navigable airspace. Despite airspace being declared public domain, landowners may still have a claim to the superjacent airspace. The landowner has a claim to the superjacent airspace for reasonable use of his land, regardless of flights in navigable airspace. Interference with property use and enjoyment is required, such as noise, vibration, and physical damage from overhead flights. Some courts recognize interference with property use and enjoyment due to noise, vibration, and fear of damage from overhead flights. This can make the property undesirable and unbearable for residential use, impacting its potential resale value. Enjoyment of property includes the right to use it for present purposes and for investment and appreciation. Courts have rejected the idea that restrictions on future inhabitants' uses, without showing property value loss, are relevant to the owner's own use and enjoyment. Causby's standards on airspace ownership are used in state law tort claims like trespass and nuisance. Trespass claims for overhead flights by private actors may establish liability, but proving physical presence in airspace above the landowner's property is generally not enough. Landowners do not have an absolute right to the airspace above their property due to the ruling in Causby. Since Causby overturned the common law concept of ad coelum, landowners do not have an absolute possessory right to airspace indefinitely. Airspace trespass claims are evaluated using the same criteria as Causby takings claims. To prove actionable trespass to airspace, the property owner must demonstrate interference with the actual use of their land within the immediate reaches of the airspace they can possess under Causby. An intrusion must impede practical use of the airspace owned by the property owner to constitute trespass. To constitute an actionable trespass, an intrusion must impede practical use of the airspace owned by the property owner. Nuisance claims, unlike trespass, do not require the interference to occupy the owner's airspace directly but can succeed if the flight causes substantial and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the land. The integration of drones into domestic airspace will pose new legal challenges regarding airspace ownership laws. Courts may apply different interpretations of existing laws to drones, influenced by the FAA's definition of navigable airspace. The physical characteristics of drones, such as noise levels, may impact potential takings, trespass, or nuisance claims. Drone operators may face less liability compared to aircraft operators due to these characteristics. The integration of drones into domestic airspace may lead to fewer physical impacts on surface land compared to traditional aircraft. It is uncertain how drones will be deployed for flight, whether from centralized \"airports\" or individual properties. Drones are likely to operate like helicopters, taking off and landing vertically, reducing potential takings, trespass, or nuisance claims. The introduction of drones into U.S. airspace raises concerns about potential privacy violations due to their surveillance capabilities, including high-powered cameras, infrared sensors, facial recognition technology, and license plate readers. The use of drones for surveillance raises privacy concerns, especially regarding government operations and private actors. Privacy advocates warn of potential infringements on fundamental rights. This section focuses on privacy issues related to non-governmental drone use, discussing privacy laws, intrusion upon seclusion torts, and the First Amendment right to gather news. The application of these concepts to drone surveillance will be explored in the \"Congressional Response\" section. Early Anglo-Saxon law lacked explicit privacy protections, but property law and trespass theories were used to safeguard individual privacy. The concept that individuals have a right to privacy in their homes was established in early American common law. Prosecutors relied on eavesdropping theories to protect the privacy of individuals' conversations at home. These century-old theories of trespass and eavesdropping continue to influence privacy laws. In the late 19th century, the rise of \"yellow journalism\" fueled by advancing technologies led to a new media focused on sensationalism. Louis D. Brandeis and Samuel Warren introduced the concept of the right to be let alone in response to press intrusions into the private lives of prominent individuals. They recognized the inadequacy of existing tort doctrines in protecting privacy rights. In the late 19th century, Louis D. Brandeis and Samuel Warren introduced the concept of the right to privacy as a response to press intrusions into private lives. They emphasized the importance of protecting privacy rights from technological advancements like instantaneous photographs and newspaper intrusion. This new theory eventually found its way into common law, with the First Restatement of Torts creating a general tort for invasion of privacy in 1939. By 1940, some states had adopted privacy rights, while others had refused to do so. Dean William Prosser identified four rights encompassing the right to privacy: intrusion upon seclusion, public disclosure of private facts, false light publicity, and appropriation of likeness. Section 652B of the Restatement (Second) of Torts establishes a cause of action for intrusion upon seclusion, applicable to drone surveillance and widely adopted in states. It states that intentional intrusion upon another's solitude or private affairs leads to liability for invasion of privacy. Courts have established rules for applying Section 652B of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which addresses intrusion upon seclusion. The intrusion must be highly offensive to a reasonable person, with a standard of \"outrageously unreasonable conduct.\" It typically requires repeated persistence to amount to a course of hounding, although in some cases, a single intrusion may suffice. The invasion of privacy must be intentional on the part of the defendant. The intrusion upon seclusion requires intentional invasion of privacy, with the defendant desiring or knowing with certainty that the intrusion would occur. Surveillance within the target's home is often considered a viable claim for intrusion upon seclusion, causing mental suffering, shame, or humiliation in some states. The intrusion upon seclusion involves intentional invasion of privacy, such as taking a picture of a plaintiff in their home. However, surveillance in a public place may not be considered an invasion of privacy as the individual is not in seclusion and their appearance is public. The law considers recording or photographing individuals in public places as not an invasion of privacy, as the setting is public and open to anyone. Examples include taking pictures at a race track, airport, or during a combat mission in Vietnam. This is supported by case law where claims of invasion of privacy were dismissed in such public settings. In public settings, recording or photographing individuals is generally not considered an invasion of privacy. Courts have dismissed claims of invasion of privacy when individuals could be viewed from a public vantage point, even if they were on their own property. For example, a court ruled that filming a person on their property from a public road was not unreasonably intrusive. Similarly, a court dismissed a claim of invasion of privacy when a newspaper photographed a politician's wife's house as part of a news story, deeming the photographers not unreasonably intrusive. In public settings, recording or photographing individuals is generally not considered an invasion of privacy. Courts have dismissed claims of invasion of privacy when individuals could be viewed from a public vantage point, even if they were on their own property. For example, a court ruled that filming a person on their property from a public road was not unreasonably intrusive. Similarly, a court dismissed a claim of invasion of privacy when a newspaper photographed a politician's wife's house as part of a news story, deeming the photographers not unreasonably intrusive. However, successful claims for intrusion upon seclusion have involved surveillance conducted in public, where certain private matters may still be considered an invasion of privacy. In a famous case, a newspaper was sued for invasion of privacy for publishing a picture of a woman with her dress blown up at a county fair. The court upheld the claim, stating that being part of a public scene does not forfeit the right to privacy. In another case, a prisoner sued NBC for filming him without consent in a prison exercise yard, claiming invasion of privacy. NBC argued that filming in a \"publicly visible area\" did not support the claim. The court allowed the prisoner's invasion of privacy claim to proceed despite being in a \"publicly visible area.\" While privacy from drone surveillance is important, it must be balanced with the public's right to information flow. Unmanned aircraft can enhance news gathering capabilities. Unmanned aircraft can enhance news gathering capabilities by operating in dangerous areas, carrying surveillance technology, accessing inaccessible areas, and staying in flight for long durations. However, challenges arise in balancing newsgathering interests with privacy concerns protected by the First Amendment. The Court has suggested a potential right to gather news under the First Amendment, although initially hesitant due to concerns about unrestricted newsgathering rights potentially overriding government regulations. The Court has indicated that news gathering is protected by the First Amendment, but has not clearly defined the extent of this protection. In recent cases, the Court has stated that generally applicable laws apply to the press, and the press does not have special immunity from the enforcement of these laws. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals explored reporters' use of surreptitious means in newsgathering in Dietemann v. Time, Inc. The court rejected the claim that the First Amendment shields newsgathering activities, stating that individuals do not have special privileges to invade the rights of others. The court in Galella v. Onassis ruled that news reporters are not immune from torts or crimes committed during newsgathering, rejecting the argument for absolute immunity under the First Amendment. Galella, a paparazzo, was sued for invasion of privacy for constantly following and harassing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and her family. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the absolutist position that news reporters are immune from torts or crimes during newsgathering. The Seventh Circuit in Desnick v. American Broadcast Companies, Inc. held that surreptitious recording was not a privacy invasion if the target was a party to the conversation. Congress could create privacy protections against intrusive drone surveillance by private actors, balancing First Amendment rights to gather news. Several bills in the 113th Congress aim to regulate private drone use. Several bills in the 113th Congress aim to regulate the private use of drones, including the Drone Aircraft Privacy and Transparency Act of 2013 introduced by Representative Ed Markey. This bill proposes data collection requirements and enforcement mechanisms, requiring a study on privacy threats posed by drones and a data collection statement for drone operation licenses. The application for drone use requires a data collection statement with details on authorized operators, location, duration of use, information collected, data minimization procedures, data storage, privacy impact mitigation, and steps for destroying irrelevant data. The FAA requires a data collection statement for drone use, including operator contact info, data collected, privacy impact mitigation, and data destruction steps. H.R. 1262 enforces compliance by revoking licenses, FTC oversight, state AG civil suits, and private right of action for privacy violations. H.R. 1262 includes a private right of action for individuals injured by violations of the legislation, while H.R. 637 prohibits drones from capturing offensive images during personal or familial activities with an expectation of privacy. Congress could establish a cause of action for drone surveillance similar to the intrusion upon seclusion tort. The location of the search would determine privacy expectations, with courts aiming to protect individuals' privacy rights. The common law and Fourth Amendment aim to protect people, not places, with the location of an alleged intrusion being crucial in privacy analysis. Using a drone to peer inside someone's home would likely constitute an intrusion upon seclusion, while surveillance in public spaces may also be actionable. The home is still accorded significant legal protection in the digital age, with liability decreasing in public or visible private spaces. The degree of offensiveness of surveillance in public places is a key factor in determining intrusion upon seclusion. Factors such as the context, conduct, and motives of the intruder are considered, with highly offensive activities like closely following or photographing someone for an extended period leading to a finding of intrusion. Surveillance in public places can be intrusive, especially when closely following or photographing someone for an extended period. Liability may be recognized if a drone is used to monitor someone closely without their knowledge. The offensiveness of the surveillance, whether the target is aware or not, plays a role in determining privacy violations. Congress could consider creating a privacy statute specific to drone use to address these issues. A privacy statute tailored to drone use, similar to anti-voyeurism laws in various states, prohibits surreptitious filming of individuals in private settings. Some states require a prurient intent for surveillance, such as Washington State's statute on voyeurism. Congress could consider adopting an \"anti-paparazzi\" statute to prevent intrusive drone surveillance, similar to laws in California. Previous bills in the 105th Congress aimed to make it illegal to persistently follow or chase someone to obtain a visual image for commercial purposes, if the person had a reasonable expectation of privacy and feared bodily harm. The FAA's legal authority to establish privacy protections for drone surveillance is questioned as it integrates drones into national airspace. Agencies must have specific statutory authority for rulemaking, as established in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. In Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, the Supreme Court established the Chevron two-step test for assessing federal agency deference in interpreting statutes. If Congress has directly spoken on the issue, the court must follow Congress's intent. If the statute is silent or ambiguous, the court must determine if the agency's interpretation is permissible. This analysis may apply if the FAA's privacy rules under FMRA are challenged. The FAA is required to issue final rules on integrating small unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system by specific deadlines. The FMRA provides limited guidance on factors for the agency's rulemaking. Congress did not expressly grant FAA authority to regulate small unmanned aircraft systems. The FAA is tasked with integrating small unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system, but Congress did not expressly provide FAA authority to regulate privacy in this context. The Court may need to determine if addressing privacy in rulemaking would be a reasonable interpretation of the FMRA, considering the importance of privacy in drone integration. The FAA is responsible for integrating small unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system, but Congress did not explicitly grant the FAA authority to regulate privacy in this process. Some argue that the FAA should fill in privacy gaps with regulations, while others believe the FAA lacks the legal authority and expertise to regulate privacy issues related to drone use. This debate raises questions about whether Congress intentionally omitted privacy regulation from the FAA's responsibilities during rulemaking. The FAA's rulemaking for small drones and comprehensive plan lacks explicit guidance on privacy concerns. While Congress provided factors for consideration, they do not mention privacy. The term \"at a minimum\" suggests the FAA can address additional factors like privacy. Section 332 allows the FAA to define standards for operation and certification. The FAA's rulemaking for small drones lacks explicit guidance on privacy concerns. Section 332 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act allows the FAA to define standards for operation and certification of civil unmanned aircraft systems, including potential regulation of privacy as part of formal rulemaking. Additionally, Section 332(c) requires the FAA Administrator to establish a program to integrate unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system at 6 test ranges. On February 22, 2013, the FAA issued a request for comment on privacy rules for drones. The FAA issued a request for comment on privacy rules for test range operators, proposing requirements for operation and OTA agreements. The public can comment on privacy considerations and reporting requirements. Legal questions arise regarding the FAA's authority to regulate privacy through OTA agreements. The level of deference a court would apply to administrative actions is unclear. In some cases, agency actions not amounting to formal rulemaking may not receive Chevron deference. The Supreme Court has ruled that interpretations in opinion letters are not entitled to Chevron deference but may receive some deference under the Skidmore rule. In United States v. Mead, the Court ruled that Skidmore deference, not Chevron deference, applied to a United States Custom Service opinion letter on tariff levels. The FAA's use of OTAs in establishing test ranges may not warrant Chevron deference due to lack of formal agency adjudication or rulemaking. However, if the agency conducts notice and comment procedures, Chevron deference may be appropriate. The FAA has issued a notice for comment on proposed privacy regulations in the OTAs. The FAA's use of OTAs in establishing test ranges may not warrant Chevron deference due to lack of formal agency adjudication or rulemaking. The agency's regulation of privacy in the OTAs could be subject to scrutiny under either Chevron or Skidmore deference. Congress did not address privacy regulation in FMRA, leaving it to the FAA to fill in the gaps. Privacy is a primary concern in integrating drones into U.S. airspace, which could support the FAA's regulation of privacy. The FAA's focus on safety rather than privacy in regulating drones in U.S. airspace may indicate Congress's intent. The issue of federal preemption of state and local regulations on drone use is also a concern. The \"supreme Law of the Land\" doctrine establishes federal law, treaties, and the Constitution as paramount. Federal law can preempt state or local action through express, field, or conflict preemption. In aviation, federal laws and regulations typically preempt state regulations on safety, airspace management, and noise. Congress granted the federal government sole authority over the aviation industry and airspace in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. The Supreme Court has upheld federal authority over civil aeronautics, striking down local ordinances that interfere with federal regulations. State regulations on aircraft equipment taxes have been upheld, while proposals to regulate drones are pending in many state legislatures. Several states are considering proposals to regulate the use of drones, with the Virginia General Assembly passing a two-year moratorium on drone use by law enforcement agencies. The bill includes exceptions for emergency situations and has been sent back to the General Assembly for further action. Other states, like Texas, are also introducing bills to address privacy concerns related to drone use, such as creating a misdemeanor for capturing images without consent. Several states are considering proposals to regulate the use of drones, with Virginia passing a moratorium on drone use by law enforcement agencies. Texas is also introducing bills to address privacy concerns, including creating a misdemeanor for capturing images without consent. Questions about federal preemption may arise if these proposals are implemented, with field preemption or conflict preemption being potential grounds for finding preemption of state regulations based on current federal law. The extent to which states can regulate drone use without being preempted may depend on forthcoming federal regulations, the nature of state regulations, and a reviewing court's analysis of Congress's intent to regulate the issue. The Restatement (Second) of Torts Section 260 allows landowners to protect their property from drone intrusion if necessary. This means a landowner may not be liable for damage caused while removing a drone from their property. However, there are no cases where a landowner was allowed to use force against an aircraft. There are no cases where a landowner was permitted to use force to remove an aircraft from their property. Drones can be used for crimes like stalking, harassment, and wiretapping, posing new challenges for courts and legislatures. Commercial microphones on drones recording private conversations could violate federal wiretap laws. Legal issues will persist until civilian drone use expands. The FAA is tasked with safely integrating drones into national airspace, with deadlines for developing a plan and identifying test ranges already passed without compliance. Unique legal challenges will arise once regulations are in place. The FAA is facing legal challenges related to integrating drones into national airspace once regulations are in place."
