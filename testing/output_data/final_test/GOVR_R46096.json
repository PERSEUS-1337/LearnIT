These loans typically have high interest rates and are made to companies across various industries, with concentrations varying based on economic conditions. In the second quarter of 2018, healthcare and service industries were the top users of leveraged lending. In the second quarter of 2018, healthcare and service industries were the top users of leveraged lending. Leveraged loans are used for buyouts, mergers, restructuring balance sheets, and refinancing debt. Various institutions provide funds for leveraged lending, including banks, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and private investment funds. Lenders often partner with colenders or sell pieces of loans to manage risk. Lenders can partner with colenders, sell loan pieces to investors, or securitize loans into pools for investors. This trend has seen a shift from banks to nonbank institutions in leveraged lending activities. In recent decades, nonbank credit investors have overtaken banks in issuing and holding leveraged loans. Bank financing in the primary market has decreased significantly, with nonbank financing now comprising over 90% of leveraged loan investments. This shift has implications for systemic risk and regulation of leveraged loans. Multiple lenders typically divide large and risky leveraged loans using syndication and participation arrangements. Syndication and participation arrangements allow multiple lenders to share funding and risk in leveraged loans. In syndications, all lenders have a direct contractual relationship with the borrower, while in participations, the originating lender sells portions of the loan to other lenders. This splitting of the loan among multiple lenders has implications for systemic risk and regulation. Syndication and participation in leveraged loans involve coordination among parties, with one company typically acting as the arranger. The arranger gathers borrower information, sets pricing and terms, and brings lenders together. After closing the deal, the arranger or another company serves as the loan's agent, collecting payments and fees. Fees are collected by the arranger and agent, traditionally banks but now also nonbank lenders like finance companies and private investment funds. Nonbank lenders have taken on arranger and agent roles in syndications and participations of leveraged loans. Leveraged loan agreements include covenants that set conditions for the borrower to avoid default. If a covenant is violated, the lender can call the loan or restructure it with stricter terms. Lenders often restructure loans with stricter terms, including additional restrictions on borrower behavior, instead of calling the loan when covenants are violated. Covenant-lite loans, with fewer restrictions, are becoming more common, raising concerns about declining credit standards and potential future losses. The Federal Reserve reported $1.15 trillion in leveraged loans outstanding at the end of 2018, comparable to U.S. auto loans and credit card debt. The Federal Reserve reported $1.15 trillion in leveraged loans outstanding at the end of 2018, similar to U.S. auto loans and credit card debt. Leveraged lending has grown much faster than other credit categories, with a 20.1% increase from the previous year and an average annual growth of 15.8% since 2000. This rapid growth may indicate a substitution of debt types. Investors can invest in leveraged loans directly or through CLOs. Mutual funds, banks, and insurance companies hold large shares of leveraged loans. CLOs are securities backed by corporate loan portfolios, with U.S. CLOs primarily backed by business loans. Banks' funding in the leveraged loan market has been decreasing over time. CLOs are primarily backed by leveraged loans in the U.S., with their outstanding value growing significantly over the years. They offer investors a way to diversify their cash flows and manage financial risks through structured special purpose vehicles. CLOs are managed by banks, investment firms, and private equity firms, and are sold in separate tranches. CLOs are sold in separate tranches with different payment priorities, redistributing credit risk. Tranches include senior, mezzanine, and equity, with higher priority tranches having protection from losses and higher credit ratings. This structure is seen as effective in providing economic protection against unexpected losses. CLOs are sold in tranches with different payment priorities, redistributing credit risk. Higher tranches offer more protection from losses and higher credit ratings. Institutional investors like asset managers, banks, and insurers hold different tranches based on risk preference. U.S. investors held around $556 billion in CLOs based on U.S. loans in 2018, with $147 billion in domestically issued CLO holdings. Detailed data on domestic CLO holders are limited, but cross-border financial holdings provide some insight. The reporting of cross-border financial holdings shows that $409 billion of U.S. CLO holdings were issued in the Cayman Islands. Concerns arise over the potential drying up of credit from leveraged lending in the next downturn, which could impact nonfinancial companies relying on this financing. A slowdown in leveraged loan issuance may lead to challenges for businesses, forcing them to reduce capital spending if alternative funding sources are not found. Overall borrowing by nonfinancial firms is historically high, raising concerns about a potential debt overhang in the next downturn. This could lead to a reduction in capital spending and corporate failures, exacerbating the overall economic downturn. Leveraged loans and CLOs pose risks to investors and financial stability, with potential unexpected losses and securitization risks. Leveraged loans and CLOs pose credit risks to investors due to potential defaults, especially with covenant-lite loans. Borrowers often use funds for high-risk activities like leveraged buyouts. Despite this, leveraged loans historically have lower default rates and higher recovery rates than high-yield bonds. Leveraged loans have lower default rates and higher recovery rates compared to high-yield bonds. Credit risk is reduced as leveraged loans are typically secured, with floating interest rates borne by the borrower. When securitized into CLOs, credit risk is redistributed through a tranched structure, with senior tranches receiving higher credit ratings. The tranched structure of CLOs provides additional protection to senior tranches by distributing credit risk differently across investors. Analysts are concerned that default rates on leveraged loans could spike if economic conditions worsen or interest rates rise, leading to unexpected losses for investors. Default rates on leveraged loans rose significantly during the last recession, highlighting the potential systemic risk associated with changing asset values. The main policy concern is whether leveraged loans and CLOs pose systemic risk, depending on the existence of channels for problems to spill over into broader financial markets. Losses or liquidity issues with leveraged loans could lead to financial instability through various transmission channels, similar to the systemic risk posed by mortgage-backed securities during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was triggered by mispriced mortgage-backed securities (MBS), causing systemic distress in the financial system. This led to liquidity declines, fire sales, capital shortfalls, and reduced credit availability as institutions deleveraged in response to MBS losses. CLOs today share similarities with MBS before the crisis, including rapid credit growth and erosion of underwriting standards. Both are complex and opaque, potentially hiding true risks. Leveraged loans and CLOs pose limited systemic risk due to their small size in the overall securities market. Policy concerns pre-crisis focused on subprime mortgages, which turned out to be just the tip of the iceberg. The deflating housing bubble caused losses in the overall mortgage market, similar to the subprime mortgage crisis. Experts are unsure if there is an underlying asset bubble in corporate debt markets that could lead to a destabilizing downturn. It is unclear if unexpected losses in leveraged lending would result in broader systemic deleveraging or problems for systemically important institutions. The potential systemic risk from leveraged loans and CLOs is mitigated for banks due to their small holdings relative to total assets and higher capital requirements. Asset managers, the largest holders, are not vulnerable to insolvency as losses are passed on to clients. Liquidity mismatch is a concern for investors in leveraged loan mutual funds and ETFs. Investors in leveraged loan mutual funds and ETFs may face run risk, similar to a bank run, during market distress. Early redemptions could limit losses if done before fire sales occur. U.S. CLOs do not mark-to-market assets, limiting run risk, while other private funds may have redemption restrictions. The financial crisis serves as a cautionary tale for investors in leveraged loan mutual funds and ETFs, which may face run risk during market distress. However, historical examples show that sudden shifts in asset class performance, such as the collapse in the junk bond market in 1989-1990, did not lead to broader financial instability. CLO default rates remained low during the last financial crisis, and large investor withdrawals from bank loan mutual funds in December 2018 did not result in market instability. Financial regulation aims to address these risks. Following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created to address threats to financial stability associated with leveraged lending. Regulatory fragmentation in the leveraged loan market could lead to activities migrating to less-regulated sectors, limiting official data availability and complicating risk evaluation and mitigation. Leveraged lending falls under the purview of multiple regulators with different approaches and authorities. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created to address threats to financial stability and regulatory fragmentation hindering an effective policy response. In its 2018 Annual Report, FSOC recommended monitoring nonfinancial business leverage and asset valuations. FSOC has not recommended regulatory changes for leveraged lending yet. Regulations for leveraged loan issuance differ between banks and nonbank lenders, falling under general business lending laws. Banks must act safely and soundly to mitigate failure risks and are supervised accordingly by regulators. Bank regulators supervise banks to ensure safe lending practices, including leverage loan origination. Guidance documents outline standards for leveraged lending, but debate exists on whether this qualifies as formal regulation. The guidance only applies to banks and does not cover nonbank activities or potential systemic risks outside of banking. Investment in CLOs and potential systemic risks outside of the banking system are not adequately addressed by current oversight. Nonbank participants, except for insurance companies, lack similar regulatory scrutiny. Decreasing bank involvement in leveraged lending may lead to reduced oversight, with different regulations applying to banks, nonbank investment funds, and insurance companies. Prudential regulations for banks cover all activities, including leveraged lending. Prudential regulations for banks, including capital requirements and the Volcker Rule, are crucial for ensuring safety and soundness in all bank activities, such as leveraged lending. Banks must maintain minimum ratios of capital to balance sheet items to absorb losses and meet leverage and risk-weighted ratios for loans. Holding leveraged loans or CLO tranches requires sufficient capital to mitigate risks. When banks engage in leveraged loans or CLOs, they must comply with capital requirements and permissible activity restrictions, such as the Volcker Rule. This regulation prohibits proprietary trading and certain relationships with hedge funds and other funds, impacting banks' involvement in CLOs depending on their structure. The Volcker Rule sets criteria for banks' ownership interests in CLOs to avoid resembling hedge funds. Banks face periodic examinations by regulators to assess risky loans, potentially leading to increased fees or restrictions. Leveraged loans draw regulators' attention due to their higher risk. The Shared National Credit Program was established in 1977 by bank regulators. The Shared National Credit Program was established in 1977 by bank regulators to monitor large syndicated loans. Banks are required to report data on loans over $100 million. Federal bank regulatory agencies issued guidance on leveraged lending obligations. The asset management industry operates under a different framework than banking. The asset management industry operates under an agent-based model, separating investment management functions from ownership. Risk is borne by investors, not by the managing companies. The SEC regulates the industry with disclosure requirements, access restrictions, examinations, and risk controls. The OCIE conducts examinations and oversight. Leveraged loan capital markets participants have faced violations. The SEC regulates the asset management industry with disclosure requirements, access restrictions, examinations, and risk controls. Leveraged loan capital markets participants could face SEC investigations for violations like market manipulation and fiduciary duty breaches. Public and private investment funds in leveraged lending and CLO markets have different restrictions and requirements based on investor types. Public funds include mutual funds and ETFs, while private funds consist of hedge funds and private equity. Insurance firms are regulated at the state level for safety and soundness, facing risk-based capital requirements that impact their holdings of leveraged loans and CLOs. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners assesses the riskiness of assets purchased by insurance companies to meet capital requirements, with riskier assets receiving less credit. In 2017, 97% of CLOs held by insurers received an investment-grade rating from the NAIC, posing less expected risk and requiring less capital. Insurance firms can safely hold longer-term assets to match their longer-term liabilities, influencing the leveraged loans and CLOs they can hold. Insurance regulators are focusing more on the liquidity of insurers' assets, potentially discouraging them from holding leveraged loans and CLOs due to their relative illiquidity. The securitization process involves issuing securities backed by leveraged loans to investors, with regulatory requirements applied to CLOs and managers. Risk-retention rules initially applied to CLOs have been partially removed, addressing the misalignment of incentives between managers and investors. The 2007-2009 financial crisis exposed the lack of \"skin in the game\" in securitized products, leading to the adoption of credit risk-retention rules for CLOs in 2016. Managers are now required to retain 5% of CLO assets to align their interests with investors. While open-market CLO managers are exempt from these rules, other types of CLOs still need to comply. CLOs are securities instruments subject to federal securities laws, requiring registration or exemption. Most CLOs are created under private exemptions, limiting investor base. CLO managers are registered as investment advisers, subject to SEC requirements and fiduciary duties. Bank regulators issue guidance to provide clarity to banks on supervision, including expectations for risk management of leveraged lending activities. Banks have raised concerns that following this guidance restricts their ability to make sound loans, as regulators enforce it as if it were a binding regulation. Unlike guidance, regulations must go through a formal process including notice and comment requirements. Regulators must submit new regulations and certain guidance documents to Congress under the Congressional Review Act, allowing Congress to prevent their implementation. In 2017, Senator Pat Toomey requested the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to analyze bank regulators' guidance to determine if it qualified as a rule subject to Congressional review under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). GAO concluded that the guidance is indeed a rule subject to CRA review. Following this determination, bank regulators sent letters to Congress seeking feedback on the guidance. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized that the guidance was nonbinding during a hearing in February 2018. The Comptroller of the Currency, Joseph Otting, stated that the guidance provides flexibility. The Comptroller of the Currency, Joseph Otting, stated in 2018 that the guidance on leveraged loans allows flexibility for banks as long as they operate safely. No changes have been made to the guidance, and no resolution under the CRA has been introduced. The Congressional Research Service could not find a submission of the guidance to Congress as required by the GAO. The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on systemic risks of leveraged lending on June 4, 2019, where two draft bills were considered. One bill would require the Office of Financial Research to assess risks and make recommendations on leveraged lending to Congress. The draft Leveraged Lending Examination Enhancement Act would require the FFIEC to set prudential standards for leveraged lending by depository institutions and report quarterly on leveraged lending."
