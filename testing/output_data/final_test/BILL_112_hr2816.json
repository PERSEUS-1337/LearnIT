Congress finds that childhood obesity in the United States has reached epidemic proportions, with significant medical costs estimated at $270 billion annually. More than one-third of children and adolescents are overweight or obese, leading to a 70-80% chance of becoming overweight adults with increased risks of chronic diseases. Sedentary lifestyles starting in childhood contribute to 23% of US deaths from major chronic diseases. Studies indicate that children born today have a shorter life expectancy than their parents. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2006, statistics show that a significant number of students consider suicide, binge drink, and suffer from mental illness. Studies also indicate that students benefit from social-psychological support, instruction in personal and social skills, and comprehensive programs that link rigorous instruction with health, education, and social services. The American Association for Health Education recommends 50 hours of health education per year for students. Only a small percentage of schools provide comprehensive health instruction and daily physical education. Enhanced school health education programs are deemed essential by the Institute of Medicine. Enhanced school health education programs are crucial for developing a health literate society in the US, especially with increasing healthcare challenges. Physical activity can improve cognitive skills, attitudes, and academic performance. Recommendations include increasing quality physical education for all students and providing age-appropriate activities. Physical education is recommended for elementary, middle, and high school students to combat health issues and improve military readiness. Almost 30 percent of 17- to 24-year-olds are too overweight to serve in the U.S. military, highlighting the importance of physical and health education in schools. The Department of Education Organization Act is amended to include the creation of the Office of Safe and Healthy Students. This office aims to address health issues and improve physical education in schools to enhance military readiness. The Department of Education has established the Office of Safe and Healthy Students to focus on health education, physical education, and creating a safe school environment. The Office will expand its responsibilities from the previous Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools. A Director appointed by the Secretary will oversee the Office and report to the Deputy Secretary. The Director of the Office of Safe and Healthy Students promotes health education activities, physical education, and coordinates with other agencies to improve program quality. The Director of the Office of Safe and Healthy Students works on improving programs and activities that promote health, safety, and well-being in schools through financial assistance and policy development. The Director of the Office of Safe and Healthy Students works on promoting health, safety, and well-being in schools through participation in interagency committees, groups, and partnerships related to health and safety promotion, including drug and violence prevention. They also collaborate with other Federal agencies on comprehensive school health and physical education policies and contribute to the development of a national research agenda for health, physical activity, and safety promotion. The Office of Safe and Healthy Students focuses on promoting health, safety, and positive youth development in schools. They serve as a clearinghouse for research data on the connection between student health, safety, and academic performance. They coordinate programs addressing student health and safety promotion within schools and analyze data to assess progress towards national health objectives. The Office of Safe and Healthy Students serves as a clearinghouse for local educational agencies and schools needing technical assistance in addressing student health and safety issues. They submit a biennial report to Congress on the expansion of physical education, health education, school health programs, and the integration of physical activity. The Office of Safe and Healthy Students provides technical assistance for student health and safety issues, including the integration of physical activity and health programs in schools and communities throughout the day.
