    "content": "On May 26, 2015, CMS released a proposed rule (CMS-2390-P) to update federal regulations for Medicaid managed care, where states contract with private insurers to provide healthcare. The rule focuses on how states deliver services to Medicaid enrollees through risk-based managed care. This would be the first major federal regulation impacting Medicaid managed care. The proposed rule would be the first major federal regulation impacting Medicaid managed care since 2002, influencing how states structure their managed care programs. CMS is updating the regulations to align them with today's health care landscape, taking into account private health care coverage market reforms and standards established for qualified health plans under the ACA. This report responds to frequently asked questions. The report provides a high-level summary of key updates in the proposed rule for Medicaid managed care, including the introduction of a minimum medical loss ratio, guidance on enrolling the LTSS population in managed care, and network adequacy. States use fee-for-service and managed care models for Medicaid service delivery, with managed care involving different payment arrangements for providers. In the early 1990s, states began using managed care to deliver benefits to Medicaid enrollees, with 49.8% enrolled in risk-based managed care by FY2011. This approach, primarily through managed care organizations (MCOs), impacts millions of enrollees and has increased over time in 39 states. Managed care helps control costs through capitation and can improve care coordination for beneficiaries. Risk-based managed care can involve a comprehensive or limited set of benefits. States contract with MCOs to provide services, paying a fixed amount per enrollee (capitation payment). MCOs assume financial risk. Federal regulations guide states on care delivery through MCOs. Limited-benefit health plans like PIHPs and PAHPs offer specific benefits in exchange for capitated payments from Medicaid. Managed care has been increasingly used to provide coverage to Medicaid enrollees since the early 1990s. Managed LTSS (MLTSS) is the delivery of LTSS benefits through managed care, with MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs receiving capitated payments from the state Medicaid program. CMS released guidance in May 2013 for states to set up MLTSS programs, with a proposed rule to codify that guidance and address LTSS-specific changes. The rule also includes changes applicable to all managed care programs. The CMS proposed updates for Medicaid managed care aim to align regulations with other health coverage programs, improve payment rates, enhance beneficiary protections, and modernize regulatory requirements. The proposed rule seeks to better align Medicaid managed care with Medicare Advantage and ACA health insurance exchanges. References to Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations are provided for each section. CMS is proposing to align Medicaid managed care with private market and Medicare Advantage standards to improve beneficiary experiences and reduce administrative burden. The proposed rule considers changes since 2002, including the ACA and growth in Medicare Advantage enrollment. ACA established health insurance exchanges and qualified health plans for coverage. The ACA established new health plans on exchanges with premium tax credits and reduced cost sharing. CMS aims to align Medicaid MCOs with QHPs for easier transitions. New standards include coverage for preventive services and essential health benefits. Applying private market and Medicare Advantage standards to Medicaid managed care can protect beneficiaries and reduce administrative burden. The proposed rule aims to update marketing regulations for Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) to align with the Affordable Care Act (ACA). It clarifies that marketing rules do not prohibit carriers offering both Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) and MCOs from marketing their products. Unsolicited emails or text messages for marketing purposes from MCOs are prohibited. The rule also streamlines the appeals and grievances process across different health plans. The proposed rule would streamline the appeals and grievances process for health insurance markets by setting a standard 60-day time frame for beneficiaries to file an appeal. It would limit an MCO's internal appeal process to one level, with the option for a state fair hearing after that. The proposed rule aims to streamline the appeals and grievances process for health insurance markets by setting a 60-day time frame for beneficiaries to file an appeal. It would shorten the time frame for MCOs to make a decision on a standard appeal from 45 days to 30 days and for expedited review from 3 working days to 72 hours. The rule would also establish a minimum medical loss ratio of 85% to ensure actuarially sound capitation rates. The proposed rule sets a minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) of 85% to ensure health plans spend premium revenue on care delivery. States have flexibility in setting MLRs for MCOs, with the option to set higher thresholds. CMS encourages states to include contract provisions to drive performance in line with the MLR standard. CMS has set a minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) of 85% for MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs to ensure efficiency and consistency across different healthcare programs. This standard will be implemented in state contracts starting January 1, 2017, with some states already having MLR requirements in place. The proposed rule aims to reorganize and potentially modify existing standards for contracts between states and healthcare plans. The proposed rule aims to modify existing standards for contracts between states and healthcare plans, including MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs. It would give CMS regulatory flexibility to set procedural rules for contract submission and approval, with a new standard requiring contracts to be submitted at least 90 days before the planned effective date. Additionally, the rule would remove the exclusion on Medicaid payments for coverage in an institution for mental disease (IMD) for Medicaid enrollees aged 21-64 receiving coverage in an IMD for less than 15 days. Under the proposed rule, states may now make capitated payments to managed care plans for coverage in an IMD for enrollees aged 21 to 64 staying less than 15 days, as long as the facility provides psychiatric or substance use disorder inpatient care. This change offers flexibility to managed care plans. The change in Medicaid managed care plans allows for capitated payments to cover short-term inpatient psychiatric and SUD treatment in alternative settings. This aims to improve consistency and transparency in rate-setting processes across programs. States must set actuarially sound payment rates for MCOs, as defined by federal regulations. The proposed rule aims to establish standards for states to set actuarially sound capitation rates for Medicaid managed care plans. These rates must be certified by a qualified actuary and meet specific criteria to ensure appropriateness for the covered population. The rule would create a new section to outline these standards, including restating existing provisions without changing their meaning. The proposed rule establishes standards for setting actuarially sound capitation rates for Medicaid managed care plans. Rates must be specific to each rate cell and meet six new rate-development standards. CMS will apply these standards during the review and approval process of state capitation rates. The proposed rule would add a new standard to the regulations governing incentive arrangements in Medicaid managed care plans. Incentive arrangements must be designed to support program initiatives tied to quality goals and performance outcomes. The proposed rule aims to improve program integrity in managed care by implementing new standards for incentive arrangements tied to quality goals and performance outcomes. States may require MCOs to adopt value-based purchasing models and participate in initiatives like patient-centered medical homes to reduce low birth weight babies. Provider screening and enrollment processes will also be enhanced under the proposed rule. The proposed rule aims to improve program integrity in managed care by addressing fraud concerns related to MCOs and Medicaid funds. Significant changes in program integrity have occurred since the last regulations in 2002, including the creation of the Medicaid Integrity Program and enhanced authority under the ACA. CMS has excluded Medicaid managed care providers from previous regulations, despite feedback from states and the HHS Office of the Inspector General. CMS aims to improve program integrity by addressing provider screening and enrollment procedures for FFS providers in managed care programs to prevent fraud and protect Medicaid funds. The proposed rule would adapt requirements to MCOs and ensure consistency in enrolling all ordering or referring physicians under the Medicaid program. Feedback from state program integrity reviews and the HHS OIG highlighted the need for more consistent application of these processes. CMS proposes to consolidate state responsibilities for program integrity in one section of the regulation, requiring states to enroll all MCO network providers not already enrolled for FFS Medicaid beneficiaries. States must also post contracts with each MCO on their website and disclose encounter data and audit results. The proposed rule addresses various aspects of a beneficiary's experience with Medicaid managed care. The proposed rule by CMS aims to establish federal regulations for enrollment in managed care plans, including standards for enrollment and disenrollment, beneficiary support, and care coordination. It requires states to provide at least 14 days of fee-for-service coverage while enrollees choose a managed care organization, applying to both voluntary and mandatory programs. This rule responds to the growth of MLTSS programs and aims to codify principles outlined in previous guidance. The proposed rule by CMS establishes federal regulations for enrollment in managed care plans, including beneficiary support systems. States must provide support for Medicaid beneficiaries before and after enrollment, including choice counseling, training for staff and providers, assistance in understanding managed care, and support for those receiving LTSS. Specific elements for LTSS beneficiaries include an access point for complaints, education on grievance and appeal rights. The proposed rule by CMS establishes federal regulations for enrollment in managed care plans, including beneficiary support systems. States must provide support for Medicaid beneficiaries before and after enrollment, including choice counseling, training for staff and providers, assistance in understanding managed care, and support for those receiving LTSS. Specific elements for LTSS beneficiaries include education on grievance and appeal rights, assistance in navigating the grievance and appeal process, and review of LTSS program data to assist the state Medicaid Agency. The proposed rule by CMS establishes federal regulations for enrollment in managed care plans, including beneficiary support systems for LTSS beneficiaries. MLTSS refers to the delivery of LTSS benefits through managed care, with the number of states with MLTSS programs growing significantly over the past decade. CMS released guidance in May 2013 for states to set up MLTSS programs, outlining 10 key elements for high-quality programs. The proposed rule would codify this guidance and make changes specific to MLTSS, including establishing an access point for complaints and concerns for beneficiaries using LTSS. The proposed rule by CMS establishes federal regulations for enrollment in managed care plans, including beneficiary support systems for LTSS beneficiaries. It includes an access point for complaints and concerns, education on grievance and appeal rights, assistance in navigating the process, and review of LTSS program data to assist the state Medicaid Agency. States are proposed to set specific time and distance standards for MLTSS programs. The proposed rule by CMS establishes federal regulations for enrollment in managed care plans, including beneficiary support systems for LTSS beneficiaries. It includes time and distance standards for MLTSS programs and defines LTSS as services and supports for beneficiaries with functional limitations. This section addresses network adequacy in Medicaid managed care and quality improvement strategies. The proposed rule by CMS sets standards for network adequacy in Medicaid managed care, including time and distance standards for specific provider types. States must develop access standards for all Medicaid enrollees to ensure ongoing assessment and certification of MCO networks. The rule aims to establish transparency and criteria for network adequacy measures, particularly for MLTSS programs. The proposed rule by CMS sets standards for network adequacy in Medicaid managed care, including time and distance standards for specific provider types. States must consider various elements when developing network adequacy standards, such as Medicaid enrollment, service utilization, provider availability, and geographic accessibility. The proposed rule by CMS sets standards for Medicaid managed care, including a quality rating system for MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs. The system is based on clinical quality management, member experience, and plan efficiency. States must establish a quality assessment strategy and undergo external reviews. The proposed rule by CMS extends the \"state quality strategy\" requirement to all Medicaid beneficiaries, not just those under MCOs and PIHPs. It includes new standards for reporting enrollee encounter data related to services received. The proposed rule by CMS aims to improve data collection and reporting in Medicaid managed care by implementing new enrollee encounter data standards for MCO, PIHP, and PAHP contracts. This is crucial for ensuring accurate data for financial and program performance analysis. The proposed rule by CMS aims to improve data collection and reporting in Medicaid managed care by implementing new enrollee encounter data standards. CMS establishes new requirements for data submission benchmarks to receive federal matching payments."
