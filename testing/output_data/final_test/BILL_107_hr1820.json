The Secretary will publish a list of recommended military installations for closure or realignment, to be considered by the Commission and transmitted to the President by October 15, 2003.

The decision, made by majority vote, is binding on the Secretary unless overruled. If overruled, the Secretary must provide written notice with reasons to relevant parties. The Commission cannot remove a military installation from the closure list or make substantive changes, but has jurisdiction over procedural matters. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress by December 31, 2003, evaluating the feasibility of allowing local communities to take possession of individual structures on military installations approved for closure before the installation is closed."
