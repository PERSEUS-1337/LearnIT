    "content": "The \"Regulatory Accountability Act of 1993\" is the short title of this Act, as stated in Section 1. The Congress finds that the cost of Federal regulation in the United States exceeds $400 billion annually, with each household paying over $4,100 as a \"hidden tax.\" Without intervention, this tax is projected to increase by 50% by the year 2000. It is crucial for the Federal Government to develop a systematic approach to account for these regulatory costs imposed on taxpayers. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that agencies thoroughly assess and document the benefits, costs, and alternative approaches of proposed regulations. It also requires agencies to select the most cost-effective alternative for final regulations and offset all foreseeable costs for a period of 3 years. The Act aims to ensure thorough assessment and documentation of proposed regulations, selecting the most cost-effective alternative for final regulations, and offsetting all foreseeable costs for a period of 3 years, which may involve revocation or revision of existing regulations. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"agency\" as specified in title 44, excluding certain agencies, and defines \"regulation\" as agency statements implementing law or policy, excluding certain actions and regulations related to military, foreign affairs, or agency management. The Act defines \"agency\" and \"regulation\" excluding certain actions and regulations related to military, foreign affairs, or agency management. SEC. 4 mandates requirements for issuing new regulations. When taking regulatory action, agencies must adhere to requirements such as basing decisions on substantial evidence of anticipated benefits, considering alternative approaches, and weighing benefits against costs before finalizing regulations. When proposing new regulatory actions that incur costs, agencies must propose revisions or revocations of existing regulations to fully offset the anticipated costs. This is in accordance with the requirement to weigh benefits against costs and consider alternative approaches before finalizing regulations. SEC. 5. EXEMPTION.\n\nThe President can waive section 4(3) requirements for regulatory actions in emergencies, with a detailed explanation in the Federal Register.\n\nSEC. 6. INDEPENDENT EVALUATION. The President shall provide independent evaluation of the regulatory process and its impact on the economy, including business startups, employment, international trade, research and development, State and local governments, and Federal spending for enforcement. The evaluation will also study the regulatory cost cap and methodologies used by regulatory agencies to estimate costs. The Office of Management and Budget will estimate the cost of regulations and use alternative regulatory approaches. The President can transfer funds to the OMB for this purpose, up to $50,000, despite restrictions in title 31 of the United States Code. The provisions of this Act will take effect upon enactment, with regulations or rules enacted within 2 years before this Act taking effect 6 months later. Section 4(3) requirements will end 3 years after enactment."
