    "content": "The Administration's FY2009 budget request for FDA was $2.676 billion, an increase of $256 million (10.6%) over FY2008. The request included budget authority of $2.046 billion and user fees of $630 million, with $25 million for cost-of-living pay increases and $14 million in new fees for DTC television advertisements. This additional funding would support activities in FDAAA, the Food Protection Plan, and the Action Plan for Import Safety. The FY2009 FDA budget request included new user fees for generic drugs and animal feed, totaling $48 million. Concerns were raised about the adequacy of the FDA budget to meet challenges in both FY2008 and FY2009. The FDA Science Board recommended a $375 million increase in appropriated funds. In FY2009, FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach recommended a $375 million increase in the budget. The President's amended FY2009 request included an additional $275 million for FDA activities, and Congress passed an FY2008 supplemental appropriations bill providing an extra $150 million for FDA. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended FY2009 direct appropriations for FDA that matched the Administration's request. The committee did not include proposed user fees for human or animal generic drugs, or user fees for DTC television advertisements of prescription drugs. The full Senate had not considered the bill by the end of FY2008, and the Continuing Appropriations Resolution allowed FDA to spend at the rate of their FY2008 appropriations until March 6, 2009. The FDA's budget includes $150 million from the FY2008 supplemental for agency-wide activities and specific program areas. The agency supports six program areas, five of which administer regulatory responsibilities for products. The sixth area, Toxicological Research, involves non-regulatory activities to inform FDA's decisions. Funding information for regulatory programs is divided into Center Activities and Field Activities, with the latter including inspection, laboratory testing, and enforcement activities. The FDA's Field Activities/ORA, responsible for regulatory purposes and enforcement, received $716 million for FY2009, representing 26.8% of the agency's total request. The 110th Congress addressed product inspection and standards enforcement functions, with some studies suggesting budget constraints have impacted FDA's ability to fulfill all responsibilities. The FDA's budget constraints have hindered its ability to conduct required inspections, such as in the case of domestic medical device manufacturing establishments. Concerns about field activities' adequacy have been raised due to deaths linked to contaminated heparin. Funding and management of field activities are key challenges faced by the FDA. The report provides program descriptions and FY2009 budget details for each regulatory program area. The Foods Program, administered by FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, addresses regulatory responsibilities in food protection, nutrition, dietary supplement safety, and cosmetic safety. The program's FY2009 budget request was $84 million, with a focus on the Protecting America's Food Supply Initiative. Key challenges include resource adequacy for overseeing the food system facilities. The Human Drugs Program, under FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, ensures the safety and effectiveness of prescription and nonprescription drugs. It is funded through budget authority and user fees, with a FY2009 request of $789 million. The FDA's Human Drugs Program requested $789 million for FY2009, funded through budget authority and user fees. The requested user fees included increases from PDUFA and new fees for DTC television advertisement review and generic drug application review. The Senate committee recommendation matched the budget authority request but did not include the requested fees for DTC advertisement review or the proposed GDUFA. Key challenges include ensuring drug safety and identifying emerging safety and effectiveness information. The Biologics Program ensures the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. The Biologics Program, administered by FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), operates with budget authority and user fees authorized by PDUFA and MDUFA. The FY2009 request was $268 million, with an increase to cover blood and tissue safety and a cost-of-living pay raise. User fees include revenue from PDUFA, MDUFA, and a new fee for DTC advertisements. The Senate committee recommended a budget of $268 million for the FDA, excluding the requested fees for DTC advertisement review. Legislation for abbreviated applications for follow-on biologics is being considered for FY2009, with key challenges in negotiating a compromise among existing proposals and the new Obama Administration. The Animal Drugs and Feeds Program ensures the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, devices, and feeds, including pet food. The Animal Drugs and Feeds Program, administered by FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, focuses on ensuring the safety of animal feeds, including pet food. In FY2009, the program requested $132 million in funding, with a $17 million increase from FY2008. The funding includes budget authority, user fees for brand-name animal drugs, and a proposed Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act. The increase in funding would support the Protecting America's Food Supply Initiative. The Animal Drugs and Feeds Program requested $132 million in funding for FY2009, including user fees for brand-name animal drugs and a proposed Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act. The increase in funding would support workforce development, product safety, and activities related to animal foods. The program faces challenges in evaluating drug approvals efficiently, monitoring drug safety, and ensuring the safety of imports. The FDA's Devices and Radiological Health Program focuses on regulating medical devices, ensuring safety and effectiveness, and reducing radiation exposure. It is divided into premarket device safety, postmarket surveillance, and the Mammography Quality Standards Act. The program is primarily managed by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health and operates with budget authority and user fees. The FY2009 budget request was $326 million, with increases for cost-of-living adjustments and the Modernizing Medical Product Safety and Development Initiative. The Senate committee recommended $327 million for the FDA's Devices and Radiological Health Program, closely matching the FY2009 request. Key challenges include ensuring the safety of imported devices and those already on the market, complicated by the requirement that device user fees be spent only on activities related to new device approval."
