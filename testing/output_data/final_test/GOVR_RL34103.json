    "content": "The sugar program ensures a minimum price for sugarcane and sugar beets, with the USDA regulating the sugar supply through marketing allotments and import restrictions. The program operates on a \"no-cost\" basis, using loan rates to set support levels to prevent market prices from falling below minimum levels. If market prices fall below support levels, processors can forfeit sugar. The sugar program allows processors to forfeit sugar as collateral for loan repayment, leading to budgetary expenses for USDA. The report discusses issues with sugar program provisions in House and Senate farm bills, including minimum price guarantees, managing sugar supply, using surplus for ethanol, and program costs. Industrial users considered converting sugar for food and beverage products. The sugar program includes price support loans for processors, with minimum prices unchanged since the 1980s. USDA must protect the price guarantee using other tools. This policy option was explored by industrial users but did not receive further attention. The 2008 farm bill will increase sugar loan rates by 4% to 5% by FY2012, with rates rising in stages each year. The raw cane sugar loan rate will increase from 18.0\u00a2 per pound to 18.75\u00a2/lb, and the refined beet sugar loan rate will increase from 22.9\u00a2 per pound to 24.1\u00a2/lb by FY2012. Growers and processors had initially sought a one cent increase in the raw cane sugar loan rate. The House-passed farm bill includes an increase in sugar loan rates to cover production costs, opposed by sugar users due to potential taxpayer costs. The Bush Administration also opposed the loan rate increase. USDA announced 2008-crop sugar loan rates, with raw cane sugar at 18.0\u00a2/lb and refined beet sugar at 22.9\u00a2/lb. The national loan rates for raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar remain the same as the previous year's crop. Loan rates vary based on transportation costs, ranging from 16.37\u00a2/lb in Hawaii to 18.22\u00a2/lb in Louisiana for raw cane sugar, and from 21.95\u00a2/lb in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington to 24.34\u00a2/lb in Michigan and Ohio for refined beet sugar. Import quotas and marketing allotments are used to support prices for producers and processors in the sugar program. The USDA implements tools to prevent sugar loan forfeitures, while also allowing imports to meet demand. Quotas regulate foreign sugar entry to avoid market price depression, based on WTO rules and FTAs. The 2002 farm bill authorized imports of up to 1.532 million STRV annually, influencing the national sugar allotment. Since January 1, 2008, U.S. sugar imports from Mexico are no longer restricted under NAFTA, allowing for fluctuation in imports based on factors like HFCS exports and Mexican sugar output variations. The Mexican government policy includes holding three months worth of sugar stocks in reserve and allowing sugar imports when needed. Mexican sugar prices have been higher than U.S. sugar prices in recent years, reducing the incentive for Mexican sugar mills to export north. U.S. buyers' concerns about the quality of Mexican sugar may limit the amount flowing north. The U.S. has committed to allowing additional sugar imports under existing and pending bilateral FTAs, potentially exceeding previous trade commitments and the maximum amount of sugar allowed from Mexico in 2007. The 2008 farm bill did not directly address the issue of additional sugar imports from Mexico. Instead, a new sugar-for-ethanol program was authorized to handle the impact of such imports. USDA is directed to ensure that most imports enter as raw cane sugar to cover shortfalls in domestic sugar processors' allotments. The 2008 farm bill aimed to support cane refineries by limiting the entry of refined sugar imports, benefiting domestic beet sector sales. This policy change allowed cane refineries to utilize their capacity fully and enhanced the competitive position of raw sugar processors and sugarcane producers. The 2008 farm bill aimed to support cane refineries by limiting refined sugar imports, benefiting domestic beet sector sales. USDA decided not to regulate raw cane sugar imports due to hurricane impacts, citing changes in domestic marketing. House-passed provisions aimed to increase transaction costs for sugar-exporting countries and give a competitive edge to domestic processors. Food and beverage firms opposed import timing regulations, fearing supply shortfalls. The Bush Administration expressed concern over shipping patterns for quota sugar imports in the House bill. Several countries eligible to ship sugar to the U.S. market were worried about proposed regulations conflicting with U.S. trade commitments. Provisions prescribing how sugar import shipping patterns should be administered were dropped in conference. USDA announced the FY2009 raw sugar tariff-rate quota (TRQ) at 1,231,497 STRV, in line with changes made by the 2008 farm bill. The TRQ for refined and specialty sugars was set at 104,251 STRV, 80,000 ST higher than the U.S. minimum refined. The USDA announced the FY2009 raw sugar tariff-rate quota (TRQ) at 1,231,497 STRV, in line with changes made by the 2008 farm bill. The TRQ for refined and specialty sugars was set at 104,251 STRV, 80,000 ST higher than the U.S. minimum refined sugar TRQ to meet U.S. demand for organic sugar. Adjustments will be made to TRQ levels to ensure adequate sugar supplies. USDA has discretionary authority to increase sugar TRQ in case of emergency shortage due to natural disasters. The sugar production sector may argue against additional imports, while industrial users may request more refined sugar imports to prevent low ending stocks affecting prices. The USDA has the authority to increase sugar import quotas in case of an emergency shortage, with projected low ending stocks keeping refined sugar prices high. Producers and users are expected to provide input on regulations for determining an emergency sugar shortage. The 2002 farm bill included mandatory limits on sugar sales to protect prices and assumed continued import quota commitments. The USDA may suspend marketing allotments if imports exceed 1.532 million short tons, potentially leading to lower sugar prices and forfeitures if demand is already met. The 2002 farm bill included provisions to prevent USDA from losing control over managing U.S. sugar supplies. The sugar production sector ensured a minimum 85% share of the U.S. sugar-for-food market in the 2008 farm bill to prevent imports from displacing domestic production. USDA now announces an \"overall allotment quantity\" to guarantee this share and protect U.S. sugar processors' ability to sell their output. The USDA announced the FY2009 OAQ at 8.925 million STRV, complying with the statutory requirement of at least 85% of estimated U.S. sugar consumption. The FY2009 OAQ is higher than the projected sugar production, with cane sugar output increasing by 4% but beet sugar production expected to be 11% lower due to weather problems. USDA projected 2008/2009 U.S. sugar production at 7.8 million ST, 1.1 million ST below the announced OAQ. The USDA projects historically low ending stocks for sugar in FY2009, leading to higher wholesale prices. However, current spot U.S. refined sugar prices are above average due to continued imports from Mexico. The U.S. raw cane sugar futures price is under pressure due to imports from Mexico, which are projected to be lower this year. The explosion at a cane sugar refinery in Georgia has reduced demand for raw cane sugar, keeping prices low. Higher refined sugar prices are also attributed to the loss of refined product from the refinery. USDA's ability to increase sugar supply is limited by the 2008 farm bill. If a sugar shortage is determined before April 1, USDA may take action. Before the midpoint of the marketing year, USDA can address a sugar shortage by reassigning existing allotment deficits to imports of raw cane sugar. If a shortage persists, USDA can increase the refined sugar TRQ under specific conditions to avoid loan forfeitures. However, USDA must ensure that domestic sugar sales and refining capacity have been maximized before taking this step. Any decision to allow additional imports of raw cane sugar after April 1 may depress prices, potentially leading to sugarcane processors forfeiting on their loans. Sugar producers and processors have shown interest in using sugar crops for ethanol production. In 2005, the DR-CAFTA agreement increased access for six countries' sugar to the U.S., potentially impacting cane prices. USDA may be hesitant to allow an increase in refined sugar TRQ to prevent loan forfeitures, despite high sugar prices. Ethanol producers have experimented with adding sugar to ethanol fermentation, but results were disappointing. The DR-CAFTA trade agreement allows increased sugar access to the U.S. market. Producers sought a sugar-for-ethanol deal with the Bush Administration. Hawaii mandated gasoline to contain 10% ethanol, aiming to use sugarcane as a feedstock. Producing ethanol from sugarcane can be cheaper than from corn. Producing ethanol from sugarcane is cheaper than from corn due to the extra step required to break down corn starch into sugar. Sugar cane waste can also be burned to provide energy for an ethanol plant, reducing costs and improving energy balance. However, the economics of sugar-based ethanol differ significantly between countries, with the United States finding it more than twice as costly as corn ethanol. The USDA study showed that sugar ethanol may not be economical in the United States due to high costs compared to corn ethanol. The 2008 farm bill includes a program for bioenergy producers to use surplus sugar for ethanol production. The USDA would use competitive bids to purchase sugar from processors at support levels, selling it to ethanol firms. The program would require a subsidy due to higher production costs compared to corn ethanol. Sugar would likely be used by existing corn-based ethanol facilities and new plants in sugarcane-producing states. Ethanol producers may need to adjust their processes to use sugar as a feedstock. The USDA would purchase sugar from processors at support levels to sell to ethanol firms, requiring a subsidy due to higher production costs. This program could help develop the ethanol sector in Hawaii and reduce dependence on imported gasoline. Producers support the provision for a guaranteed minimum price, while sugar users oppose it to manage surplus supplies. The USDA proposed a program to manage surplus sugar supplies by selling it to ethanol producers, which was opposed by the Bush Administration. The current U.S. sugar market outlook suggests that USDA can meet the program's no-cost directive without subsidies. The USDA's ability to meet the no-cost directive for the sugar-for-ethanol program in FY2009 is confirmed, as there will be no sugar available for the program. The future of the program depends on U.S. sugar production levels and how sugar users, especially in the beverage sector, respond to higher HFCS prices. If HFCS prices are higher than Mexican sugar prices, there will be less displacement of Mexican sugar by HFCS imports from the U.S. This occurred in FY2008. The USDA successfully operated the sugar program at no cost from FY2003-FY2008. Budget forecasts projected costs of $700-$800 million over FY2008-FY2012 due to additional sugar imports. Policy changes in the 2008 farm bill aimed to prevent these costs and maintain a no-cost operation. The USDA aims to operate the sugar program at no cost, but estimating future budgetary impacts is challenging due to market volatility. The CBO projects outlays of $6 million for the sugar price support program and $325 million for the sugar-for-ethanol program over the farm bill period."
