    "content": "On June 1, 2009, Mauricio Funes, a former television journalist, became the president of El Salvador after winning the election against Rodrigo \u00c1vila. Funes, the first FMLN candidate without a guerilla past, brought a modern face to the party. Mauricio Funes won the election in El Salvador after a polarizing campaign. ARENA tied him to hard-line FMLN members, warning of strained US relations. Funes projected a moderate image, promising to maintain ties with the US and keep the US dollar as currency. His victory marked the first for FMLN, a former guerilla group turned political party. The FMLN in El Salvador transformed from a guerrilla group to a political party in 1992 after a peace accord. Mauricio Funes' election in 2009 marked a shift leftward in Salvadoran voting behavior. President Funes pursued moderate policies, causing friction with more radical FMLN members. S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n, former guerrilla leader and 2014 presidential candidate for the FMLN party, has faced criticism for straying from his party's base by forming an alliance with the GANA party led by former president Tony Saca. Despite economic and security challenges, President Funes maintains high approval ratings and has addressed human rights violations from the civil war era. In December 2012, the Funes government acknowledged the Inter American Court of Human Rights ruling on the El Mozote massacre, but did not commit to reinvestigating or prosecuting those responsible due to the amnesty law. Amnesty International expressed disappointment that war crimes perpetrators in El Salvador have not faced justice. Some former military leaders in El Salvador are facing judicial proceedings in the United States. President Funes may face challenges in enacting his legislative agenda as he enters lame duck status. ARENA gained support in the 2012 legislative elections, increasing its representation in the legislature. President Funes will need to form alliances to pass legislation as no party has a simple majority. President Funes, with no simple majority, must form alliances to pass legislation. He aims to pass laws on seizing criminal assets, business reforms, and attracting foreign investment. The Assembly approved an $800 million bond issue for debt payments. A new attorney general was selected in December 2012. In January 2013, a law was passed to revise regulations for free trade zones. IMF urges agreements on economic and political policies. In 2014, El Salvador must enact agreements on economic and political policies for the transition to a new government. There has been tension between the Assembly and the Supreme Court over the court's composition and authority. The court has 15 justices divided among four chambers, with five appointed every three years by the Assembly. The Assembly approved five new justices for the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court in 2009. These justices have made rulings to limit presidential power and revoke charters of political parties. This has caused backlash from politicians and threats to the court's independence. President Funes tried to constrain the justices' independence in 2011, but the decree was repealed after protests. In July 2011, the decree limiting the Supreme Court's independence was repealed after protests. Tensions between government branches persisted. In March 2012, the ARENA party gained seats, becoming the largest party. Before the Assembly's term ended, FMLN deputies and allies appointed new justices to influence the court. In June 2012, the constitutional chamber ruled that each legislature can only nominate one group of five justices to the Supreme Court. The National Assembly's 2012 appointments to the Supreme Court were deemed unconstitutional due to the chamber ruling that each legislature can only nominate one group of five justices. This decision led to tensions between the legislature and the constitutional chamber, resulting in a crisis. The Assembly rejected the ruling and filed a lawsuit with the Central American Court of Justice, sparking further legal debate. The newly elected justices forcibly entered the court building to take their seats on July 1, despite protests from the constitutional chamber, leading to two groups of judges claiming to be on the Supreme Court. The constitutional chamber declared the selection of a new attorney general in April 2012 unconstitutional, prompting President Funes to call for a compromise in late July. Pressure from international entities played a role in resolving the crisis. The Obama Administration officials expressed confidence in resolving the crisis in El Salvador in a way that respects the constitution, without U.S. intervention. Some U.S. Congress members threatened to suspend aid if a constitutionally sound solution was not reached. A resolution was negotiated by party leaders and approved by the National Assembly, involving the re-election of judges previously ruled as elected unconstitutionally. Most leaders expressed relief that the resolution, while imperfect, respected the constitution. The resolution to the constitutional crisis in El Salvador did not address the constitutional court's ruling on the selection of a new attorney general. After pressure from various parties, a vote to fill the post was held in December 2012. In January 2013, the constitutional chamber ruled that the appointment process for judges to the Court of Auditors was unconstitutional. The Assembly traditionally appointed politically aligned individuals instead of competent and independent ones as required by the constitution. The political crisis in El Salvador has been exacerbated by the repeated appointments of politically aligned individuals to key positions, which have been rejected by the constitutional chamber. This has led to disruptions in legislative processes, strained relations between political parties, and weakened support for judicial independence. The results of the 2012 elections indicate a shift in power towards ARENA, potentially impacting the upcoming 2014 presidential campaign. Norman Quijano, ARENA's 2014 presidential candidate, won reelection as mayor of San Salvador by a large margin. The FMLN hopes that selecting Oscar Ortiz as Vice-President S\u00e1nchez Ceren's running mate will attract moderate voters. Former President Tony Saca is running with a center-right coalition. President Funes has not endorsed any candidate. El Salvador continues to struggle with high crime rates, with a murder rate of 69 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2011. El Salvador recorded a high murder rate of 69 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2011, attributed to drug trafficking, corruption, poverty, and unemployment. Drug trafficking organizations like the Texis Cartel and Los Zetas have increased illicit activities, including money laundering. Connections between DTOs and the MS-13 gang are well established, with 20,000 to 35,000 Salvadoran youth belonging to street gangs. President Funes replaced his minister of public security due to deteriorating security conditions. In November 2011, President Funes replaced his FMLN minister of public security with retired general David Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s. Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s estimated there could be 50,000 gang members in El Salvador, with up to 90% of homicides attributed to gangs or drug trafficking. The PNC had around 20,500 police officers in 2011, with 86% being agents and a budget of $233 million. Limited funding for training and equipment has been a historical challenge for the PNC. The PNC in El Salvador faces challenges such as corruption, weak investigatory capacity, and an inability to prosecute officers accused of corruption and human rights abuses. The restructuring of the PNC by Minister Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s and the new director, both retired generals, has led to concerns about ties to organized crime among some appointed officers. Human rights groups criticize the appointment of retired generals to key positions, citing violations of the Peace Accords and the constitution. The arrest and release of Jos\u00e9 Natividad Luna Pereira (\"Chepe Luna\") also raised questions. The arrest and release of Jos\u00e9 Natividad Luna Pereira (\"Chepe Luna\"), a Salvadoran drug trafficker, in Honduras in August 2012 raised concerns about ties to organized crime within the Salvadoran police force. Minister Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s dismissed allegations of police officers helping Luna evade capture. Another trafficker, Jorge Ernesto Ulloa Sibrian, who previously had police protection, was recently arrested in Guatemala. President Funes has tasked Salvadoran military forces with public security functions due to funding and manpower deficiencies within the PNC. President Funes deployed military troops to assist police in fighting crime until police can handle the task alone. The military, with about 14,000 troops, has a lower budget than the police. Both the military and police have been accused of extrajudicial killings and torture. The Salvadoran judiciary faces challenges due to inefficiency, corruption, and insufficient resources. The Salvadoran judiciary's performance is hindered by inefficiency, corruption, and lack of resources, leading to a low criminal conviction rate of 5%. Severe prison overcrowding is a result of delays in the judicial process, with 25,000 prisoners in facilities meant for 8,000. Minister Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s initially supported a tough stance on gangs but later backed a truce brokered by a former guerrilla fighter and a Catholic bishop. In March 2012, he agreed to transfer high-ranking gang leaders to less secure prisons. Since March 2012, Minister Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s facilitated the transfer of high-ranking gang leaders to less secure prisons to aid in negotiating a truce between gangs. Questions remain about the details of the negotiations and their impact on reducing homicide rates by 40%. Gang leaders have pledged to refrain from recruiting children or committing violence against women, surrendered some weapons, and expressed willingness to engage in broader negotiations for a potential permanent truce. They have not relinquished control of their territories but emphasize the importance of improving prison conditions and providing rehabilitation programs for gang members. The Organization of American States (OAS) is monitoring the truce implementation and seeking support from various sectors. Gang negotiators proposed \"peace zones\" in municipalities where gangs would cease crimes in exchange for reintegration programs. The government plans to invest $72 million in participating municipalities. A charitable foundation has been established to coordinate international efforts to support the truce, including the \"peace zone\" plan. Some doubt the gangs' commitment to ending all crimes and the government's ability to prevent lawlessness in the \"peace zones.\" The truce has been praised for reducing the homicide rate and saving young lives in El Salvador. U.N. programs coordinator sees the truce as an opportunity for a long-term solution to violence. U.S.-based gang experts have formed a Transitional Advisory Group in Support of the Peace. Some skeptics question the lack of transparency in the government's role in facilitating the truce in El Salvador. Analysts warn of risks in recognizing gangs as legitimate political actors and meeting their demands. Extortion and violent crimes remain high despite a decline in gang-on-gang homicides. Disappearances and clandestine graves continue to be discovered in 2012. The truce in El Salvador has raised concerns about gangs becoming more powerful and organized due to less restrictive prison conditions. U.S. officials have made few public comments on the truce, with some believing that addressing root causes of crime is essential for sustainable reduction. The Treasury Department's sanctioning of MS-13's financial activities may not be directly related to the truce, according to Ambassador Aponte. The truce in El Salvador, which has raised concerns about gang power and organization, has led to a decline in the homicide rate. However, the sustainability of this decline is uncertain, and the truce has had little impact on other violent crimes. The government has implemented prevention and rehabilitation programs to support the truce, including municipal crime prevention councils and expanding school programs for at-risk youth. Additionally, a temporary youth employment program has been launched. El Salvador implemented a temporary youth employment program and civil protection training to address the country's challenges. The government also transferred low-risk inmates to new prison farms and is collaborating with the private sector and donors to enhance rehabilitation programs. The country achieved stability and economic growth in the 1990s through a \"neo-liberal\" economic model, including dollarization in 2001. While this led to lower interest rates and inflation, it limited the government's ability to cushion the economy from external shocks. El Salvador's economy struggled in the 2000s with moderate growth rates, high poverty levels, and a 3.1% contraction in 2009 due to the global financial crisis. President Funes implemented austerity measures to combat excess spending, subsidies, tax evasion, and corruption. The U.S. economic slowdown also impacted El Salvador's economy, leading to a decline in remittances, investment, tourism revenues, and demand for exports. President Funes implemented austerity measures to combat excess spending, subsidies, tax evasion, and corruption. He announced an \"Anti-Crisis\" plan focusing on boosting social spending, constructing new housing, and improving public utilities and road infrastructure. Despite efforts to repair the economy, Hurricane Ida in 2009 caused significant damage. In 2010, an agreement with the IMF led to a $790 million package to improve tax administration, restrict spending, and reallocate energy subsidies, supported by loans from the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank for anti-poverty efforts and fiscal reform programs. Despite government efforts and support from international donors, the Salvadoran economy has continued to perform poorly compared to its Central American neighbors. In 2010, GDP growth was modest at 1.4%, but hopes for faster expansion in 2011 were dashed due to flooding causing $840 million in damage. The enactment of a tax reform package in 2011 generated $150 million in new revenue, but the government still struggles with reducing the fiscal deficit. Poor export performance led to a GDP growth of 1.3% in 2012, the lowest in Central America. Moody's Investors Service downgraded El Salvador's credit rating due to slow growth and debt problems. The Funes Administration in El Salvador is working to attract foreign investment with U.S. support. Foreign direct investment in the country has been low due to challenges in the business climate, public security, and labor force. The government is aiming to improve the legal environment, combat crimes affecting businesses, and align education programs with private sector needs. The Funes Administration in El Salvador is working to attract foreign investment with U.S. support by improving the legal environment, combating crimes affecting businesses, and aligning education programs with private sector needs. El Salvador aims to channel increases in FDI into higher value-added production to take advantage of preferential access to the U.S. market. The country also signed a free trade agreement with the European Union in 2012. The United States has historically been involved in El Salvador's political and economic developments, providing military aid during the 1980s and shifting towards assisting in rebuilding democracy and implementing economic reforms after the 1992 peace accords. The United States is a key player in El Salvador's economic development, providing foreign investment and assistance. There are strong migratory and cultural ties between the two countries, with close to 2 million Salvadorans residing in the U.S. Bilateral relations have remained friendly, with cooperation in counternarcotics operations and support for U.S. coalition forces in Iraq. Despite initial concerns, relations have continued positively since Mauricio Funes took office in 2009. President Funes of El Salvador expressed his desire to strengthen relations with the United States, being referred to as a strategic partner. High-level meetings between Funes and Obama Administration officials led to Funes' visit to the White House in 2010. President Obama thanked Funes for his help in resolving the political crisis in Honduras and emphasized the importance of U.S.-Salvadoran relations. El Salvador was the only Central American country included in Obama's 2011 tour of Latin America, where he pledged to continue working as partners with El Salvador. President Obama pledged to continue working as partners with El Salvador to confront hurdles to growth and development. Initiatives such as the Partnership for Growth and the Central American Citizen Security Partnership were announced. U.S.-Salvadoran cooperation continued despite tension during a constitutional crisis, focusing on improving productivity and reducing insecurity in El Salvador. Relations received a boost in mid-June 2012. In mid-June 2012, the U.S. Senate approved Mari Carmen Aponte as U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador, boosting bilateral relations. In September 2012, El Salvador completed its first MCC compact, with a second one in development. The U.S. donated helicopters to aid in fighting organized crime and disaster relief. El Salvador is part of the Partnership for Growth Initiative to promote economic development. The Partnership for Growth Initiative in El Salvador aims to address constraints on growth such as crime, insecurity, and lack of competitiveness. The U.S. and Salvadoran governments signed a Joint Country Action Plan in 2011 to tackle these issues, with progress evaluated every six months. The U.S. government plans to assist El Salvador in strengthening judicial institutions and supporting crime prevention programs. The U.S. government aims to help El Salvador improve infrastructure and business climate to attract investment. President Funes formed a Growth Council to enhance public-private cooperation. Progress on bilateral goals is mostly on track, but issues like extraditions for crime control and civil service reform are lagging. Crime reduction measures have been enacted, including access to public information and asset forfeiture laws. The government of El Salvador has implemented various measures to combat crime and improve productivity, including the establishment of an elite anti-gang unit, expansion of U.S. funded programs, community policing training for police, justice sector training, creation of task forces to combat crimes against small businesses and on public transit, and expansion of employment and training programs for at-risk youth. Additionally, there have been improvements in legislation to facilitate investment and regulate free trade zones. El Salvador has implemented measures to combat crime and improve productivity, including an elite anti-gang unit, community policing training, and task forces to combat crimes. Progress has been made in modernizing the Comalapa airport and supporting financing. Job training has helped 6,000 job seekers find employment. Bilateral funding to El Salvador was $29.8 million in FY2011, with an estimated $28.2 million in FY2012. The Administration requested $41.8 million in bilateral assistance for FY2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 requires a 5% reduction in funding for El Salvador in FY2013. Uncertainty over country allocations makes it difficult to calculate post-sequestration funding levels. U.S. bilateral assistance is focused on reducing insecurity and boosting productivity in the country. USAID is increasing funding for institutional strengthening, violence prevention, and private sector competitiveness programs in El Salvador. Health programs are ending, and education programs are being reoriented towards in-school and out-of-school youth in high-crime communities. USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provides foreign assistance beyond bilateral funds, with U.S. Peace Corps volunteers engaged in various projects in the country. USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) provides assistance in response to natural disasters in El Salvador. The country also benefits from regional trade capacity building and anti-gang assistance funded through global funds. El Salvador receives support under the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) for counternarcotics and anticrime efforts. CARSI provides equipment, training, and technical assistance to combat criminal threats and supports community-based programs. CARSI supports community-based programs to address economic and social vulnerabilities. El Salvador received $58.8 million in CARSI assistance between FY2008 and FY2011. The Obama Administration requested $107.5 million for CARSI in FY2013. El Salvador also signed a $461 million compact with MCC to develop its northern border region, focusing on poverty alleviation through projects in agriculture and education. The MCC compact in El Salvador, worth $268.8 million, aimed to improve education, public services, and infrastructure. It ended in 2012, benefiting over 700,000 Salvadorans. The project included road rehabilitation, bridge construction, electricity provision to 28,000 families, water connection for 6,300 households, vocational training for 12,000 people, and attracting $57 million in private investment.

The project included road rehabilitation, bridge construction, electricity provision to 28,000 families, water connection for 6,300 households, vocational training for 12,000 people, and attracting $57 million in private investment. The Salvadoran government invested $70 million in road construction. El Salvador is eligible for a second compact focusing on improving ports, airports, water, electricity, education, and developing a tourism hub. The MCC is providing $3 million for compact development, expected to be finalized in 2013. El Salvador serves as a transit country for narcotics, mainly cocaine and heroin. President Obama included El Salvador on the list of \"major\" drug-producing or \"drug-transit\" countries in 2011. Despite efforts, corruption and lack of resources hinder bilateral efforts. In 2012, officials seized drugs and cash, but operational results were lower due to staff turnover. In 2012, El Salvador achieved fewer operational results due to staff turnover and shortages. U.S. assistance focused on improving interdiction capabilities of Salvadoran law enforcement and military agencies, including the joint military-police task force \"Grupo Cuscatl\u00e1n.\" The U.S. government provided $5 million to establish the National Electronic Monitoring Center in 2012. Comalapa International Airport in El Salvador serves as a cooperative security location for U.S. anti-drug forces in the hemisphere. El Salvador signed an agreement in April 2009 allowing the U.S. to use Comalapa for five more years. The country hosts the U.S.-backed International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) and is a key starting point for U.S. anti-gang efforts in Central America. The FBI established a Transnational Anti-Gang Unit in El Salvador in 2007. The Department of Homeland Security launched \"Operation Community Shield\" in 2005 to combat gangs. ICE collaborated with El Salvador and the FBI to share criminal history information on gang deportees. The State Department funded anti-gang programs in El Salvador through the M\u00e9rida Initiative/CARSI, allocating $35 million between FY2008 and FY2012. A Regional Gang Advisor in El Salvador coordinated Central American gang programs since January 2008. USAID has been supporting prevention programs for at-risk youth and municipal crime prevention projects in El Salvador since 2005. Recently, a $42 million public-private partnership focused on crime prevention was announced, along with $2 million in grant awards for innovative crime prevention projects. The MS-13 gang was designated as a significant transnational criminal organization in 2012, allowing for economic sanctions under Executive Order 13581. The Treasury Department collaborated with ICE to designate the MS-13 gang as a criminal organization involved in drug trafficking, kidnapping, and other serious offenses. While some MS-13 cliques in DC may work with groups in El Salvador, transnational collaboration is not common. Salvadoran officials were surprised by the designation, with President Funes suggesting that the economic risk from MS-13 may be overestimated. Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s pledges to support peace efforts with MS-13 and M-18 despite U.S. TCO designation. U.S. officials stand by the designation to aid anti-gang efforts. The movement of Salvadorans to the U.S. eases pressure on El Salvador's social services and labor market, providing substantial remittances. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was granted to 212,000 Salvadoran migrants due to earthquakes in 2001. The Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Salvadoran migrants has been extended multiple times, currently set to expire in March 2015. Despite this, many Salvadoran migrants are still being deported from the United States, with 47% deported on criminal grounds in FY2011. Efforts are being made by the United States and El Salvador to improve the deportation process, including the formation of a bi-national working group in 2009. El Salvador became the first country to receive more complete criminal history information on U.S. deportees in 2012. El Salvador's economy heavily relies on trade with the United States, with the US being its main trading partner. The country has benefited from preferential trade agreements, allowing duty-free entry of exports like apparel. However, Salvadoran apparel producers have faced challenges competing with cheaper Asian goods since the expiration of global textile quotas in 2004. El Salvador ratified the CAFTA-DR agreement in 2004, becoming the first country in Central America to do so. However, Salvadoran exports have struggled due to factors like dependence on apparel trade, low investment levels, public security issues, and governance concerns. The low productivity of El Salvador's industries has hindered the country from fully benefiting from CAFTA-DR, potentially causing an 8% GDP loss compared to its counterparts. This productivity constraint may be linked to the country's limited human capital."
