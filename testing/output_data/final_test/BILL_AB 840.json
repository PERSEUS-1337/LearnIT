    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to establish a process to prevent mandatory overtime for nurses and CNAs in state health care facilities. This includes prohibiting the use of mandatory overtime as a scheduling tool or excuse for staffing failures. A new section, 19851.2, is added to the Government Code for this purpose. Section 19851.2 is added to the Government Code to prevent mandatory overtime for nurses and CNAs in state health care facilities. It defines terms like \"nurse,\" \"CNA,\" \"facility,\" and \"emergency situation\" for clarity. In an emergency situation, a facility cannot require nurses or CNAs to work beyond their regular hours. Nurses and CNAs can choose to work additional hours voluntarily. Refusal to work extra hours does not constitute any penalty. The section outlines grounds for adverse employment decisions for nurses and CNAs, with exceptions for patient abandonment and neglect. It does not apply in certain situations, such as during surgical procedures or catastrophic events where mandatory overtime may be necessary due to a large number of patients needing immediate care. The section outlines grounds for adverse employment decisions for nurses and CNAs, with exceptions for patient abandonment and neglect. It does not apply in certain situations, such as during surgical procedures or catastrophic events where mandatory overtime may be necessary due to a large number of patients needing immediate care. The catastrophic event is an unanticipated and nonrecurring event. Nothing in this section affects the Nursing Practice Act, Vocational Nursing Practice Act, or a registered nurse's duty under competent performance standards. Facilities can hire part-time or intermittent employees and provide more protections against mandatory overtime. This section becomes operative on January 1, 2019. Section 19851.3 is added to the Government Code. Each facility must establish a joint labor management task force to reduce mandatory overtime. The task force, composed of eight members, will meet quarterly to develop recommendations including tracking patient acuity and staff needs, providing training on staffing principles, best practices, and avoiding mandatory overtime. The task force will prepare a report on recommendations for reducing mandatory overtime, including data on voluntary and mandatory overtime hours, complaints investigated, and suggestions for statutory changes to improve enforcement. The report on reducing mandatory overtime recommendations will be submitted to the Legislature as required by Section 9795 of the Government Code, effective until January 1, 2019, when it will be repealed."
