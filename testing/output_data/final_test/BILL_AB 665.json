    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 200 of the Fish and Game Code delegates power to the commission to regulate the taking of wildlife for public health and safety purposes. The commission does not have the authority to regulate the commercial use of aquatic plants. Section 200.5 is added to the code, referencing a California Supreme Court decision. The California Supreme Court ruled that local governments cannot regulate fish and game matters, placing this responsibility with the Legislature. The commission was established in 1870 to manage California's fish and wildlife resources, with regulatory powers delegated by the Legislature. Hunting and fishing are safe outdoor activities regulated by the state through safety requirements, discharge laws, and commission regulations. Local regulation is unnecessary and would create enforcement issues, as these activities are compatible with other recreational uses on public lands. The Legislature affirms exclusive legal authority granted to the commission and the department for fish and game matters, preempting local ordinances. Local governments should regulate hunting, fishing, and permits under Section 207. Section 200.6 is added to the Fish and Game Code, stating that the state fully occupies the field of taking and possession of fish and game, preempting local ordinances. The commission and department must protect public recreation rights on navigable waters in accordance with the California Constitution. The commission and department are the only entities authorized to regulate fishing and hunting in the state, except for private landowners who can control access on their property. Public rights for recreation on state waters are protected. Section 203.1 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to consider various factors when adopting regulations, including populations, habitat, food supplies, welfare of animals, public health, and safety.
