    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Healthy and High Performance Schools Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that American schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, with many students in schools with unsatisfactory environmental conditions. It is noted that students perform better in comfortable, healthy, and well-lit environments. Over half of the nation's schools are over 40 years old and in need of renovation. Over the next 10 years, schools must accommodate the increasing number of students. Poor ventilation, lighting, and temperatures can impact students' health and focus. Inefficient water use is common in older schools. Designing new schools with a whole building approach leads to healthy and high-performance buildings. Adoption of whole building concepts has proven beneficial. Adopting a whole building approach in school construction can lead to improved student and teacher performance, lower life cycle costs, energy conservation savings, and the use of renewable energy sources. Additionally, using environmentally preferable products and ensuring adequate fresh air supply can further enhance building efficiency. The purpose of this Act is to assist school districts in creating high performance, healthful, energy-efficient, and environmentally sound school buildings. Many districts lack knowledge of cutting-edge design and technologies for new construction or renovations. Providing adequate fresh air supply can improve indoor air quality in schools. The Act aims to help school districts create high performance, energy-efficient, and environmentally sound school buildings. The High Performance Schools Program, established in the Department of Education, allows for grants to State educational agencies to award subgrants to local educational agencies for activities related to energy efficiency and environmental protection in school buildings. The State educational agency awards subgrants to local educational agencies committed to developing healthy, high-performance school buildings in line with approved plans. The State educational agency awards subgrants to local educational agencies to achieve specific purposes, encouraging them to supplement funds from other sources. The agency uses grant funds to evaluate compliance and distribute information. The State educational agency uses grant funds to promote the development of healthy, high-performance school buildings by distributing information, organizing programs, obtaining technical services, and monitoring project information. Local educational agencies receiving subgrants under this Act must use funds for energy-efficient new school building and renovation projects, aiming to reduce energy use by at least 30 percent compared to standard construction codes. The local educational agency must use subgrant funds for energy-efficient renovations of existing school buildings to reduce energy consumption and ensure compliance with health and safety standards. The State must allocate grant funds as follows: at least 70% for section 3(c)(1) and at least 15% for section 3(c)(2). The Secretary can reserve up to $300,000 per year to assist in coordinating and implementing the Program. Additionally, funds may be used to develop reference materials. A report to Congress is required. The Secretary will conduct biennial reviews of State actions implementing the Act and report to Congress. The reviews will assess the effectiveness of calculation procedures for local educational agency eligibility for subgrants. Authorization of appropriations includes $250,000,000 for fiscal years 2002-2005 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2006-2011. The Act defines terms such as \"elementary school,\" \"secondary school,\" \"healthy, high performance school building,\" and \"local educational agency\" in relation to their specific meanings and criteria. The curr_chunk defines terms such as \"agency,\" \"renewable energy,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State educational agency\" in relation to their specific meanings."
