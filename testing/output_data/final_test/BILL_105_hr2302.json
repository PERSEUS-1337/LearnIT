    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. The \"Immigration Technical Revisions Act of 1997\" amends Section 240A of the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding deportation and adjustment of status. The changes apply to removal cases starting from April 1, 1997. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-208, Division C, 110 Stat. 3009) is amended to remove paragraph (7) from Section 309, subsection (c). Section 240A of the Immigration and Nationality Act is also amended to make various changes, including redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4) and adding a new paragraph after paragraph (2). The Attorney General has the discretion to cancel removal and adjust the status of certain aliens covered by the settlement agreement in American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh if they meet specific criteria, including not being convicted of an aggravated felony and entering before December 19, 1990. Guatemalan nationals who entered the United States before specific dates and met certain criteria could be eligible for benefits under the ABC settlement agreement or Temporary Protected Status. Eligibility for benefits under the ABC settlement agreement includes being the spouse or unmarried son or daughter of an alien who entered the United States before specific dates. The ABC settlement agreement provides benefits to certain individuals, including Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, or Salvadoran asylum applicants who filed before April 1, 1990, and had not received a decision by April 1, 1997. The alien must not fall under specific sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act and must be removable under US law. The individual must have been physically present in the United States for at least seven years before applying for benefits under the ABC settlement agreement. They must also demonstrate good moral character and show that their removal would cause extreme hardship to themselves or their family members who are U.S. citizens. To be eligible for benefits under the ABC settlement agreement, an individual must be a citizen of the United States or a lawful permanent resident. They must have been physically present in the US for at least 10 years following an act or status that could lead to deportation. To be eligible for benefits under the ABC settlement agreement, an individual must prove good moral character and show that their deportation would result in exceptional hardship to themselves or their family members who are US citizens or lawful permanent residents. Subsection (d) does not apply to determinations under this paragraph. The alien's continuous physical presence in the United States will not be considered interrupted if their absence was brief, casual, innocent, and did not meaningfully disrupt their presence. The amendments made by this section will be effective as if included in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Any eligible alien can file one motion to reopen for suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal. The Attorney General will set a specific time period for filing motions to reopen for suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal, starting no later than 120 days after the enactment of the Act and lasting for 180 days."
