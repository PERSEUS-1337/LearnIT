    "content": "The U.S. national security strategy has focused on enhancing security at home and abroad, promoting economic prosperity, and democracy globally. Various mechanisms, including military, diplomatic, and economic tools, have been used to achieve these objectives. The core objective of enhancing U.S. security involves protecting American lives, sovereignty, and well-being through a range of tools. The U.S. national security strategy utilizes military, alliances, economic power, arms control, and nonproliferation efforts to protect its interests and counter aggression. These tools are seen as complementary to military and economic efforts, not as substitutes. Effective employment of arms control and nonproliferation is crucial for the success of the broader strategy. Effective arms control measures are essential for enhancing U.S. national security by providing early warning of evasion efforts, promoting transparency, easing military planning, reducing opponent incentives for attack, building confidence among adversaries, and complementing force structure objectives. Arms control measures are crucial for U.S. national security, helping to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. Proliferation can escalate regional tensions, complicate military strategy, and pose a threat to the U.S. homeland if acquired by terrorists. The United States employs diplomatic, economic, and military tools to restrain threats to its national security posed by weapons acquisition by terrorists or subnational groups. Critics argue that arms control agreements can become unbalanced without stringent enforcement mechanisms, with the U.S. abiding by terms while others fail to comply. Arms control played a significant role in the U.S.-Soviet relationship during the Cold War, despite rarely forcing significant changes in planned nuclear forces. During the Cold War, arms control played a significant role in U.S.-Soviet relations, despite rarely leading to major changes in nuclear forces. The United States also participated in multilateral regimes to limit the spread of weapons and provided assistance to reduce the threat of weapons falling into hostile hands. In the George W. Bush Administration, there were doubts about the effectiveness of arms control negotiations and treaties in enhancing U.S. security objectives. During the George W. Bush Administration, doubts arose about the effectiveness of arms control in enhancing U.S. security objectives. Some argued against formal treaties to reduce nuclear forces, preferring unilateral military action or ad hoc coalitions to address weapons proliferation. The Administration eventually incorporated reductions into a formal treaty with Russia after initial reluctance. The Bush Administration removed \"arms control\" from State Department bureaus, focusing on nonproliferation without formal treaties. The Obama Administration reinstated \"arms control\" in bureau titles, emphasizing arms control and nonproliferation agreements in national security policy. President Obama outlined pursuing a new arms control treaty with Russia, ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and negotiating a Fissile Material Control Treaty. President Obama's efforts in arms control and nonproliferation included convening international nuclear security summits and pledging to strengthen the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Limited results were seen during his first term, with the signing of the New START Treaty with Russia being a notable achievement. Despite limited progress in arms control during President Obama's first term with the New START Treaty, further reductions in nuclear weapons were not achieved. The United States accused Russia of violating past agreements, including the INF Treaty and Open Skies Treaty, amidst concerns over Russia's actions in Crimea and Ukraine. This lack of progress suggests a rejection of arms control and security measures by Russia. The United States and Russia have had limited progress in arms control agreements, with accusations of violations by Russia. The situation escalated with Russia's actions in Crimea and Ukraine, indicating a rejection of arms control measures. In contrast, an agreement with Iran in 2015 restricted their nuclear program, showing the value of international monitoring. There is ongoing debate in Congress over the role of arms control agreements in national security, with skepticism from the Trump Administration. This skepticism stems from concerns about Russian compliance and the effectiveness of such agreements. The Trump Administration announced the suspension of U.S. participation in the INF Treaty on February 1, 2019, citing Russia's non-compliance. This decision was made after failed attempts to convince Russia to adhere to the treaty. President Trump's diplomatic efforts with North Korea have raised hopes for resolving the nuclear crisis. The Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Iran agreement contrasts with diplomatic engagement with North Korea. The United States has a history of arms control efforts over the past 60 years, including formal treaties, informal arrangements, and unilateral restraints. Congress remains interested in existing agreements and future negotiations. The changing international environment in the 1990s led to hopes for a new era of restraint in weapons deployments and military operations, with treaties like START I, START II, the Chemical Weapons Convention, and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty signed between 1991 and 1996. However, slow ratification and implementation of agreements clouded these hopes, with START I entering into force in late 1994, START II never entering into force, and the CTBT failing to win approval from the U.S. Senate in 1996. Despite international support, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) failed to gain approval from the U.S. Senate in 1999. Concerns were raised by India, Pakistan, Iran, and North Korea regarding the effectiveness of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Progress was made in 1997 with the U.S. and Russia ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention, and an international agreement banning antipersonnel land mines was signed by over 120 nations. However, major nations like the U.S. declined to sign. The U.S. Senate's rejection of the CTBT, withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002, and rejection of a verification protocol for the Biological Weapons Convention raised doubts about the U.S.'s commitment to arms control. The U.S.'s approach to arms control shifted during the Bush Administration, focusing on voluntary guidelines and targeting nations deemed security threats. Nonproliferation policy became intertwined with antiterrorism efforts under both the Bush and Obama Administrations. The Obama Administration shifted towards establishing international norms and regimes to control nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, emphasizing the importance of nonproliferation as a tool of U.S. national security policy. President Obama highlighted the illusion of prestige in holding these weapons and emphasized the need to stop their spread without singling out individual nations. The Trump Administration supports existing arms control and nonproliferation tools but also considers bolstering military capabilities. The report provides an overview of key arms control agreements over the past 40 years, divided into three sections. The report outlines arms control efforts between the United States and the former Soviet Union, including bilateral treaties, multilateral nonproliferation efforts, and agreements addressing various weapons. Appendices list treaties, the ratification process, and organizations involved in implementation. The first formal agreements between the US and Soviet Union on nuclear weapons were signed in May 1972 during the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT). The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) in May 1972 produced two agreements - the Interim Agreement on Offensive Arms and the Treaty on Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems. SALT II in 1979 aimed to equalize limits on U.S. and Soviet nuclear forces, freezing the number of ICBM and SLBM launchers. The Interim Agreement on Offensive Arms in 1972 between the United States and the Soviet Union froze the number of ICBM launchers and allowed for a limited number of SLBM launchers on submarines. Concerns arose over the unequal limits, leading to the Jackson amendment requiring future arms control agreements to have equal limits. The agreement was to last for five years or until replaced by a more comprehensive agreement. In 1977, both nations agreed to uphold the agreement until the completion of the SALT II Treaty. The United States and Soviet Union completed the SALT II Treaty in June 1979 after seven years of negotiations. The treaty limited each nation to a total of 2,400 ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers, with sublimits for various types of missiles and bombers. The SALT II Treaty did not limit the total number of warheads on delivery vehicles but set restrictions on increasing warheads on existing missiles and testing new ICBMs with more than 10 warheads and new SLBMs with more than 14 warheads. Provisions aimed to limit missile modernization programs to prevent qualitative improvements in strategic forces. Despite equal limits on U.S. and Soviet forces, the Treaty was controversial with some analysts advocating for lower limits and actual reductions to curb the arms race. Some analysts argued that the SALT II Treaty would give the Soviet Union strategic superiority over the United States due to their advantage in large, land-based ballistic missiles. This advantage could potentially allow the Soviet Union to target all U.S. land-based ICBMs in a first strike, creating a \"window of vulnerability\" for the United States. However, supporters of the Treaty believed that the U.S. advantage in SLBM warheads and heavy bombers would offset the Soviet advantage in MIRVed ICBMs. The Soviet build-up of nuclear forces and other international challenges further complicated the situation. The 1972 ABM Treaty between the United States and Soviet Union allowed for the deployment of ABM interceptors at two sites, with restrictions on developing, testing, or deploying ABM systems for defense. President Carter withdrew the Treaty from Senate consideration after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979. The ABM Treaty of 1972 imposed restrictions on the deployment of space-based, sea-based, or air-based ABM systems, with qualitative limits on missile defense programs. It allowed for the deployment of ABM systems at only one site, either around the nation's capital or an ICBM deployment area. The Soviet Union deployed its system around Moscow, while the United States briefly operated its system near Grand Forks, ND before closing it down. The Treaty was a source of controversy and debate throughout its history. President Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Clinton grappled with defending the US against ballistic missile attacks within the confines of the ABM Treaty. President George W. Bush withdrew from the treaty in 2002 to deploy missile defenses, resolving the conflict. Reagan aimed to enhance US nuclear capabilities to counter Soviet advantages, initially rejecting arms control agreements. In 1982, the Reagan Administration outlined negotiating positions on arms control agreements to address intermediate-range missiles, long-range strategic weapons, and ballistic missile defenses. Negotiations led to the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987. President George H. W. Bush pursued the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) with the Soviet Union, signed in July 1991. START II was signed in January 1993, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. NATO decided on a \"two track\" approach to intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) in Europe in December 1979. NATO adopted a \"two track\" approach to INF in Europe, combining negotiations with the Soviets to limit systems and scheduling deployments to spur talks. Negotiations began in 1980, paused in 1983 due to U.S. INF deployments, and resumed in 1985. The Reagan Administration proposed a \"double zero\" option initially, but progress was hindered by Soviet reluctance to limit systems in Asia. Progress improved during the Gorbachev era, leading to agreements at the Reykjavik summit in 1986. The United States and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) on December 8, 1987, establishing an intrusive verification regime and eliminating entire classes of weapons. They agreed to destroy all intermediate-range and shorter-range nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles with a range between 300 and 3,400 miles. The INF Treaty signed in 1987 required the destruction of missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles, along with their launchers. The warheads and guidance systems could be repurposed. The Soviets destroyed 1,750 missiles, while the US destroyed 846, allowing for asymmetrical reductions. The main systems destroyed were the Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missile for the US, and the SS-20 ballistic missile for the Soviets, all capable of striking high-value targets. The INF Treaty signed in 1987 required the destruction of missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles, along with their launchers. The Soviets agreed to destroy a range of older nuclear missiles and the mobile, short-range SS-23 system. The verification regime allowed for on-site inspections and data exchange to ensure compliance. Inspections continued until May 2001. The INF Treaty continued until May 2001, with the United States operating its site at Russia's Votkinsk Missile Assembly facility under the 1991 START Treaty. In 2007, Russia threatened to withdraw from the INF Treaty due to U.S. missile defense plans in Eastern Europe. Concerns were raised about Russia's testing of a new ground-launched cruise missile since 2014. The United States has expressed concerns about Russia's violation of the INF Treaty by developing a new ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km. The missile, designated as the 9M729, has been a point of contention in diplomatic meetings between the two countries. The United States accused Russia of violating the INF Treaty by developing a new ground-launched cruise missile, the 9M729, with a range of 500 km to 5,500 km. Russia denied the existence of the missile at first, then claimed it had not been tested to INF range. The U.S. also faced accusations of noncompliance, with Russia pointing to missile defense launchers in Romania. The Trump Administration conducted a review in 2017 and announced a comprehensive response on the Treaty's 30th anniversary in December 2017. The United States announced its withdrawal from the INF Treaty in response to Russia's violation, leading to the near certainty that the Treaty will lapse on August 2, 2019. This decision was made after diplomatic, military, and economic measures were considered, including the establishment of a new program in the Pentagon for research into a ground-launched cruise missile. START negotiations began in 1982 but were halted between 1983 and 1985 due to a Soviet walk-out in response to U.S. deployment of intermediate-range missiles in Europe. The United States and Soviet Union signed the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) on July 31, 1991. After the demise of the Soviet Union in December 1991, questions arose about the future of the Treaty. Russia initially wanted to be the sole successor, but Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan also became parties to the Treaty in May 1992. The leaders of Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan agreed to eliminate their nuclear weapons and join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear states. The U.S. Senate and Russian parliament ratified START, with Russia waiting for the other republics to join the NPT. Kazakhstan and Belarus joined the NPT as non-nuclear states in 1994 and 1993, respectively, while Ukraine approved START in 1993. Ukraine's parliament approved the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) in November 1993, with conditions on retaining some weapons and receiving security guarantees. After negotiations with the US and Russia, Ukraine ratified START on November 16, 1994, and joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. START officially entered into force on December 5, 1994, limiting long-range nuclear forces. The START treaty limited the deployment of nuclear forces in the United States and the former Soviet Union, allowing each side to deploy up to 6,000 warheads on 1,600 ballistic missiles and bombers. The treaty also restricted each side to 4,900 warheads on ICBMs and SLBMs, with a further limit of 1,540 warheads on \"heavy\" ICBMs. START did not require the elimination of most missiles removed from service. The START treaty allowed each side to deploy a limited number of warheads on ballistic missiles and bombers. Most missiles removed from service did not need to be eliminated, but launchers exceeding permitted totals had to be eliminated. The treaty included a complex verification regime using satellites, remote sensing equipment, data exchanges, notifications, and on-site inspections to detect violations. However, no verification regime can guarantee the detection of all violations. The START Treaty mandated reductions in forces by December 5, 2001, with warheads and launchers being removed and destroyed. Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan returned missiles and warheads to Russia. The Treaty expired in December 2009, giving parties options to let it lapse, extend unchanged, or modify it. The START Treaty expired in December 2009, giving parties options to let it lapse, extend unchanged, or modify it. The United States and Russia had differing views on the future of START, with Russia proposing a new Treaty with reduced warheads while the Bush Administration argued that detailed provisions were no longer necessary due to improved relations. The United States and Russia considered extending the monitoring provisions of the Moscow Treaty, but some objections arose due to their impact on U.S. strategic weapons and missile defense programs. The Obama Administration decided to negotiate a new Treaty to replace START, leading to the signing of the New START Treaty in April 2010. The United States and Russia signed the second START Treaty, START II, in January 1993, but it never entered into force. The Treaty would have limited warheads and banned MIRVed ICBMs, with the U.S. needing to remove warheads from missiles and eliminate launchers to comply. The United States and Russia planned to reduce their nuclear arsenals under the START II Treaty. This involved eliminating launchers for missiles and reducing the number of warheads on submarines. Russia would have downsized its missile arsenal significantly to comply with the treaty limits. This led to discussions about negotiating a START III Treaty with even lower warhead numbers to avoid the need for Russia to produce new missiles. The START II Treaty aimed to reduce warhead numbers, eliminating Soviet SS-18 heavy ICBMs and limiting U.S. SLBM warheads. The treaty included verification measures such as allowing U.S. inspectors to monitor Russia's missile silo conversions. The START II Treaty, signed in early January 1993, aimed to reduce warhead numbers by eliminating Soviet SS-18 heavy ICBMs and limiting U.S. SLBM warheads. Russian inspectors could verify missile silo conversions and weapons carriage areas on U.S. heavy bombers. The treaty faced delays in both the U.S. Senate and the Russian Duma due to concerns over its impact on strategic offensive forces and economic costs. It was eventually ratified by the U.S. Senate on January 26, 1996. The United States negotiated a Protocol to extend START II deadlines, but faced delays due to various international events. President Putin eventually won approval for the treaty in April 2000 after promising Russia's withdrawal if the U.S. left the ABM Treaty. The United States and Russia faced challenges in arms control agreements, with Russia withdrawing from START II in response to the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty. Efforts to ratify and implement START II stalled in the 1990s, leading to negotiations for a START III Treaty that ultimately did not materialize. When President Bush took office in 2001, he signed the Moscow Treaty in 2002, preferring that the U.S. and Russia set their own force levels without formal limits. Many in Russia suggested bypassing START II for deeper reductions in nuclear warheads. The Clinton Administration initially wanted to ensure Russia eliminated its MIRVed ICBMs but later realized Russia would not ratify START II. The United States agreed to proceed to START III after START II entered into force, with reductions to between 2,000 and 2,500 warheads for strategic offensive nuclear weapons on each side. Discussions on START III between the United States and Russia did not resolve their differences before the end of the Clinton Administration, and President Bush did not pursue the negotiations after taking office in 2001. This left many unresolved issues in the U.S.-Russian arms control process. The START III framework aims to limit long-range, nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles and other tactical nuclear weapons. Concerns have been raised about the safety of Russia's stored nuclear weapons and the numerical difference between U.S. and Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons. The U.S. and Russia agreed to explore transparency measures and promote irreversible warhead reductions, but the Bush Administration rejected this approach. The Bush Administration implemented deep reductions in the U.S. stockpile of nuclear weapons but did not prioritize transparency or irreversibility. Critics argued this undermined efforts to encourage Russia to eliminate at-risk warheads. The 1972 ABM Treaty allowed limited defenses against ballistic missiles, with the U.S. abandoning a treaty-compliant system in 1974. Russia continues to operate a similar system. In the 1990s, the United States focused on developing ballistic missile defense technologies under the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) initiated by President Reagan. The Bush Administration shifted towards defending against limited missile attacks from various countries. After the Persian Gulf War in 1991, the U.S. began developing advanced theater missile defense (TMD) systems to counter short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. The Clinton Administration also pursued research for national missile defenses (NMD). The Clinton Administration considered deploying a national missile defense system in response to concerns about missile proliferation, but President Clinton decided not to authorize construction after disappointing test results in September 2000. President George W. Bush later altered U.S. policy on missile defenses. President George W. Bush changed U.S. missile defense policy by deploying a layered defense system to protect against short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles. Land-based interceptors were deployed in Alaska and California, with plans for defenses on naval ships. The ABM Treaty would not have allowed these systems, and negotiations with the Soviet Union in 1985 aimed to replace the treaty. In 1993, the Clinton Administration shifted focus to clarifying the difference between theater missile defenses and strategic missile defenses to proceed with theater missile defense programs without violating the ABM Treaty. Two joint statements on ABM/TMD Demarcation were signed by the United States and Russia in September 1997, but President Clinton never submitted them to the Senate for approval due to lack of support. In February 1999, the United States and Russia discussed ABM Treaty modifications to allow for a U.S. national missile defense system. The U.S. reassured Russia that the NMD would not affect their strategic nuclear forces and emphasized the importance of the ABM Treaty. However, Russia remained skeptical, fearing the U.S. could expand the system to intercept their forces and overstating the threat from rogue nations. President Putin warned that U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty would lead to Russian withdrawal from START II and other arms control agreements. Russian withdrawal from a wider range of arms control agreements, including the ABM Treaty, was a point of contention between the United States and Russia. The George W. Bush Administration viewed the ABM Treaty as a relic of the Cold War and sought to move beyond its limits to deploy robust missile defenses. Despite offering extensive briefings to demonstrate that the missile defense program would not threaten Russia, the Administration faced resistance from Russia in amending the Treaty. The Bush Administration announced the withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2001, citing interference with their missile defense program. Russia disagreed with setting aside the Treaty and proposed modifications, leading to a standoff. President Putin criticized the US decision as \"mistaken,\" and Russia responded by withdrawing from the START II Treaty. The George W. Bush Administration proposed deploying a third missile defense site in Europe to counter a potential Iranian threat, with interceptors in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic. Russia objected, fearing an arms race, but offered cooperation using a radar in Azerbaijan. Despite disagreements, President Bush insisted on the European sites. The Bush Administration proposed a missile defense site in Europe to counter an Iranian threat, facing objections from Russia. Despite ongoing discussions, Russia criticized the program and threatened to deploy missiles to Kaliningrad. Congress resisted funding for the system, requesting successful tests and agreements with Poland and Czech Republic. The Obama Administration later canceled the proposed system and announced a new plan. Defense Secretary Gates announced U.S. plans to develop and deploy a regional BMD capability that could be deployed around the world on short notice during crises. This new capability, based on current BMD sensors and interceptors, aims to address concerns over Iranian ballistic missile proliferation. The system, known as the \"Phased Adaptive Approach,\" will evolve to counter more sophisticated threats in the future. The United States and NATO allies are deploying components of this missile defense system, including ships armed with the Aegis missile defense system. The United States has deployed missile defense assets in Europe, including Aegis missile defense systems on ships in Spain and land-based systems in Romania and Poland. Russia objects to these deployments and links them to discussions on offensive weapons limits. The Trump Administration is conducting a new Missile Defense Review to guide future U.S. missile defense systems. The Missile Defense Review is likely to support the deployment of missile defenses in Europe and Asia to address regional threats from nations like North Korea and Iran. Plans may include deploying more robust sensors and interceptors to counter threats from other nations. President George W. Bush announced a reduction in strategic nuclear warheads during a summit with President Putin in 2001, with the U.S. committing to unilateral reductions without a formal agreement, while Russia emphasized the need for a reliable and verifiable arms control agreement. Russia and the United States had differing views on the type of agreement needed for nuclear forces reduction. Russia wanted a legally binding document for predictability and transparency, while the US preferred a less formal process. Secretary of State Powell supported a legally binding agreement to help President Putin's standing, despite objections from the Pentagon. The eventual outcome did not undermine US objectives in the negotiations. The United States and Russia signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty on May 24, 2002. The Treaty aimed to reduce strategic nuclear warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by December 31, 2012. It entered into force on June 1, 2003 but lapsed on February 5, 2011 when the New START Treaty took effect. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty aimed to reduce strategic nuclear warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by December 31, 2012. It did not define \"strategic nuclear warheads\" or impose limits on delivery vehicles. Monitoring and verification provisions were also not included in the Treaty. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty did not include monitoring or verification provisions, raising concerns about the adequacy of information collected compared to START I. Congress also questioned the absence of limits on nonstrategic nuclear weapons, which some believed posed a greater threat. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Powell agreed that addressing nonstrategic nuclear weapons should be a priority in future meetings. The United States and Russia discussed the disposition of nonstrategic nuclear weapons for future meetings but did not support a formal arms control regime. Analysts have called for reductions in these weapons. Discussions on arms control options began after START in 2006, but during the Bush Administration, they could not agree on a path forward. Russia wanted to replace START with a new Treaty to further reduce deployed forces, while the United States initially did not want to negotiate a new treaty. The Bush Administration was willing to extend some of START's monitoring provisions informally but agreed to conclude a new Treaty with monitoring provisions attached in 2008. The United States and Russia began talks on a new treaty during the Obama Administration, aiming to replace START by the end of 2009. Presidents Obama and Medvedev endorsed the agreement after their meeting in London. After meeting in London, Presidents Obama and Medvedev endorsed negotiations for a new treaty to replace START by the end of 2009. In Moscow, they signed a Joint Understanding for the treaty, which included numerical limits for strategic delivery vehicles and warheads. Despite negotiations in Geneva, a final agreement was not reached by the end of 2009. Formal talks resumed in late January 2010. The New START Treaty was concluded in early April 2010 after formal talks resumed in late January 2010. Presidents Obama and Medvedev signed the Treaty in Prague on April 8, 2010, and it entered into force on February 5, 2011. The treaty sets limits on U.S. and Russian strategic offensive nuclear forces, including restrictions on deployed launchers, heavy bombers, and warheads. The New START Treaty sets limits on U.S. and Russian strategic offensive nuclear forces, including restrictions on deployed warheads, ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. Deployed launchers must meet specific criteria to be considered as such. The New START Treaty sets limits on U.S. and Russian strategic offensive nuclear forces, including restrictions on deployed warheads, ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. Nondeployed launchers are used for testing or training, located at space launch facilities, or on submarines without deployed ICBMs or SLBMs. New START differs from the original START Treaty by having a single limit on the aggregate number of deployed warheads. The New START Treaty has a single limit on the aggregate number of deployed warheads, allowing each nation to mix their forces as desired. The calculation of warheads against treaty limits involves counting deployed launchers, assuming each launcher contains an operational missile with attributed warheads. This method is different from the previous START Treaty and aims to maintain flexibility in determining nuclear force structures. The New START Treaty allows the US and Russia to count deployed warheads and launchers without multiplying them. This counting method offers flexibility in reducing forces while meeting operational needs. The treaty includes a monitoring and verification regime similar to the previous START Treaty. The New START Treaty includes provisions for notifications, inspections, and data exchanges to verify compliance. The verification regime is less costly and complex than the previous START Treaty, focusing on transparency, cooperation, and deterring violations. The US and Russia rely on National Technical Means (NTM) for monitoring their strategic forces under New START. The New START Treaty includes provisions for data exchanges, notifications, and inspections to verify compliance. Parties exchange vast amounts of data about their forces, including distinguishing characteristics, locations, and warhead deployments. Inspections are conducted to confirm information in the database, with each party allowed up to 18 short-notice, on-site inspections per year. The New START Treaty allows for Type One and Type Two inspections, with each side conducting up to 10 Type One and 8 Type Two inspections. These inspections include data update and reentry vehicle inspections, totaling 18 short-notice inspections similar to those in the original START Treaty. Additionally, the treaty includes a provision on the interrelationship between strategic offensive and defensive arms. The New START Treaty includes provisions on the interrelationship between strategic offensive and defensive arms. Russia and the United States clarified their positions on missile defenses, with Russia warning of potential treaty withdrawal if US missile defense capabilities threaten its strategic nuclear forces, while the US stated its missile defense systems are not intended to affect the strategic balance with Russia. The United States missile defense systems are used to defend against limited missile launches and protect deployed forces, allies, and partners from regional threats. The Obama Administration officials emphasized that these statements do not impose obligations on the US or Russia, nor limit US missile defense programs. Russia may withdraw from the treaty if US missile defenses threaten its strategic nuclear forces, but the US is not obligated to consult with Russia on its defense plans. The New START treaty has been in force for eight years, with both the United States and Russia completing their required reductions. Russia has raised concerns about the US method of eliminating weapons, leading to uncertainty about US compliance. As of September 1, 2018, the US had 1,398 warheads on 659 deployed launchers, while Russia reported 1,420 warheads on 517 launchers meeting New START limits. Russia reported meeting New START limits with 1,420 warheads on 517 deployed launchers. The treaty is set to expire in 2021, but an extension could prolong it until 2026. President Putin proposed the extension, but the US has not announced its position yet. Administration officials are reviewing the possibility. General John Hyten noted the benefits of the treaty's limits on Russian forces and verification regime. Some argue for extending New START before addressing new Russian long-range nuclear delivery systems. Concerns arose in Congress in 1991 about control over Soviet weapons post-collapse. $400 million was authorized for assistance to republics inheriting Soviet nuclear assets. The Department of Defense (DOD) budget has been used to assist countries like Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus in transporting and dismantling Soviet nuclear and chemical weapons. Congress has allocated over $1 billion annually for nonproliferation programs. Funding for programs in the former Soviet Union has decreased while funding for programs in other countries has increased. The DOD's CTR program initially focused on assisting with the safe transportation, storage, and dismantlement of nuclear weapons. The focus of CTR funding has shifted towards securing and eliminating chemical and biological weapons, as well as preventing weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists. The United States has expanded its nonproliferation efforts to engage more nations in securing nuclear materials and other weapons of mass destruction. Assistance has been provided to former Soviet states for the elimination of nuclear weapons. The CTR program provided extensive assistance to Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan in removing warheads, deactivating missiles, and enhancing safety and security over nuclear weapons and materials. Projects also focused on improving security at storage facilities and constructing a chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuch'ye to help Russia comply with international obligations. The United States assisted Russia in destroying Soviet-era chemical weapons to prevent their loss or theft. Operations at the destruction facility began in March 2009, with over 3,321.5 metric tons of nerve agent eliminated by the end of 2012. Congress also allocated funds for biological weapons proliferation prevention in the late 1990s. The US provided CTR assistance to improve safety and security at Russia's biological weapons facilities. The United States provided CTR assistance to Russia in the late 1990s to improve safety and security at biological weapons sites and help employ scientists. Biological proliferation prevention programs in Russia ended in 2013, but the US expanded its global engagement to secure pathogen collections, train scientists, and enhance disease surveillance to counter the threat of biological weapon acquisition by state and non-state actors. The United States and Russia initially signed the Umbrella Agreement in 1992 to govern CTR projects, with a focus on biological weapons. The agreement expired in 2013 and was replaced by the MNEPR protocol. Russia's Ministry of Defense no longer participates in these programs, leading to the end of many CTR projects in Russia. However, the two countries will continue to cooperate on nuclear security, and the US will fund engagement programs globally. The Department of Energy plays a role in US threat reduction and nonproliferation efforts. The Department of Energy has contributed to U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to former Soviet states since the start of CTR. The United States and Russia have cooperated to secure and eliminate materials that could aid terrorists or rogue nations in acquiring nuclear capabilities. Russia stopped cooperating in DOE-funded programs in 2014. The U.S. assisted Russia in securing nuclear weapons and materials in the mid-1990s, focusing on safety at civilian research facilities through the MPC&A program. Upgrades were provided to over 50 facilities in the former Soviet Union to reduce security risks. The United States funded upgrades at nuclear weapons storage and research facilities in the former Soviet Union to enhance security and reduce the risk of material loss. This included installing modern security systems and providing training for Russian nuclear specialists. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) was announced in 2004 to secure and remove vulnerable nuclear materials worldwide to prevent terrorists from obtaining them. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) works to repatriate highly enriched uranium (HEU) from research reactors worldwide to prevent terrorists from obtaining nuclear material. The Department of Energy is reorganizing its nonproliferation programs to focus on Material Management and Minimization, and Global Material Security. In the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement (PMDA) signed in 2000 and amended in 2010, the US and Russia agreed to dispose of 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium. Russia showed little interest in permanent disposal, preferring to use it for civilian power. The US initially planned to convert its surplus plutonium to mixed oxide fuel (MOX) but later canceled the program due to escalating costs. The Trump Administration aims to cancel the MOX program and pursue a dilute and dispose method for surplus plutonium disposition. Despite Russia suspending its participation in the agreement, both countries are committed to keeping the 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium out of circulation. The International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) was established in Moscow to prevent scientists from Russia's nuclear weapons complex from sharing knowledge with other nations seeking nuclear weapons. The Russian government announced in August 2010 its withdrawal from the International Science and Technology Center (ISTC), but other member states reaffirmed their commitment. The State Department's Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance (EXBS) program helps nations improve their ability to interdict nuclear smuggling and stop illicit trafficking of materials for weapons of mass destruction. The program is expanding globally with projects in over 30 nations. The United States leads efforts to limit nuclear weapons spread through treaties, export control, and U.N. Security Council resolutions. The focus of U.S. nonproliferation policy in the past decade has been on Iran and North Korea, as well as preventing nuclear terrorism by controlling sensitive materials and technologies. Key issues for the 116th Congress include preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, addressing North Korea's nuclear program, U.S. civilian nuclear cooperation agreements, and tensions between India and Pakistan due to their nuclear weapons programs. Leveraging international nonproliferation regimes to prevent nuclear terrorism is also a consideration for Congress. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) is a key part of the nuclear nonproliferation regime, with 191 states parties. It is supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), national export control laws, and other initiatives. Five nations are recognized as nuclear weapon states, while India, Israel, Pakistan, and North Korea have significant nuclear capabilities. Leveraging international regimes is crucial for preventing nuclear terrorism. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Several countries like Argentina, Brazil, and South Africa gave up their nuclear weapons programs and joined the NPT in the 1990s. Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan also joined as non-nuclear weapon states. Only India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea are currently outside the treaty. Non-nuclear weapon states pledge not to acquire nuclear weapons in exchange for assistance from nuclear weapon states in peaceful nuclear energy uses. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Many countries have joined the NPT, while some remain outside the treaty. The P-5 Dialogue, led by the United States, works towards transparency and disarmament among nuclear weapon states. Concerns have shifted towards preventing further proliferation, including through black markets like the A. Q. Khan network. The International Atomic Energy Agency plays a key role in nuclear nonproliferation efforts. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957 to assist nations in their peaceful nuclear programs and safeguard nuclear materials. It has 171 member states as of February 2019. The IAEA safeguards system relies on data collection, review, and inspections at declared facilities to prevent diversion of nuclear materials for weapons use. Non-nuclear weapon NPT members must declare and submit all nuclear materials for regular IAEA inspections. Some states not party to the NPT, like India, Israel, and Pakistan, are IAEA members allowing inspections of some facilities. The IAEA provides technical assistance for peaceful nuclear applications in energy, medicine, agriculture, and research. Efforts were made to strengthen the IAEA's authority for more intrusive inspections after the discovery of Iraq's covert nuclear weapons program. In 1998, the IAEA adopted an \"Additional Protocol\" to enhance its authority and access. The IAEA adopted an \"Additional Protocol\" to enhance its authority and access for verifying nuclear declarations. The protocol enters into force for NPT states upon ratification. The United States ratified the protocol on March 31, 2004, and it entered into force on January 6, 2009. As of February 2019, 148 countries have signed an Additional Protocol. The IAEA has an expanded mission in nuclear security and may need to monitor more nuclear power plants. Congress may consider U.S. support for the IAEA. The Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration is studying international safeguards through its Next Generation Safeguards Initiative. The Next Generation Safeguards Initiative by the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration aims to enhance international safeguards and share U.S. expertise with the IAEA. Various regions have established nuclear-weapon-free zones, reinforcing non-nuclear-weapon state commitments under the NPT. Antarctica, the seabed, outer space, and the moon are also designated as areas where nuclear weapons are banned by international treaties. The NPT non-nuclear-weapon state members have protocols for nuclear weapon states to ratify, ensuring they will not base, test, or use nuclear weapons in the zone. The \"negative security assurance\" provided to non-nuclear weapon states is a key benefit of membership. The United States ratified protocols to Latin American NWFZ and submitted Protocols to Treaties of Pelindaba and Rarotonga for ratification in 2011. The United States signed protocols for the Treaties of Pelindaba and Rarotonga in 2011, along with other nuclear weapon states. The Obama Administration aimed to resolve issues related to protocols with Southeast Asian and Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones. Consultations with SEANWFZ countries are ongoing. The five nuclear-weapon states announced their signature of the CANWFZ Protocol in May 2014. The Obama Administration submitted the CANFWZ Protocol to the Senate for ratification in April 2015, stating it would not require changes in U.S. law. The U.S. recognized Mongolia as a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 2012. Talks have been held on establishing a Middle East WMD-free zone. The U.S. has been a leader in establishing export controls for nuclear nonproliferation. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) authorized controls on dual-use technology to prevent foreign weapons proliferation. Export controls require licenses for selling sensitive technology to foreign buyers and ban certain exports to some countries. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), founded in 1975, coordinates international nuclear controls among 48 nuclear exporters. NSG members agree to guidelines for exporting civilian nuclear material and related equipment to non-nuclear weapon states, ensuring proper use, security, and no unauthorized transfers. In September 2008, the NSG exempted India from full-scope safeguards but retained restrictions on enrichment and reprocessing equipment transfers. Additional guidelines were adopted in June 2011 for eligibility criteria on technology transfers. The NSG's effectiveness is limited due to its voluntary nature, allowing countries like Iraq and Pakistan to exploit weaknesses in export control systems. The CPPNM, established in 1987, sets international standards for nuclear trade and commerce, ensuring security requirements for nuclear material protection. The CPPNM, established in 1987, sets international standards for nuclear trade and commerce, ensuring security requirements for the protection of nuclear materials against terrorism. The treaty covers nuclear material in international transport and domestic use, storage, and transport, as well as the protection of nuclear material and facilities from sabotage. President George W. Bush submitted an amendment to the Senate in September 2007, which was approved in September 2008. The United States ratified the amendment to the CPPNM on July 31, 2015, after Congress approved implementing legislation. The amendment entered into force on May 8, 2016, following Nicaragua's ratification as the 102nd state. In the 112th Congress, the House passed implementing legislation, but the Senate did not take action. In the 113th and 114th Congress, the House passed legislation related to nuclear terrorism conventions, but the Senate did not take action. The U.N. General Assembly adopted the Nuclear Terrorism Convention in 2005 after years of debate. The draft treaty proposed by Russia in 1997 faced disputes over terrorism definition and nuclear weapons use by states. After September 11, 2001, necessary compromises were made, and the Convention entered into force in July 2007. The United States strongly supported the Convention, with President Bush being the second to sign it in 2005. Congress needed to approve implementing legislation before the U.S. could ratify the Convention. In the 112th Congress, the Obama Administration submitted draft legislation in April 2011. In the 114th Congress, implementing legislation for three conventions was incorporated into the USA Freedom Act of 2015, which became law on June 2, 2015. The United States ratified the Convention on September 30, 2015, defining offenses related to the unlawful possession and use of radioactive or nuclear materials. The Convention on Nuclear Terrorism commits parties to criminalize offenses related to radioactive materials and nuclear facilities. It focuses on individual actions, not state actions, and promotes cooperation to prevent nuclear terrorism. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty aims to ban all nuclear explosions but has not yet entered into force. Previous treaties have limited nuclear testing. The 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty and subsequent treaties limited nuclear testing. The CTBT aims to ban all nuclear explosions but has not entered into force. In 1997, President Clinton signed the CTBT, but the Senate rejected it in 1999. The treaty prohibits any nuclear weapon test explosions. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) establishes an organization to implement the treaty, overseeing monitoring stations and laboratories globally. The treaty requires 44 specified states to ratify it for it to enter into force, with 36 nations having ratified it so far. The CTBT has been signed by 183 nations, with 36 ratifying it. Some key nations like India, North Korea, and Pakistan have not signed, while others like China, Egypt, Iran, Israel, and the United States have not ratified it. The Bush Administration opposed U.S. ratification, but President Obama expressed support and aimed to secure ratification. Senator Hillary Clinton also supported the CTBT. Senator Hillary Clinton, as nominee for Secretary of State, emphasized the need for intensive briefing of Senators on key technical issues related to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Critics argued that nuclear testing is necessary for stockpile reliability and raised concerns about detection techniques for cheaters. The Obama Administration chose not to submit the treaty to the Senate for ratification before the end of its term. Ambassador Adam Scheinman acknowledged the challenges in securing U.S. ratification without a set timeframe. The Trump Administration does not plan to seek ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) but will continue to support the organization and monitoring systems. The United States has a long history of proposing a ban on fissile material production for nuclear weapons, as recognized by the NPT negotiators. The negotiations for a fissile material production ban have been stalled since 1993, with the CD agreeing to the \"Shannon Mandate\" in 1995. The Bush Administration supported the idea of a ban in 2004 but deemed it unverifiable. In 2006, they proposed a draft treaty without verification measures. The Obama Administration supported negotiating an FMCT with verification measures based on the Shannon mandate. The Trump Administration also expressed support for starting negotiations on an FMCT. One key issue is whether to include existing stocks of fissile material, which the United States opposes but some non-nuclear weapon states support. Negotiations at the CD are preferred to establish a global norm without conferring nuclear weapons status on certain countries. Negotiations for a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons have not started as of March 2019. Pakistan opposes the start of negotiations, arguing that the treaty should also require states to reduce their existing stocks of fissile material. A U.N. General Assembly resolution in 2012 established a group of experts to make recommendations on the treaty, which completed its work in 2015. Another resolution in 2016 requested the Secretary-General to take further action on the issue. The 2016 U.N. General Assembly resolution established a group to examine a report on a future treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. The group met in 2017 and 2018, presenting its final report in June 2018. In April 2004, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1540, requiring states to criminalize proliferation and secure sensitive materials. The U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540 requires states to enforce domestic controls over WMD and related materials, maintain border controls, and develop export controls. Several subsequent resolutions modified the original resolution, with the 2011 resolution extending the committee's mandate for 10 years. The Group of Experts has increased to nine members, focusing on implementing resolution 1540. The committee is identifying assistance projects for states in need of WMD controls. UNGA Resolution A/71/258 called for negotiations on a Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 2017, resulting in 122 countries approving the treaty. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons prohibits the development, possession, and use of nuclear weapons. It also requires states to provide assistance to individuals affected by nuclear weapons and environmental remediation. As of March 2019, the treaty had 22 states parties and 70 signatories. Supporters aim to establish an international norm against nuclear weapons possession and use. Critics are concerned about the implications of the ban treaty. Some critics of the nuclear weapons ban treaty fear it could undermine the NPT and its verification system. The US, UK, and France, among others, did not participate in negotiations and believe a ban without addressing security concerns won't eliminate nuclear weapons or enhance security. The Global Partnership (GP) Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction was formed by Russia (G-8) and other members of the G-7 and the European Union to raise up to $20 billion over 10 years for disarmament, nonproliferation, counterterrorism, and nuclear safety projects. The partnership expanded donors and recipients over the past decade, with the United States promising an additional $10 billion in funds subject to congressional appropriations. The Global Partnership (GP) was formed by Russia and other G-7 members to raise funds for nonproliferation efforts. Recent priorities include biological threat reduction and radiological security. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) was announced by President Bush in 2003 to interdict shipments of WMD-related materials. Russia has not participated in the G-8 or the Global Partnership since the 2013 invasion of Crimea. France holds the G-7 Presidency in 2019. The Bush Administration initiated the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) to create partnerships for countering the spread of WMD and missile technology. PSI involves states reviewing their legal authorities for interdiction, allowing boarding and searching of flag vessels, and signing ship-boarding agreements. Despite lacking a budget, formal offices, or a mechanism for measuring effectiveness, the initiative enables swift responses to evolving threats. The Obama Administration aims to institutionalize PSI, with 105 countries committed as of April 2018. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) involves 105 countries committed as of April 2018. Sixteen \"core\" nations have pledged cooperation in interdicting shipments of WMD materials. The United States has prioritized signing ship-boarding agreements with key states. Congress may find tracking PSI's progress challenging due to its lack of budget and formal organization. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) involves 105 countries committed as of April 2018, with 16 \"core\" nations cooperating to interdict shipments of WMD materials. Congress may find tracking PSI's progress challenging due to its lack of budget and formal organization. Intelligence resource issues, coordination with other federal programs, and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism are key areas of interest for Congress. The Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, endorsed by Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia, aims to prevent nuclear terrorism through information sharing and capacity building. 88 states have agreed to the Statement of Principles, which includes securing radioactive material, improving detection, and responding to terrorist attacks. The Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism aims to prevent nuclear terrorism by sharing best practices and improving national capabilities. Partner nations participate in exercises and workshops to enhance coordination and exchange knowledge. The Initiative follows legal guidance from international conventions and U.N. Security Council Resolutions. Funding for the Initiative is not included in the U.S. budget, raising questions about achieving its goals within existing constraints. Efforts like economic, military, and security assistance can help slow nuclear proliferation. Cooperative measures have been effective in some cases but failed in others. A mix of positive and negative incentives, including diplomacy, is seen as the best approach to control the spread of nuclear weapons. However, some policymakers argue that military measures may be necessary in states hostile to the United States or its allies. The Bush Administration justified the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq based on claims of possessing weapons of mass destruction. Accurate intelligence is crucial for diplomatic and military nonproliferation efforts. International arms control agreements like the CFE and Open Skies Treaty aim to enhance stability in Europe and control the spread of weapons technologies. Other agreements seek to ban entire classes of weapons. In late 1990, 22 members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact signed the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty to limit non-nuclear forces. The CFE treaty did not anticipate the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, leading to the signing of the \"Tashkent Agreement\" in May 1992 to allocate responsibility for Treaty-Limited Equipment among several nations. The CFE Adaptation Agreement was signed in 1999 to adjust to these changes. The CFE Adaptation Agreement was signed to adjust to the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the expansion of NATO. It has not entered into force pending ratification by NATO members, and Russia has suspended its participation in the CFE Treaty. CFE placed ceilings on military equipment to promote stability and prevent surprise attacks. The treaty also included detailed data exchanges, procedures for equipment destruction, and verification through on-site inspections, resulting in a significant reduction of conventional arms in Europe. The CFE treaty aimed to reduce conventional arms in Europe, with over 50,000 TLEs removed or destroyed. Russia failed to meet equipment reduction deadlines, citing national security concerns and economic hardship. The outbreak of armed conflicts in the Caucasus, particularly in Chechnya, further complicated compliance with treaty limits. The CFE parties negotiated a Flank Agreement in early 1996 to address national security concerns and economic hardship. The agreement adjusted equipment ceilings in certain administrative districts, enhanced reporting requirements, increased inspection rights, and imposed district ceilings on armored combat vehicles. The 1996 CFE Review Conference opened negotiations to modify the treaty due to the absence of the USSR and the Warsaw Pact, and NATO's expansion. Russia sought broader revisions to the treaty. Russia initially sought broader revisions to the CFE treaty, including maintaining alliance-wide equipment ceilings. However, the parties did not adopt Russia's position, and ultimately, Russia agreed to a largely NATO-drafted document. The agreement called for lower equipment levels in the \"Atlantic to the Urals\" area, enhanced verification procedures, and the replacement of bloc-to-bloc ceilings with national limits on all categories of TLEs. It also reaffirmed the Flank Agreement and stated NATO's commitment to not deploying nuclear weapons on new members' territory while improving their defensive capabilities through interoperability. Russia's focus has been on NATO enlargement and adapting the CFE treaty to address perceived threats. They have called for new NATO members, like the Baltic states, to join the CFE regime. Russia made commitments at the Istanbul Summit in 1999 to remove troops from Georgia and Transdniestra. NATO members considered Russian proposals but ultimately agreed on a largely NATO-drafted document for CFE adaptation. NATO members required Russian compliance with commitments for ratification of the CFE Adaptation Agreement. Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan were the only signatories to ratify the treaty. The State Department cited Russia for exceeding equipment limits, minor reporting violations, and failure to withdraw troops from Georgia and Moldova. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Ukraine were also cited for noncompliance, with Armenia and Azerbaijan not completing equipment reductions or declarations. Belarus was cited for questionable equipment. The State Department raised concerns about Russia's compliance with the CFE treaty, especially since Russia suspended its participation in the treaty in 2007. Russian President Putin announced a \"moratorium\" on compliance, citing NATO nations' failure to ratify the treaty. Russia will not allow CFE inspections or report on its military during the moratorium. Russia's CFE \"moratorium\" includes no inspections or reporting on military movements. The Istanbul Commitments on troop withdrawals in Georgia and Moldova are not legally binding and should not hinder NATO members' ratification of the CFE Adaptation Agreement. The Baltic States and Slovakia are not bound by the CFE, and Russia sees NATO's basing agreements with Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania as a threat to its national security. Failure to ratify the CFE Adaptation Agreement within a year may lead to Russia's withdrawal from the treaty. Russian officials view the CFE treaty as outdated and not reflective of the current European security environment. Russian military officials consulted with NATO on May 10, but there was no softening of the Russian position. A request for a special conference of CFE signatories in June was granted, but it failed to resolve any issues. European and U.S. governments were surprised by the harsh Russian statements and urged them to address concerns within the treaty framework. Eurasian Affairs reiterated the U.S. position on the CFE Adaptation Agreement, linking ratification to Russia's military withdrawal from Georgia and Moldova. President Putin suspended Russian compliance with CFE in December 2007, leading to NATO expressing regret and planning discussions on Russia's military posture. Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns criticized Russia's action as a \"mistake\" and urged negotiations within the CFE framework. Russian officials clarified that it was not a withdrawal from the treaty and expressed willingness to participate in further discussions. In recent years, Russia has shown reluctance to return to the CFE Treaty and prefers negotiating a new agreement reflecting the current security environment in Europe. Russia suspended its participation in the Joint Consultative Group of the CFE Treaty in 2015, hindering further dialogue. Despite indicating no plans for significant force redeployment in 2007, Russia's actions in Georgia in 2008 were seen as a violation of its obligations under the treaty. U.S. officials have criticized Russia for not complying with the CFE Treaty, suspending participation, and not allowing inspections or providing required data. Some view Russia's actions as a response to the U.S. missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic, while others see it as part of broader dissatisfaction with European security changes. In November 2011, the United States announced it would stop sharing data with Russia under the CFE Treaty due to Russia's refusal of inspections and lack of information sharing with other treaty parties since 2007. The U.S. remains committed to revitalizing conventional arms control in Europe and will inform Russia of any significant changes in its force posture voluntarily. The Open Skies proposal, originally suggested by President Eisenhower in 1955, was revived by President George H. W. Bush in 1989. The aim was to increase transparency in Europe post-Cold War to reduce military confrontation and build confidence. On March 24, 1992, the United States, Canada, and 22 European countries signed the Open Skies Treaty. The Open Skies Treaty was signed on March 24, 1992, by the United States, Canada, and 22 European nations. It entered into force on January 1, 2002, with 34 participating member states conducting over 1,000 observation flights. The treaty allows unarmed aircraft to fly over territories to promote openness and mutual understanding of military activities, serving as a confidence-building measure. The Open Skies Treaty allows nations to conduct overflights with unarmed aircraft to collect information on military activities of other parties, promoting openness and mutual understanding. It helps in observing and monitoring military forces, such as Russian forces near Ukraine, and can provide early signs of military build-ups or assurances of peaceful intentions. Parties agree to make their territories accessible to overflights, with restrictions in certain areas for safety reasons. The Open Skies Treaty allows nations to conduct overflights with unarmed aircraft to collect information on military activities. Nations can share costs, use different sensors, and have quotas for overflights. The United States has a quota of 42 observation flights per year, and various sensors can be used during the flights. The Open Skies Treaty permits nations to conduct observation flights using approved equipment like infrared cameras and synthetic aperture radars. The sensors provide basic information on military forces but not detailed technical intelligence. Each flight generates data for both the observing and observed nations, which can be shared with other treaty parties. Nations are responsible for analyzing their own data, and the list of permitted sensors is periodically reviewed as technology advances. The Open Skies Treaty allows nations to conduct observation flights using approved sensors. Russia has requested to use digital cameras on flights over the United States, which are permitted by the treaty. However, concerns have been raised by some U.S. officials about the data quality that Russia may collect with these cameras. The Open Skies Treaty allows nations to conduct observation flights using approved sensors. Russia has requested to use digital cameras on flights over the United States, which are permitted by the treaty. Concerns have been raised about the data quality that Russia may collect with these cameras, as it could help fill gaps in its satellite surveillance capabilities. The parties conduct approximately 100 observation flights each year, with the United States receiving 4-9 observation flights from Russia and conducting 14-16 flights over Russia annually. The United States also uses its open skies aircraft for monitoring natural disasters and conducting flights over Ukraine to monitor Russian military forces. Concerns have been raised about Russia's compliance with the treaty in recent years. The U.S. State Department raised concerns about Russia's compliance with the Open Skies Treaty, citing refusals of access for observation flights over certain regions and limited flight clearances. In response, the U.S. restricted Russian flights over its territory and blocked approval for new cameras on Russian aircraft. The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) was established in 1987 by the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom to slow the proliferation of ballistic and cruise missiles, rockets, and UAVs capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. Participants adhere to common export policy guidelines for controlled items listed in an annex, exchanging information on export licensing issues. The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) aims to restrict the proliferation of ballistic and cruise missiles by major producers. It lacks the ability to verify compliance or penalize violators but has been credited with slowing missile development in various countries. Partner countries have tightened export controls, but the MTCR does not regulate countries' missile production and cannot prevent nonpartners from exporting missiles and technology. The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) aims to restrict missile proliferation by major producers. Challenges include difficulty in restraining exports of missile technology, potential limitations in the MTCR's effectiveness, and discussions on adopting a \"demand side\" approach. The number of MTCR partners has grown from 7 to 35 since 1987, with India joining in 2016. Several nonpartners have also committed to restricting missile transfers according to the MTCR. Membership is decided by consensus. The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) restricts missile proliferation by major producers. Membership is decided by consensus, with new requests supported by the US if countries agree not to develop missiles exceeding MTCR guidelines. Guidelines call for restraint in transfers of technology that could aid in building missiles capable of delivering a 500kg warhead over 300km. The MTCR guidelines restrict missile proliferation by major producers, with a 500kg weight threshold to limit transfers of missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. Category I items, such as complete rocket systems, have a strong presumption to deny transfers, while Category II items allow for greater flexibility in exports. Regime partners periodically update the MTCR guidelines and annex. The Hague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (HCOC) was established on November 25, 2002, as a framework for cooperation to address missile proliferation, focusing on possession of ballistic missiles. It complements the MTCR guidelines which restrict missile proliferation by major producers. Category I items have a strong presumption to deny transfers, while Category II items allow for greater flexibility in exports. The Hague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (HCOC) was established in 2002 to prevent the spread of ballistic missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. Subscribing states agree to exercise restraint in developing, testing, and deploying such missiles, and not to assist countries suspected of developing WMD. Additionally, they commit to vigilance in monitoring space-launch programs that could be used as covers for ballistic missile development. The Hague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (HCOC) requires subscribing states to implement transparency measures for their missile and space launch programs. This includes producing annual declarations outlining their policies and providing information on the number and class of missiles launched. States must also exchange pre-launch notifications for ballistic missile and space launch vehicle launches and test flights. Austria serves as the Immediate Central Contact and Executive Secretariat for the HCOC, receiving notifications from signatories like the United States and Russia. The Wassenaar Arrangement replaces CoCom and aims to prevent the acquisition of armaments and sensitive items for military use. It promotes transparency and responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods. The Wassenaar Arrangement promotes transparency and responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods. Member decisions are made by consensus, with each national government regulating its own exports. Unlike CoCom, there is no mechanism to punish a state for violating guidelines. Eligibility for membership is based on adherence to control lists and effective export controls. The Wassenaar Arrangement requires participating states to adhere to export controls and report all transfers of sensitive goods. This includes items on a Munitions List and a List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies. States must report transfers, licenses issued, denials of licenses, and any undercutting practices. The Wassenaar Arrangement requires participating states to adhere to export controls and report all transfers of sensitive goods, including items on a Munitions List and a List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies. Participants share information on potential threats and dangerous acquisition trends, review national control policies, and develop guidelines. The Chemical Weapons Convention bans chemical weapons and controls their production and transfer. The Chemical Weapons Convention, established in 1993 and enforced in 1997, aims to control the production and international transfer of chemical weapons. As of November 2015, 192 nations were party to the treaty, with Israel signing but not ratifying it. Egypt, North Korea, and South Sudan have not signed the convention. States-parties provide declarations to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) detailing their chemical weapons-related activities, which are then inspected and monitored by the OPCW. The U.S. Senate debated and ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997 after four years of hearings. Congress passed implementing legislation in 1998, outlining procedures for inspections by the OPCW. Parties agreed to cease chemical weapons production, declare stockpiles, and destroy weapons within 10 years. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) requires signatories to cease production of chemical weapons, declare and destroy their stockpiles and weapons within 10 years. The convention also mandates the destruction of all chemical weapons production facilities within the same timeframe, with the possibility of conversion to peaceful purposes in exceptional cases. The CWC includes a verification regime with different obligations for various types of chemical facilities, categorized into three schedules based on their relevance to weapons production and peaceful uses. Inspections by the OPCW can be systematic, periodic, or random, with the option for challenge inspections at suspected violator facilities conducted on short notice. The OPCW conducts inspections on short notice, with nations negotiating access to facilities. Member-states have inactivated declared chemical weapons production facilities, with 96% of agent stockpiles destroyed by March 13, 2018. Six countries declared possession of chemical weapons, but only Albania, South Korea, and India have destroyed their stocks. Libya, Russia, Syria, Iraq, and the United States also declared possession of such weapons. Libya joined the CWC in January 2004 and declared nearly 25 metric tonnes of sulfur mustard agent, aerial munitions, and production facilities. They were given deadlines to destroy their chemical weapons, with progress reported on destruction. Some weapons, including undeclared mustard gas stocks, remained after the 2011 revolution. Libya joined the CWC in January 2004 and declared nearly 25 metric tonnes of sulfur mustard agent, aerial munitions, and production facilities. Some chemical weapons, including mustard gas stocks, remained after the 2011 revolution. Libya completed the destruction of its stock of bulk mustard agent in 2013 and announced in January 2014 the destruction of CW-filled munitions. They were to destroy precursor chemicals by the end of 2016 but requested international assistance due to delays. Libya requested international assistance for destroying its remaining chemical weapons stockpile. The OPCW Director-General was tasked with evaluating options for destruction, including removal from Libya. In August 2016, Denmark led an operation to remove precursor chemicals to Germany for destruction, with support from several countries. Italy, Malta, Spain, UK, and the US provided assistance for Libya's chemical weapons destruction. Syria joined the CWC in 2013 after US threat of military action. UN Resolution 2118 mandated Syria to declare and destroy its chemical weapons under OPCW supervision. Syria had over 1,000 metric tons of chemical agents at the start of its civil war. The U.N. and OPCW oversaw the removal and destruction of chemical weapons agents from Syria, including sarin, mustard agent, and VX. Destruction of chemical weapons facilities is ongoing, with concerns about Syria's full declaration of its chemical weapons stocks. The OPCW's Declaration Assessment Team is investigating these issues. The U.S. State Department's 2018 report states that Syria has not complied with the Chemical Weapons Convention, has been using chemical weapons for years, and has not declared all elements of its chemical weapons. Syria has not declared all elements of its chemical weapons program and has retained some chemical weapons. The Syrian government denies using chemical weapons, while the U.S., France, and the U.K. believe Syria is complicit in ongoing chemical attacks. Expert teams have found evidence of chemical weapons use in some cases. Russia did not meet the 2012 deadline to destroy its chemical weapons stockpiles but planned to do so by December 31, 2020. In September 2017, the OPCW confirmed that Russia had destroyed its declared chemical weapons stockpile. The United States and other countries provided financial assistance for this destruction under the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. The State Department could not certify Russia's compliance in annual reports to Congress. The State Department could not certify Russia's compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) due to incomplete declarations. The United States also declared Russia in non-compliance after a nerve agent attack in the UK. The US faced challenges in destroying its Category One chemical weapons stockpile and missed the 2007 deadline. A request was made to extend the deadline to April 29, 2012. The United States faced challenges in destroying its chemical weapons stockpile, leading to missed deadlines and requests for extensions. Delays were attributed to meeting environmental requirements and addressing concerns from local and congressional levels. The deadline was extended multiple times, with the latest deadline set for December 31, 2023. The OPCW reported in April 2018 that 90.5% of the U.S. Category One stockpile had been destroyed. The remaining stockpiles in Colorado and Kentucky are projected to be destroyed by November 2019 and September 2023, respectively. Iraq used chemical weapons in the past, leading to U.N. resolutions requiring the declaration and destruction of weapons programs. Resolution 687 required Iraq to destroy all chemical and biological weapons under international supervision. Iraq's compliance was monitored by the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM). Iraq's chemical weapons were either used during the Iran-Iraq war, destroyed under UNSCOM supervision, secretly destroyed outside UNSCOM supervision, or destroyed by coalition forces during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Iraq's legacy chemical weapons from the Persian Gulf War were identified, declared, and destroyed under international supervision. These weapons were contained in sealed bunkers at an old Iraqi facility and rendered unusable by UN inspection teams. Iraq acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2009 and collaborated with the OPCW and other countries to dispose of the remaining weapons. Iraq, with the help of OCPW and other countries, struggled to fulfill its obligations to destroy chemical weapons due to security concerns. However, in 2017, Iraq began destroying the weapons, and by February 2018, all former chemical weapons production facilities in Iraq were completely destroyed. In 2018, Iraq completed destroying its chemical weapons remnants. The al-Muthanna chemical weapons facility was invaded by ISIL in 2014, but Iraqi armed forces regained control in 2014. Despite this, ISIL has used chemical weapons in Iraq, including mustard agent attacks confirmed by the OPCW. The OPCW confirmed the use of sulfur mustard in an attack in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq in 2016. The Nixon Administration renounced U.S. biological weapons in 1969, leading to the signing of the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972. The BWC bans the development of biological weapons. The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) was signed in 1972 and entered into force in 1975. It prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and transfer of biological weapons, agents, and toxins. States-parties are required to destroy relevant materials and only defensive research is allowed. Unlike the Chemical Weapons Convention, the BWC does not specify particular biological agents but defines them broadly. The Fifth Review Conference of the BWC in November 2001 ended in disarray as parties could not agree on an adaptive protocol to enhance enforcement. The United States rejected the 200-page protocol after seven years of negotiations, citing security concerns. This led to widespread international criticism. The United States faced international criticism for jeopardizing biological arms control at the 2001 Review Conference. Proposals included criminalizing BWC violations, UN investigation of disease outbreaks, and improved security over research on pathogens. The conference adjourned without a compromise, and the US continued to oppose verification negotiations. The 2002 Review Conference endorsed a minimal program proposed by the chairman, focusing on annual meetings to strengthen national laws and address BW attacks. The 2006 BWC Review Conference failed to agree on guidelines for national implementation due to US-nonaligned nations differences on technology transfer. Enhanced verification and enforcement provisions were not considered due to assumed US opposition. Annual meetings were established for discussion on BWC provisions before the 2011 Review Conference. The United States did not support revival of negotiations on a BWC verification protocol, citing concerns about the difficulty of detecting violations in biological research advancements. The Obama Administration believed a legally binding protocol would not achieve meaningful verification or enhance security. The United States opposes a BWC verification protocol due to concerns about detecting violations in biological research advancements. Instead, they advocate for promoting confidence in BWC compliance through transparency and compliance diplomacy. Tauscher urged states-parties to increase transparency, improve confidence-building measures, and engage in robust compliance discussions. She proposed measures such as enhancing participation in confidence-building measures and cooperation in pathogen security and disease surveillance. The 7th Review Conference took place from December 5 to 22, 2011. The 7th Review Conference in December 2011 decided to continue the intersessional process with changes, focusing on cooperation, scientific developments, and national implementation. States-parties discussed participation in confidence-building measures and implementing Article VII. After the 2016 review conference, states-parties were to meet annually to make progress on substantive issues before the next Review Conference. The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) is a multilateral treaty aimed at establishing international standards for regulating the trade in conventional arms and preventing illicit trade. The concept gained momentum in 2004 with a speech by the UK Foreign Secretary. An intersessional process was established during the 7th Review Conference in 2011, with annual expert group meetings. The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) was negotiated in the U.N. General Assembly and specialized fora, approved in April 2013, opened for signature in June 2013, and entered into force in December 2014. The United States participated in drafting and voting for the treaty but has not ratified it. The ATT regulates international arms trade, requiring states parties to establish national control systems. The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) regulates international arms trade by requiring states parties to establish national control systems to review, authorize, and document the import, export, brokerage, transit, and transshipment of conventional weapons. States parties must report on their treaty-specified transfers annually to the Secretariat. The treaty covers various weapons including battle tanks, combat aircraft, warships, missiles, and small arms. States parties must conduct preexport reviews considering factors like international security, terrorism, and human rights before approving transfers. The Arms Trade Treaty prohibits transfers that violate UN Security Council Resolutions, especially arms embargoes, and those that could be used in genocide or other war crimes. Parties must prevent illegal diversion of arms and cooperate to mitigate diversion risks. The Arms Trade Treaty encourages states parties to cooperate in preventing diversion of arms and exchanging relevant information. The treaty's Secretariat will have a minimized structure to facilitate cooperation and assist in implementing the treaty. The Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) addresses antipersonnel landmines (APL) and includes rules for marking, registering, and removing minefields. The United States signed the CCW in 1982 and ratified it in 1995. In 1992, Congress established a moratorium on U.S. exports of APL. In 1992, Congress established a one-year moratorium on U.S. exports of APL, which was extended for 15 more years. H.R. 948 in the 107th Congress aimed to make the ban permanent but was not voted on. Many nations followed the U.S. example and imposed their own moratoria. President Clinton announced a policy in 1996 to discontinue U.S. use of \"dumb\" APL, except in the DMZ of Korea, and supported negotiation of a worldwide ban on APL in the United Nations. President Clinton's initiative aimed to replace all landmines by 2003, except in Korea, with \"smart\" mines that self-neutralize. The U.S. introduced a resolution to the U.N. for an international ban on APL, with some countries already complying. The Ottawa Treaty, also known as the Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-personnel Mines, was signed by over 100 nations in 1997 and came into force on March 1, 1999. The Clinton Administration participated in the treaty process but did not sign it due to certain exceptions they were unable to secure. The United States declined to sign the Ottawa Treaty due to exceptions they wanted, including the use of APL in defense of South Korea until 2006. President Clinton suggested signing in 2006 if effective alternatives to APL were available. As of April 8, 2016, 162 countries had become states-parties to the treaty, with some missing stockpile destruction deadlines. Turkey completed destroying its APL in June 2011, and Poland must also destroy APL stockpiles. States parties are required to clear APL within 10 years of becoming parties. The Ottawa Treaty requires states parties to destroy APL stockpiles within 10 years of becoming party to the convention. Thirty-one states-parties have not yet met their clearance obligations. The Convention allows for allegations of noncompliance to be submitted to the U.N. Secretary-General. The United States announced in 2004 that they would no longer use persistent landmines after 2010, opting for self-destruct and self-deactivating landmines instead. The United States announced in 2004 that they would no longer use persistent landmines after 2010, opting for self-destruct and self-deactivating landmines instead. The policy did not include a date to join the Ottawa Treaty, and U.S. forces will use nonpersistent mines if needed. The Obama Administration reviewed U.S. policy regarding landmines, and on June 27, 2014, the United States announced that it \"will not produce or otherwise acquire any anti-personnel landmines in the future.\" The United States announced in 2004 that they would no longer use persistent landmines after 2010, opting for self-destruct and self-deactivating landmines instead. The Obama Administration reviewed U.S. policy regarding landmines, and on June 27, 2014, the United States announced that it \"will not produce or otherwise acquire any anti-personnel landmines in the future,\" including for the purpose of replacing expiring stockpiles. Moreover, the United States is aligning its \"APL policy outside the Korean Peninsula with the key requirements of the Ottawa Convention.\" The U.S. will not use APL outside the Korean Peninsula, assist, encourage, or induce anyone outside the Korean Peninsula to engage in prohibited activity, and will destroy APL stockpiles not required for the defense of the Republic of Korea. The United States is pursuing solutions compliant with the Ottawa Convention while ensuring alliance commitments to South Korea. There is no current review of U.S. policy on landmines, except for the Korean Peninsula. Cluster munitions are valued militarily for their ability to dispense smaller submunitions into an area. Cluster munitions are valued militarily for their ability to kill or destroy multiple targets with fewer weapons. Critics argue that they are imprecise, fail to detonate, and pose risks to civilians. Negotiations led by Norway resulted in an agreement to ban cluster munitions in 2008, with some countries like the United States, Russia, China, Israel, and Egypt not participating. The Convention on Cluster Munitions was signed by 94 states during the Signing Conference in Oslo in 2008. The agreement entered into force on August 1, 2010, banning the use, development, production, acquisition, transfer, and stockpiling of cluster munitions. Notable countries like the United States, Russia, China, Israel, and Egypt did not participate in the talks or sign the agreement. The curr_chunk discusses various arms control treaties and agreements, including the Geneva Protocol banning poison gas and bacteriological weapons, the Antarctic Treaty demilitarizing Antarctica, the Hot Line Agreement establishing secure communications between Washington and Moscow, and the Limited Test Ban Treaty banning nuclear weapons tests in certain environments. The curr_chunk discusses arms control treaties such as the Outer Space Treaty, Treaty of Tlatelolco, Non-Proliferation Treaty, Seabed Arms Control Treaty, and Accident Measures Agreement. These treaties aim to prevent nuclear weapons testing and proliferation in various environments. In 1971 and 1972, various arms control measures were implemented to reduce the risk of nuclear exchange, biological warfare, incidents at sea, and limitations on strategic offensive nuclear weapons and anti-ballistic missile systems. In 1971 and 1972, arms control measures were implemented to reduce the risk of nuclear exchange, biological warfare, incidents at sea, and limitations on strategic offensive nuclear weapons and anti-ballistic missile systems. The agreements included the ABM Treaty limiting interceptor missiles and radars, the Prevention of Nuclear War Agreement promoting international cooperation, the Threshold Test Ban Treaty prohibiting nuclear tests over 150 kilotons, the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty extending the limit, and the Helsinki Final Act outlining notifications. The Helsinki Final Act of 1975 outlines notifications and confidence-building measures for military activities in Europe. The Convention on the Prohibition of Military Use of Environmental Modification Techniques in 1978 bans hostile environmental modification techniques. The SALT II Treaty of 1979 places limits on U.S. and Soviet strategic nuclear weapons. The Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) was concluded in 1980 and entered into force in 1993. Protocol II, established in 1993, includes rules for marking, registering, and removing minefields to reduce casualties from antipersonnel landmines. Protocol IV prohibits laser weapons causing blindness. The Stockholm Document of 1986 expands on notifications and confidence-building measures, while the Treaty of Rarotonga in the same year creates a Nuclear Weapons Free Zone in the South Pacific. The United States signed the Protocols in 1996 but has not ratified them yet. The Agreement on the Establishment of Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers in 1987 sets up communication centers in Washington and Moscow to enhance communication. In 1987, communications centers were established in Washington and Moscow to improve links between the U.S. and Soviet Union. The Treaty of 1987 banned ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 300 and 3,400 miles. The U.S. announced withdrawal from the treaty in 2019. Additionally, agreements in 1988 and 1989 focused on notifications of missile launches and prevention of dangerous military activities between the two countries. The U.S.-U.S.S.R. Chemical Weapons Destruction Agreement in 1990 mandated the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles. The Vienna Document of the Negotiations on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures in 1990 expands on measures from the 1986 Stockholm Document. The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty) in 1990 limits and reduces certain types of conventional armaments. The Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START) in 1991 limits and reduces strategic offensive nuclear weapons. The Vienna Document in 1992 further expands on measures from the 1990 Vienna Document. The Treaty on Open Skies in 1992 allows overflights by unarmed observation aircraft. The Treaty on Open Skies, 1992 allows overflights by unarmed observation aircraft to increase transparency of military activities. The Agreement Concerning Safe and Secure Transportation, Storage, and Destruction of Weapons, 1992 provides for U.S. assistance to Russia for the safe disposal of weapons. The Agreement with Belarus, 1992, offers U.S. aid in eliminating nuclear weapons and responding to nuclear emergencies. The START II Treaty, 1993, aimed to further reduce U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear weapons. The Treaty on Open Skies, 1992 allows overflights by unarmed observation aircraft to increase transparency of military activities. The Agreement Concerning Safe and Secure Transportation, Storage, and Destruction of Weapons, 1992 provides for U.S. assistance to Russia for the safe disposal of weapons. The Agreement with Belarus, 1992, offers U.S. aid in eliminating nuclear weapons and responding to nuclear emergencies. The START II Treaty, 1993, aimed to further reduce U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear weapons. The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction bans chemical weapons and requires elimination of their production facilities. The Agreement Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium Resulting from the Dismantlement of Nuclear Weapons in Russia, 1993 provides for U.S. purchase of highly enriched uranium removed from Russian nuclear weapons for use in commercial nuclear reactors. The Agreement Between the United States and Ukraine, Republic of Kazakhstan, and Trilateral Statement involved U.S. assistance in eliminating nuclear weapons and implementing provisions of START I. Ukraine agreed to transfer nuclear warheads to Russia for security assurances. The United States and Ukraine agreed to transfer nuclear warheads to Russia in exchange for security assurances and financial compensation, including fuel for Ukraine's nuclear reactors. Various international treaties such as the Treaty of Pelindaba, Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and Ottawa Treaty were mentioned, with the U.S. Senate voting against ratification of the CTBT in 1999. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (Moscow Treaty) of 2002 obligated the US and Russia to reduce strategic nuclear forces to 1,700-2,200 warheads without defining specific weapons or monitoring provisions. The New START Treaty of 2010 further reduced forces to 1,550 warheads on up to 700 deployed delivery vehicles within 7 years. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 2017 obligates parties to never possess nuclear weapons. The Treaty On the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, 2017, obligates parties to never possess nuclear weapons. The United States has not signed this treaty and does not support its entry into force. The U.S. Treaty Ratification Process involves the President seeking advice and consent from the Senate for treaty ratification. The U.S. Treaty Ratification Process involves the President seeking advice and consent from the Senate for ratification. Congress outlined the relationship between arms control agreements and the treaty ratification process in the Arms Control and Disarmament Act. Most U.S. arms control agreements are submitted as treaties for international agreements. Some arms control agreements are submitted as treaties for approval by the Senate, as outlined in the Arms Control and Disarmament Act. The Senate expects significant arms control obligations to be made only through treaties, but some agreements have been made through executive agreements without congressional approval. The executive branch in the United States has entered into various agreements without congressional approval, including the Hot Line Agreement, the Agreement on Prevention of Nuclear War, and arms control agreements like the SALT I Interim Agreement. Some agreements were considered \"politically binding\" but not \"legally binding,\" such as those from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Senate approval is typically required for treaties, but some arms control agreements have been made through executive agreements. After a treaty is signed, parties decide whether to ratify it, with the US Senate considering the treaty and providing advice and consent for ratification. Senate consideration is governed by Senate Rule XXX, amended in 1986 to simplify the process. The process of ratifying a treaty in the US Senate is governed by Senate Rule XXX, which was amended in 1986 for simplification. The treaty is read, secrecy is removed, and it is referred to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. If the committee objects or believes the treaty won't pass, it may not report it, leaving it pending indefinitely. After committee consideration, the treaty must lie over for one day before Senate consideration. The Senate considers the treaty after a motion to go into executive session. Amendments to the treaty may be proposed, and the resolution of ratification can be amended with reservations or conditions. Final approval requires a two-thirds majority vote. After the Senate approves a treaty with a two-thirds majority vote, it is returned to the President for ratification. The President signs an instrument of ratification, including any Senate conditions requiring approval by the other party. The treaty then enters into force through the exchange of instruments of ratification for bilateral treaties or the deposit of specified ratifications for multilateral treaties. A proclamation is signed by the President to publicize the treaty domestically as in force and the law of the land. The Senate may stipulate various conditions on its approval of a treaty, including amendments, reservations, understandings, and declarations. The President can resubmit the treaty to the Senate for further consideration if objections arise. A treaty can be formally amended through an additional treaty known as a protocol. An example is the ABM Protocol signed in 1974, which limited the US and Soviet Union to one ABM site each. Reservations can change the obligations of parties in a treaty, such as President Nixon's request for a reservation to the Geneva Protocol on poison gases. The INF treaty included a condition requiring the President to obtain Soviet consent for a U.S.-Soviet agreement to have the same effect as the treaty provisions. This condition was referred to as a Category III condition by the sponsors. In 1980, the Senate added five understandings to the agreement with the IAEA for the Application of Safeguards in the United States, focusing on implementation within the country. The INF treaty resolution included a condition requiring a presidential certification on ground-launched ballistic missiles. Senator Robert Dole emphasized that this condition did not demand more from the Soviets but required action from the U.S. President. Declarations and statements related to treaties often focus on internal procedures of the United States to ensure Congressional participation in policy decisions. The resolution of ratification for the Threshold Test Ban Treaty in 1990 included declarations on safeguards for maintaining a viable deterrent. In 1963, the Senate attached a preamble to the limited nuclear test ban treaty resolution, emphasizing the constitutional process for treaty amendments. Conditions set by the Senate may alter international obligations, leading to further negotiations or treaty abandonment. During the consideration of the SALT II Treaty, the importance of specified safeguards in national security programs was highlighted. During the consideration of the SALT II Treaty, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee categorized conditions into three groups to clarify their legal effect. The Senate typically approves treaties without attaching conditions, but in the case of the START Treaty, some conditions were explicitly communicated to other parties. Ten arms control treaties were adopted without conditions, including the Antarctic, Outer Space, and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaties. The Senate may include significant understandings in its report on treaties, even if formal conditions are not placed in the resolution of ratification. These statements become part of legislative history but are not formally transmitted to other parties. For example, when considering the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963, the Senate required a written assurance from President Kennedy on certain issues. In reporting the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the committee clarified that its support did not imply approval of security assurances. The Senate clarified that its support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty did not mean approval of security assurances given by a U.N. Security Council resolution and declarations by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, which were considered \"solely executive measures.\""
