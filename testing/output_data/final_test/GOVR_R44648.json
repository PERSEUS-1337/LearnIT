    "content": "Presidential succession in the United States is governed by the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which states that the Vice President becomes President if the incumbent chief executive dies, resigns, or is removed from office. The new President nominates a successor Vice President, who must be confirmed by both houses of Congress. If there is no President or Vice President, the Speaker of the House, President pro tempore of the Senate, and Cabinet officers can act as President. These rules apply at all times, but additional factors come into play during presidential election years. During the presidential general election campaign and transition period, succession issues arise for presidential and vice presidential nominees, as well as the President- and Vice President-elect. This is especially complex when an incumbent President is leaving office and the incoming President-elect is preparing for inauguration. The period before the inauguration of a President's second consecutive term is not considered a transition period. The transition period after the presidential election campaign starts immediately after the general election and extends through January 20 of the following year. The winning candidates are known during this period, and they are considered the President- and Vice President-elect. The transition period after the presidential election campaign begins immediately after the general election. The winning candidates are considered the President- and Vice President-elect. The second phase of the transition starts when electors cast their votes and the electoral vote is announced. Candidates who receive a majority of electoral votes become the President- and Vice President-elect. Presidential transitions in the past half-century have been characterized by high activity levels and improvisation as the incoming administration finalizes personnel and policy arrangements within a 10-week period. The transition period after the presidential election campaign begins immediately after the general election. The winning candidates are considered the President- and Vice President-elect. Succession and disability procedures concerning the President-elect and Vice President-elect provide a potential complicating factor during the election period and the transition. Depending on circumstances, Congress could be called on to make succession-related decisions of national importance in questions of the death, disability, or resignation of a President- or Vice President-elect. During the presidential election campaign, vacancies in a major national party ticket are covered by party rules. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have procedures for filling vacancies on the presidential ticket, with the DNC and Republican National Committee responsible for nominating successor candidates. The Rules of the Republican Party allow for vacancies on the presidential ticket to be filled by the Republican National Committee (RNC) or by reconvening the national convention. Voting in the RNC is done by state, with a majority vote needed to nominate a successor candidate. In 1972, the Democratic vice presidential nominee resigned, and a successor was nominated by the Democratic National Committee. In 1912, Vice President James S. Sherman died just days before the election. Columbia University President Nicholas M. Butler was nominated to replace him by the Republican National Committee. Butler's appointment had no impact on the election outcome as Woodrow Wilson won with a large electoral college majority. After the election in 1912, Woodrow Wilson won a large electoral college majority of 435 votes to 88 for Roosevelt and eight for Taft. Presidential transitions begin immediately after election day, with winning candidates considered informal President and Vice President-elect until electoral votes are cast. The titles \"President-elect\" and \"Vice President-elect\" are courtesy titles anticipating the candidates' ultimate status. If a vacancy occurs during this period, parties would follow established rules. In the event of a presidential nominee's death, confusion and controversy may arise among electors, potentially leading to a breakdown of party discipline and fragmentation of the electoral vote. Individual electors might argue they are free agents and able to vote for any candidate. The balance of opinion among scholars is that presidential electors are free agents, able to vote as they please, despite pledges or commitments. Party national committees may appoint replacements, but cannot guarantee all electors will follow instructions, especially in a closely contested election. Historical record shows only one instance of a presidential candidate dying before the meeting of electors. Horace Greeley, the nominee of the Democratic and Liberal Republican Parties, died before the electors' meeting, with some electors voting for other candidates. Despite questions about the validity of Greeley's electoral votes, Ulysses S. Grant won the election with 286 electoral votes. The succession process after the presidential election revolves around when the candidates become President-elect and Vice President-elect. Presidential electors meet in December to cast their votes, with Congress counting the electoral votes in January. The question arises whether the candidates are officially elected after the electoral college results are declared by Congress on January 6. Some commentators doubt if there would be a President- and Vice President-elect before the results are certified. The balance of scholarly opinion holds that winning candidates immediately become the President- and Vice President-elect once a majority of electoral votes has been cast. Section 3 of the 20th Amendment would apply if the President-elect dies, making the Vice President-elect the President-elect. This view is supported by the language of the 1932 House committee report accompanying the 20th Amendment. The report addresses the issue of when a President-elect is determined, stating that the term refers to the person who receives the majority of electoral votes or is chosen by the House of Representatives. The 20th Amendment does not specifically cover vacancies due to reasons like disability or resignation. Congress is authorized to provide for situations where neither a President-elect nor Vice President-elect qualifies. The 20th Amendment covers succession in the case of the death of the President-elect, where the Vice President-elect would take over. However, it does not address other scenarios like resignation or disability. If a President-elect fails to qualify, the amendment's language may come into play. The 20th Amendment addresses succession in the event of the death of the President-elect, with the Vice President-elect taking over. However, it does not cover scenarios like resignation or disability. If the circumstances are deemed a \"failure to qualify,\" the Vice President-elect could potentially act as President until a disabled President-elect regained health or if the President-elect resigned or subsequently died. Congress has the power to legislate for situations where neither a President-elect nor a Vice President-elect qualifies. The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 outlines the order of succession if there is neither a President nor Vice President to discharge the powers and duties of the office. The Speaker of the House of Representatives would act as President, followed by the President pro tempore of the Senate and the secretaries of the principal executive departments. The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 outlines the order of succession in the absence of a President or Vice President. Concerns about succession during the transition period have increased since 9/11, focusing on presidential succession under the Act and the potential for a mass terrorist attack during the presidential inaugural. The question of who would succeed in the event of an attack removing key officials is of significant importance. The Cabinet's transition during the succession period raises concerns about who would succeed in the event of an attack removing key officials. Only confirmed cabinet officers can act as President under the Succession Act, leading to a potential scenario where no incoming cabinet officer is confirmed, leaving succession uncertain if the Speaker and President pro tempore are also unavailable. One solution could be for officials in the line of succession not to attend. The State of the Union Message is traditionally delivered by the President before Congress, with a designated survivor from the Cabinet not attending since 1984 for continuity in the presidency. Following the 2001 attacks, the designated survivor is taken to a secure location. Congress also designates Senators and Representatives to not attend for legislative branch continuity. The Speaker of the House or the President pro tempore of the Senate could be designated as the designated survivor during the State of the Union session to ensure executive continuity. This would allow them to be absent during the President's inauguration and other public ceremonies, avoiding hurdles with early confirmation of cabinet nominees. Alternatively, focusing on the Cabinet could also reduce gaps in the line of presidential succession. One proposal to reduce gaps in the line of presidential succession is to retain incumbent cabinet officers until the new President and Vice-President are installed. Another suggestion is for the outgoing President to nominate and confirm cabinet officers for the incoming administration before the inauguration. This would ensure executive continuity as cabinet secretaries do not have set terms of office. Additionally, the outgoing President could submit cabinet nominations to the Senate after the new Congress convenes. The Senate may retain incumbent cabinet secretaries until the new Congress convenes in January 2017. The alternative is for the outgoing President to nominate and confirm cabinet officers for the incoming administration before the inauguration, which could create a heavy workload for the Senate. In 2008, a designated survivor from the Cabinet was appointed by President-elect Barack H. Obama. Barack Obama retained Secretary of Defense Robert Gates for continuity in the Defense Department during two military campaigns. Gates did not attend the presidential inauguration ceremonies in 2009, as he was designated as the successor for continuity of government. This practice was continued by the Obama Administration in 2013. During the presidential inaugural ceremony in 2013, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki was designated as the successor for continuity of government. Succession procedures during the presidential election campaign period and transition are governed by party rules, federal law, and constitutional requirements. Candidates have been replaced only three times in the nation's history, in 1872, 1912, and 1972, all successfully addressed by party rules. Party rules are assumed to be adequate for future incidents, but a volatile post-election political climate or faithless electors could complicate matters. The 20th and 25th Amendments are relevant during the transition period. During the transition period, the 20th and 25th Amendments provide solutions for potential succession issues. In the post-9/11 era, concerns about terrorist incidents during the inauguration led to discussions about ensuring executive continuity. Options included having the Speaker of the House or President pro tempore of the Senate absent from the ceremony, expediting confirmation of incoming cabinet officers, retaining outgoing cabinet members until succession is secured, and ensuring a duly-confirmed cabinet. During the transition period, solutions for potential succession issues include expediting confirmation of incoming cabinet officers and ensuring a duly-confirmed cabinet member is not present at the inauguration. The 2008-2009 transition set a positive example for future transitions by ensuring a senior cabinet officer was in place during President Obama's inauguration, suggesting a precedent for succession issues in future transitions."
