    "content": "The \"Urban Entrepreneurial Opportunities Act\" provides tax incentives for Urban Entrepreneurial Opportunity Financing Subsidiaries under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. ``Sec. 251. Deduction for equity contributions to urban entrepreneurial opportunity financing subsidiaries.`` In the case of a qualified contributing corporation, a deduction is allowed for equity contributions made to an urban entrepreneurial opportunity financing subsidiary. The deduction is limited to $10,000,000 or the allocated program limitation under section 252. The term 'equity contribution' refers to the contributions made by the corporation. The term 'equity contribution' refers to cash payments for stock in an urban entrepreneurial opportunity financing subsidiary of a corporation. Recapture provisions involve reducing the adjusted basis of stock held in the subsidiary by the deduction amount allowed. No basis increase is permitted for capital contributions with deductions. The sale of stock in an urban entrepreneurial opportunity financing subsidiary may result in ordinary income recapture. If the subsidiary no longer qualifies as such, the corporation must recognize gain as if it sold the stock at fair market value. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development allocates a program limitation of $250,000,000 among qualified contributing corporations. Regulations are set for the allocation procedures to ensure availability of benefits on a geographical basis. Definitions and special rules are outlined in Section 253. For this subpart, a qualified contributing corporation is a domestic corporation not classified as a small business concern, excluding those predominantly engaged in banking, insurance, finance, or similar businesses. An urban entrepreneurial opportunity financing subsidiary is a domestic corporation wholly owned by a qualified contributing corporation, focusing on making qualified enterprise zone business loans and providing related services. The urban entrepreneurial opportunity financing subsidiary provides support services and makes temporary investments for qualified small business concerns receiving qualified enterprise zone business loans. A qualified enterprise zone business loan is defined as a loan made to a qualified small business concern not related to the subsidiary or the contributing corporation. The urban entrepreneurial opportunity financing subsidiary offers support services and loans to qualified small businesses in urban enterprise zones. The loan interest rates are capped based on whether the loan is secured or unsecured. A qualified small business concern is defined as a small business with activities primarily in an urban enterprise zone. An urban enterprise zone is an urban area designated as an enterprise zone under state or federal law. Substantial qualified services are defined as specific services within this subpart. The term 'substantial qualified services' for loans by urban entrepreneurial opportunity financing subsidiaries involves specific support services provided to borrowers, requiring at least 1,000 man-hours per $100,000 loan in the first year. The 'prime rate' is defined as the average prime rate quoted by commercial banks to large businesses, determined by the Federal Reserve Board. The prime rate for loans is determined at the time the loan is made, unless it is a variable rate loan where the prime rate is determined at the time of any rate change. Controlled groups of corporations are treated as one entity for this purpose. Employees of the borrower may be considered for certain financing purposes. The qualified small business concern can designate a financing subsidiary as its primary lender, allowing the employees of the small business concern to be treated as employees of the contributing corporation for compliance with Federal law. The small business concern can only designate one urban entrepreneurial opportunity financing subsidiary as its primary lender. The amendments in this section regarding tax incentives for urban entrepreneurial opportunity financing subsidiaries will take effect on the enactment date of the Act."
