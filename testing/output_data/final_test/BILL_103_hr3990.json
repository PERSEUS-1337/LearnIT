    "content": "The Act titled \"Protection from Sexual Predators Act of 1994\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings and purposes of the Act. Congress finds that rape and sexual assaults are serious threats to communities, with sexual offenders being more likely to repeat their crimes. The average rape sentence is 10\\1/2\\ years, with offenders serving only half of that time. Congress believes states should consider the high recidivism rate of sexual offenders when making decisions on plea bargains and parole, and should review treatment and parole programs for these offenders. Supervision programs for sexual offenders must meet their goals; if not, they should be replaced or abandoned. Federal jurisdiction over rape and sexual assault cases. Section 2241 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to impose life imprisonment for sexual predators who violate the section or engage in conduct affecting interstate commerce, if they have a prior conviction for a similar offense. The amendment to Section 2241 of title 18, United States Code, imposes life imprisonment for sexual predators who commit offenses in special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The registration program under Section 4 requires sexual predators who commit offenses in special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States to register. The Attorney General establishes guidelines for State programs requiring convicted sex offenders to register and keep up-to-date addresses with law enforcement for 10 years after release. States must provide information to the Attorney General regularly in a uniform format. The guidelines established by the Attorney General require convicted sex offenders to provide data including fingerprints, photographs, offenses, and modus operandi for assisting law enforcement investigations. The term \"sex offense\" is defined as any State or Federal offense specified under certain sections of the United States Code. The Attorney General maintains online information obtained for law enforcement use, ensuring privacy. States have 3 years to comply with guidelines or face a 10% reduction in funds under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. The funds under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act may be reduced by 10% if states do not comply with guidelines, with the unallocated funds reallocated accordingly. SEC. 5. STUDY OF PERSISTENT SEXUAL PREDATORS. The National Institute of Justice will conduct a study on persistent sexual predators, reporting to Congress and the President within a year. The report will include a synthesis of current research on such offenders, their characteristics, recidivism rates, treatment effectiveness, responses to treatment, deterrence, and early intervention possibilities, as well as an agenda for future research in this area."
