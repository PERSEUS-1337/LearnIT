    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"21st Century Skills Incentive Fund Act\". Congress finds that students must be prepared in core subjects like English, math, science, and history, as well as 21st-century skills such as global awareness, financial literacy, critical thinking, and collaboration. Information and communications technology literacy is essential for developing 21st-century content knowledge and skills in core subjects. Educators should also incorporate life skills like leadership, ethics, and adaptability into teaching. Assessments should measure core subjects, 21st-century themes, and life and career skills. The curr_chunk focuses on essential skills for the 21st century, including life and career skills, thinking and innovation skills, and information media and technology skills. These skills are crucial for developing content knowledge and should be incorporated into education along with core subjects and 21st-century themes. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to essential skills for the 21st century. The curr_chunk defines an \"eligible State\" as one that develops and implements a comprehensive plan for advancing 21st Century Skills, with support from education, business, and civic leaders. The nonprofit Partnership for 21st Century Skills and the Fund established under section 6(a) are defined in the text. SEC. 4. GRANTS AUTHORIZED. The Secretary can award grants from the Fund to eligible States for establishing a statewide 21st Century Skills initiative. Grants are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis based on approvable applications. The Federal share is 50 percent, and the non-Federal share can come from State or foundation sources. The Secretary awards grants for 21st Century Skills initiatives to eligible States for 1-3 years. Grants must supplement, not replace, State funds for these activities. Each eligible State seeking a grant under this Act must submit an application to the Secretary detailing the 21st Century Skills initiative, meeting eligibility criteria, providing non-Federal funds, and ensuring continued support throughout the grant period. SEC. 6. 21ST CENTURY SKILLS INCENTIVE FUND. The Secretary will establish a fund using appropriated amounts to award grants to eligible States. SEC. 7. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS. The Secretary administers the program under the Act, including determining State eligibility, making grant awards, and conducting evaluations. Each eligible State must evaluate the 21st Century Skills initiative and submit the evaluation to the Secretary. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Act, with $100,000,000 allocated for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, and additional funding as needed for 2009-2011. A separate percentage limitation is set for corporate charitable contributions to 21st Century Skills initiatives of eligible States. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a special rule for corporate contributions to 21st century skills initiatives of eligible states. This rule allows corporations making such contributions to have a separate limitation for those contributions compared to other charitable contributions. The amendment made by this section applies to contributions made after the enactment of the 21st Century Skills Incentive Fund Act, which allows corporations to have a separate limitation for contributions to eligible states' initiatives."
