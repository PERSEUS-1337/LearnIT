Foreign trading partners responded with retaliatory tariffs, especially targeting agricultural commodities. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced a $12 billion trade aid package to assist farmers affected by the trade damage. The Secretary announced a $12 billion trade-aid package to assist farmers affected by trade retaliation, focusing on agricultural commodities like corn, cotton, soybeans, and dairy. The package includes direct payments, a Food Purchase and Distribution Program, and an Agricultural Trade Promotion program. Payments under the Market Facilitation Program would be made in two rounds, totaling $4.7 billion initially. There would not be further financial assistance beyond this package. The $12 billion trade-aid package was announced to assist farmers affected by trade retaliation. Producers could adjust production activities in 2019 to reflect market conditions related to the trade dispute. The report provides background on the dispute, USDA's authority to respond with financial assistance, and details on the three components of the aid package. The Trump Administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in March 2018, followed by additional tariffs on Chinese products in April. Retaliatory tariffs were enacted by China, Canada, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey on U.S. food and agricultural products. Retaliatory tariffs were imposed by China, Canada, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey on U.S. food and agricultural products, totaling about $26.9 billion in export value in 2017. China has the most extensive list of retaliatory tariffs, targeting about 800 U.S. food and agricultural products worth $20.6 billion. China imposed retaliatory tariffs on $20.6 billion worth of U.S. food and agricultural products in 2017, including a 25% tariff on soybeans. This led China to increase soybean purchases from Brazil. Other targeted U.S. products include sorghum, wheat, pork, dairy, fruits, nuts, seafood, and whiskey. Canada also imposed tariffs on $2.6 billion worth of U.S. food and agricultural products, while Mexico imposed tariffs on processed foods. In 2017, U.S. agriculture and food exports to Canada were valued at $2.6 billion. Mexico, the third-largest export market, imposed tariffs on cheese, pork, and prepared foods worth $2.5 billion. The European Union and Turkey also imposed tariffs on U.S. food products, totaling about $1 billion and $250 million respectively. Foreign nations have targeted U.S. agriculture and food products with increased tariffs due to the large export volume and easily substitutable nature of agricultural commodities. Countries can target specific goods to negatively affect U.S. lawmakers, such as imposing tariffs on Bourbon whiskey from Kentucky. The trade aid package is managed by the Secretary of Agriculture through the CCC, a government-owned entity supporting U.S. agriculture programs. The CCC is federally chartered to finance programs supporting U.S. agriculture, borrowing up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury. Congress replenishes CCC's borrowing authority to cover losses, directing USDA on funding through laws like omnibus farm bills. The Secretary has discretionary powers to support U.S. agriculture. The Secretary has discretionary authority to purchase U.S. agricultural commodities under Section 32, which allows for the diversion of products to domestic food assistance programs. This discretionary use has historically been limited but is the basis of trade aid programs announced by the Administration. The Administration's trade aid announcement for the Food Purchase and Distribution Program does not specify the funding source, but the $1.2 billion program is likely sourced from the CCC. Secretary Perdue announced the first round of trade assistance on August 27, 2018, with an initial tranche of $6.1 billion out of a potential $12 billion in total program spending. The Market Facilitation Program (MFP) was announced with an initial estimated direct payment of $4.7 billion to qualifying agricultural producers. Additionally, a Food Purchase and Distribution Program worth $1.2 billion and an Agricultural Trade Promotion (ATP) program with $200 million were introduced to support affected agricultural products. Secretary Perdue revised the MFP outlays to $4.8 billion for the first round and announced a potential second-round outlay of $4.8 billion. The MFP provides financial assistance to producers impacted by foreign government actions, covering commodities like corn, cotton, soybeans, wheat, dairy, and hogs. The USDA announced that fresh sweet cherries and shelled almonds are now eligible for Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments. Producers can sign up once to receive payments in two tranches, with different application start dates based on the type of crop. The deadline for application was extended to February 14, 2019, due to a government shutdown, and producers must certify their 2018 production by May 1, 2019. The USDA extended the deadline for producers to certify their 2018 production for Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments to May 1, 2019. Approximately $9.6 billion will be distributed in MFP payments for various commodities, with soybean producers receiving the majority of the payments. Eligible applicants must meet certain criteria to qualify for MFP payments. The USDA determined MFP payments based on estimated direct trade damage, linking payments only to the trade loss associated with each identified commodity. Indirect effects like market price declines were not considered in the payment calculation. The final trade effect was not observable due to the timing of payment rate calculations and market adjustments. The USDA estimated export values with and without retaliatory tariffs using a global trade model. MFP payments are based on a producer's actual production of eligible commodities in 2018. Payments were calculated as the announced rate per unit multiplied by 50% of the producer's production during the first payment period. The Market Facilitation Program (MFP) provides payments to producers based on their actual production of eligible commodities in 2018. The payments are calculated at a rate of 50% for the first payment period and the remaining 50% for the second payment period. The MFP is separate from other safety net support programs like ARC, PLC, and crop insurance. Regions impacted by factors like drought may receive less aid through MFP. As of February 7, 2019, $6.4 billion in payments have been made to farmers, with FSA offices closing temporarily due to a government shutdown. Producers who have not applied or certified their 2018 production must wait for FSA offices to reopen to receive MFP payments. Those who have already applied will continue to receive payments during the shutdown. MFP payments are capped per person or legal entity for eligible crops, livestock, and specialty crops. These payments do not count against other farm bill payment limitations. There are no criteria to determine if losses covered by revenue support programs may be duplicated by MFP. The MFP payments, totaling $12 billion, may overlap with ARC or PLC payments for eligible program acres. Policymakers are concerned about WTO compliance due to the coupled nature of MFP payments. If MFP payments stay below $12 billion and other amber box payments remain around $4.9 billion annually, total U.S. amber box payments would be within the WTO limit. However, economists are uncertain about the final MFP payment amount. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is concerned about exceeding the $19 billion cap for agricultural payments, potentially leading to a legal challenge. Some commodity groups argue that the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments are insufficient to compensate for trade losses, with corn growers claiming a $6.3 billion loss in 2018 due to trade disputes. The National Association of Wheat Growers and the National Milk Producers Federation estimate significant losses due to trade retaliation. Specialty crop groups also report substantial losses, with California alone facing potential losses of over $3.3 billion. The Administration is allocating $1.2 billion of its trade aid package to purchase agricultural commodities for domestic distribution. The USDA is allocating $1.2 billion for contingency purchases of agricultural commodities to support agriculture and nutrition assistance programs. The purchases are made under the Secretary's discretion and do not require appropriation. Agricultural Marketing Service announces purchasing intentions and vendors approved to sell to USDA may submit offers. The USDA is allocating $1.2 billion for contingency purchases of agricultural commodities to support nutrition assistance programs. Approved vendors can submit offers for distribution through various USDA assistance channels. The purchase values for commodities were determined using a gross trade damage formula. The USDA allocated $1.2 billion for contingency purchases of agricultural commodities to support nutrition assistance programs. The largest purchases announced include pork ($559 million), apples ($93 million), dairy ($85 million), and pistachios ($85 million). Purchasing orders and distribution activities will be adjusted based on demand. As of December 17, 2018, USDA had procured some portion of 16 of the 29 commodities included in the program, totaling more than 4,500 truckloads of food. AMS will continue purchasing commodities for delivery throughout 2019. In FY2017, AMS purchased $2.2 billion of commodities for domestic nutrition assistance, including $735 million from Section 32. The USDA allocated $1.2 billion for contingency purchases of agricultural commodities to support nutrition assistance programs. The new program includes $270 million in contingency purchases, $465 million in entitlement purchases, and $1.5 billion from the Food and Nutrition Service budget. The ATP program, part of the trade aid package, will receive $200 million to boost trade promotion efforts for U.S. agricultural goods overseas. The USDA allocated $200 million for the ATP program to promote U.S. food and agricultural goods overseas, which nearly doubles the annual amounts for trade promotion programs. The funding can be used for various activities like advertising, market research, and technical assistance, benefiting all sectors of agriculture. The USDA allocated $200 million for the ATP program to promote U.S. food and agricultural goods overseas. The application period closed in November 2018 with over $600 million in requested activities. USDA's FAS announced the full funding awards on January 31, 2019. The Secretary has broad discretionary authority to determine aid distribution. The trade aid package is a temporary, one-time response to foreign tariffs on U.S. commodities, supported by most farm commodity and advocacy groups. Some stakeholders question the equity of MFP payment distribution due to transparency issues. Trade aid package and tariffs create uncertainty in U.S. trade policy behavior and reliability as a trading partner. The USDA has used CCC authority to mitigate tariff-related losses, setting a precedent for future situations. Trade loss is the value of lost export sales due to changes in foreign demand, impacted by retaliatory tariffs. The USDA revised its forecast for agricultural export sales to China in FY2018 from $21.6 billion to $19 billion by August 2018. The initial projection for FY2019 was only $12 billion, showing a significant decline in export outlook. Lost market value represents the opportunity cost of missed sales due to a drop in market prices. For example, waiting to sell soybeans at $8.00 per bushel in October instead of $10.00 per bushel in March incurs an opportunity cost of $2.00 per bushel. The potential impact of trade disputes on market prices for commodities is a key concern for producers. Factors such as retaliatory tariffs and record harvests can influence market prices, leading to missed sales opportunities and unknown opportunity costs until commodities are sold. It is important to exclude production effects when estimating trade-based market losses. Changes in USDA's monthly price forecasts from May to September may provide an upper-bound estimate of the trade impacts, coinciding with escalating trade conflicts and retaliatory tariffs. Farm prices for MFP commodities declined for soybeans, sorghum, and corn but rose for wheat and cotton during this period. The MFP payment rates seem out of sync with the price changes, with sorghum potentially receiving a payment rate three times larger than its price decline. Corn, experiencing a similar price decline to sorghum, could receive a payment rate amounting to only 3% of the price decline. The impact of retaliatory tariffs on market prices is difficult to determine due to various influencing factors. Estimating market prices would require a global economic model considering all major agricultural commodities and relevant market factors. For example, wheat and cotton received MFP payment rates and saw an increase in farm prices from May to September. However, poor international wheat harvests in 2018 suggest that wheat prices could have been much higher without the tariffs."
