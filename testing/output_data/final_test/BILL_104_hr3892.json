    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"D'Oench Duhme Reform Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Congress finds that secret side agreements not recorded in the records of an insured depository institution should not be enforceable against Federal banking agencies, based on the D'Oench doctrine. This was supplemented by an amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in 1950. The D'Oench doctrine and section 13(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act have been expanded by courts to bar various claims beyond their original scope. The aggressive use of these authorities by Federal banking agencies has led to unfair outcomes, preventing individuals from asserting valid claims. The Act aims to unify authority under Federal statutory law for cases involving agreements against the interest of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It also seeks to limit the enforcement of unrecorded agreements while allowing certain valid claims and defenses to be considered. SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION. Section 13(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to require written agreements to protect the Corporation's interests in acquired assets. Claims against the Corporation in its corporate capacity and as receiver of an insured depository institution are not barred, estopped, or prohibited, including claims unrelated to specific assets acquired, transactions not reflected in institution records, claims from litigation before the Corporation's appointment, and claims filed at any time. The curr_chunk discusses the conditions under which a claim or defense based on intentional torts or violation of State or Federal law can be filed, provided the party asserting it did not participate in fraudulent schemes or mislead bank examiners. It also mentions that oral representations relied upon should not conflict with written agreements in the institution's records. The curr_chunk outlines the Corporation's limitations in defeating claims related to assets acquired in good faith, except in specific circumstances. It also exempts vendor agreements from certain provisions. SEC. 4. REPEAL. Amends Section 11(d) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by removing paragraph (9) and renumbering paragraphs (10) through (19). \n\nSEC. 5. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Modifies Section 11 of the Act by adjusting subsection (e) and subsection (g)(4) to align with the changes made in Section 4.\n\nSEC. 6. APPLICABILITY. Specifies the applicability of the amendments. \"Section 13(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended by this Act, applies to administrative claims and litigation filed on or after October 19, 1993.\""
