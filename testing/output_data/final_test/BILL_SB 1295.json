    "title": "SB 1295",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2962 of the Penal Code is amended to require necessary treatment by the State Department of State Hospitals for prisoners with severe mental disorders as a condition of parole. A severe mental disorder is defined as an illness that impairs thought, perception, emotions, judgment, or behavior, excluding certain conditions like personality disorders or substance abuse. The term \"remission\" refers to controlling severe mental disorder symptoms with medication or support. A person cannot be kept in remission without treatment if they have been violent, made threats, caused harm, or not followed the treatment plan. The standard for voluntary treatment plan compliance is based on reasonable behavior. The prisoner may be eligible for parole or release if their severe mental disorder was a factor in the crime they committed and they have received treatment for it for at least 90 days within the year prior to their parole or release. Prior to release on parole, a prisoner with a severe mental disorder must be evaluated by a psychiatrist and certified by a chief psychiatrist that the disorder is a factor in their criminal behavior and poses a danger to others. Treatment for the disorder for at least 90 days within the year prior to release is also required. Prior to release on parole, a prisoner with a severe mental disorder must be evaluated and certified by a chief psychiatrist that the disorder is a factor in their criminal behavior and poses a danger to others. The evaluation and certification process involves the State Department of State Hospitals and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. If professionals evaluating a prisoner do not agree on the presence and impact of a severe mental disorder related to criminal behavior, a chief psychiatrist can certify the prisoner for further examination by independent professionals ordered by the Board of Parole Hearings. The professionals evaluating a prisoner must concur with the chief psychiatrist's certification for the prisoner to be considered for involuntary treatment as a mentally disordered offender. The purpose of the examination is to determine if the prisoner meets specific criteria, and it is not necessary for the prisoner to understand this. The crime must meet certain criteria, including receiving a determinate sentence for offenses like voluntary manslaughter, mayhem, or kidnapping. The specified crimes that qualify for involuntary treatment as a mentally disordered offender include voluntary manslaughter, mayhem, kidnapping, robbery with a deadly weapon, carjacking with a deadly weapon, rape, sodomy by force, and oral copulation by force. The specified crimes that qualify for involuntary treatment as a mentally disordered offender include lewd acts on a child under 14, continuous sexual abuse, arson posing physical harm, felony with firearm use, violation of Section 18745, attempted murder, and other crimes involving force or serious bodily injury. A crime involving the threat of force or violence likely to cause substantial physical harm, without requiring proof of serious bodily injury. For meeting the criteria in this section, the nature of the crime for which the prisoner was convicted can be proven with documentary evidence. Details of the offense, including the use of force or violence, causing serious bodily injury, or the threat of force likely to cause substantial physical harm, can be shown through various documents. The term \"substantial danger of physical harm\" does not require evidence of a recent overt act."
