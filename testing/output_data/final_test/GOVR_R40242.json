    "content": "Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are being developed at various levels. One option is to implement a carbon tax on GHG emissions or their inputs. This report focuses on the policy considerations of using a carbon tax to control emissions, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison of all available policy tools. Governments may impose taxes for various reasons. Governments impose taxes to raise revenue for funding objectives like national defense, education, and social security. Taxes on desirable activities like income and investment provide steady revenue but are considered distortionary by economists. They argue that reducing payroll and income taxes would incentivize employment and investment. Economists suggest implementing a pollution tax as an efficient way to correct market failures. A pollution tax, also known as a Pigouvian tax, corrects market failures by internalizing external costs of activities like fossil fuel combustion. This tax ensures that the true costs of resource use, such as climate change-related damages from CO2 emissions, are reflected in the market price. Policymakers can implement a pollution tax on greenhouse gas emissions or their inputs to address this issue. A carbon tax can be placed on GHG emissions or their inputs to stimulate emission reduction. Entities like power plants would be incentivized to take actions to lower tax payments. Energy consumers would be encouraged to switch to less carbon-intensive fuels, use energy more efficiently, and prefer lower-priced products or services. A carbon tax or cap-and-trade system would incentivize businesses and households to reduce GHG emissions by increasing the price of coal, oil, and natural gas. This market-based approach aims to provide accurate information to consumers about the full cost of their choices. The report discusses the fundamental choices between a cost (tax) and a quantity (cap) control instrument. The report discusses the choices between a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade program to control GHG emissions. It compares the advantages and disadvantages of a carbon tax with a cap-and-trade system. Implementation issues for a carbon tax, such as where to apply it and how to distribute revenues, are also analyzed. Policymakers must decide whether to use a price instrument like a carbon tax or a quantity instrument like an emissions cap. A price (carbon tax) or quantity control instrument (cap-and-trade system) can achieve the same outcome. Figure 1 shows the intersection of marginal costs and benefits to determine the price or quantity limit for economic efficiency. Emission abatement above or below this point is not economically efficient. The efficient price and quantity limits are indicated by dashed lines. Both a tax and cap would result in identical emission abatement levels and costs. The marginal cost of abatement would equal P* in an economically efficient market. The shapes and levels of marginal abatement cost and benefit curves are uncertain due to factors like future emission baselines, population levels, and economic growth. The development and deployment of low-carbon technology will influence mitigation costs. Policymakers need accurate information on costs and benefits to establish emissions caps or carbon taxes. The choice between a carbon tax and emissions cap depends on preferences for uncertain emissions or program costs. Design elements in a cap-and-trade program can complicate this decision. Design elements in a cap-and-trade program can blur the distinction between price and quantity control, offering flexibility in controlling costs. Congress is presented with a policy continuum rather than a stark policy dichotomy, with options to resemble a carbon tax program. Elements like banking allow covered sources to save emission allowances for future use, reducing compliance costs. Banking in cap-and-trade programs reduces compliance costs by allowing covered sources to save emission allowances for future use. Borrowing at high interest rates and market oversight can help control price spikes. Safety valves, triggered by allowance market prices, include set prices, slowing emissions cap tightening, and extending compliance time. Congress could create an oversight board to implement cost-relief measures if needed. The first type of compliance measure would set a ceiling on allowance prices and limit volatility, moving the program closer to price control. Auctioning allowances could raise revenues and support price discovery. A reserve price in emissions allowance auctions would guarantee a revenue stream, similar to a minimum tax or price floor. Policymakers could establish a carbon tax with mechanisms for addressing long-term emission uncertainty by requiring periodic emission data submission. The carbon tax rate can be adjusted by Congress or a federal agency to achieve emission reduction goals. There are concerns about delegating this authority and the ability to modify the tax rate periodically. A flexible approach may sacrifice long-term price certainty. Congress may need to consider providing tax rate increase mechanisms. The gap between price control and quantity control in carbon tax and emissions cap policies cannot be fully overcome. Design details, such as a price safety-valve and emission allowance auction, impact the ability to control price fluctuations. Comparison between a carbon tax and emissions cap requires careful consideration of design elements. This report examines the advantages of a carbon tax approach to controlling GHG emissions, comparing it to a cap-and-trade system from an economic theory perspective. It discusses the benefits of price stability, revenue generation, and potential implementation challenges. The report discusses the advantages of a carbon tax approach compared to a cap-and-trade system in terms of economic efficiency and cost uncertainty. It highlights the potential benefits of using a tax, but acknowledges the debate surrounding the assumptions. The analysis shows that both a tax and a cap instrument could achieve the same result if policymakers have knowledge of the marginal cost and benefit curves. Weitzman's 1974 study \"Prices vs. Quantities\" argues for a tax over an emissions cap based on the slopes of cost and benefit curves. Price instruments are preferred with a flat marginal benefit curve, while quantity limits are preferred with a flat marginal cost curve. Some economists argue that the slope of the marginal benefits curve is flat relative to the marginal cost curve in the context of emission abatement. This notion is debated but grounded in the scientific processes of how GHG emissions impact climate change. A carbon tax is considered more efficient than an emissions cap based on the relationship between the expected slopes of costs and benefits. Policymakers rely on estimates of marginal costs and benefits when implementing a tax or cap. The expected marginal costs and benefits of GHG emission abatement determine the economically efficient point of regulation, where policymakers can implement either an emissions cap or carbon tax. However, the actual cost curve is unlikely to match the expected cost curve, leading to some level of economic inefficiency. If actual marginal abatement costs are higher than expected, applying a carbon tax would incentivize emission sources to abate emissions until the marginal cost of abatement equals the tax. Emission sources would abate emissions until the marginal cost of abatement equals the carbon tax at Point A. Covered sources would pay the tax for any additional emissions. On the other hand, with an emissions cap (Q*), covered sources would abate emissions until Point B when the cap is met. The difference in efficiency losses between the two policies is substantial, with a tax leading to less abatement than optimal under higher-than-expected costs, and an emissions cap leading to more abatement than optimal. Lower-than-expected marginal abatement costs would result in abatement that is less than optimal with an emissions cap, and beyond optimal with a tax. The efficiency losses from a carbon tax are greater than those from an emissions cap, regardless of whether marginal abatement costs are higher or lower than expected. The argument for a carbon tax minimizing economic inefficiency in uncertain cost scenarios is based on assumptions about the steepness of cost and benefit curves. Other underlying issues are also discussed. The argument for a carbon tax maximizing efficiency is based on the assumption that the slope of the marginal benefits curve is flat compared to the marginal costs curve. GHG emissions generate damages due to their concentration in the atmosphere over decades or centuries, unlike traditional air pollutants. The current stock of CO2 in the atmosphere is approximately 3,000 gigatons. The benefits from controlling the stock of CO2 emissions are thought to occur slowly and steadily, assuming no climatic \"tipping points.\" However, some scientists argue that reaching a certain stock level could lead to abrupt and catastrophic climate events, such as the collapse of Greenland's ice sheet or dieback of the Amazon rainforest. The potential tipping points like the collapse of Greenland's ice sheet and dieback of the Amazon rainforest could drastically change the benefits curve by necessitating emission reduction to avoid severe consequences. The Stern Review suggests that as greenhouse gas stock grows, damages will likely increase sharply, especially at critical levels. The damage curve is expected to respond more to cumulative emissions over years or decades. Depending on the proximity of tipping points, an emissions cap may be preferable, but there is limited information available to scientists and policymakers. A 2003 economic study found that emissions caps would be optimal only when there is a well-defined threshold with clearly catastrophic consequences. Recent cap-and-trade proposals suggest that the marginal cost curve for emission abatement opportunities may not be flat, with costs likely to increase with each additional unit. However, a carbon market could spur technology development, potentially flattening the marginal cost curve and making an emissions cap more beneficial. Weitzman's economic principle applies to comparing costs and benefits of controlling pollutants like SO2, which yield short-term damages. However, CO2 is a stock pollutant with potential damages related to total accumulation. Static analysis oversimplifies as it assumes activities in different time periods are unrelated, but upgrades made in one period affect future emissions. Time-related factors like discounting future benefits need consideration. Several economic studies have expanded Weitzman's basic principle within a dynamic framework, addressing time-related factors such as discounting future benefits and atmospheric decay of GHGs. The relative-slope principle generally depends on the marginal cost curve, as covered sources making emission abatement decisions do not factor in the benefits of abatement in their economic calculations. Economists suggest that considering benefits would eliminate the externality, but in some cases, an emissions cap may lead to a more economically efficient outcome. An emissions cap may result in a more economically efficient outcome, especially when the uncertainty of costs and benefits are positively correlated. Quantity control can be more advantageous than price control in this scenario, depending on the degree of correlation and the magnitude of uncertainty. Stavins argues that the advantage of price control over quantity control remains unless the true benefits of emissions reduction are considered. The efficiency gains of using a carbon tax versus an emissions cap have been extensively studied. Economic analyses consistently show that taxes are more efficient than cap-and-trade systems for a wide range of parameter values related to global warming. For example, Pizer found that taxes are five times more efficient than an emissions cap. These efficiency gains are estimated to be in the hundreds of millions to several billions of dollars per year. A 2008 MIT report suggests that efficiency gains from cap-and-trade programs may be smaller in practice. A 2008 RFF study found that banking provisions in a cap-and-trade program could improve efficiency by 20%. Some argue that precise control of GHG reductions is necessary to avoid irreversible climate changes, favoring a quantity-based emissions cap over economic efficiency. The viewpoint of applying a precautionary principle with a quantity-based emissions cap argues for keeping options open in the face of uncertainty. This approach allows for gathering more information on abatement costs and climate change benefits, leading to potential amendments in climate change policy. Depending on the chosen GHG control instrument, emissions or prices would fluctuate over short-term periods. Proponents of a carbon tax highlight price volatility observed in emissions cap-and-trade programs, such as the significant price variations in the U.S. sulfur dioxide (SO2) market. The use of banking in the SO2 market has not fully addressed price volatility, influenced by regulatory uncertainties. CO2 emission allowances could impact the U.S. economy significantly due to fossil fuel reliance. Strict quantity limits may disrupt energy markets and investment planning, affecting income distribution, inflation rates, and energy prices. Volatile emission allowance prices could deter investment as firms face unreliable cost information. GHG cap-and-trade programs may or may not exhibit similar price swings as seen in the SO2 market. The European Union's Emission Trading System (EU ETS) has experienced significant price volatility in Phase 1 (2005-2007) and Phase 2 (2008-2012). Phase 2 allowance prices may provide a better example of potential market fluctuations under a U.S. cap-and-trade program. Carbon tax proponents highlight the generation of carbon tax revenues as a key advantage. Proponents often cite carbon tax revenues as a primary advantage, but a cap-and-trade program could achieve similar results. The strength of this advantage depends on the design of the cap-and-trade program. Carbon tax revenue would be more predictable than auction revenue due to fluctuating allowance prices. A carbon tax offers implementation advantages over a cap-and-trade program, as it is easier to explain and understand. The transparency of a carbon tax may help garner support for its enactment, especially as cap-and-trade programs become more complex with flexible design elements. In the context of the recent financial climate, the argument for a simpler carbon tax gains strength over complex financial structures. Congress could establish a transparent carbon tax framework that may rival the complexity of a cap-and-trade program, with considerations for CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and potential subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. Policymakers could also offer tax credits for carbon sequestration projects, similar to carbon offsets in a cap-and-trade regime. A carbon tax may face challenges in credibility and transparency, potentially weakening the program. Cap-and-trade proponents have an advantage in promoting their approach due to lower estimated program costs. The existing administrative structure in the US could facilitate the implementation of a carbon tax on fossil fuels. A carbon tax on fossil fuels could utilize the existing administrative structure in the US. However, implementing a carbon tax that includes other greenhouse gas emissions would require new institutions. Some argue that creating institutions for an emissions trading system would be costly and lead to bureaucratic controls, while others believe that institutions can be established quickly and inexpensively based on past programs like the U.S. SO2 trading program. Comparing the SO2 trading program with a potential GHG emission trading program shows significant differences in scale and emission source concentration. The effectiveness of a carbon tax versus a cap-and-trade system would depend on the specific design of each instrument. Implementing a cap-and-trade system with a downstream structure could pose challenges, especially in determining emission allowances for covered sources. Emission allowance auctions could help alleviate this issue but would require additional administrative responsibilities. A carbon tax approach may have administrative advantages over cap-and-trade, as it carries less risk of litigation and allows for easier modification of stringency. Cap-and-trade legislation may delegate more authority to government agencies, making certain decisions vulnerable to legal challenges. Policymakers could face difficulties adjusting emissions caps in a cap-and-trade program after initiation. The potential disadvantages of a GHG emission reduction program that employs a carbon tax include concerns about the value of investments made by energy producers and consumers based on an expected carbon tax, which may change if the tax is altered. This could result in longer time to recoup investments compared to a cap-and-trade program. The primary disadvantage of using a carbon tax to control GHG emissions is the uncertainty in emission levels. Some argue that this uncertainty may make a carbon tax unfeasible as an option. However, models have estimated the carbon tax rate needed to achieve emission targets comparable to cap-and-trade proposals, based on the best available information on abatement costs. The uncertainty in emission levels with a carbon tax approach can be addressed by implementing a mandatory GHG emission reporting regime to track the impact and performance of the tax. This data can be used to adjust the tax rate if emission reduction is not occurring at the desired pace. Short-term emission fluctuations would not undermine efforts to control climate change according to carbon tax proponents. Some suggest an independent agency to adjust carbon tax rates for emission reduction goals, sacrificing long-term price certainty for emission certainty. Political challenges may arise in changing tax rates during economic downturns. The Council on Foreign Relations recommended a cap-and-trade system over a carbon tax, stating that either approach, designed with efficiency and fairness in mind, would be acceptable for reducing emissions. Political momentum favors cap-and-trade for near term adoption, despite potential obstacles for a carbon tax. Enacting a carbon tax to control GHG emissions poses a political challenge due to the word \"tax,\" while cap-and-trade does not carry the same stigma. Both approaches would impose costs on the economy by placing a price on carbon. Some argue that cap-and-trade should be labeled as a \"cap and tax.\" Some Members argue that a carbon tax should be reframed as a \"user fee\" or \"tariff\" to overcome political hurdles. Proponents could gain traction by framing the debate within the context of tax policy and industry motivations for supporting or opposing a carbon tax may vary based on the design of alternative approaches like cap-and-trade. Industry stakeholders have supported cap-and-trade proposals in anticipation of receiving allowances at no cost, similar to past programs. However, recent proposals from the 110th Congress would provide fewer allowances for free, causing concern among stakeholders. The evolution of allocation strategy in the industry may lead to a shift in support from cap-and-trade to a carbon tax. Some argue that taxes may be less preferred than auctioned allowances due to potential price manipulation. However, some industries prefer the fixed cost of a carbon tax for better investment assessment. Industry stakeholders may support a tax over cap-and-trade proposals resembling those from the 110th Congress. Cap-and-trade proposals from the 110th Congress would have applied to energy producers, resembling a tax for downstream consumers like power plants. Direct compliance for upstream entities with little emissions could pose challenges without a known price. Supporters of stringent GHG control may oppose a carbon tax, fearing a low rate would not induce emission mitigation. Similar concerns of stringency exist for a cap-and-trade system. A cap-and-trade system may face challenges such as setting undesired levels for the cap or allowing questionable offsets, which could undermine emission reduction goals. Despite potential drawbacks, an emissions cap offers a guarantee of meeting specific emission levels, which some environmental groups prioritize. It is crucial for all major emitting countries to take action to mitigate human-induced climate change. Congress should consider how market-based instruments like a cap or tax can complement international efforts and maximize emission reduction. Establishing a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system on an international scale presents challenges for policymakers and negotiators aiming to create a global greenhouse gas reduction regime. While cap-and-trade programs are currently more prominent, some argue that a carbon tax could encourage participation from major emitting nations like the United States, China, and India. The core of international greenhouse gas mitigation efforts involves cap-and-trade programs among nations with quantitative commitments, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS. If Congress enacted a cap-and-trade system in the United States, it could allow trading between systems for more emission reduction opportunities. However, linked programs may have unintended consequences if they differ in scope or stringency. A U.S. carbon tax program could potentially link with international cap-and-trade programs by offering tax credits for emission reductions made outside the U.S. This linkage would not allow for the purchase of reductions from the U.S., creating a one-way flow of trade. Some argue that a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program should prioritize maximum participation among nations over the choice of instrument. Concerns arise about tax credits for international emission abatement projects potentially compromising the primary goal of GHG emission control. The effectiveness of bringing in more nations is debated between a carbon tax and cap-and-trade program. The debate between a carbon tax and cap-and-trade program revolves around the effectiveness of bringing more nations under a mitigation umbrella. Implementing an international carbon tax system faces challenges related to national sovereignty and diverse participation. Some argue for a cap-and-trade approach due to existing programs and political momentum, but this reasoning is questioned. The debate between a carbon tax and cap-and-trade program revolves around the effectiveness of bringing more nations under a mitigation umbrella. A substantial percentage of the world's CO2 emissions are not covered by existing international cap-and-trade systems. Implementing a carbon tax approach would face challenges in reaching agreement on fair tax rates for each nation, especially between developed and developing nations. Implementing a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system poses challenges in reaching fair tax rates between nations. International discussions may be complicated by pre-existing carbon taxes and subsidies. Monitoring and enforcing carbon taxes could face logistical difficulties, with concerns about corruption in a cap-and-trade system. Determining a nation's \"net carbon tax\" is a primary obstacle, as offsets through subsidies or loopholes could impact the effectiveness of the tax. Implementing a carbon tax poses challenges in reaching fair tax rates between nations. International discussions may be complicated by pre-existing carbon taxes and subsidies. Policymakers would face decisions on the point of taxation, level of taxation, and tax revenue allocation. Congress would need to consider emissions coverage for maximum environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency. A carbon tax can be challenging to implement due to various factors such as measurement capabilities, costs, control options, and political considerations. Policymakers have options for where to impose the tax in the economy, either upstream or downstream in the energy production and consumption chain. A carbon tax can be implemented either upstream or downstream in the energy production and consumption chain. The upstream approach levies the tax before emissions occur based on fossil fuel carbon content, minimizing sources subject to the tax. The downstream approach applies the tax on emissions themselves, with advantages in sectors like the electric utility industry where monitoring CO2 emissions is already in place. Applying a carbon tax directly to emissions from coal-fired power plants could stimulate carbon capture technology. A combined approach, taxing emissions from different sectors in various ways, could be considered. A carbon tax would determine which entities need to make tax payments based on emissions or emission inputs, monitor emissions, and maintain records. Implementing a direct tax on emissions may be challenging across all economic sectors due to the large number of emission sources. Some fossil fuel uses do not generate emissions but sequester carbon, so policymakers may need to consider exemptions or tax credits for these activities. Fossil fuels with varying carbon content would be impacted differently by a carbon tax, with coal prices rising more than natural gas prices. A carbon tax would impact fossil fuels differently, with coal prices rising more than natural gas. Including all greenhouse gas emissions in the tax base could reduce overall costs by 20%, but implementation challenges exist for non-CO2 emissions sources. Sources of GHG emissions are varied, including smokestacks, exhaust pipes, households, and livestock. Policymakers must balance benefits and costs when deciding which sources and gases to tax. Excluding certain sectors may require higher tax rates to meet emissions targets. Table 2 lists the top emission sources of six GHGs in the United States, accounting for approximately 95% of total emissions. In the United States, policymakers could address CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and non-energy uses by levying an upstream carbon tax on fewer than 2,500 entities. A downstream approach may be feasible for electric generating facilities powered by fossil fuels, but impractical for other sources like automobiles and homes. One possible alternative to a complete upstream/midstream strategy is to target coal combustion directly at electric generating facilities. Coal-fired power plants in the US accounted for 92% of coal combustion in 2006, with about 641 plants in total. Applying a point of taxation at these facilities could incentivize tax credit opportunities and enhance the development of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology. This direct approach may provide a stronger price signal compared to an indirect upstream tax on coal-fired emissions. To avoid leakage situations, it may be burdensome to cover all sources of coal combustion at the point of emissions, especially at residences and commercial entities. Policymakers could expand coverage to include more greenhouse gas emissions from various sources listed in Table 2, which individually contribute small proportions to US emissions. Including a combination of these sources in the carbon tax base could significantly increase emissions coverage, varying by the number of entities subject to the tax and the circumstances of emission release. A large number of entities subject to a carbon tax would incur higher administrative costs per unit of emissions. Some emissions sources, like those from the agriculture sector, would be challenging to cover due to logistical issues in measurement and monitoring. Agricultural emissions, which make up about 6% of total GHG emissions in the US, are generated by many entities with no upstream measurement points. However, nitrous oxide emissions from artificial fertilizers could potentially be addressed through an upstream point of taxation. EPA. EPA estimates that around 25% of N2O emissions from agricultural soils are due to artificial fertilizer use, accounting for approximately 0.8% of U.S. GHG emissions in 2006. A tax on fertilizers could reduce their use, but concerns about emissions leakage exist. Monitoring agricultural emissions is challenging, and the sector has been excluded from cap-and-trade proposals due to practical and political reasons. Agricultural emissions could be addressed with policy tools like tax credits for reduction projects. Other emission sources may be more suitable for a carbon tax due to easier monitoring. Landfills and coal mines already control methane emissions for safety reasons. Methane from landfills could be covered by including more landfills in the tax base. Large municipal landfills are already required to collect and combust methane emissions to comply with federal air regulations. Some landfills are also following suit under state laws or voluntary programs. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are used as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances and account for 1.6% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Most HFC emissions come from air conditioning and refrigeration units in vehicles, buildings, and homes during production, operation, and disposal. Unlike other sources, HFC emissions enter the atmosphere from millions of locations, far away from production sites. Some have proposed implementing a tax on HFC emissions. Some propose combining a tax on HFC production with a tax credit for proper recycling. Norway has an HFC rebate program that could guide U.S. policymakers. Congress may consider taxing imported HFCs and including iron/steel production and cement manufacturing facilities to cover more emissions. Methane from natural gas systems could also be addressed. Emissions from normal operations, routine maintenance, or \"system upsets\" are primarily from fugitive emissions. Methane emissions from underground coal mines, accounting for 0.8% of total GHG emissions, may be easier to monitor under a carbon tax. Setting the level of the carbon tax would be a subject of intense debate, with some arguing the rate is either too low or too high. Setting the level of a carbon tax involves intense debate, with arguments that the rate is either too low or too high. Two approaches can inform this decision: one based on estimated benefits of avoiding climate change impacts, and the other based on a GHG emissions target. The first approach is theoretically stronger, while the second is considered more practical due to uncertainty. Table A-1 in the report provides estimates of price increases for fossil fuels and motor gasoline based on different carbon tax rates. The optimal carbon tax rate is determined by the intersection of emission abatement costs and benefits, known as the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). The SCC is defined as the monetized sum of annual net losses from impacts triggered by an additional ton of carbon emitted today. This establishes an economically optimal price of carbon where mitigation costs equal benefits. Applying this economic principle to set a carbon tax currently presents significant challenges. Estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) are uncertain, with a wide range of values from zero to over $500 per ton of CO2 emissions. Choosing a value within this range is complex and controversial, as it involves placing a monetary measure on the global damages of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimation involves placing a value on goods and services that are difficult to measure, such as human health, water supplies, and agricultural production. The value varies by location, making the estimate complex. Climate change processes impacting these goods are not fully understood, and the element of time complicates SCC estimation. Economists use a discount rate to determine the cost of future damages in today's dollars. To estimate the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), economists use a discount rate to determine damages in today's dollars. The chosen discount rate is crucial in cost-benefit analyses and SCC estimation. Uncertainty in evaluating climate change damages includes factors like the discount rate and future emission trajectories. A business-as-usual emission path leads to a higher SCC estimate compared to an emission stabilization path. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimate varies based on emission pathways, with higher concentrations leading to higher estimates. Using SCC for a carbon tax is challenging due to wide variations in estimates and changing conditions over time. Policymakers often view SCC as a starting point for setting carbon tax levels. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimate varies based on emission pathways, with higher concentrations leading to higher estimates. Policymakers find using SCC for a carbon tax challenging due to wide variations in estimates and changing conditions over time. Tax rates from various proposals align closely with the average SCC estimates, which average around $12/tCO2-e. An alternative approach to setting a carbon tax is to base it on expected damages to achieve specific emissions reduction goals. Setting a specific emissions reduction goal can be achieved by estimating a tax schedule to encourage reductions. This approach eliminates the need for estimating marginal benefits of abatement in tax rate calculations but may involve debate over climate change risks. Estimates of marginal costs of emission abatement are necessary, but they are uncertain due to multiple assumptions. The uncertainty in cost analyses is evident in proposals like the Lieberman-Warner cap-and-trade proposal from the 110th Congress. The uncertainty in estimating costs for emission allowance prices under the proposed strategy (S. 2191) from the 110th Congress is evident. Price estimates varied considerably from $16/tCO2-e to $49/tCO2-e in 2015, indicating weak information for setting optimal tax rates. An uncertain emissions pathway is associated with a carbon tax system, which could be alleviated by monitoring U.S. emissions annually and adjusting the tax rate as needed. Carbon tax revenues would be substantial, with potential uses including reducing other taxes, offsetting increased energy prices, promoting low-carbon technologies, and supporting various climate- or non-climate-related purposes. Revenue recycling options and potential impacts are discussed, with estimates from legislative proposals provided in Table 3. The 110th Congress proposed two bills, H.R. 2069 and H.R. 3416, to impose a carbon tax on fossil fuels based on CO2 emissions. The estimated tax revenues ranged from $69 billion to $126 billion in 2015. These revenues could be used for various policy objectives, including climate-related initiatives. Carbon tax revenues can be used to replace taxes on desirable activities, reducing market distortions. This approach aims to reduce taxes on favored activities like employment and investment while increasing taxes on less desirable behavior such as pollution. By using carbon tax revenues in this manner, it can lead to a double-dividend effect: reduced greenhouse gas emissions and decreased market distortions from taxes on desirable behavior. Recent economic studies suggest that the costs of carbon tax-imposed costs would likely exceed the economic efficiency benefits in the United States. To offset these costs for households, especially low-income ones, policymakers could provide financial assistance using tax revenues. Assistance mechanisms include lump-sum payments, tax deductions, credits, rebates, or increases in existing programs. Stakeholders in carbon-intensive industries, like fossil fuel-fired electric utilities and steel, could be affected. Stakeholders in carbon-intensive industries, such as fossil fuel-fired electric utilities and steel producers, are concerned about the potential adverse impacts of a GHG emission control program like a carbon tax. To mitigate these impacts, policymakers may consider returning a portion of the tax revenues to affected industries. Additionally, the tax revenues could be used to support technology development, energy efficiency improvements, and other climate change-related objectives. Improvements in energy efficiency can help reduce GHG emissions. A carbon tax can incentivize energy efficiency, with tax revenues used to promote carbon sequestration and adaptation efforts. Some suggest using tax revenues to prepare communities for climate change effects and for deficit reduction. The potential use and distribution of new carbon tax revenue could have significant impacts on society. Congress faces trade-offs in deciding how to allocate the tax revenues, such as minimizing overall costs, alleviating costs for specific groups, and supporting other policy objectives. In the long-term, advancements in low-carbon technology can reduce societal costs. Economic studies suggest using carbon tax revenues to offset reductions in distortionary taxes for the greatest economic efficiency. Using revenues for other purposes could lead to higher overall costs. The study compares the economic efficiency of different emission allowance distribution methods in a cap-and-trade program. Providing emission allowances at no cost to covered sources is the least efficient method. Distributing carbon tax revenues to households or reducing taxes on labor/investment are more cost-effective options. This can reduce efficiency costs by 21% compared to the no-cost option. The left/green column option reduces societal costs by 47% compared to no-cost distribution in a cap-and-trade program. It also lowers costs by approximately 32% compared to lump-sum distribution, thanks to the \"double-dividend\" effect. However, a carbon tax is regressive, with lower-income households facing a greater percentage increase in household income for carbon tax-related costs than higher-income households. The 2007 report suggests that redistributing tax revenues to households in lump-sum payments would result in a more progressive impact on household income. The lowest income brackets would see net gains, while higher income brackets would break even or experience minor losses. Another scenario examined by the study involves workers receiving a tax rebate equal to the payroll taxes paid, which would disproportionately impact the two lowest income brackets. The last scenario in Table 4 proposes equal rebates for social security recipients, aiming for a more progressive distribution of tax-related impacts. This allocation of tax revenue may spark debate among industry and non-industry stakeholders, with concerns about the potential impact on carbon-intensive businesses. Many argue that providing assistance to carbon-intensive industries may be necessary, despite concerns about creating a level playing field for low-carbon energy sources. The impacts of a carbon tax would vary across different industries, with some able to pass on costs more easily than others. Fossil fuel producers and electric utilities are expected to pass on the majority of tax-related costs, leading to potential winners and losers within these sectors. Some industries may face financial gains or losses under a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program. Policymakers may need to consider providing assistance to carbon-intensive industries that may struggle to pass on tax-related costs. Recent legislative proposals in the 110th Congress aimed to assist carbon-intensive industries facing potential financial challenges under a carbon tax system. Representative Larson's carbon tax proposal would have allocated 8% of tax revenues in the first year to negatively affected industries, decreasing to zero by 2018. Additionally, cap-and-trade bills in the same Congress would have allocated a percentage of allowance value to these industries. Experts also emphasize government investment in technology as crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Investment in technology is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restructuring the energy economy. Developing low-carbon technologies can impact the costs of emissions reduction programs. However, the effectiveness of using tax revenues for technological development remains uncertain, as some programs may already be operating at full capacity. A carbon tax could further incentivize technological change in the marketplace. A carbon tax would increase the incentive for low-carbon energy alternatives. Market-based mechanisms like cap-and-trade or carbon tax aim to limit greenhouse gas emissions by placing a price on carbon. Both mechanisms would raise fossil fuel prices, impacting energy users. In an ideal market, either a carbon tax or cap-and-trade could achieve the same outcome, but market imperfections make the choice complex. A carbon tax offers advantages over a cap-and-trade system by providing a known price on carbon, reducing volatility in energy prices, and giving industry better information for investment decisions. However, periodic adjustments may be needed to meet emission reduction goals. Some argue that a carbon tax offers economic efficiency advantages but relies on uncertain costs and benefits of climate change mitigation. It may have implementation benefits like transparency and ease of modification, potentially aiding in reaching GHG reduction agreements with developing nations. However, others believe a cap-and-trade system is better suited for this goal due to uncertainties in emissions reduction. The primary disadvantage of a carbon tax is the uncertainty in emissions outcomes, which may deter some from considering it as an option for controlling GHG emissions. Some argue that a cap-and-trade system offers emissions certainty, but there are concerns about uncertain emissions due to offsets and emissions leakage. Policymakers could consider a tax program with short-term emission fluctuations towards long-term reduction goals, which may be more favorable than price fluctuations in a cap-and-trade system. Some argue that a cap-and-trade system may be easier to garner support for than a tax increase policy due to political stigma. However, a carbon tax and cap-and-trade legislation would fall under different committee jurisdictions in Congress, potentially influencing the debate over the preferred policy instrument. Environmental groups may oppose a carbon tax, fearing it may not be stringent enough to effectively control greenhouse gas emissions. The debate over a carbon tax versus a cap-and-trade program focuses on the differences in cost certainty versus emissions certainty. Design elements within each instrument could blur their distinctions, such as implementing price control mechanisms in a cap-and-trade program. This choice highlights the fundamental argument over stringency in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions."
