    "content": "Obesity is a major public health concern in the United States, with two-thirds of adults and one-third of children being overweight or obese. Weight gain is primarily due to an energy imbalance, where calories consumed exceed calories expended. Various state and local nutrition labeling initiatives have been implemented to address high rates of obesity and chronic disease. The 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act authorized the FDA to require nutrition labeling on most foods and dietary supplements, while the ACA established nutrition labeling requirements for standard menu items in chain restaurants. The FDA regulations require chain restaurants and similar retail food establishments with 20 or more locations to provide calorie and nutrition information on their menu items. The rules were finalized in 2014 to create consistency in labeling requirements across different states and localities. The report discusses the challenges of nutrition labeling requirements for chain food establishments, with support from the National Restaurant Association for a federal standard. It also addresses the role of nutrition labeling in obesity management, FDA regulations on menu calorie labeling, and concerns raised by stakeholders. Data from NHANES shows high obesity rates in the US, with stability in youth rates since 2003-2004. The prevalence of obesity among U.S. adults and children is higher than Healthy People 2020 goals. Obesity is associated with health risks like high blood pressure, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Eating out frequently leads to higher calorie intake and lower nutritional quality. Portion sizes in restaurants have not changed since the mid-1990s, contributing to increased calorie intake. Consumers tend to underestimate the calories in restaurant meals. Changes in obesity rates in the United States have been paralleled by changes in calorie consumption. From 1977-1978 to 2005-2008, daily calorie intake increased from 1,875 to 2,002 calories. The percentage of calories consumed away from home also rose from 18% to 32%. Recent data shows a leveling off of obesity rates, with some age groups even experiencing a decrease. Average calorie intake has declined by 118 calories between 2005-2006 and 2009-2010, with a significant drop in calories from food eaten away from home. Consumer preferences for nutritious foods may be increasing, as evidenced by a decrease in calories consumed away from home and from fast food. Public health stakeholders support restaurant menu labeling as a way to promote healthier dietary choices, although some research suggests it may not significantly impact calorie consumption. The effects of mandatory menu labeling on food choices remain uncertain. The impact of mandatory restaurant menu labeling on food purchasing and health outcomes is uncertain. Studies show mixed findings on the relationship between menu labeling and calorie purchasing behavior. Current research is limited due to varying scope and methodology in existing studies. Existing studies on the impact of mandatory restaurant menu labeling on calorie purchasing behavior are limited in scope and methodology. Studies have shown mixed findings, with some conducted in low-income communities and others focusing on specific restaurant chains. Time frame between implementation and assessment is also a factor, with some studies showing effects only after 18 months. Several studies have examined the impact of menu labeling on calorie purchasing behavior, with mixed findings. Some studies suggest that the effects may take time to manifest, while others point out the limitations of relying on self-reported data. Additionally, these studies focus on calories purchased rather than consumed, which may vary based on dining habits such as sharing meals or taking leftovers home. After the implementation of mandatory calorie labeling in NYC, Starbucks saw a 6% decrease in average calories per transaction, lasting 10 months. This decrease was mainly for food purchases, with a 14% drop in average food calories per transaction. Changes in beverage calories, like substitutions, were not reflected in transaction data. The study assessed the impact of calorie posting on Starbucks revenue in NYC. It found no significant change in revenue, with daily store transactions increasing by 1.4% and revenue per transaction decreasing by 0.8% on average. Stores near Dunkin Donuts saw a 3.3% increase in daily revenue. Surveys were conducted to gauge consumer knowledge of calories in Starbucks products. Consumers at Starbucks tended to inaccurately predict calorie counts in their orders. The calorie-posting law in Seattle led to reduced food purchases as consumers underestimated food calories but overestimated beverage calories. Menu labeling proponents argue that posting calories helps consumers make informed choices. Menu labeling proponents argue that mandatory menu labeling can influence consumer behavior and encourage restaurants to offer healthier options. A study showed a 12% drop in calories in new menu items in anticipation of federal menu-labeling provisions. The FDA has the authority to regulate food products and ingredients, with restaurants exempt from nutrition labeling requirements. The Affordable Care Act amended FFDCA Section 403 to establish nutrition labeling requirements for chain restaurants with 20 or more locations. They must disclose the number of calories in each item as usually prepared and offered for sale. Chain restaurants with 20 or more locations must disclose calorie information for items on menus and menu boards. Additional nutrition information must be provided upon request. Certain food items are exempt from labeling requirements. Covered establishments must have a reasonable basis for nutrient content disclosures. The law requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations to disclose calorie information on menus and menu boards. It also establishes nutrition labeling requirements for vending machine items and amends federal preemption of state and local food labeling requirements. Approximately 298,600 establishments under 2,130 chains would be covered by the menu labeling regulations. The Secretary must establish standards for disclosing nutrient content for standard menu items. The FDA's regulations require chain restaurants with 20 or more locations to disclose calorie information on menus and menu boards. The Secretary must establish standards for disclosing nutrient content for standard menu items, including different flavors or varieties. FDA published rules in 2011 and finalized them in 2014, requiring calorie labeling for food items in restaurants and vending machines. The FDA's regulations mandate menu labeling for chain restaurants with 20 or more locations. Restaurants must offer substantially the same menu items to be subject to the requirements. Establishments can voluntarily register with the FDA to comply. The definition of restaurant or similar retail food establishment is crucial for determining coverage under the rule. In the final rule, FDA defines a restaurant or similar retail food establishment as a retail establishment offering restaurant-type food, excluding schools. This definition impacts various segments of the food industry, with different exemptions for entertainment venues, general merchandise stores, hotels, transportation, grocery, and convenience stores. The final rule by FDA defines restaurants or similar retail food establishments as those offering restaurant-type food, including supermarkets and convenience stores. This decision has sparked debate within the industry over the cost and complexity of implementing menu labeling. The FDA's final rule defines covered establishments as those offering restaurant-type food, including supermarkets and convenience stores. Implementing menu labeling in grocery and convenience stores is seen as costly and complex due to the variety of food forms and seasonal changes. Certain foods are exempt from labeling requirements, such as custom orders and daily specials. The FDA's final rule defines covered establishments as those offering restaurant-type food, including supermarkets and convenience stores. This includes daily specials, temporary menu items, market test items, and condiments available for general use. The proposed definition of restaurant food is \"food served for immediate human consumption on the premises or for takeout, and restaurant-type food is ready for sale but not immediate consumption, processed primarily in a retail establishment.\" The final rule by the FDA defines restaurant-type food as food usually eaten on the premises or soon after arriving at another location, served in restaurants or prepared in retail establishments for sale but not immediate consumption. The rule specifies which foods require labeling and exempts alcoholic beverages. The FDA's final rule defines restaurant-type food as food typically consumed on-site or soon after purchase, excluding alcoholic beverages. Covered establishments must provide calorie information on menus and menu boards, with other nutrition information available upon request. The definition of menu or menu board includes various menu forms like breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus, dessert menus, beverage menus, children's menus, and electronic menus. In the final rule, the FDA determined that take-out and delivery menus would not be considered primary writing solely based on including items for sale. Instead, other factors would determine if certain writing qualifies as the primary selection source for customers, such as including the name, image, and price of standard menu items. The FDA's final rule on menu labeling requires primary writing to include the name, image, and price of standard menu items. Pizza companies argue against in-store menu boards, stating that most orders are placed online or by phone. They propose listing calorie counts online instead. Convenience store representatives also express concerns, stating their food preparation and sales differ from chain restaurants. Chain restaurants and stores within the same chain may offer the same food items but vary in preparation and presentation based on geographic region and market demand. Grocery and convenience stores provide food in various settings like counter areas, self-service stations, and grab-and-go options. Covered establishments must disclose calorie information for standard menu items, with a reasonable basis for nutrition information disclosures. The FDA regulations require calorie information to be displayed next to standard menu items on menus and menu boards in covered establishments. A succinct statement about daily recommended caloric intake must also be provided. Additional nutrition information can be given upon request. Calories must be declared to the nearest 5 or 10-calorie increment based on the food item's calorie content. The term \"Calories\" or \"Cal\" should appear as a heading above a column on menus and menu boards. The FDA proposed the \"80/120 rule\" for nutrient substantiation in menu labeling, allowing a narrow deviation between posted and actual calorie values. Some comments opposed this rule, citing wider variations in restaurant food preparation. The final rule mandates a statement on calorie information for standard menu items. The final rule mandates calorie information to be displayed on menus and menu boards, with specific requirements for calorie declaration and formatting. Additional nutrition information is available upon request. The FDA requires calorie information to be displayed on menus and menu boards, with specific formatting requirements. Nutrient declarations must be accurate and consistent with scientific basis, and establishments must provide information substantiating nutrient values upon request. Industry groups have requested flexibility in calorie labeling requirements, suggesting options such as ranges, averages, or standard offerings. Grocery stores may face challenges with pre-portioned foods for immediate consumption. The Food and Drug Administration requires calorie labeling for food sold in restaurants, salad bars, hot food bars, and vending machines. Domino's Pizza and Pizza Hut offer a wide variety of pizza combinations, making it challenging to list all options on a menu board. Vending machine operators with 20 or more machines must disclose calorie information for food sold. The FDA issued a final rule on calorie labeling for food items in vending machines. Operators can voluntarily register to be covered by the regulation. Vending machines must provide calorie information for foods if not displayed before purchase. The FDA published rules in 2011 for calorie labeling on food items in vending machines, with compliance dates set for December 1, 2015, and December 1, 2016. Compliance was delayed due to legislation, and enforcement was prohibited until December 1, 2016, or one year after final regulations were issued. The FDA issued final guidance on compliance with menu labeling requirements, with enforcement starting on May 5, 2017. Due to industry concerns, the compliance date was extended to May 7, 2018, and for calorie labeling on vending machines to July 26, 2018. Non-compliant menu items in covered establishments would be considered misbranded under FFDCA Section 403. The FDA has the authority to enforce menu labeling requirements, with penalties for non-compliance including recalls and other enforcement actions. The agency estimates that the benefits of the labeling rules exceed costs by $477.9 million annually. The FDA expects the final rules on menu labeling to have costs for both industry and consumers. Industry will incur costs for implementing the rules, including nutrient analysis, menu board purchases, employee training, and legal review. Cost estimates for nutrition analysis vary based on factors like food complexity and analysis method. The FDA estimates that restaurants and SRFEs will need to replace menus and menu boards with calorie information, costing $1 to $3 per menu and $550 per board. Employee training may be required, with legal analysts spending 8 to 12 hours learning about the menu labeling rule requirements. The estimated cumulative cost of legal review for menu labeling rule requirements ranges from $1.6 million to $2.5 million. FDA estimates initial and recurring costs of $397.03 million and $55.13 million, respectively, for complying with the regulations affecting approximately 298,600 establishments. Compliance may lead to price increases for affected food items, potentially impacting consumers. The FDA estimates a recurring cost of $55.13 million for complying with regulations. The total estimated annual cost of the final requirements is $76.90 million (at 3% discount rate) and $84.50 million (at 7% discount rate) over 20 years. There are approximately 8,983 to 11,960 operators with 4.97 million to 5.98 million vending machines. Providing nutrition information at the point of purchase aims to help consumers make healthier dietary choices. Providing nutrition information at the point of purchase can help consumers make informed and healthful dietary choices, potentially reducing caloric intake and obesity. The benefits depend on increased awareness of caloric content, consumer interest in lower-calorie options, and potential menu item reformulation. Studies on menu labeling's impact on calories purchased show mixed results, indicating that simply providing nutrition information may not always lead to healthier decisions. Further research is needed to determine the impact of menu labeling on consumer purchasing behaviors. Some Members of Congress support amending nutrition disclosure requirements for added flexibility, as seen in the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act. This act would allow entities like pizza chains to provide menus online instead of in restaurants and give manufacturers more flexibility in nutrient content analysis. The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act proposes flexibility for establishments with standard menu items in different flavors or varieties to disclose nutritional information using specified methods. Violations of menu labeling requirements must be corrected within 90 days to avoid enforcement action by the Secretary. Regulations would be promulgated to determine and disclose nutrient content for such menu items listed as a single item. The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act allows for flexibility in disclosing nutritional information for standard menu items with different flavors or varieties. Menu labeling compliance dates have been extended multiple times, with opponents arguing that many chains are already complying and consumers want menu labeling. Public health groups have opposed changes to the menu labeling requirements."
