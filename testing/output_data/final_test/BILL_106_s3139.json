    "content": "The \"Secret Evidence Repeal Act of 2000\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 discusses the application of procedures used under the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) to immigration proceedings. In immigration proceedings involving classified information, the Attorney General must notify the alien and presiding officer in advance. Classified information can only be used in specific cases, such as deportation or opposing relief from removal, with a certification required. In immigration proceedings, classified information can be used if it cannot be obtained from open sources. The Attorney General can request the declassification of information for immigration proceedings under the President's Executive Order. If classified information is involved, the presiding officer can refer the matter to the District Court for review. The presiding officer can forward a petition for review to a Federal district court for the district where the alien resides or where the immigration proceedings are pending. Any evidence subject to a petition cannot be considered in the immigration proceeding unless provided in paragraph (3). The immigration proceeding may be suspended pending the district court's decision, and a summary can be submitted in such cases. After a referral under paragraph (1)(A), the district court issues an order to the presiding officer for the use of unclassified summaries of classified information in immigration proceedings. The presiding officer decides on the admissibility of the approved information. The Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) applies to cases involving classified information in immigration proceedings. The Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) applies to aliens in immigration proceedings in the same way as it applies to defendants in criminal proceedings. This includes references to the alien as the subject of the immigration proceeding and to the immigration proceeding itself. The Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) applies to aliens in immigration proceedings, with provisions for termination of the immigration proceeding against an alien and rules for protecting classified information in custody of non-judicial officials. The Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) applies to aliens in immigration proceedings, with rules for protecting classified information in custody of non-judicial officials. Section 12 of CIPA is not applied to immigration proceedings, and the Attorney General will report annually on the implementation of this section to the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The alien's immigration status, benefit applied for, court approval of classified information summary, removal order, or admission/denial of benefit are disclosed in immigration proceedings. Exculpatory evidence must be disclosed as well. In immigration proceedings, the Attorney General must disclose exculpatory evidence to the alien, similar to disclosure requirements in criminal proceedings under CIPA. The alien can also seek access to classified information and initiate actions to declassify information not disclosed. Definitions for \"immigration proceeding\" and \"presiding officer\" are provided in this section. The term 'presiding officer' in immigration proceedings refers to the official overseeing the process. Title V of the Immigration and Nationality Act is repealed, with clerical amendments made to the table of contents. Sec. 295 applies classified information procedures to immigration proceedings. Title V is repealed, and the use of secret evidence in other immigration proceedings is also repealed. The use of secret evidence in other immigration proceedings is repealed. Aliens have the right to examine all evidence against them, present their own evidence, and cross-examine government witnesses. Aliens must meet the burden of proof by having access to relevant documents. SEC. 4. REPEAL OF USE OF SECRET EVIDENCE IN BOND PROCEEDINGS. Amends Section 236 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to ensure aliens' rights in bond proceedings, including the privilege of representation by chosen counsel, the opportunity to examine all evidence, present their own evidence, and cross-examine witnesses. SEC. 5. REPEAL OF USE OF SECRET EVIDENCE AGAINST LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS, ASYLUM SEEKERS, AND ALIENS PAROLED INTO THE UNITED STATES. Amends Section 235(c)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to exclude certain aliens from being subjected to secret evidence, including lawful permanent residents, asylum seekers, and aliens paroled into the United States. The Attorney General must provide detained aliens with a copy of information submitted by the Government ex parte and in camera, allowing for a redetermination of bond or withdrawal of evidence in proceedings. The Attorney General must provide detained aliens with information submitted ex parte and in camera, allowing for release or removal of restrictions unless detention is solely based on disclosed evidence. Additionally, within 30 days, the Attorney General must address aliens seeking immigration benefits opposed by the Government based on such information. The Government must provide detained aliens with information submitted ex parte and in camera, allowing for a response and reconsideration of their application based on public record evidence. Alternatively, the Government can remove any such confidential information and grant de novo reconsideration of the application. The Government must provide detained aliens with information submitted ex parte and in camera for reconsideration of their application based on public record evidence. Alternatively, the Attorney General may terminate immigration proceedings and commence de novo removal proceedings within 10 days under section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Attorney General will issue regulations within 90 days to implement the Act, covering various aspects like asylum, deportation relief, and naturalization. The amendments will apply to all aliens regardless of their entry date."
