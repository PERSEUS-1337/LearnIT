    "content": "The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 established the congressional budget process, requiring the House and Senate to adopt a budget resolution annually. This resolution serves as a statement on revenue, spending, and debt-limit policies, guiding legislation implementation. The House and Senate Budget Committees have exclusive jurisdiction over budget resolutions and enforce policies through various mechanisms. The House and Senate Budget Committees rely on budget projections from the Congressional Budget Office. Budget resolutions are based on assumptions of legislative actions that could change revenue and spending levels. The budget reconciliation process is an optional procedure to enhance the budget resolution process. The reconciliation process enhances Congress's ability to adjust revenue, spending, and debt levels to align with the budget resolution. It involves two stages: first, committees develop legislation based on reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution, and second, the Budget Committees compile these recommendations into a reconciliation bill without changes. The reconciliation process involves two stages: committees develop legislation based on reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution, and the House and Senate consider the resultant reconciliation legislation under expedited procedures. Debate in the Senate is limited to 20 hours, and amendments must be germane. The House Rules Committee recommends a special rule for consideration in the House, placing restrictions on debate time and amendments. In some cases, only one committee reports reconciliation legislation directly to its parent chamber, bypassing the Budget Committee. Budget resolutions may include instructions for multiple reconciliation bills. The reconciliation process involves two stages: committees develop legislation based on reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution. Congress cannot develop another reconciliation bill without adopting another budget resolution after a veto. Reconciliation has been used in most years since 1980, with 19 acts sent to the President, 16 signed into law, and 3 vetoed. The budget reconciliation process involves a list of 19 acts, with examples of measures not considered by both chambers. In 1984, the Deficit Reduction Act was signed into law without being designated as a reconciliation measure. The process reflects a complex set of rules and procedures. The budget reconciliation process in the House and Senate has evolved over time to adapt to changing political and budgetary circumstances. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 allows for flexibility through the \"elastic clause\" to make changes to the budget resolution and reconciliation processes. The House and Senate have utilized the elastic clause to modify reconciliation procedures, including extending the time frame and incorporating innovations into the 1974 act. The reconciliation procedure underwent significant changes, including advancing its use to the spring budget resolution and extending its time frame from one year to multiple years. Originally, the 1974 act required two budget resolutions each year, with the first setting advisory budget levels in the spring and the second setting binding levels in September. Reconciliation was established to quickly make adjustments in existing law or pending legislation to align with changing budget policies between the spring and fall budget resolutions. The House and Senate shifted to adopting a single budget resolution in the spring of each year in the early 1980s, incorporating this change into the 1974 act in 1985. The spring budget resolution gained prominence, initiating reconciliation procedures for FY1981 and extending the budget resolution and reconciliation time frame. The budget resolution and reconciliation time frame was extended to three years, FY1982-FY1984, to allow more time for committees to develop recommendations and for the House and Senate to reconcile differences. The 1974 act was amended to prevent extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation. The Byrd rule under Section 313 of the act has had a significant impact on reconciliation legislation in both the House and Senate. Changes in reconciliation practice have been influenced by political and budgetary factors, with a shift towards reducing revenues in the 1990s and 2000s. Recent reconciliation directives for FY2006 involve reductions in both revenues and spending. The reconciliation process for FY2006 involves reductions in both revenues and spending. The key authorities for reconciliation are outlined in Title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, including basic procedures in Section 310 and a Senate rule in Section 313 to prevent extraneous matter. Other provisions in Title III, such as the timetable in Section 300 and budget resolution authorization in Section 301, also impact the reconciliation process. Section 301 (2 U.S.C. 632) authorizes reconciliation directives in budget resolutions, along with deferred enrollment procedures. Section 305 (2 U.S.C. 636) outlines Senate procedures for budget resolutions and reconciliation measures. Points of order related to timing, budget policies, and committee jurisdiction are found in Sections 302, 303, and 311. Additional points of order for reconciliation measures involve budgetary legislation. Title IV of the act outlines points of order for reconciliation measures related to budgetary legislation. Section 904 imposes a three-fifths vote requirement on waivers and appeals. Reconciliation directives in a budget resolution specify changes in spending, revenues, or public debt limit. Committees are instructed to make necessary changes to achieve budgetary results. Under Section 310(b), committees in the House or Senate submit recommendations to their Budget Committee for reconciliation. The Budget Committee combines these recommendations into an omnibus measure without changes. A reconciliation resolution directs changes to legislation not yet enrolled, typically done through reconciliation bills. Section 310(c) allows flexibility, known as the \"fungibility rule.\" Section 310(c), the \"fungibility rule,\" provides flexibility to committees under reconciliation directives for spending and revenues. It applies mainly to the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. The rule allows committees to comply if recommended legislation keeps spending or revenue changes within 20% of the instructed amount, with the total changes meeting the directive. Section 310(d) mandates amendments in the House and Senate. Section 310(d) requires deficit-neutral amendments in the House and Senate, except during a declaration of war. The Senate allows motions to strike regardless of deficit-neutrality. The House Rules Committee can propose amendments to meet reconciliation instructions if committees fail to submit recommendations. Senate procedures for budget resolutions apply to reconciliation measures, with a 20-hour debate limit. Section 310(f) enforces a June 15 deadline for reconciliation legislation in the House. Section 310(g) of the reconciliation legislation prohibits any reconciliation measure, including special ones related to Social Security, from being considered. The \"Byrd rule,\" named after Senator Robert C. Byrd, originated in 1985 and applies to Senate procedures. The Byrd rule, named after Senator Robert C. Byrd, was adopted by a vote of 96-0 to protect the effectiveness of the reconciliation process by excluding extraneous matter that does not aid deficit reduction efforts. It also aims to preserve the deliberative character of the Senate by excluding legislative matters not central to deficit reduction. The rule defines six categories of extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation and provides points of order against such matter. The Byrd rule, named after Senator Robert C. Byrd, was adopted to exclude extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation that does not aid deficit reduction efforts. It consists of two components that were merged in 1990 and made permanent. There have been no further changes to the rule since 1990. The Byrd rule, named after Senator Robert C. Byrd, was adopted to exclude extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation that does not aid deficit reduction efforts. Procedural provisions affecting the reconciliation process have been included in budget resolutions since 1990, authorized by Section 301(b) of the 1974 act. Examples include restrictions on adjournment without completing reconciliation actions and declarations on the consideration of certain recommendations. The FY2006 budget resolution included a provision requiring a three-fifths vote for waivers and appeals of points of order related to unfunded mandates. The Senate established a \"pay-as-you-go\" (PAYGO) rule in 1993, which prohibits direct spending and revenue legislation that would increase the on-budget deficit in specific time periods. The Senate's \"pay-as-you-go\" (PAYGO) rule requires any increase in direct spending or reduction in revenues to be offset by equivalent cuts or tax increases. Legislation without an offset needs approval from at least 60 Senators. Reconciliation legislation is exempt from the PAYGO rule if assumed in budget resolution levels. When reconciliation is triggered by the budget resolution, spending bills for the upcoming fiscal year may be held at the desk for changes through a reconciliation resolution, avoiding the need for a reconciliation bill. Once changes are made, the spending measures are cleared for the President. Deferred enrollment provisions were seen in budget resolutions in the early 1980s. The methodology for preparing budget baselines and scoring budgetary legislation is outlined in Section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Scoring practices for the congressional budget process, including reconciliation procedures, are influenced by scorekeeping guidelines from the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Guideline number 3 specifically addresses the treatment of reconciliation legislation in certain circumstances, requiring changes in direct spending to be scored against the Appropriations. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 established a special reconciliation process in the Senate tied to deficit targets and PAYGO requirements. Violations would result in sequestration, automatic spending cuts. Section 258C allowed for reconciliation legislation consideration. Section 258C of the 1985 act allowed for reconciliation legislation consideration in the Senate to achieve deficit reductions and avoid sequestration under the PAYGO requirement. Reconciliation directives compel committees to develop legislation to achieve budget resolution goals that require changes in existing law. Reconciliation directives in the Senate compel committees to develop legislation to achieve budget resolution goals, typically expressed in dollar amounts. While these directives do not determine specific budget outcomes for individual programs, in rare cases, they have been framed in programmatic terms. For example, the FY1981 budget resolution instructed the Senate Appropriations Committee to limit subsidies to the U.S. Postal Service. However, a Senate Presiding Officer clarified that reconciliation directives cannot specify changes from certain types of programs. The Budget Committees may suggest options for instructed committees to meet spending or revenue reconciliation directives. A reconciliation directive typically includes identifying the committee, budgetary changes to be achieved, fiscal year periods, and a deadline for recommendations. Reconciliation directives may recommend changes in revenues, spending, and debt limit. Three types of budgetary changes that directives may require include new budget authority, entitlement authority, and credit. Reconciliation directives can recommend changes in revenues, spending, and debt limit. The directives may include new budget authority, entitlement authority, and credit. Spending directives typically focus on direct spending for entitlements and mandatory programs funded by the legislative committees of the House and Senate. Reconciliation directives for direct spending generally specify changes in outlay levels, with the House Budget Committee sometimes specifying the total outlay level post-changes. Committees may recommend changes in offsetting collections or receipts within their jurisdiction during the process. Reconciliation directives can impact discretionary spending levels by instructing committees to reduce spending for the fiscal year in progress. This was seen in the FY1981 and FY1982 budget resolutions, where committees recommended rescissions of annual appropriations to comply with the directives. In 1981, there was a more indirect attempt to reduce discretionary spending through the reconciliation process. In 1981, reconciliation process spending was complicated by directives to reduce authorizations of appropriations, leading to strained relationships between committees. This approach was not revisited due to its complexity and potential extraneous nature under the Byrd rule. Reconciliation directives in Congress have been assigned to various committees, involving changes in revenue levels and outlays. These directives may include deficit reduction goals, which can be achieved through a combination of spending cuts and revenue increases. Compliance with these directives is evaluated on a net basis. Reconciliation directives in Congress involve achieving deficit reduction goals through spending cuts and revenue increases. Compliance is judged on a net basis, with instructions to reduce spending or increase revenues including a minimum target for reduction or increase. The public debt limit is codified in Title 31, United States Code, with periodic adjustments made through amendments. The public debt limit in the United States is adjusted through amendments to 31 U.S.C.3101(b), typically by changing the dollar limitation. While adjustments have mostly been increases, there have been instances of reductions or extensions. Committees in Congress, such as the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, have jurisdiction over the debt limit. Budget resolutions may include contingent reconciliation directives for changes in spending or revenue. The FY1998 budget resolution allowed for adjustments to committee directives, including a $16 billion children's health initiative, contingent on excess outlay savings to maintain deficit neutrality. In some cases, reconciliation directives became effective upon the fulfillment of a contingency, as seen in the FY1996 budget resolution. The Congressional Budget Office projected that reconciliation legislation would achieve a balanced budget by FY2002. Multiple committees in the House and Senate received spending reconciliation directives, except for FY2002 and FY2004 when the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee were instructed regarding outlays to accommodate changes in revenue laws. The number of House and Senate committees receiving spending reconciliation directives in a budget resolution varied, ranging from one to 14 for the Senate and 15 for the House. Reconciliation directives to change the statutory limit on public debt are given to a single committee in each chamber due to jurisdiction. Ways and Means Committee and Finance Committee primarily handle reconciliation directives to change revenue levels, but other committees may also receive such instructions. The Senate Finance Committee received a two-part reconciliation directive in the FY1998 budget resolution, with instructions to reduce outlays and increase the statutory limit on public debt. Seven other Senate committees also received instructions to reduce spending or the deficit. The Senate Finance Committee received a directive to reduce spending and raise the debt limit in the FY1998 budget resolution. Seven other Senate committees were also instructed to reduce spending or the deficit. The Finance Committee could develop reconciliation legislation to achieve these goals, with limitations on the number of bills allowed for each type of budgetary change. The FY2006 budget resolution directed Senate committees to reduce spending, increase revenues, and raise the debt limit, resulting in potential reconciliation measures. House practices allow for more flexibility in developing multiple reconciliation bills. For example, the FY1997 budget resolution allowed for consideration of three separate reconciliation measures in the House. The HouseBudget Committee explains that the multi-reconciliation process offers flexibility to achieve changes in spending and tax relief. The House's reconciliation packaging is constrained compared to the Senate's, with 18 budget resolutions from FY1981 to FY2006 containing reconciliation directives. The House Budget Committee explains that the reconciliation process offers flexibility for changes in spending and tax relief. 18 budget resolutions from FY1981 to FY2006 contained reconciliation directives, aiming to reduce the deficit or increase the surplus. House and Senate committees received comparable reconciliation directives during this period. The House Budget Committee utilized reconciliation directives in 18 budget resolutions from FY1981 to FY2006 to improve budgetary posture, aiming to change deficits into surpluses or reduce deficits. For example, the FY1991 resolution projected a deficit turning into a surplus over five years. The House Budget Committee used reconciliation directives in budget resolutions from FY1981 to FY2006 to improve the budget, aiming to change deficits into surpluses or reduce deficits. The reconciliation directives included revenue increases, spending decreases, or a combination of both to eliminate or reduce the deficit. Data for the FY1996, FY1997, and FY1998 resolutions are not precise, but generally regarded as effective. The reconciliation directives in budget resolutions from FY1981 to FY2006 aimed to improve the budget by reducing deficits. The directives included revenue increases, spending decreases, or a combination of both. The FY2000-FY2002, FY2004, and FY2006 resolutions recommended net reductions in the surplus or increases in the deficit, ranging from $35 billion to $1.350 trillion over various timeframes. These resolutions allocated portions of projected surpluses for tax cuts, with larger final year surpluses estimated than in the first year. The FY2006 budget resolution included reconciliation directives for revenue reductions of $70 billion over five years and outlay reductions of $35 billion over six years. Despite aggregate reductions in the surplus, the budget resolution aimed for a surplus of $36.8 billion by the final year. The budget resolutions for FY1985, FY1989, FY1992, FY1993, and FY1995 did not include reconciliation directives. The \"revenue changes\" column reflects directives to change revenue levels, while the \"outlay changes\" column reflects directives to change outlay levels or achieve deficit reduction. Net decreases in the deficit also refer to net increases. The budget resolution reflects on-budget deficit or surplus, while tables in the joint explanatory statement show total deficit or surplus including off-budget funds. Outlay changes and net decreases exclude reconciled reductions in authorizations. Reconciliation directives in budget resolutions were not expressed as amounts of change from baseline levels. The reconciliation directives in budget resolutions were not expressed as amounts of change from baseline levels, but rather as levels of revenue and direct spending outlays. The expected revenue reduction over multiyear periods was indicated in joint explanatory statements for each fiscal year. Direct spending reductions in reconciliation directives to Senate committees resulted in estimated net savings of $387.1 billion over seven years in FY1996, $228.9 billion over six years in FY1997, and $52.2 billion over five years in FY1998. The FY1998 budget resolution included detailed information on reconciliation directives to House committees and overall deficit or surplus levels in budget resolutions for FY1981-FY2006. Sources for the information included various conference reports and committee reports from different fiscal years. The FY1998 budget resolution included reconciliation directives to House committees and deficit/surplus levels in budget resolutions for FY1981-FY2006. Information was sourced from conference reports and committee reports from different fiscal years. The reconciliation directives in budget resolutions for FY1981-FY2006 applied to the budget year and ensuing fiscal years, with some exceptions for FY2002 and FY2004. Directives were given to the House Ways and Means Committee to change revenue levels, and to all House committees to change outlay levels or achieve deficit reduction. The budget resolution for FY1981 included reconciliation directives to reduce spending for deficit reduction. The total deficit or surplus levels are reflected in tables accompanying the conference report. Reconciliation directives for FY1980 included $1.0 billion in savings from outlays to Appropriations Committees. $343.1 billion in \"other changes\" and \"net savings\" excluded $42.953 billion in reconciled reductions in authorizations. Reconciliation directives for FY1996-FY1998 focused on revenue and direct spending outlays levels resulting from changes. Revenue reduction expectations were detailed in joint explanatory statements for each fiscal year. The reconciliation directives for FY1996-FY1998 resulted in estimated net savings of $387.1 billion over seven years, $228.9 billion over six years, and $52.2 billion over five years, respectively. The House actions during this process included developing legislative recommendations, preparing an omnibus measure, establishing special rules for reconciliation legislation, and conducting floor consideration. The reconciliation directives instruct committees to recommend legislative changes to meet budgetary targets by a certain date. Committees follow normal legislative procedures and are expected to comply with relevant House rules when developing recommendations. Clause 2(h)(1) of House Rule XI requires committees to meet with a majority quorum present to report reconciliation recommendations. Committees often hold hearings before marking up recommendations. In 1997, instructed committees conducted oversight and legislative hearings related to reconciliation recommendations. House committees typically follow a standard markup process where the legislative text is read in full and then section by section for amendment. During the markup process, committees consider amendments to the legislative text under a five-minute rule before voting to report the legislation to the House or the House Budget Committee. The key decision is selecting the text to be considered, which can be a bill referred to the committee or draft legislation developed by the committee's staff in response to reconciliation directives. During the markup process, committees select the legislative text to consider amendments. Committees may use original legislative language, committee prints, or introduced bills as the markup text. In some cases, committees have considered bills introduced and referred to them directly. In 2003, the House Ways and Means Committee marked up H.R. 2 in response to reconciliation directives from the FY2004 budget resolution. Reconciliation directives in a budget resolution specify deadlines for committees to report legislative recommendations. Committees can report directly to the House or submit recommendations to the House Budget Committee to comply with reconciliation directives. When committees receive reconciliation directives, they must report legislative recommendations either directly to the parent chamber or to the House Budget Committee. The submission material required includes supplemental views, cost estimates, and committee rollcall votes. The Budget Committee typically requests specific material to be submitted by instructed committees for reconciliation recommendations, including legislative text, summary of policy decisions, section-by-section description, oversight findings, constitutional authority statement, committee votes, performance goals, and minority views. The Budget Committee requests material from instructed committees for reconciliation recommendations. Ways and Means Committee submitted recommendations to Budget Committee and reported legislation directly to the House. Some committees reported reconciliation legislation directly to the House. In 1982, four committees reported individual reconciliation measures to the House, which were later incorporated into an omnibus bill. Each instructed committee is expected to comply with reconciliation directives. The committee is expected to comply with reconciliation directives by submitting recommendations by the specified date and proposing legislative changes to existing law for budgetary changes. The House Rules Committee may allow amendments to achieve compliance if committees fail to submit their recommendations on time. In the past, some committees have submitted recommendations late or not at all. In 1995, nine of the 12 instructed committees submitted their reconciliation recommendations after the deadline, but all tardy submissions were included in the reconciliation measure reported by the Budget Committee. In some cases, committees did not submit any legislative recommendations, leading the House Rules Committee to make amendments to satisfy their directives. For example, in 1995, an amendment by then-Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich achieved compliance for the House Agriculture Committee. The House Budget Committee plays a significant role in developing reconciliation legislation when multiple committees are directed to recommend legislative changes. Each committee must submit its recommendations to the Budget Committee by a specified date. Once all recommendations are received, the Budget Committee is required to report reconciliation legislation to the House. The Budget Committee incorporates directed committees' recommendations into an omnibus reconciliation measure without substantive revisions. During the markup, amendments are not allowed, but motions can be made to request certain amendments through the Rules Committee. The Budget Committee chairman requests amendments through the Rules Committee during the markup of bills. Committee reports include an overview of reconciliation measures and comments on compliance with directives. The Budget Committee chairman requests amendments through the Rules Committee during the markup of bills. Committee reports include an overview of reconciliation measures and comments on compliance with directives. The legislative recommendations submitted by committees usually include a section-by-section analysis and cost estimates prepared by the Congressional Budget Office. The House considers major legislation under special rules developed by the House Rules Committee. The House Rules Committee is responsible for developing special rules for considering measures on the House floor, including reconciliation directives. Reconciliation measures are typically considered under special rules reported by the Rules Committee, with most being agreed to by the House. Only a few special rules have been amended or rejected in the past. The special rule for reconciliation measures includes provisions for general debate, limited amendments, debate time allocation, waiver of points of order, and a motion to recommit. General debate time has ranged from one to 10 hours, with allocation changes over the years. The special rule for reconciliation measures typically divides debate time equally between the chair and ranking minority member of the committee. Amendments to the bill are limited, with some instances of no floor amendments allowed. Self-executing provisions have been included in special rules since the mid-1980s. The special rule for reconciliation measures often limits floor amendments, with some allowing only one or two amendments. Self-executing provisions, like those in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, have been included in special rules since the mid-1980s. In 1989, special rules limited debate on floor amendments for reconciliation bills, with debate times ranging from 20 minutes to four hours. Points of order against the bill or amendments were often waived, with some exceptions. During House floor consideration of reconciliation measures, special rules typically govern the process. Out of 29 reconciliation measures from 1980 to 2003, 23 were considered under special rules, while the rest were handled through different procedures like \"suspension of the rules\" or unanimous consent. Some special rules allowed motions to recommit with instructions, but four explicitly prohibited such motions. During House floor consideration of reconciliation measures under a special rule, key elements impacting the measure include amendments, points of order, and motions to recommit. The special rule limits floor amendments to those made in order, with the number of amendments offered ranging from one to 10. In some cases, amendments made in order were not offered or were withdrawn by a Member. During House floor consideration of reconciliation measures under a special rule, amendments play a crucial role. Out of 30 floor amendments offered, 19 were agreed to and 11 were rejected. The success rate of amendments has varied over the years, with a higher success rate in the early 1980s compared to recent years. During House floor consideration of reconciliation measures, amendments are crucial. Out of 30 floor amendments, 19 were accepted and 11 rejected. Over half of these amendments were offered to one reconciliation measure in 1989. Reconciliation bills must adhere to House rules and budget enforcement procedures. During House floor consideration of reconciliation measures, amendments are crucial. Amendments must be deficit neutral and adhere to House rules and budget enforcement procedures. Special rules often waive points of order against the bill and floor amendments, but some exceptions exist where points of order can be raised. During House floor consideration of reconciliation measures, special rules can waive points of order against the bill and floor amendments. In 1985, a special rule for H.R. 3500 waived certain points of order under Rule XXI, but exceptions allowed points of order to be raised against provisions with appropriations or tax measures not within committee jurisdiction. Representative Sidney Yates and Representative Dan Rostenkowski raised points of order during the consideration of H.R. 3500. Points of order were raised against provisions containing tax measures in a reconciliation bill, leading to those provisions being removed. Motions to recommit can be made with or without instructions, with debate time allocated accordingly. Motions to recommit reconciliation bills were offered with instructions, but all were rejected. In one instance in 2003, a motion to recommit with instructions was ruled not germane to the bill. Another motion with instructions was subsequently rejected. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 incorporated H.R. 6955, except for H.R. 6782 which became public law separately. The House Budget Committee issued a report on efforts to reduce the federal deficit. H.R. 3500 was incorporated into H.R. 3128 after passage by the House. Special rules for reconciliation measures in the House from FY1981-FY2005 are detailed in tables provided by the Congressional Research Service. The House passed an amendment by a vote of 245-176. The Senate's reconciliation process involves legislative recommendations, omnibus measure preparation, floor consideration, and the \"Byrd rule.\" The reconciliation directives in the budget resolution guide Senate committees on developing legislative recommendations to comply with the directives. Committees must submit recommendations to the Budget Committee by a deadline or report legislation directly to the Senate. Committees follow Senate rules and their own committee rules when developing recommendations. The Senate Budget Committee provides guidelines to instructed committees on procedural requirements and scoring conventions for reconciliation recommendations. They also advise on drafting considerations to avoid confusion when compiling recommendations into a single measure. The instructed committees maintain an ongoing relationship with the Budget Committee during the process of developing their legislative recommendations. Consultations occur to foster a clear understanding of procedural requirements, assess compliance issues, and seek guidance from various offices. Committees also consult with CBO and JCT on budgetary implications and seek support from other relevant entities. Senate Rule XXVI outlines basic requirements for committee procedures in conducting legislative activities. Committees often hold hearings before marking up legislative recommendations, as seen in the example of the Senate Finance Committee holding multiple hearings on revenue reconciliation measures in 1997. Topics covered included the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, Individual Retirement Account proposals, capital gains and losses, the Administration's FY1998 budget, and tax proposals. Committees may originate legislation in the markup process, such as by considering a \"chairman's mark\" that can be altered by amendments. Before submitting reconciliation legislation, the committee must meet to approve the legislation and relevant amendments by a majority vote. A majority presence is required for voting, or a point of order may be raised to prevent consideration on the Senate floor. The committee must comply with reporting requirements in various sections of the 1974 act, including cost estimates and assessments of unfunded mandates prepared by CBO and JCT. CBO and JCT estimates must be included in committee reports if available in a timely manner. Additionally, a tax complexity analysis is required for revenue legislation reported by specific committees. The Senate Finance Committee or a conference committee handles measures amending the Internal Revenue Code with widespread applicability. Committee submissions to the Budget Committee include legislative text, committee report language, CBO or JCT estimates, and a transmittal letter. The committee report language may include additional views or dissenting views from members. During the development of reconciliation legislation, committees submit legislative recommendations to the Budget Committee, which may include CBO or JCT estimates. Sometimes estimates are omitted initially but later included in the Budget Committee's report. Committees can also publish their recommendations separately. In the 105th Congress, two reconciliation acts were enacted in one year. During the 105th Congress, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 showcased the complexity involved in reconciliation legislation. The initial Senate version of the spending reconciliation measure, Balanced Budget Act (S. 947), was reported in June 1997. The Senate Finance Committee submitted a 126-page report as part of the Budget Committee's 241-page print, with additional details provided in a separate 474-page print. The Senate version of the revenue reconciliation measure, Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (S. 949), was reported to the Senate by the Finance Committee in June. The Budget Committee's role in preparing omnibus reconciliation legislation is considered ministerial, but it must ensure accuracy and completeness in carrying out legislative recommendations without substantive revision. The Budget Committee ensures completeness and accuracy of responses from instructed committees. Technical corrections are made as needed, such as in the case of welfare reform legislation in 1996. Chairman Lugar and Ranking Member Leahy requested corrections to four provisions in a submission. The Budget Committee ensures completeness and accuracy of responses from instructed committees, making technical corrections as needed. Chairman Domenici and Chairman Roth addressed issues with submissions, clarifying that only instructed committees have authority to make changes. Dealing with tardy responses poses a challenge for the Budget Committee, with the initial practice being to extend deadlines when necessary to maintain the integrity of reconciliation measures. The Budget Committee may extend deadlines for tardy committee submissions to preserve the integrity of reconciliation measures. Deadlines have been extended in the past in various steps or by larger margins to accommodate late responses. The Budget Committee may exercise discretion in waiting for responses to include them in the omnibus. The Budget Committee has discretion in waiting for tardy committee responses to include them in the omnibus reconciliation measure. While there is a deadline for committee submissions, the Budget Committee is only obligated to report the measure upon receiving all recommendations. It is expected to report promptly, but may choose to proceed without all responses and address any omissions during floor consideration. The Budget Committee evaluates compliance by the responding committees in meeting the goals of reconciliation directives. It assesses spending and revenue levels against instructed levels, making adjustments as needed. In 1995, the Budget Committee adjusted estimates provided by CBO and JCT due to a change in the enactment date, leading to reduced savings attributed to the Armed Services Committee for FY1996. This change caused some committees to miss their fiscal year 1996 reconciliation instruction. The Budget Committee adjusted estimates in 1995 due to a change in the enactment date, causing some committees to miss their FY1996 reconciliation instruction. The Armed Services Committee complied with the budget resolution's instructions for FY1996, meeting the criteria for compliance including the \"fungibility rule.\" The fungibility rule applies to Senate or House committees subject to reconciliation directives in a budget resolution. It deems compliance if recommended legislation does not exceed or fall below spending and revenue changes by more than 20% and the total changes recommended meet the directives. The rule allows the Senate Budget Committee chairman to make adjustments in the budget resolution levels and committee spending allocations. The fungibility rule applies to Senate or House committees under reconciliation directives in a budget resolution. It allows committees to achieve deficit reduction by adjusting outlay reductions and revenue increases, as long as the total meets the directive. The rule was described in a 1993 print of the Senate Budget Committee, illustrating how committees can adjust their targets within a 20% margin. The fungibility rule allows Senate and House committees to adjust outlay reductions and revenue increases to achieve deficit reduction as long as the total meets the directive. The rule applies primarily to the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee. The Senate's \"Byrd rule\" also assesses committee compliance with reconciliation directives by barring extraneous matter in legislation. The Parliamentarian plays a key role in assessing compliance with reconciliation directives and determining if provisions are within jurisdiction. The Budget Committee reports legislative recommendations without a written report to expedite the reconciliation process. The Budget Committee issues a committee print to explain legislation instead of a written report. They cannot make substantive revisions to an omnibus reconciliation bill. Strategies for addressing non-compliance may be evaluated with leadership for Senate floor consideration. Senate procedure for reconciliation measures is guided by Section 310 of the 1974 act. Section 310(e) of the 1974 act applies procedures for reconciliation measures in the Senate, with a 20-hour debate limit. Congress should complete reconciliation by June 15, enforced in the House but not in the Senate. Reconciliation measures must comply with the budget. Reconciliation measures must comply with budget enforcement procedures in the 1974 act and annual budget resolutions. Spending and revenue levels must not exceed allocations or drop below established floors, and no policy matters within the Budget Committee's jurisdiction can be included. Senate completed action on 19 reconciliation acts from 1980-2004, subject to points of order requiring a three-fifths vote to waive. In response to reconciliation directives in budget resolutions, the Senate considered single or multiple reconciliation measures in different years, resulting in the enactment of multiple acts. The Senate typically starts with a single reconciliation measure, either from the Budget Committee or Finance Committee, before moving to conference with the House by incorporating the Senate-passed measure into the House-passed reconciliation measure. This process is crucial for finalizing reconciliation acts. The Senate follows a procedure to ensure revenue measures originate in the House, passing a House-numbered bill to abide by the constitutional requirement. Different legislative actions have occurred, such as considering separate original Senate bills for revenue and spending reconciliation instructions before incorporating them into the House-passed reconciliation bill. The Senate has taken various actions on reconciliation measures, including considering separate revenue and spending bills before incorporating them into the House-passed reconciliation bill. The Finance Committee reported original Senate bills for revenue reconciliation instructions in 2001 and 2003, but the Senate ultimately considered House-passed reconciliation bills instead. The Senate typically completes initial action on reconciliation measures within two to four days. The Senate typically completes initial action on reconciliation measures within two to four days, with the Finance Committee reporting omnibus reconciliation bills without a written report. The Finance Committee reports reconciliation legislation directly to the Senate, with debate limitations on amendments and motions. Control of time is divided between majority and minority leaders, with Budget Committee members serving as floor managers. Time for amendments is controlled by the proposing Senator. The Senate's reconciliation process involves time control by the proposing Senator and majority or minority managers. Debate on amendments, motions, and quorum calls is limited to 20 hours, but time for reading amendments or voting is not counted. Consideration can extend beyond 20 hours due to a large number of amendments, while debate time can be reduced by yielding back time or nondebatable motions. Restrictions on amendments in the reconciliation process include the requirement that amendments must be germane, with certain exceptions. Once matter is stricken from a measure by amendment, it cannot be used to justify germaneness, but matter added by amendment can be used as a basis for additional amendments. An exception to the germaneness requirement is made in connection with a motion to recommit with instructions. In the reconciliation process, amendments must be germane, with exceptions. A motion to recommit with instructions allows addressing matters not in the original recommendations. Section 310(d) prohibits amendments reducing outlays or increasing revenues below instructed amounts. Section 310(g) bars certain considerations. Section 310(g) prohibits reconciliation legislation containing recommendations regarding Social Security, including the OASDI program under Title II of the Social Security Act. The Byrd rule in Section 313 also restricts reconciliation legislation with extraneous matter, reinforcing the prohibition on Social Security recommendations. A three-fifths vote is required to override these restrictions. An amendment may need a three-fifths vote to waive or appeal the chair's ruling. It must be germane and have a budgetary effect to avoid violating the Byrd rule. Motions to recommit can bring committee recommendations into compliance, with restrictions on the type of motions allowed. Amendments proposed through a motion to recommit must be germane unless necessary for compliance. The number of amendments offered to reconciliation measures has increased over time. When the 20-hour debate limit is reached, Senators may continue to consider amendments and motions to recommit, known as \"vote-arama.\" Accelerated voting procedures may be implemented during a vote-arama scenario, allowing two minutes of debate per amendment. During the consideration of recent reconciliation measures, the Senate dealt with numerous amendments and motions under a vote-arama scenario, with a 10-minute limit per vote. In 2000, 2001, and 2003, a total of 162 amendments and motions were considered. For example, in 2000, the Senate debated 37 amendments and a motion to recommit under unanimous consent agreements, without taking final action. During the consideration of recent reconciliation measures, the Senate dealt with numerous amendments and motions under a vote-arama scenario, with a 10-minute limit per vote. In 2000, 2001, and 2003, a total of 162 amendments and motions were considered. The Senate considered H.R. 1836 on May 17, 21, 22, and 23, 2001, with a procedure limiting debate time for each amendment. 37 amendments and one motion to recommit were considered, with 10 amendments adopted, three rejected, seven falling on a point of order, and 17 withdrawn. During the consideration of recent reconciliation measures, the Senate dealt with numerous amendments and motions under a vote-arama scenario. In 2000, 2001, and 2003, a total of 162 amendments and motions were considered. The Senate considered H.R. 1836 on May 17, 21, 22, and 23, 2001, with a procedure limiting debate time for each amendment. 37 amendments and one motion to recommit were considered, with 10 amendments adopted, three rejected, seven falling on a point of order, and 17 withdrawn. During the Senate's consideration of amendments on May 15, a total of 65 amendments were discussed. 30 were adopted, nine rejected, 19 fell on a point of order, and seven were withdrawn. 26 amendments were set aside before the 20-hour limit expired and later considered under accelerated voting procedures, resulting in eight adoptions, 14 falling on a point of order, and four withdrawals. The legislation contained provisions that were extraneous to budget resolution policies, including those that had no budgetary effect or violated jurisdiction. Reconciliation procedures limited debate and amendments, deviating from Senate practices. Senators were willing to restrict freedoms for reconciliation legislation but wanted to confine its scope to budgetary purposes. The Byrd rule was adopted in 1985 and 1986 to address these concerns. The Byrd rule, named after Senator Robert C. Byrd, was initially adopted in 1985 and 1986 to curb extraneous provisions in legislation not related to budgetary purposes. It has since been extended and modified, becoming permanent in 1990 as Section 313 of the Congressional Budget Act. The rule allows for points of order to strike extraneous matter from bills or prevent their inclusion through amendments or motions. The Byrd rule allows points of order to remove extraneous provisions from legislation, requiring a three-fifths vote to waive the rule. Once material is stricken under the Byrd rule, it cannot be reintroduced as an amendment. The Byrd rule allows points of order to remove extraneous provisions from legislation with a three-fifths vote to waive the rule. The Senate Budget Committee determines budgetary levels for enforcing the Byrd rule, and definitions of extraneous matter are provided in subsection (b)(1) of the rule. The Byrd rule defines extraneous matter as provisions not related to reconciliation process goals, with six specific criteria for determining extraneousness. The Byrd rule defines extraneous matter as provisions not related to reconciliation process goals, with specific criteria for determining extraneousness. This includes provisions that increase the deficit, recommend changes in Social Security, or do not produce a change in outlays or revenues. Exceptions can be made if certified by certain committee members. The Byrd rule outlines criteria for determining extraneous provisions in the reconciliation process, including those that increase the deficit or do not impact outlays or revenues. Exceptions can be made based on committee jurisdiction or if reliable estimates cannot be made due to insufficient data. The Byrd rule, applied to reconciliation measures, allows for the removal of extraneous provisions that do not impact outlays or revenues. It has been used successfully in various cases, with opponents striking extraneous matter or blocking extraneous amendments through points of order. The rule has been waived in some instances to retain or add extraneous matter. Additionally, the House and Senate typically pass their own reconciliation measures before considering conference reports. Reconciliation measures are complex and lengthy legislation, ensuring differences between House and Senate bills. Both chambers must agree on the same reconciliation measure before sending it to the President. They use usual legislative procedures and practices, with conferences often used to develop agreements on reconciliation legislation. The House and Senate convened a conference on the reconciliation measure, with the Senate typically considering one or two bills before amending the House-passed bill for conference. In 1982, there was an exception to this pattern. The House and Senate may use an amendment exchange instead of a conference to resolve differences on legislation. In some cases, like with the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, the Senate receded and concurred with a further amendment after a successful point of order raised under the Byrd rule. The Senate resolved a disagreement by receding and concurring with a further amendment that removed the offending matter. The second chamber requests a conference with the first chamber to resolve disagreements, appoints conferees, and convenes a conference committee to work on reconciliation legislation. In the House and Senate, conferees are appointed to resolve disagreements and negotiate over the entire bill or specific portions in conference. The Speaker appoints conferees in the House, while the Senate authorizes the Presiding Officer to appoint them. Conferees can be general, negotiating over the entire bill, or limited-purpose, focusing on specific aspects designated at the time of appointment. Conferees appointed in the House and Senate work to resolve disagreements and negotiate over the entire bill or specific portions in conference. General conferees appointed by the Speaker and the Presiding Officer, along with committee members, work to reconcile legislative language and facilitate timely resolution of policy disagreements. Replacements may be appointed when necessary, and conferees are chosen from committees that submitted reconciliation recommendations. Conferences on reconciliation measures involve conferees chosen from committees in each chamber to address a wide range of issues. The largest conference, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982, included 184 Representatives and 69 Senators. The Reconciliation Act of 1982 involved 184 Representatives and 69 Senators, with 58 subconferences established informally. Members are assigned to subconferences based on their committee's jurisdiction. Senate conferees have broader roles, requiring a majority to sign off on the conference report. Motions may be considered in either chamber to instruct conferees before going to conference on a measure. In either chamber, motions can instruct conferees on positions but are not binding. In the House, motions can be made before, during, and after conferees are appointed. Preference is given to minority party members for offering instructions. In the Senate, motions to instruct can only be offered before the appointment of conferees, but Senators can also instruct their conferees through resolutions and amendments. Motions to instruct conferees are less common in the Senate compared to the House, where minority party members are given preference for offering instructions. In the House, motions to instruct conferees on reconciliation measures have been regularly made, with examples dating back to 1980. For instance, in 1997, motions were made for both reconciliation bills that year, with one being approved and the other rejected. The Ways and Means Committee's motion to instruct conferees on the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 was rejected by a vote of 199-233. In the Senate, motions to instruct conferees have been considered on various bills, with examples dating back to 1981 and 1989. During the consideration of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, the Senate adopted three out of four motions to instruct conferees. These motions can be amended, as seen in a 1993 example where a motion was amended and agreed to by a vote of 415-0. Procedures for House-Senate conferences are informal, with conferees having flexibility. The chairmanship rotates between House and Senate members. When conferees agree on a reconciliation measure, they submit a conference report detailing the resolution. The conference report and joint explanatory statement explain the actions taken by conferees to resolve disagreements, with signatures required for support. The conference report must be signed by all House and Senate conferees for validity. It is published as a House report and in the Congressional Record. Conference reports are privileged matters and can be called up for consideration as a priority. In the Senate, motions to proceed to the consideration of a conference report are not debatable. Conference reports are typically debated for one hour in the House, but in the Senate, they can be debated for up to 10 hours. Special rules in the House have provided waivers for points of order and extended debate times on major legislation. The Byrd rule in the Senate allows for extraneous matter to be removed from conference reports on reconciliation measures. The Byrd rule in the Senate allows for extraneous matter to be stricken from a conference report through a successful point of order. This process enables the Senate to remove offending language without rejecting the entire report, reaching final agreement by resolving disagreements through further amendments. Customized procedures can be established through unanimous consent agreements during consideration of conference reports. In July of 1997, the Senate considered reconciliation measures under a unanimous consent agreement that suspended the Byrd rule under certain circumstances. This allowed for long-term tax cuts to be offset by spending reductions. In 1982, the House recommitted a conference report on the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 to the existing conference committee. The House recommitted the conference report on the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 to the conference committee by a vote of 266-145. The conference committee reported a second agreement (H.Rept.97-759) which was accepted by both chambers. If either chamber disagrees with the conference report, the matter can be resolved through a motion or by sending it to a further conference. Title 1, Section 107 of the United States Code requires measures to be enrolled on parchment paper. To expedite enrollment, the requirement can be waived by a joint resolution. For example, H.J.Res. 90 waived enrollment requirements for reconciliation measures H.R. 2014 and H.R. 2015, becoming P.L.105-32 on August 1, 1997. Technical corrections can also be made before enrollment by adopting a concurrent resolution. Enrollment correction measures for reconciliation acts can originate in the House or Senate. Technical corrections were made in past acts like the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 and 1983. Reconciliation measures follow the same legislative path as other legislation, and the President has 10 days to approve or disapprove a bill. If Congress adjourns during this period, the bill becomes law without the President's signature. If Congress adjourns sine die during the 10-day period, the bill is disapproved by \"pocket veto.\" The President can veto the bill, which is then returned to the originating chamber for a possible override. The Line Item Veto Act in 1996 granted the President line-item veto authority, used by President Clinton in 1997 but nullified by the Supreme Court in 1998. 19 reconciliation acts have been sent to the President, with 16 signed into law. Eleven were signed by Republican Presidents. During congressional deliberations on reconciliation legislation, the President may signal approval through Statements of Administration Policy (SAPs). These signals are more significant if congressional action differs significantly from the President's recommendations, potentially leading to a veto threat if policy adjustments are not made. The President often signs reconciliation legislation into law in an official ceremony attended by Members of Congress and other officials. Any official statements and remarks made during the event are included in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents. Three reconciliation acts sent to the President were vetoed by President Bill Clinton due to significant policy changes proposed by Republican majorities in Congress. Congress proposed reconciliation measures that clashed with President Clinton's agenda. Statements of Administration Policy (SAPs) were used to influence Congress to adopt favored policies and drop others. SAPs could include veto threats if necessary changes weren't made. President Clinton vetoed three reconciliation acts, with SAPs clearly expressing his opposition. The SAP issued on July 27, 1999, expressed President Clinton's strong opposition to the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. The President made it clear that he would veto any bill containing the tax cut proposals. When the President vetoes a bill, he sends it back to the House with an explanation of his objections. President Clinton's veto message regarding the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 highlighted extreme cuts proposed by the Republican majority. The reconciliation bill, opposed by President Clinton, includes extreme cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, and tax increases for working Americans. The veto message outlined programmatic objections and specific concerns by program area. If a vetoed bill is passed by both chambers with a two-thirds vote, it becomes law despite the President's objections. The reconciliation bills vetoed by President Clinton were returned to the House with House numbers. The bills were referred to either the House Budget Committee or the House Ways and Means Committee. A discharge motion for the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000 was successful, but the bill failed to pass with the necessary two-thirds majority. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 was also vetoed and returned to the House. The Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999 (H.R. 2488) and the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000 (H.R. 4810) were both vetoed by President Clinton and referred to the Ways and Means Committee. The House took no further action on the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act, while a discharge motion for the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act was tabled and failed to pass. The House failed to reconsider three vetoed reconciliation bills, including the Line Item Veto Act which became law in 1996. The Act incorporated procedures into the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. However, in 1998, the Line Item Veto Act was nullified by the Supreme Court in Clinton v. City of New York. The Supreme Court nullified the Line Item Veto Act in 1998 in Clinton v. City of New York. The Court rejected the argument that the President's power to cancel items was discretionary and stated that it represented the repeal of law that should go through the regular legislative process. The President could cancel discretionary budget authority, new direct spending, or limited tax benefits to reduce the deficit, as long as it didn't harm essential government functions or the national interest. The Line Item Veto Act allowed the President to cancel provisions in an act within five days of signing it into law. Congress could disapprove cancellations through expedited procedures. In July 1997, reconciliation measures were passed for tax cuts and deficit reduction. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reduced direct spending by $122 billion over five years and increased the public debt limit to $5.950 trillion. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 included tax cuts offset by revenue increases, resulting in a net revenue reduction of $95 billion. President Clinton signed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 into law on August 5. He also used the Line Item Veto Act to cancel spending items and tax benefits, marking the first use of this authority. The Line Item Veto Act allowed the President to cancel limited tax benefits identified in revenue or reconciliation measures. A total of 80 limited tax benefits were found in two reconciliation bills. President Clinton utilized the line-item veto to cancel two limited tax benefits in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The first cancellation, identified as Cancellation No. 97-1, eliminated Section 1175 (Exemption for Active Financing Income) of the act. Cancellation No. 97-1 canceled Section 1175 (Exemption for Active Financing Income) of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Cancellation No. 97-2 applied to Section 968 (Nonrecognition of Gain on Sale of Stock to Certain Farmers' Cooperatives). These provisions dealt with sheltering income in foreign tax havens and capital gains on the sale of agricultural assets. President Clinton used the line-item veto to cancel these limited tax benefits. President Clinton utilized the line-item veto to cancel one item of new direct spending in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, specifically subsection 4722(c) related to Medicaid provisions in New York State. This action was part of the reconciliation process outlined in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The \"Byrd Rule\" is a key aspect of Congressional budget reconciliation measures, with various reports detailing revenue and spending directives in budget resolutions from different years. Reconciliation directives were issued to House and Senate committees in budget resolutions for FY1976-FY2005 by Bill Heniff Jr. on January 14, 2005."
