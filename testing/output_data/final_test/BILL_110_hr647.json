    "content": "The \"Mark-to-Market Extension Act of 2007\" includes sections on purposes, definitions, extension of the Mark-to-Market program, exception rents, eligible projects, disaster-damaged projects, nonprofit debt relief eligibility period, and effective date. The purpose of this Act is to continue the progress of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997, expand eligibility for Mark-to-Market restructuring, and provide for the preservation and rehabilitation of projects damaged by natural disasters. The Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 is amended to include a definition for \"disaster-damaged eligible project\" as a multifamily housing project located in a county designated a major disaster area after January 1, 2005, with the owner carrying required insurance. The Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 now includes provisions for disaster-damaged eligible projects, which are multifamily housing projects in designated disaster areas with damages exceeding $5,000 per unit not covered by insurance. Owners can request project restructuring within 2 years of the damage occurring. SEC. 4. The Mark-to-Market program is extended to October 1, 2011. SEC. 5. Exception rents for disaster-damaged eligible projects are increased from 5 percent to 9 percent. SEC. 6. Changes to eligibility criteria for projects. Section 514 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 is amended to allow certain projects that meet specific requirements to be treated as eligible multifamily housing projects on an exception basis if deemed necessary by the Secretary for cost-effective preservation. The Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 allows eligible projects to be treated as multifamily housing projects if requested by the owner. If no request is made, the Secretary will not withhold other preservation options. Owners can cancel a request at any time before mortgage restructuring and pursue other renewal options for section 8. The Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 allows eligible projects to be treated as multifamily housing projects if requested by the owner. Owners can withdraw their request for renewal under section 8 and pursue other options, submitting new documentation if needed. The Secretary can only treat projects as eligible multifamily housing if the number of units does not exceed 10% of all units eligible for mortgage restructuring. The Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 allows eligible projects to be treated as multifamily housing projects if requested by the owner, with a limit of 10% of units eligible for mortgage restructuring. SEC. 7. DISASTER-DAMAGED ELIGIBLE PROJECTS. Market Rent Determinations and Owner Investment for disaster-damaged eligible properties under the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 are amended to ensure fair market rents are maintained post-disaster. The owner contribution for rehabilitation of disaster-damaged eligible properties is determined according to specific guidelines. SEC. 8. PERIOD OF ELIGIBILITY FOR NONPROFIT DEBT RELIEF. This section amends the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 regarding the period of eligibility for nonprofit debt relief. It specifies the timeline for a purchaser to acquire a project after the recordation of an affordability agreement. The purchaser must submit an application for modification, assignment, or forgiveness before acquiring the project. SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE. SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments will be effective on the date of enactment or September 30, 2007."
