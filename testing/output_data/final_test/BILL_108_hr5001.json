The Act titled \"Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act of 2004\" finds that the 95,000-mile coastline of the United States is crucial for homeland security, transportation, trade, environment, and more. Coastal communities, home to over half of the population, support seaports, cities, and natural resources, contributing significantly to the economy. The oceans and Great Lakes play a vital role in the economy, with goods valued at over $700 billion annually. The fishing industry is worth over $28 billion, while recreational fishing brings in $20 billion. The offshore oil and gas industry generates between $25 billion and $40 billion annually. Marine biodiversity provides essential food resources and has commercial and medical potential. The oceans and Great Lakes also influence climate and weather patterns, impacting coastal ecosystems and communities. The Coast Guard plays a crucial role in saving lives, conducting rescue missions, and responding to environmental cleanups and pollution. Monitoring the Nation's ports and coastline is essential for homeland security, requiring the ability to track vessels and provide real-time environmental conditions. Advances in sensing technologies have enabled long-term and continuous monitoring. National investment is needed to consolidate, sustain, and integrate elements of an ocean and coastal observing system. This investment would help improve understanding of oceans and the global climate system, enhance homeland security, improve weather forecasts, manage marine resources, ensure maritime operations' safety and efficiency, and mitigate coastal hazards. The Act aims to develop an integrated ocean observing system for national security, economic development, healthy marine ecosystems, scientific advancements, and education. It includes research and development, data management, and regional ocean and coastal systems. The Act aims to establish a regional ocean and coastal observing system to address local needs for ocean information. The Act defines key terms such as Council, IOOS, National Oceanographic Partnership Program, and interagency program office. It also establishes the Integrated Ocean and Coastal Observing System. The President, through the Council, will establish a pilot program for an integrated ocean and coastal observing system to monitor changes impacting the nation's social, economic, and ecological systems. The system aims to improve ocean health, protect lives and livelihoods, support national defense, and understand human and natural impacts on the environment. The Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) aims to measure, explain, and predict environmental changes, provide for sustainable use of ocean resources, support ecosystem-based management, educate the public on ocean importance, track climate change, and supply information to marine-related businesses. The IOOS consists of a national observation program, regional associations, data management system, research and development program, and outreach, education, and training program. The Council oversees the design and implementation of the IOOS, coordinates with other earth observing activities, and administers a research and development program under the National Oceanographic Partnership. The National Oceanographic Partnership Program supports the operation of an integrated ocean and coastal observing system, advances understanding of the oceans, establishes pilot projects for technology development, supports institutional mechanisms, provides representation at international meetings, and coordinates Federal activities with other nations. An Interagency Program Office is established under the Council. OceanUS is established under the Council as an interagency program office responsible for program planning and coordination of the IOOS. It prepares annual and long-term plans for the design and implementation of the IOOS, promotes collaboration among Federal agencies and regional associations, and coordinates agency budgets for the IOOS implementation. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is the lead Federal agency for the implementation and operation of the IOOS. It coordinates the implementation, operation, and improvement of the IOOS based on plans prepared by the interagency program office and adopted by the Council. The agency also establishes standards and protocols for data management and communications, certifies regional associations, and establishes an external technical committee for biannual review of the IOOS. The IOOS is coordinated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the implementation, operation, and improvement of the system. Regional associations are responsible for developing and operating regional ocean and coastal observing systems to meet user group needs while adhering to national standards. Associations must demonstrate an organizational structure capable of supporting and integrating all aspects of the program within their region. The regional ocean and coastal observing program must prepare a strategic operations plan and provide information products for multiple users in the region. Any system designated as part of a regional association is considered part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for civil liability purposes. Interagency financing allows departments and agencies on the Council to share and transfer funds for administrative and programmatic projects. Funds can be used for the National Oceanographic Partnership Program and supporting an ocean and coastal observing system. Appropriations can be transferred among members through specified instruments. Authorization of appropriations is also granted. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 for the development of an integrated ocean and coastal observing system. Funding will be provided to regional associations for the design, implementation, operation, and improvement of regional ocean and coastal observing systems. The Administrator shall allocate $50,000,000 from the appropriated funds for fiscal year 2006 to support the development of regional ocean and coastal observing systems. The allocated funds will remain available until expended. The President must submit a report to Congress by March 31, 2006, detailing the pilot program established under section 4. The report should cover activities, effectiveness, and recommendations for reauthorization and funding levels in future fiscal years."
