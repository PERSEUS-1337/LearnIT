    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Coral Reef Resource Conservation and Management Act of 1999\". Congress finds that coral reefs have significant value in various aspects such as commercial, recreational, cultural, environmental, and aesthetic. They provide habitat for a third of all marine fish species, contribute to biodiversity, protect coastlines, and support industries like tourism and fishing. However, coral reefs are facing degradation and severe threats from human and environmental impacts like pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing practices. The Department of the Interior manages coral reef habitats in national wildlife refuges and units of the National Park System in Hawaii, Florida, Guam, American Samoa, and the US Virgin Islands. They also oversee coral reef resources in insular areas, territories, and surrounding waters in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The Department of the Interior manages coral reef habitats in national wildlife refuges and units of the National Park System in Hawaii, Florida, Guam, American Samoa, and the US Virgin Islands. They conduct scientific research, monitoring, and conservation activities to conserve, protect, and restore the health of coral reef ecosystems and the species that depend on them in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The purpose of the program is to support coral reef ecosystems under US jurisdiction, enhance existing conservation efforts, fund research, education, and enforcement activities, provide financial resources for partnerships, and coordinate with relevant agencies and task forces. The program aims to support coral reef ecosystems, enhance conservation efforts, fund research, education, and enforcement activities, provide financial resources for partnerships, and coordinate with relevant agencies and task forces. Additionally, it aims to address priorities identified by the Coral Reef Task Force. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"coral\" refers to various species of the phylum Cnidaria, including black corals, stony corals, horny corals, soft corals, and fire corals. \"Coral reef\" encompasses species, habitats, and natural resources associated with reefs composed primarily of corals in maritime areas under U.S. jurisdiction. A coral reef conservation project involves activities that help preserve, sustain, or enhance coral reef ecosystems, including resource management, habitat monitoring, species surveys, and planning for coral reef management. This applies to various waters in the south Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific Ocean. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a Coral Reef Task Force, defines terms like \"foundation\" and \"Secretary,\" and specifies the meaning of \"State\" in relation to coral reef conservation efforts. The curr_chunk mentions territories and possessions of the United States such as Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands. The curr_chunk introduces the Coral Reef Resource Conservation Grant Program. The Secretary provides grants for coral reef conservation projects to eligible entities, including natural resource management authorities, educational institutions, and organizations with expertise in marine science. The Federal share of project costs cannot exceed 75 percent. The non-Federal share of a coral reef conservation project grant can be in cash or in kind. The Secretary can waive the matching requirement for projects under $25,000 or for planning and monitoring coral reef areas under specific acts. The Secretary awards grants for coral reef conservation projects in specific ocean regions, with a minimum allocation for each. Remaining funds are for emergency priorities or threats identified by the Secretary in consultation with the Coral Reef Task Force. Annual funding priorities are determined after consultation with various entities involved in coral and marine conservation. The Secretary identifies threats to coral reef ecosystems for funding priorities and reviews project proposals based on specific criteria, including peer review for projects costing $25,000 or more. The Secretary requires standardized documentation and an expedited peer review process for projects under $25,000. Written comments are requested from relevant government departments for individual grants. The Secretary provides a list of funded projects at the beginning of each fiscal year. The Secretary evaluates and selects project proposals for funding based on criteria that include promoting the protection, conservation, restoration, or enhancement of coral reef ecosystems and fostering cooperative conservation projects with various entities. The projects aim to enhance public knowledge and awareness of coral reefs. The Secretary will promulgate regulations within 90 days to implement the Act, including project approval requirements within 180 days. The Secretary will consult with various agencies and organizations to prioritize coral reef protection in developing regulations. Additionally, the Secretary may enter agreements with foundations to administer funds for grant programs under the Act. A foundation entering into an agreement with the Secretary shall invest and administer funds in a separate interest-bearing account at an insured depository institution or credit union. The term is defined in section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1752) and established by the foundation solely to support partnerships between the public and private sectors that further the purposes of this Act. Beginning in fiscal year 2000, and biennially thereafter, the Secretary shall conduct a review of each grant program administered by a foundation under this subsection. Each review shall include a written assessment describing the extent to which the foundation has implemented the program. The Secretary may transfer funds to a foundation for matching contributions from private persons and government agencies. Authorization of Appropriations: $20,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually for fiscal years 2000 through 2004 for the implementation of this Act, with a limitation of 6% for administrative expenses."
