    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 18904.25 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to provide CalFresh information on expedited services for the homeless population and victims of domestic violence. This information will be available to various agencies serving homeless individuals. Each county human services agency must offer annual training on CalFresh application procedures to homeless shelter operators, including eligibility criteria for unaccompanied homeless children and youths. Upon request, agencies must provide homeless and domestic violence shelters with CalFresh expedited service application forms. Upon receipt of a signed CalFresh application from an unaccompanied child or youth under 18, the county agency determines eligibility, including household status and expedited service. If denied, a written notice is provided. Section 18914.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code allows residents or individuals on a waiting list for a shelter for battered women and children, who are in a household with the abuser, to apply for expedited CalFresh benefits as a separate household. The definition of \"shelter for battered women and children\" is consistent with federal regulations. Section 18926.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to define the \"CalFresh Employment and Training program\" as a program aimed at helping CalFresh households gain skills for employment. A county participating in the CalFresh Employment and Training program screens work registrants to determine participation. Registrants can request to enroll voluntarily if deferred. Individuals may be deferred if they meet certain criteria or reside in specific areas. \"Deferred\" means exempt. A county participating in CalFresh E&T must show how it effectively uses funds for components like workfare, training, education, and job search. Counties are not required to offer specific components in their CalFresh E&T plan. (d) Counties can require participation in employment and training programs for nonmedical benefits under Section 17000, even if funded by CalFresh E&T funds. (e) Federal funds can be used for CalFresh E&T programs. (f) Counties are not obligated to provide workers' compensation for CalFresh E&T participants. The department may implement this section through all-county letters or similar instructions before adopting regulations by October 1, 2013. Reimbursement for mandated costs to local agencies and school districts will be made if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
