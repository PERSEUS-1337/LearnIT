    "content": "The \"Unfair Foreign Competition Act of 2007\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Tariff Act of 1930 by adding a new subtitle for Judicial Determination of Injury, including provisions for civil action. In an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation, a petitioning party can bring a civil action in a US district court within 30 days to determine if a US industry is materially injured, threatened with injury, or materially retarded by imports of merchandise subject to the investigation. This action can also be taken within 30 days after a 5-year review of an antidumping or countervailing duty order is initiated. When a review of an antidumping or countervailing duty order is initiated, a party from the initial investigation can bring a civil action in a US district court to determine if revocation of the order would lead to material injury. The election for this determination in court replaces a determination by the Commission. If an election is made under this subtitle, the Commission will investigate and compile evidence for the petition, providing information to the parties and the district court in a timely manner. The administering authority must notify the Commission accordingly. The district court shall receive all information required by the Commission under this title, and any notifications required by the administering authority shall also be provided to the district court. In an action brought under subsection (a) or (b), the court will apply the same standards and make determinations as the Commission would have made. The court will issue findings of fact and conclusions of law, with orders having the same effect as a Commission determination. The rules for actions initiated under this title include: appeal to a United States Court of Appeals, no stay of orders pending appeal, decisions of the Commission not binding on the court, and provision of hearings to petitioning and interested parties. The rules for actions initiated under this title provide an opportunity for petitioning and interested parties to file briefs and argue orally in court. Defendants are not required to attend meetings or hearings, and failure to do so will not harm their case. Default judgments will not be issued if an interested party fails to intervene or participate in the proceedings. Civil actions under this section may be brought in a judicial district where manufacturing occurs. Within 5 days of filing an action under subsection (a) or (b), the filing party must notify all known interested parties and provide them with a copy of the complaint. Interested parties have the right to intervene in the proceedings. Civil actions can be brought in a district where a plaintiff's facility is located. Upon motion, the court issues a preliminary order in an action under subsection (a) to determine if a US industry is materially injured by imports of merchandise. An affirmative determination has the same effect as a preliminary determination by the Commission. The court must make a preliminary determination within 45 days of a complaint being filed under section 703(a) or 733(a). An action under subsection (a) or (b) will be expedited in every way practicable. In cases under subsection (a), a final determination on material injury must be made within 120 days of an affirmative preliminary determination by the administering authority. The court must make a final determination on material injury within specific timeframes after an affirmative preliminary determination by the administering authority. In complex cases, the court may extend the time by an additional 30 days. The court may extend the time for making a final determination on material injury by an additional 30 days. Additionally, the court must protect the confidentiality of proprietary information designated by an interested party. If the injury determination was initially made by a United States district court, the court retains jurisdiction for certain cases. The table of contents for title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to include a new section 791. Subtitle E--Judicial Determination of Injury Section 791 of the Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to include a provision for civil action. The effective date for these amendments applies to countervailing duty investigations, antidumping duty investigations, and reviews initiated after the enactment of this Act. Additionally, the amendments also apply to Canada and Mexico. The amendments made by this Act apply to goods from Canada and Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Secretary of State must notify the World Trade Organization within 30 days of enactment, regarding the changes made by this Act and the role of U.S. district courts in injury determinations under the Tariff Act of 1930."
