This paper studies the population and empirical loss functions of attention-based neural networks, showing that they have low prediction error and require lower sample complexity. The self-attention model delivers consistent predictions with a more expressive class of functions, providing guidelines for designing attention mechanisms. Experimental results on MNIST and IMDB reviews dataset validate the findings. Attention mechanisms, inspired by human cognition, focus on relevant input regions for tasks in machine learning. Various attention variants have improved performance in machine translation, image and video captioning, visual question answering, and generative modeling. Spatial/spatio-temporal attention masks are used in computer vision to concentrate on important image/video regions. In machine learning, attention mechanisms focus on relevant input regions for tasks. Attention masks are used to concentrate on important regions in images/video frames. Self-attention is a popular implementation that learns attention masks by correlating elements in the input sequence. Studying the loss landscape of neural networks with attention is an open area of research. The loss landscape and optimization of neural networks, including two-layer neural networks, is a challenging research area. While previous studies have shown convergence of gradient descent for two-layer neural networks, attention mechanisms introduce additional parameters that require joint optimization with the model. This study presents the first theoretical analysis on attention-based models, showing that under certain conditions, every stationary point of attention models can be achieved. Attention models achieve low prediction error at stationary points under mild conditions. Asymptotic analysis shows prediction error decreases as n \u2192 \u221e. They have lower sample complexity than models without attention. Results extend to recurrent and multi-layer cases, considering regularization effects. Attention improves loss landscape by increasing linear regions, flatness of minima, and aiding small sample size training. Experimental validation on MNIST and IMDB datasets confirms theoretical findings. Attention mechanisms help neural networks focus on relevant input regions for predictions. Different types of attention models are analyzed, starting with a global attention model. In analyzing attention models, different types are considered, starting with a naive global attention model. The focus is on how the output depends on specific regions of the input, using an attention mask. A two-layer neural network is used to approximate the ground-truth function, with attention masks indicating relevant and irrelevant regions of the input. The baseline model consists of two linear layers denoted by w(1) and w(2), with the response function f(x) = w(2)T \u03c6(w(1), x). Attention is incorporated using an attention mask a as additional parameters. The focus is on regression tasks with a loss function minimizing the difference between predicted and actual values. Analysis extends to classification tasks and practical self-attention setups inspired by the transformer model. The baseline model includes two linear layers w(1) and w(2) with a response function f(x) = w(2)T \u03c6(w(1), x). Self-attention is applied using query, key, and value matrices to capture interactions between words in sentences. The self-attention vector represents these interactions, and a generative model is then applied to the value vectors. The generative model discussed involves linear layers w(1) and w(2), with attention models like recurrent and multi-layer self-attention. Naive global attention, although limited, is fundamental for assigning different weights to input features based on intrinsic data structure. In the context of attention mechanisms, the naive global attention assigns weights to input features, while the self-attention model learns attention weights based on value/key/query matrices. Both models involve learning network weights and attention parameters simultaneously. Analyzing global attention provides insights into the size and sparsity of attention parameters. The detailed discussions in Section 3 analyze the effect of sparsity and parameter size of attention on model performance and sample complexity. Section 3.1 examines the loss landscape for the naive global attention model, while Section 3.2 extends the analysis to the self-attention model. Section 3.3 discusses the recurrent attention model, and Section 3.4 explores the impact of regularization and its extension to multi-layer networks. The softplus activation function is used to approximate the non-differentiable ReLU \u03c6. The softplus activation function \u03c6 \u03c4 approximates ReLU \u03c6. Theoretical results hold for any large \u03c4. Analyzing the asymptotic prediction error of local minimum with a large sample size involves the covariance matrix of \u03c6(w) and attention masks. Necessary assumptions include the output y specified by a two-layer neural network with subGaussian error and sparsity constraints. The attention model assumes weights between 0 and 1, with a focus on reducing sample complexity for convergence to a good minimum. Theoretical results consider the prediction error bound with sparsity structures and attention mechanisms. The attention model focuses on reducing sample complexity for convergence to a good minimum by constraining parameters in a smaller space. The prediction error is proportionate to n^-1/2 for optimal convergence in regression. Extending the model with a sum-to-one constraint tightens the bound, leading to a discussion in Corollary 1. In this section, the analysis extends to the self-attention model where the attention mask is a function of the input. A self-attention model with a known attention function is examined, showing that if the self-attention mask can be computed precisely, global attention results can be extended. However, in real-world applications, the function needs to be learned. The self-attention setup introduced in section 2 is more desired in real-world applications. The two-layer self-attention model can be estimated with necessary assumptions. The model can predict the output y with an independent sub-Gaussian error. These assumptions allow for the determination of sample complexity. Theorem 2 demonstrates that self-attention enables consistent prediction with more complex models, considering interactions between data vectors. Unlike global and baseline models, self-attention achieves accurate estimation without requiring a larger parameter space. Self-attention model achieves accurate estimation by constraining the parameter space and input space, reducing sample complexity. Proper choice of matrices can further reduce complexity. Sample complexity analysis can be extended to recurrent neural networks, with a good design helping convergence with small complexity. Careful design choices are necessary for optimal results. The analysis suggests that regularization is beneficial in training attention models, reducing sample complexity. Imposing constraints on network weights can help achieve good generalization by removing sharp minima. Theorems 1 and 2 can be extended to multi-layer attention networks under certain assumptions. In multi-layer self-attention models, sample complexity bounds are provided under certain assumptions. The discussion focuses on two-layer models to explain why attention reduces sample complexity. Additionally, attention mechanisms in global models reduce unnecessary linear regions and maintain low approximation error. The use of attention mechanisms also retains flatness properties of minima. Our analysis shows that attention mechanisms in both global and self-attention models maintain flatness properties of minima and reduce the number of linear regions, leading to simpler landscapes with lower sample complexity for achieving accurate predictions. This results in smaller sample sizes being sufficient to converge to good minima that generalize well in prediction. Additionally, perfect in-sample prediction on small sample sizes is achieved in attention networks. Theorem 3 discusses the attention sparsity in self-attention models and the potential sharpness of minima in global attention mechanisms without parameter constraints. The concept of flatness is introduced, and Theorem 4 analyzes the flatness of stationary points in both global and self-attention models. Theorem 4 discusses the flatness of minima in neural networks with global and self-attention mechanisms. It shows that sharp minima exist with attention mechanisms, but not all sharp minima generalize well. The restriction on the parameter space helps remove sharp minima in neural networks. Constraints control the parameter space and prevent sharp minima when certain parameters go to infinity. A two-layer neural network can achieve perfect empirical estimation error in small sample sizes. The discussion of Theorem 5 is deferred to the appendices. Theorem 1 shows that attention models have lower sample complexity than baseline models, needing fewer samples to achieve the same test error. In an experiment, a two-layer neural network is created with random weights, mapping input to output. Ground-truth labels are generated using an attention mask. Multiple datasets with varying sample sizes are generated to test sample complexity. The experiment shows that attention models require fewer training samples than baseline models to achieve a desired error. This is attributed to the attention mechanism rather than an increase in model parameters. Regularizing the attention vector improves the attention model's performance, as demonstrated through empirical validation with L1 regularization. The results show better sample complexity and faster convergence compared to unregularized models. The experiment extends to a self-attention model for sentiment classification on IMDB reviews dataset. For sentiment classification on IMDB reviews dataset, fixed length sentences are required. Zero-padding is done to match the maximum sentence length (2142). Pre-trained GloVE embeddings are used for input words, passed to a neural network. Baseline model flattens input to a vector and uses a 1-hidden layer MLP. Self-attention model computes attended features and passes them to a 1-hidden layer MLP. Models are trained using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-3. Best performance was achieved with this setting among different configurations tried. The self-attention model outperforms the baseline model with lower sample complexity. Increasing the baseline model's parameters does not improve its performance compared to the self-attention model. An experiment on the convergence of empirical risk is conducted using a modified NoisyMNIST dataset for classification tasks. The attention model outperforms the baseline model in terms of convergence speed and reaching a better minimum. The Hessian matrix analysis validates the loss landscape of attention models. The Hessian matrix analysis shows that attention models have flatter loss landscapes compared to baseline models, leading to better generalization. Attention mechanisms reduce sample complexity and improve predictions in the large sample regime for two-layer neural networks. Attention mechanisms in neural networks produce well-behaved loss landscapes that lead to good minima, as shown through analysis of linear regions, loss landscape under small sample regime, and flatness of local minima. Empirical studies on NoisyMNIST and IMDB reviews datasets validate these findings. Theoretical extensions to recurrent attention models, regularization effects in attention networks, and potential extensions to CNN/RNN are discussed in appendices. The recurrent attention framework in Bahdanau et al. (2014) involves a generative model represented by a scoring function and an update function. The model estimates the effect of words in a sentence for each data point, using data features as annotations. The scoring function can be a dot product or MLP, while the update function updates the model parameters. The recurrent attention framework involves a generative model with scoring and update functions. The model estimates word effects using data features. The scoring function can be a dot product or MLP, while the update function updates model parameters. The sample complexity bound is extended with necessary assumptions and prediction error bounds. The theorem provides a sample complexity bound for recurrent attention networks, showing a trade-off between network complexity and sample complexity. Proper selection of functions f(\u00b7) and a(\u00b7) can lead to good stationary points with optimal sample complexity. However, an overly complicated design increases sample complexity, while an overly simple design may not yield good stationary points. This trade-off is similar to the balance between approximation error and estimation error in learning theory. A well-designed recurrent structure can help achieve an optimal sample complexity. The rationality of Assumptions (A1) to (A6) is discussed in this section, with a focus on achieving optimal sample complexity in recurrent attention models. These assumptions, including upper bounds on input and network weights, are crucial for proving the main result in Theorem 3. Regularization is key to meeting these assumptions and ensuring the network can specify the conditional mean. The two-layer network's ability to approximate bounded functions with a Fourier representation is highlighted. The two-layer network approximates functions with a sparse structure. Technical conditions (A5) ensure analysis of stationary points, including eigenvalue bounds and active features. These assumptions prevent sharp minima and guarantee accurate estimation. The two-layer network approximates functions with a sparse structure, ensuring analysis of stationary points and preventing sharp minima. The correlation assumption between certain features and bias cannot be fully explained by a fixed linear combination, indicating systematic bias in the model. This assumption is reasonable with a large dimensionality and a non-degenerate model, and can be evaluated with a large sample size. The correlation assumption between features and bias can be evaluated with a large sample size to prevent sharp minima in the network. The structure of the proof remains unaffected by this evaluation. The assumption of correlation between features and bias is crucial for evaluating sharp minima in the network. By fitting a model with expectation close to truth and centralization, unnecessary minima can be removed to focus on analyzing good stationary points. Attention mechanism can reduce the sample complexity required to approach a good minimum, but its application should be carefully considered to avoid misuse. The assumption of correlation between features and bias is important for evaluating sharp minima in the network. Attention mechanism can reduce sample complexity to approach a good minimum, but misuse can lead to inconsistent models. Comparing attention model with baseline, the key difference lies in the substitution of s0 with p, resulting in larger dimensionality. Constants C1 and C2 remain the same due to the same generative model and network size. In the framework, the effect of p diverging to \u221e as n \u2192 \u221e is studied. Imposing regularizations on weights helps control the upper bound of weight norm, preventing overfitting. Baselines with overfitting are expected to have larger C2 values. Sample complexity of baselines is observed to be larger compared to fixing C1 and C2. In the experiment, it was observed that the 2 norm of weights from the baseline model is larger or equal to the attention network. The sample complexity bound for the sum-to-one global attention model does not require s0 under assumption (A7). Rescaling x properly leads to results parallel to Theorem 1. The bounds for attention models with different sparsity levels are plotted in Figure 1, showing that the bound for attention models is smaller than that for baseline models. This implies that with proper attention mechanisms, the approximation error remains small, allowing for a simpler landscape. The approximation error remains small with proper attention mechanisms, allowing for a simpler landscape structure with fewer linear regions. The assumption of full column rank holds almost surely after nonlinear activation, similar to conditions in previous theorems. Theoretical justification on how attention mechanisms improve model learning by shrinking parameter space, making gradient and Hessian more controllable. Performance improvement expected with well-learned attention masks, especially when weight is sparse. Constraints and regularization on network also play a role. Imposing constraints and regularization on network weights can help remove sharp minima and maintain flat minima for better predictions. The main idea of Theorem 1 and 2 can be extended to multi-layer networks. It is important to control the bounds for network weight matrices and improve estimation of attention weighted input space. Two regularization methods are suggested to enhance current attention mechanisms, including 2 regularization on weights. Regularization on attention weights, such as 1 regularization, can help achieve sparsity and more precise estimation in multi-layer networks. This can lead to more interpretable results and improve the landscape behavior of the loss function in attention mechanisms. Adding regularization to attention weights in self-attention models can further enhance the prediction power while maintaining a nice in-sample prediction. Regularization on attention weights, like 1 regularization, improves sparsity in self-attention models. This enhances prediction accuracy by focusing attention on relevant words, leading to better results compared to 2 regularization. The sample complexity bound is proportional to the sparsity level, making 1 regularization more effective in controlling attention mask magnitude. Regularization techniques, such as 1 regularization, enhance sparsity in attention weights for improved prediction accuracy by focusing on relevant words. The sample complexity bound is linked to sparsity level, making 1 regularization more effective in controlling attention mask magnitude. Theorems 1 and 2 discuss how these results can be extended to multi-layer neural nets, emphasizing the importance of achieving sparse and precise attention structures. The attention mechanism in a D-layer network with self-attention structure leads to a smaller sample complexity bound compared to baseline models. The network calculates self-attention D times to produce the final prediction, with necessary assumptions on weights and predictions. The D-layer self-attention network predicts output y with independent sub-Gaussian error. The sample complexity bound of the model is determined by the total number of parameters in the matrices. The weight term w kr satisfies certain conditions, leading to a stationary point of the objective function. The multi-layer self-attention model assumptions are complex due to a large parameter set, but the main assumption is that the bias cannot be uncorrelated with all directions, which is reasonable in high-dimensional networks. The extension of this model is omitted for simplicity, focusing on the two-layer model to explain why attention reduces sample complexity. The analysis is based on fully connected networks and may not directly apply to CNN and RNN tasks, but provides insights for analyzing them with attention. The attention mechanisms in CNN/RNN models help shrink the parameter space, reducing noise and improving generalization. Analyzing global and self-attention models can inspire complex task analysis. Future work includes detailed experiments with CNN/RNN to validate theoretical analyses. The proof is divided into studying population risk landscape and evaluating convergence of empirical risk. Necessary notations are introduced to emphasize the role of variables. In the analysis, the role of x and y is studied separately. The expectation of the empirical loss gradient with respect to y is denoted as R(w(1), w(2), a) = Ey|x(Rn(w(1), w(2), a)). The expectation of the empirical loss function with respect to both x and y is denoted as Ex(\u2207R(w(1), w(2), a)) = Ex,y(Rn(w(1), w(2), a)). The use of a simplifies the analysis of empirical risk convergence. In the proof, o(\u03b3) is used for vector/matrix cases, where every element in the vector/matrix is o(\u03b3). The value d is considered as an arbitrary large fixed value, not diverging with n. In the proof, d is treated as a large fixed value, not diverging with n. The derivatives of population risk with respect to y are presented, showing that any true set of parameters must have zero gradient expectation. The key is to show that parameters must be bounded away from zero with high probability. The parameters are inside 2 balls, and the covering numbers for these balls are upper bounded. In the proof, the parameters must be bounded away from zero with high probability. The covering numbers for the balls containing the parameters are upper bounded. The notation and calculations involving the elements in the cover are used to show the constraints on the feasible parameters. The proof requires parameters to be bounded away from zero with high probability and the covering numbers for the balls containing the parameters to be upper bounded. Notation and calculations involving the cover elements show constraints on feasible parameters. The covariance matrix \u03a3 \u03c6 is invertible with a lower bounded smallest eigenvalue, leading to the conclusion w (2) = w (2) + o(\u03b3) when condition equation 9 is violated. The gradient \u2207R(w (1)) is then studied. The text discusses studying the gradient \u2207R(w(1)) and bounding the gradient term with fixed parameter sets. It mentions finding a constant c such that certain conditions are met, and using Hoeffding bound on the 2 norm in a specific direction. The text also refers to the gradient with respect to a parameter set in an -cover. The text analyzes the gradient \u2207R(w(j)) with respect to parameter sets in an -cover, using union bound and triangle inequality. It shows that parameter sets with poor prediction have population risk gradient away from zero. The text discusses how parameter sets with poor prediction have population risk gradient away from zero, and shows that empirical risk will converge to the popular risk. It concludes that these parameter sets cannot have zero empirical gradient, and provides bounds for \u03c6(w(1), xi). The text discusses the convergence of empirical risk to population risk for parameter sets with poor prediction. It provides bounds for \u03c6(w(1), xi) and shows that all stationary points satisfy the prediction error upper bound rate. The sample complexity bound in corollary 1 is slightly tighter than in theorem 3. The text presents a new -covering bound with Theorem 1 and introduces new terms v i and z ik. It shows the existence of a constant c such that E(\u2207R(w (2 )) 2 \u2265 c\u03b3 or there exist k \u2208 1, . . . , p satisfying certain conditions. By utilizing Hoeffding bound and union bound, it bounds certain terms and concludes with high probability the convergence of empirical risk for parameter sets. The text introduces a new -covering bound with Theorem 1 and terms v i and z ik. It discusses the convergence of empirical risk for parameter sets using Hoeffding and union bounds. The proof shows that inactive inputs can be omitted, and active inputs are split into groups with specific weights and biases assigned. The designed network has linear regions within each group. The text discusses the design of a network with linear regions within each group, showing a lower bound on the total number of regions. It involves scale transformations, jacobian determinants, and Hessian matrices to analyze the properties of the network. The biggest eigenvalue of \u2207 2 L(T \u03b11,\u03b12 (\u03b8)) is larger than M, leading to a stationary point with an arbitrarily large operator norm for the Hessian. This completes part (a) of the proof. Moving on to part (b), a similar \u03b1 scale transformation is defined, resulting in the jacobian determinant going to infinity as \u03b1 approaches infinity. The volume of C(L, \u03b8) also increases. The Frobenius norm is lower bounded by \u03b1 \u22122 \u03b4 for the Hessian matrix. By choosing a sufficiently small \u03b1, the biggest eigenvalue of \u2207 2 L(T \u03b11,\u03b12 (\u03b8)) is larger than any constant M, leading to a stationary point with an arbitrarily large operator norm for the Hessian. The proof involves calculating gradients of the empirical loss function and solving linear systems to show that the loss is zero inside the sample, indicating a global minimum. This is further extended by considering derivatives with respect to different variables to establish the global minimum. The proof involves deriving bounds for parameter sets and population risk derivatives, showing that the loss is zero inside the sample, indicating a global minimum. The sample complexity bound is obtained under certain assumptions, with considerations for Lipschitz continuity and parameter covers. The text discusses constructing parameter covers and analyzing gradient terms to ensure convergence of the empirical risk procedure under certain assumptions and Lipschitz continuity. The sample complexity bound is derived, showing that the loss reaches a global minimum within the sample. The text presents convergence results for 2-layer neural networks on a classification task using the Noisy-MNIST dataset. Different settings with varying learning rates are explored, showing that attention models converge faster than baseline models. Additionally, convergence plots for sample complexity experiments in regression tasks are provided. In the experiment, convergence plots for regression tasks with different dataset sizes are discussed. Regularized attention models converge fastest, followed by attention models and then baseline models. Attention models not only improve sample complexity but also converge faster, with regularization further speeding up convergence."
