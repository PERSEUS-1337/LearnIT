    "content": "In early 1999, concerns arose about nuclear weapon security at U.S. labs after reports of China acquiring W88 warhead design. President Clinton mentioned China's limited nuclear weapons but worries persisted about their missile development programs. The controversy surrounding the W-88 warhead raised policy issues regarding the suspected use of U.S. nuclear weapon secrets by China in developing smaller nuclear warheads and new ICBMs. Suspicions of China attempting to acquire secrets from U.S. nuclear weapon labs have been longstanding, with reports of recruitment attempts at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore labs. In the late 1970s to 1980s, China may have conducted clandestine operations at U.S. labs or benefited from voluntary disclosures. Suspects were U.S. scientists born in Taiwan. A 1999 case suggested China sought neutron bomb data in 1995, but it was unclear if DOE labs were involved. In 2003, FBI agents were arrested for allegedly passing secrets to China. China was reported to have stolen neutron bomb data from Lawrence Livermore labs in the late 1970s to early 1980s. In the late 1970s to early 1980s, China allegedly stole neutron bomb data from Lawrence Livermore labs. The FBI's investigation, code-named \"Tiger Trap,\" began in 1986 and remained open as of 2000. The PRC used U.S. secrets to create an experimental neutron bomb tested in 1988 and shared the information with Pakistan. The U.S. scientist involved, Gwo-Bao Min, was fired but not charged due to insufficient evidence. Another scientist, Peter H. Lee, admitted in 1997 to giving classified information to PRC nuclear scientists during a trip to China in 1985. Peter H. Lee admitted to giving classified information to Chinese nuclear scientists during a trip to China in 1985. He disclosed details about his work on using lasers to simulate thermonuclear explosions and sensitive satellite radar imaging for tracking submarines. Lee's attorney stated that he was not a spy but made mistakes in trying to assist Chinese scientists. Peter H. Lee admitted to giving classified information to Chinese nuclear scientists in 1985 to boost his reputation in China. After a seven-year FBI investigation, he was sentenced to one year at a halfway house. The case was briefed to National Security Advisor Sandy Berger in July 1997 and included in a classified counterintelligence report in November 1998. Senator Specter criticized the prosecution of the case in 2000. The third case, known as \"Kindred Spirit\"/\"Fall Out,\" was made public in 1999 after an investigation into technology transfers to China by the Cox Committee. In 1995, U.S. intelligence discovered that secrets about the W88 nuclear warhead may have leaked from Los Alamos National Laboratory to China between 1984 and 1988. This led to an FBI investigation named \"Kindred Spirit.\" Suspicions of China acquiring W88 data were raised, prompting a reexamination of China's nuclear testing history. China's decision to begin a moratorium on nuclear testing in 1996 raised further suspicions. The FBI investigation into the W88 nuclear warhead leak led to suspicions of China acquiring test data from Russia or France. In 1999, scientist Wen Ho Lee was indicted for mishandling defense information. The investigation expanded in 1999 with the code-named \"Fall-out\" to examine the Pentagon and its facilities for potential espionage activities. In the 1990s, there were allegations of PRC espionage targeting U.S. nuclear weapon designs, specifically seeking information on the neutron bomb design. This led to FBI investigations and intelligence concerns about China's acquisition of neutron bomb and W88 data. In the 1990s, there were concerns about PRC acquisition of neutron bomb and W88 data. A case in July 1996 raised suspicions of Wen Ho Lee's involvement. However, there was no evidence of China improving its neutron bomb or nuclear weapon labs being involved. In a separate case in 2003, a retired FBI agent and his informant were arrested for mishandling national defense information related to China. The FBI's Los Angeles office found a directory related to the \"Royal Tourist\" case on Peter Lee, a Secret FBI memorandum on fugitives from China, and a 1994 directory of FBI legal attaches. The case involved a 20-year history including an affair, Leung's role as a FBI source, and the involvement of another FBI agent named William Cleveland Jr. who had a relationship with Leung. Leung was paid $1.7 million for information about China. The FBI launched a damage assessment of compromised counter-intelligence cases on China since 1991 due to the investigation of Leung and Smith. Lawrence Livermore, FBI, and DOE began an investigation into security problems related to Cleveland's relationship with Leung. The FBI conducted an investigation into security issues related to Cleveland's connection with Leung, the lead FBI agent in the \"Tiger Trap\" case. Larry Albert stated in May 2003 that there was no evidence of security breaches beyond the charges against Leung and Smith. Smith was charged with concealing their romantic relationship and Leung was indicted for unauthorized copying and possession of national security documents. The documents included intercepted conversations between Leung and a PRC intelligence agent. Smith pleaded guilty to concealing his affair with Leung and cooperated with the investigation. Leung pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI and violating tax laws. China's suspected acquisition of W88 data raised concerns about its nuclear-armed ballistic missile force modernization and implications for U.S. national security. China reportedly deployed over 100 nuclear warheads, including strategic long-range ICBMs capable of reaching the United States. China's military modernization efforts included developing miniaturized nuclear warheads and more reliable mobile missiles. China developed a new DF-31 solid-fuel, mobile ICBM with a range of 5,000 miles and a smaller warhead than the DF-5A ICBMs. President Clinton stated that U.S. nuclear forces maintained superiority over China's limited strategic nuclear forces. China has accepted constraints on modernizing its arsenal by signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. China has fewer than two dozen long-range nuclear weapons today; we have over 6,000. In 1998, a report urged a comprehensive damage assessment of security breaches at nuclear weapon labs by China. National Security Advisor Berger acknowledged that China benefitted from obtaining W88 data. Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet announced findings on March 15, 1999. Intelligence (DCI) George Tenet announced on March 15, 1999, that an independent panel led by retired Admiral David Jeremiah would review the damage assessment completed by the end of March. The panel made recommendations for changes by early April to address concerns of politicization and protect policies towards China. In August 1997, NSC official Gary Samore requested an alternative assessment from the CIA that downplayed DOE's conclusion on PRC espionage at Los Alamos. The final assessment was briefed to appropriate authorities. The DCI briefed the final assessment on the leaks at Los Alamos to congressional committees and the White House on April 21, 1999. Robert Walpole led the damage assessment prepared by multiple agencies and labs. President Clinton requested an assessment of vulnerabilities at other nuclear weapon institutions. Key findings from the Intelligence Community's damage assessment were released by the DCI. The DCI's damage assessment confirmed that China obtained classified U.S. nuclear weapons information through espionage, accelerating its nuclear weapons program. This espionage effort dated back to the late 1970s and provided China with crucial design information on modern U.S. nuclear reentry vehicles and weapon concepts, contributing to their second strike capability and future weapon designs. China obtained classified U.S. nuclear weapons information through espionage, accelerating its nuclear weapons program. The assessment confirmed that China has the technical capability to develop a MIRV system for deployed ICBMs but has not deployed it. U.S. intelligence reported that Chinese acquisition of U.S. information could aid in developing a MIRV for future mobile missiles. Effective counterintelligence and intelligence efforts are still needed due to China's aggressive collection activities. The assessment confirmed that China was aggressively collecting U.S. nuclear weapon secrets to fill gaps in their programs. The Intelligence Community was warned of insufficient depth and multiple countries gaining access to classified U.S. information through espionage. The Cox Committee's declassified report in May 1999 revealed China's ongoing intelligence collection efforts since the late 1970s. China has obtained classified information on advanced U.S. thermonuclear weapons, including details on seven warheads and the W88, the most advanced U.S. nuclear warhead deployed on the Trident D-5 SLBM. This intelligence collection by the PRC has been ongoing since the late 1970s. China has obtained classified information on advanced U.S. thermonuclear weapons, including details on seven warheads and the W88 deployed on the Trident D-5 SLBM. The PRC has been collecting this intelligence since the late 1970s, with implications for U.S. national security and PRC's nuclear weapon modernization efforts. The PRC has obtained classified information on advanced U.S. thermonuclear weapons, allowing them to fabricate and test their next generation of nuclear weapons designs. This includes small, modern thermonuclear warheads equivalent to current U.S. warhead yields. The PRC could potentially begin serial production of these weapons within the next decade, in connection with the development of their next generation of solid-fuel mobile ICBMs. The PRC has rapidly advanced from 1950s-era strategic nuclear capabilities to more modern designs, with the potential to diminish their need for further testing by utilizing stolen U.S. technology and computer models. The PRC's advanced nuclear capabilities, including small thermonuclear warheads, could reduce the need for further testing. Despite the US's advantage in nuclear forces, a modernized PRC ballistic missile force poses a credible threat. It is unclear if the PRC intends to develop multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles for its nuclear missile force. The PRC is developing MIRVs and obtained secret US nuclear weapon information from a \"walk-in\" in 1995. Questions arose about the credibility of the source and the PRC's motives for revealing its nuclear weapons development. The Cox Committee's report confirmed suspicions of PRC espionage in obtaining US nuclear weapon information from a \"walk-in\" in 1995. The Prather Report questioned the findings but criticized the Clinton Administration's policies. The Prather Report criticized the Clinton Administration's policies, particularly for its support for the CTBT, declassification of nuclear weapon information, and lab-to-lab exchanges with China. China confirmed possessing the neutron bomb technology in response to the Cox Committee's charges of espionage. The PFIAB conducted a review of security challenges at government labs over the last 20 years, finding that most security problems still exist and that the labs are major targets for foreign intelligence services. Foreign intelligence services, both friendly and hostile, target DOE due to organizational disarray and managerial neglect. Chinese spies are adept at eliciting information from ill-prepared DOE personnel. Congressional and Executive Branch leaders have used simplification and hyperbole regarding security assessments. Energy Secretary Richardson's initiatives to address security problems are supported, but his case may have been overstated. Energy Secretary Richardson may have overstated the security of the nation's nuclear secrets. Intelligence officials and the Cox Committee have made contributions to resolving security problems at DOE. The assessment of espionage losses and the findings of the independent review are supported. Extreme views on Chinese acquisition of classified information are deemed inaccurate. The most accurate assessment is presented in the April 1999 Intelligence Community report. The April 1999 Intelligence Community Damage Assessment provides the most accurate assessment of espionage losses at the DOE weapons laboratories. The failures in enforcing cyber-security measures and bureaucratic resistance to security directives are highlighted. Recommendations for reorganization are suggested due to the dysfunctional nature of the DOE bureaucracy. Reorganization is needed for the DOE due to its dysfunctional nature. Two solutions proposed for a new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship: a semi-autonomous agency reporting to the Secretary of Energy or an independent agency reporting to the President. The labs should not be under the Department of Defense. Continuous monitoring of DOE reforms by Congress and the executive branch is necessary. The Foreign Visitors' and Assignments Program is valuable for scientific progress. Abolishing the Office of Energy is recommended. The report recommended abolishing the Office of Energy Intelligence and the current oversight system for national weapons labs, proposing a new Joint Committee for Congressional Oversight of ANS/Labs. Scholars critiqued the Cox Committee's report on nuclear weapons, stating that the allegations about theft of nuclear weapons information were largely unsupported. The Cox Committee's report on nuclear weapons was critiqued by scholars for lacking support for allegations of theft of nuclear weapons information. Nicholas Rostow defended the report, stating it was valuable and factually accurate, based on classified information. Danny Stillman's unpublished book about his experience at Los Alamos was also mentioned in the context. Stillman sued the government to publish his manuscript on U.S. and PRC nuclear weapons scientists. He argued that China's program made advances without espionage. Stillman claimed China began miniaturized warhead research in the 1970s, with development halted until a 1992 test. Allegations were made that the government blocked his book for political, not security reasons. Lawsuit ongoing as of June 2003. In January 2000, Stillman's attorney, Mark Zaid, mentioned that the lawsuit regarding his manuscript on U.S. and PRC nuclear weapons scientists was ongoing as of June 2003. Concerns about security at nuclear weapon labs were raised by Congress, with a focus on the foreign visitor program. Senator John Glenn held a hearing in 1988 regarding foreign nationals working at the labs, and in 1996, the House National Security Committee requested a study on controls over foreign visitors. In response to concerns about security at nuclear weapon labs, Congress held hearings and passed legislation to restrict cooperative activities with China related to nuclear weapons technology. The Senate Intelligence Committee investigated reports of missile technology transfer to China in connection with satellite exports. The Senate and House committees conducted investigations into China's acquisition of U.S. nuclear weapon secrets and technology transfers. The Cox Committee approved a classified report with recommendations on technology transfers to China. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee conducted closed hearings to review the investigatory steps of the Departments of Energy and Justice, and the FBI. A bipartisan report was issued on August 5, 1999, highlighting investigatory missteps and misunderstandings at all levels of government. Senator Specter held the first hearing in his investigation on October 26, 1999. Senator Specter conducted hearings on the Justice Department's handling of various issues, including PRC nuclear espionage, satellite exports, campaign finance, and Waco. He criticized the prosecution of Peter H. Lee in 1997 and issued a report critical of the investigation of Wen Ho Lee in 2000. The 106th Congress also held hearings on suspected PRC acquisition of U.S. nuclear weapon secrets. The 106th Congress conducted hearings on various issues including PRC nuclear espionage, satellite exports, campaign finance, and Waco. Hearings were held in different committees such as House Appropriations, Senate Intelligence, Senate Armed Services, Senate Energy and Natural Resources, House Commerce, Senate Judiciary, House Science, and House International Relations. The 106th Congress conducted hearings on various issues including PRC nuclear espionage, satellite exports, campaign finance, and Waco. Hearings were held in different committees such as House Appropriations, Senate Intelligence, Senate Armed Services, Senate Energy and Natural Resources, House Commerce, Senate Judiciary, House Science, and House International Relations. Additionally, hearings were also held in Senate Governmental Affairs, Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, House Intelligence, Senate Judiciary, Senate Armed Services, Senate Governmental Affairs, House Government Reform, and Congressional Asian Pacific. The 106th Congress conducted hearings on various issues including PRC nuclear espionage, satellite exports, campaign finance, and Waco in different committees such as House Appropriations, Senate Intelligence, Senate Armed Services, Senate Energy and Natural Resources, House Commerce, Senate Judiciary, House Science, House International Relations, Senate Governmental Affairs, Senate Banking, Housing, Urban Affairs, House Intelligence, House Government Reform, and Congressional Asian Pacific. The 106th Congress held hearings on various issues including PRC nuclear espionage and satellite exports. Legislation was introduced to prohibit foreign nationals from visiting nuclear weapon labs without notification to Congress. The Senate agreed to improve satellite monitoring in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2000. The 106th Congress introduced legislation to enhance monitoring of satellite exports and strengthen security at DOE facilities. Representative Cox's amendment to H.R. 1401 included 27 sections addressing recommendations from the Cox Committee, which was approved by the House. Meanwhile, Representative Ryun's amendment for a moratorium on foreign visitors to national labs failed. Section 3146 of the FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act was enacted on October 5. Section 3146 of the FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act required background checks on foreign visitors and imposed a moratorium on visits to national labs by foreign nationals of countries on the Sensitive Countries List. The Secretary of Energy may waive the ban on a case-by-case basis, with waivers being issued for foreign scientists to restore the balance between security and science. The Senate removed language from the DOE bill after Secretary Richardson threatened a veto. Richardson opposed the proposal to make labs more autonomous, citing concerns about undermining his authority. Critics argued that autonomy could hinder scientific research important for national security. The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board recommended creating a new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. On June 7, 1999, Representative Thornberry introduced H.R. 2032 to establish a Nuclear Security Administration within the Department of Energy. Secretary Richardson agreed to the proposal for a semi-autonomous agency within DOE, under his control. The Senate approved an amendment for the FY2000 Intelligence by a vote of 96-1 on July 21, 1999. On July 21, 1999, an amendment was approved to create the ANS as a separately organized agency within the DOE, under the Energy Secretary's direction. Democratic Senators sought changes to the amendment, including authority for the Energy Secretary to use field offices and control security operations. The House had options to agree to the Senate's plan or consider other alternatives for the organization of the DOE. The House Armed Services Committee argued for organizational changes at DOE, leading to the creation of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) within DOE. However, there were objections from the Administration and some Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee regarding the potential undermining of the Energy Secretary's authority. Senator Levin expressed concerns about the reorganization going beyond its intended scope. Senator Levin supported the creation of a new entity within DOE but expressed concerns about the Energy Secretary's control over the NNSA administrator. Representative Thornberry argued that the secretary would have unchecked authority. Richardson initially considered recommending a veto of the bill due to concerns about undermining his authority and blurred lines of responsibility. Democrats in Congress and 46 state attorneys general also urged a Presidential veto. President Clinton raised concerns about the DOE reorganization in the FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act, criticizing it as the most troubling part of the act. He directed the Secretary of Energy to act as the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security until further notice. 46 state attorneys general also urged a Presidential veto of the bill. The President directed the Secretary of Energy to act as the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security and oversee the NNSA. Senator Domenici accused the Administration of bypassing the new law, while Representative Spence warned that the President's order would undermine congressional intent. Secretary Richardson assured Congress he would comply with the law but suggested using the Intelligence Authorization Act to address any deficiencies. The House and Senate later passed H.R. 1555 without further issues. On January 7, 2000, Secretary Richardson submitted DOE's plan for implementing legislation to establish the NNSA on March 1, 2000. Richardson's plan raised questions about the semi-autonomous status of the NNSA, calling for some DOE officials to \"serve concurrently\" in functions like nuclear security and counter-intelligence. Field managers at some field operations would also \"serve concurrently in dual positions.\" A special panel of the House Armed Services Committee reviewed DOE's implementation plan and cited serious flaws, criticizing the plan for dual-hatting officials, confused lines of authority, lack of improvements to NNSA programming and budgeting, and little outside consultation. The panel's report concluded that the plan would violate key provisions of the law. Representative Spratt disagreed with the panel's report on DOE's implementation plan, stating it lacked critical review. Congress also raised concerns about racial profiling in the Wen Ho Lee investigation, leading to the passing of resolutions to enforce security and investigate discrimination allegations. Senator Feinstein introduced S.Con.Res. 53 condemning prejudice against individuals of Asian and Pacific Island ancestry, which the Senate passed in 2000. The Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in 1999 due to concerns about U.S. national security implications. Supporters argued it could impede China's nuclear weapon modernization. In 1995, concerns arose about China obtaining secrets about the W88 nuclear weapon. The Clinton Administration took corrective actions and reported serious concerns to the FBI and Congress. By 1997, the FBI identified vulnerabilities at the labs and made recommendations to improve counterintelligence. Former Energy Secretary Federico Pena defended Presidential Decision Directive-61. Presidential Decision Directive-61 was defended by former Energy Secretary Federico Pena, who highlighted actions taken by the Department of Energy to strengthen security. Briefings were conducted with various agencies, including the FBI, CIA, and NSC, leading to the establishment of an Office of Counterintelligence to enhance lab security. Energy Secretary Richardson established an Office of Counterintelligence, led by Edward Curran, in response to PDD-61. Curran submitted a report with 46 recommendations to strengthen counterintelligence. Richardson implemented corrective measures, including polygraph requirements for employees with classified access and increased counterintelligence budget. Energy Secretary Richardson implemented measures to strengthen counterintelligence, including a budget increase and background checks for foreign visitors. Wen Ho Lee, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, underwent a polygraph test in 1998 after a lab-approved visit to a nuclear weapons facility in China. Wen Ho Lee, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, underwent a polygraph test in 1998 after visiting a nuclear weapons facility in China. Despite passing the test, Lee's access to the X Division was suspended, and he was transferred to the Theoretical Division. Lee attempted to access his office in the X Division to continue work on a scientific paper, even after the transfer. The FBI interrogated Wen Ho Lee at his home on January 10, 1999, after recommending to investigate other potential suspects. Despite passing a polygraph test in December 1998, Lee was questioned further and failed another polygraph test on February 10, 1999. The FBI conducted another polygraph test on Wen Ho Lee on February 10, 1999, which he failed. Lee admitted to copying files from one division to another on an open computer system, categorizing them as \"Protected As Restricted Data.\" He claimed he did this to protect the files in case of system changes or crashes, acknowledging it was a security violation. After being fired, Wen Ho Lee left classified files on an unclassified system for convenience, not espionage. Some legacy codes he transferred were not accessed by unauthorized individuals. Allegations arose that someone at UCLA used Lee's password to access Los Alamos' computers in 1994. Lee's daughter testified to accessing powerful computer systems for academic purposes. The FBI interrogated Wen Ho Lee regarding his failed polygraph test and aggressive tactics used during the investigation. Despite initial doubts, counterintelligence officials at Los Alamos believed Lee was not a spy. During the hostile interrogation of Wen Ho Lee, he was falsely told he failed a polygraph test, threatened with arrest and electrocution, and pressured to sign a confession of espionage without legal counsel. Despite maintaining his innocence, some believed the FBI's aggressive tactics were acceptable in law enforcement. The prosecution later admitted Lee passed the Department of Energy's polygraph test. The FBI changed the results of Lee's DOE polygraph test, showing a high degree of truthfulness, to \"incomplete\" and later claimed he failed the test. Lee was fired from Los Alamos for security breaches and the FBI searched his home. Media reported on alleged Chinese spying at the lab, causing congressional concern. Congress was concerned about the investigation into Wen Ho Lee, the government's only suspect in the W88 case. Secretary Richardson fired Lee for alleged security breaches and failure to cooperate on security matters. FBI Director Freeh clarified that no charges had been made yet. Richardson announced initiatives to strengthen counterintelligence at DOE in response to the situation. Seven initiatives were implemented to strengthen counterintelligence at the Department of Energy, including improving security of cyber-information systems and documents containing weapon design data, reviewing the foreign visitors' program, monitoring the counterintelligence program, reviewing investigative files, reporting annually to Congress, and suspending scientific work on computers with nuclear weapon secrets to prevent data breaches. Energy Secretary Richardson announced reforms to increase control over nuclear weapon labs, including appointing a \"security czar\" to report directly to him. Los Alamos improved security measures, while Livermore and Sandia received \"marginal\" ratings. Energy Secretary Richardson appointed retired Air Force General Eugene Habiger as the Director of a new Office of Security and Emergency Operations. He planned to consolidate security funds in DOE under an $800 million budget and allocate an additional $50 million for computer-related security. Richardson also implemented greater controls over floppy disk drives and required electronic banners on government computers. Despite originally requesting $2 million for computer security, the request was increased to $35 million after the PRC espionage case. However, Congress did not approve the additional request in September 1999. In December 1999, Habiger complained about Congress not providing necessary funds for security improvements at labs. Representative Cox countered by asking for a detailed plan on how the additional funds would be used. Victor Reis, Assistant Energy Secretary, resigned in June 1999 due to the Los Alamos controversy. Reis admitted some responsibility for security problems but stated that others at DOE and FBI also share blame. In July 1999, DOE implemented a new policy requiring employees with security clearances to report any \"close and continuing\" relationships. In July 1999, Richardson implemented a new policy for DOE employees with security clearances to report contacts with foreigners from sensitive countries. Lab directors lost authority to grant waivers, and only the Secretary could approve them. Richardson emphasized that the policy only affected foreign citizens, not Americans. In August 1999, Richardson announced disciplinary actions following an internal inquiry. In October 1999, he narrowed the scope of polygraph tests for lab employees. Richardson narrowed the number of lab employees required to take polygraph tests to about 800, primarily those working in sensitive areas at nuclear weapon laboratories. In December 1999, he presented a plan to establish the new NNSA and received recommendations from the Task Force Against Racial Profiling in January 2000. On January 25, 2000, Secretary Richardson reported improvements in security and counter-intelligence, including cyber-security training for 700 administrators. Lab employees were now unable to transfer nuclear secrets between systems. Concerns arose that the heightened security environment at the labs was impacting their scientific mission. The NNSA began operations on March 1, 2000, with about 2,000 DOE employees realigned to NNSA. President Clinton nominated U.S. Air Force General John A. Gordon as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence in May 2000. Force General John A. Gordon to become the first Under Secretary for Nuclear Security and NNSA administrator, a decision announced by Secretary Richardson on March 2, 2000. The Senate confirmed the nomination on June 14, 2000. Critics argued that the Clinton Administration was slow to respond to concerns about China and the labs, with DOE officials resisting reforms for years. Charles Curtis ordered new security measures in November 1996, but they were not implemented by the labs or DOE officials. In April 1997, the FBI recommended changes at the labs, including reinstating background checks on foreign visitors, but the DOE did not implement improvements in counterintelligence until after Bill Richardson became Secretary of Energy in August 1998. The suspect was selected to head a program to update computer programming for nuclear weapons without testing, hiring a PRC citizen to assist. Critics questioned the delay in issuing PDD-61 until February 1998 despite suspicions of China obtaining W88 data in 1995. The PFIAB, led by former Senator Rudman, criticized the Clinton Administration for delays in responding to DOE's problems. They found the four-month delay in implementing PDD-61 and advising the National Security Advisor on actions to be unacceptable. The PFIAB criticized the Clinton Administration for delays in implementing a Presidential directive. House Commerce Committee members raised concerns about serious security deficiencies at Lawrence Livermore lab. The PFIAB criticized the Clinton Administration for delays in implementing a Presidential directive and raised concerns about security deficiencies at Lawrence Livermore lab. Critics were concerned about the lack of prompt action and aggressive investigation to protect national security in the W88 case, where a suspect remained employed at Los Alamos until March 1999 despite being identified by DOE and the FBI. The report highlighted the need for a systematic process to balance law enforcement and national security interests. The FBI began investigating the suspect in the X Division in 1995, but the investigation was not made public until December 1998. Despite concerns raised by the Director of the FBI in 1997, the suspect was not dismissed until March 1999. Energy Secretary Richardson confirmed cooperation between the DOE and FBI but acknowledged concerns about how the suspect retained access to classified information. An internal DOE inquiry revealed a \"total breakdown\" in the espionage investigation. Energy Secretary Richardson confirmed a \"total breakdown\" in the espionage investigation, stating that blame was widespread. He highlighted the need for earlier job reassignment for the suspect and stronger cooperation with the FBI. Three DOE officials were identified for discipline, including Sig Hecker, Robert Vrooman, and Terry Craig. Former secretaries Federico Pena and Elizabeth Moler were also mentioned in connection to the investigation. Former DOE officials Federico Pena, Elizabeth Moler, and Victor Reis would have faced disciplinary action. Critics questioned FBI's handling of the case, including lack of electronic surveillance and delayed interrogation of the suspect. DOJ's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review denied FBI's requests for wiretaps. The DOJ's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review denied FBI's applications for electronic surveillance of the suspect in 1997 and 1998 due to insufficient evidence of current espionage activity. Attorney General Reno supported the decision, stating that constitutional and FISA standards were not met. Contrary to reports, the 1997 request did not include a computer search. At a closed hearing, Attorney General Janet Reno explained that the FISA application lacked probable cause. The PFIAB criticized the Department of Justice for being too restrictive with FISA, questioning why the FBI's request did not include searching the subject's workplace computer systems. Competing concerns about civil liberties were raised in the Lee case. The Lee case raised concerns about relaxing civil liberties for national security surveillance. Critics worried about the lack of monitoring on the suspect's computer, leading to a compromise of nuclear weapon secrets. Secretary Richardson shut down lab computers due to security breaches. The suspect transferred highly secret nuclear weapon codes. Wen Ho Lee transferred highly secret nuclear weapon codes from a classified to an unclassified computer at Los Alamos. The FBI had difficulty obtaining a search warrant due to lack of privacy warnings on the computers. Lee claimed innocence in a television interview. Wen Ho Lee declared his innocence in a television interview, stating he did not disclose nuclear secrets to China and transferred weapon data to an unclassified computer to protect it. He felt he was made a scapegoat due to being the only Asian American in the X Division at Los Alamos. Others at the lab also mentioned the common practice of transferring files between classified and unclassified computers. Senators Thompson and Lieberman reported on potential mishandling by DOE, FBI, and DOJ. The Governmental Affairs Committee reported on mishandling of the investigation by DOE, FBI, and DOJ, with criticism towards their communication. DOE's Inspector General found that a counterintelligence official missed a computer privacy waiver signed by Wen Ho Lee in 1995, leading to FBI's late discovery in 1999. Senator Specter's investigation criticized the ineptitude of FBI's and DOE's investigations, as well as the Department of Justice and Attorney General Janet Reno for not acting on FBI's warrant request. Senator Grassley criticized the FBI for not informing Congress that Wen Ho Lee was not the prime suspect in the espionage case at Los Alamos. He requested an investigation into whether a senior FBI official withheld documents. Senator Grassley disputed Senator Specter's report, stating that the evidence against Lee was weak. The scope of the investigation was also questioned. The investigation in the W88 espionage case was criticized for narrowing down prematurely on one lab and one suspect, Wen Ho Lee. The FBI initially had only one or two agents assigned to the case, which increased to 40 agents by mid-1999. Attorney General Reno acknowledged concerns about the handling of the case and announced the establishment of a panel of FBI agents and federal prosecutors to conduct further investigation. The Justice Department established a panel of FBI agents and federal prosecutors to review the investigation of Wen Ho Lee. The government expanded the investigation to examine evidence from military facilities and defense contractors, code-named \"Fall-out.\" FBI doubted Lee's involvement in the W88 case as early as January 1999. The FBI initially doubted Wen Ho Lee's involvement in the W88 case, known as \"Kindred Spirit,\" due to him passing a polygraph test in December 1998. However, by November 1999, new evidence suggested that China obtained information on U.S. nuclear weapons from a facility involved in assembling them, potentially implicating entities like Sandia National Lab and Lockheed Martin Corporation. The FBI mishandled the espionage probe involving Wen Ho Lee, with internal turf wars and a focus on Lee as the prime suspect. The government could have discovered Lee's actions earlier, as he had signed a privacy waiver. FBI agents admitted to multiple mistakes in the investigation. Bellows' report criticized the handling of the case. In August 2001, the Washington Post reported extensive criticisms of the FBI, DOE, and the Justice Department's OIPR regarding the mishandling of the Wen Ho Lee case. The investigation later shifted to focus on the Pentagon and its contractors due to PRC espionage activities. This led to the indictment of Wen Ho Lee, but did not fully resolve the case. Former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee's criminal case did not solve the government's investigation into whether the PRC obtained W88 secrets by espionage. The Justice Department was not planning to charge Lee with espionage as of November 1999. A meeting was held in December 1999 at the White House to discuss indicting Lee, with top officials in attendance. The FBI completed an investigation into Lee's transfers of computer files in December 1999. In December 1999, Wen Ho Lee was arrested and indicted for mishandling classified information, including violations of the Atomic Energy Act and the Federal Espionage Act. The charges included intent to injure the United States or secure an advantage for a foreign nation. Lee faced a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for the Atomic Energy Act violations and up to ten years for the Federal Espionage Act violations. The 59-count indictment against Wen Ho Lee alleged that he downloaded classified files related to nuclear weapons from Los Alamos. Lee transferred files to 10 portable computer tapes, with seven tapes unaccounted for. He transferred Restricted Data on nuclear weapon research from a classified system to an unsecure computer and then to nine tapes. In 1997, Lee allegedly downloaded current nuclear weapon design codes to a 10th tape. Wen Ho Lee's lawyer requested another polygraph test and provided information to refute mishandling of tapes. Lee pleaded not guilty to charges in court and defense claimed tapes were destroyed with no evidence of Lee having or disclosing them. Despite offering bail, Lee was held in jail without bail, placed in solitary confinement, shackled, and denied outdoor exercise. Wen Ho Lee and his wife filed a lawsuit against the Departments of Energy and Justice and the FBI for alleged Privacy Act violations. The government made unauthorized disclosures about them, portraying them as \"spies.\" Lee's attorney revealed that the files he downloaded were reclassified after he was fired in 1999. The files Wen Ho Lee downloaded were not classified information but considered \"Protect As Restricted Data (PARD).\" The government changed this classification after the downloading, as shown in the prosecution's evidence. Lee's defense argued the indictment was deceptive, while the Justice Department claimed Lee took U.S. nuclear weapon secrets. Lee's lawyers noted PARD's security ranking was five out of nine. Lee's defense team requested the prosecution to name the foreign nation(s) Lee allegedly sought to help. The prosecution was ordered to disclose the foreign nations Lee may have sought to help in downloading nuclear data. The named countries were the PRC, Taiwan, Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland. Lee wrote in his book that he made backup copies of his files to protect his codes. In August 2000, U.S. District Judge James Parker ruled in favor of Lee's defense, requiring the government to publicly explain the nuclear secrets Lee allegedly downloaded. A top nuclear weapons expert testified that 99 percent of the information Lee downloaded was publicly available. According to Richter, the information Lee downloaded was publicly available and would not harm U.S. national security. The \"crown jewels\" of U.S. nuclear weapons secrets were not the simulation codes Lee obtained, but data from nuclear tests. Richter believed Lee should be acquitted as the codes could only assist in designing, not completing, nuclear weapons. Defense attorneys also argued that FBI Special Agent Messemer gave false testimony about Lee's alleged deception. The hearing on August 24, 2000, resulted in a victory for Lee's defense as Judge Parker allowed him to be released on bail under strict supervision at home. Despite delays in planning a reception, Lee was granted $1 million bail with tight restrictions, including a three-day search of his house by the prosecution. The Justice Department allowed Wen Ho Lee to be released on bail with strict supervision at home, including electronic monitoring, surveillance of phone calls and mail, and restrictions on visitors. Judge Parker granted bail after new revelations in the case made the offenses seem less serious than previously thought. Top weapons designers testified that the information Lee downloaded was less sensitive than initially described. The information Lee downloaded was deemed less sensitive than initially thought, with FBI Agent Robert Messemer testifying inaccurately about Lee. The government had a less sinister theory that Lee was seeking employment abroad, and there was no direct evidence of intent to harm the US. Family, friends, and colleagues supported Lee's character, and concerns were raised by scientists about unfair treatment. Reno expressed concerns about Lee's treatment and the U.S. justice system. Lee's release on bail was temporarily halted by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals due to national security concerns. A plea agreement was negotiated where Lee would plead guilty to one count, help verify the destruction of tapes, and be freed. On September 13, 2000, Wen Ho Lee pleaded guilty to one felony count of unauthorized possession of defense information. The plea agreement had been approved by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh after weeks of negotiation. Critics argued that the prosecution's case had crumbled, while the prosecution maintained that Lee's actions were unlawful. Lee was sentenced to 278 days in jail, which included the nine months he had already served. Lee was sentenced to 278 days in jail, which included the nine months he had already served. He agreed to answer questions for 10 days over three weeks starting on September 26, 2000. The government retained the option of prosecuting Lee and giving him another polygraph test. Judge Parker criticized the Executive Branch for the unfair treatment of Lee and apologized for his custody. Attorney General Reno launched internal reviews of the prosecution of Lee in response to Judge Parker's remarks criticizing the unfair treatment of Lee. President Clinton also criticized Lee's pre-trial detention, expressing reservations about denying him bail. U.S. Attorney Norman Bay emphasized that justice was served as Lee agreed to disclose information about mishandled nuclear data. The plea agreement was deemed in the best interest of national security to uncover the whereabouts of the tapes. FBIDirector Louis Freeh revealed that plea bargaining began before the last bail hearings, with the focus on determining the fate of the tapes. Lee's disclosure of making copies of the tapes caused a delay in the plea agreement. Lee, now considered retired, agreed to answer questions for up to 10 days as part of the plea agreement. FBI agents searched a landfill in New Mexico in late November and early December 2000 to find the tapes that Lee claimed he had thrown away in January 1999. In early 2001, the New York Times reviewed its reporting on Wen Ho Lee's case, criticizing investigators for constructing a narrative based on ambiguous evidence of Chinese espionage that eventually collapsed. Senator Shelby discussed alleged espionage by China against U.S. nuclear programs, stating that key questions remained unresolved despite extensive investigations. The investigation into Wen Ho Lee's case raised questions about Chinese espionage, with key details still unknown. Despite criticism, Lee was accused of illegally downloading classified nuclear weapons information from Los Alamos. Issues with the FBI's relationship with Lee and his wife, Sylvia Lee, further complicated the case. Mrs. Lee had reportedly been informing on PRC visitors for the FBI from 1985 to 1991. Sylvia Lee reported on visiting PRC scientists for the CIA in the 1980s, while Wen Ho Lee helped the FBI in the \"Tiger Trap\" case and passed a polygraph in 1984. Lee also assisted the FBI after making an intercepted call in 1982 to another scientist under suspicion of espionage. The government's decision not to prosecute former DCI John Deutch complicated Lee's case. Deutch was investigated for mishandling classified information and moving files to unsecured personal computers. The CIA reported that Deutch may have tampered with evidence. The CIA investigated former DCI John Deutch for mishandling classified files, including attempting to delete over 1,000 classified files. Top CIA officials impeded the investigation, delaying the appointment of an independent counsel. The Justice Department decided not to prosecute in April 1999 without an FBI investigation. The inspector general's report, completed in July 1999, led to the suspension of Deutch's security clearance in August 1999. The report highlighted Deutch's mishandling of classified information on unsecure computers connected to the internet, posing a potential risk to U.S. security. The Senate Intelligence Committee received a copy of the report in late August 1999, and the CIA's inspector general released an unclassified report on February 18, 2000. The report found that despite Deutch's knowledge of handling classified information on unclassified computers, he processed a large volume of highly classified information without restricting unauthorized access, putting national security at risk. Senior CIA officials' response to the issue was criticized. Concerned about fairness, Attorney General Janet Reno announced a review of Deutch's case in February 2000. By May 2000, a criminal investigation was initiated into Deutch's mishandling of classified information, reversing Reno's previous decision not to prosecute. In August 2000, the former prosecutor recommended prosecuting Deutch for mishandling classified information. By September 2000, a recommendation was considered to charge Deutch with a misdemeanor. In early 2001, Deutch negotiated a plea agreement but was pardoned by President Clinton on January 20, 2001, facing only a $5,000 fine. The Senate Intelligence Committee criticized the pardon of Deutch for mishandling classified information, stating he displayed a reckless disregard for security practices. The committee confirmed that Deutch's unclassified computers contained sensitive U.S. policy discussions and classified intelligence relationships. The resignation of Notra Trulock in August 1999 complicated the investigation into security practices at the CIA and other Intelligence Community agencies. Trulock was criticized for being overly focused on Los Alamos and Wen Ho Lee, with concerns of racial profiling and selective prosecution. Trulock blamed the FBI for mishandling the W88 case. Lee, an American of Chinese ethnicity born in Taiwan, was unfairly targeted as the prime suspect in a narrow investigation and media reports related to PRC espionage. He believed he was being made a scapegoat due to his Asian heritage and role in nuclear weapon designs at Los Alamos. The government's approach in countering espionage and investigating the W88 case was questioned. Ed Curran expressed concern over the devastating impact on Lee, who had not been proven guilty and should be presumed innocent. The National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium and the Committee of 100 expressed concerns about racial profiling and selective investigation in the case of Dr. Lee, urging for a thorough and professional investigation. The Coalition of Asian Pacific American Federal Employee Organizations urged the Administration to protect rights and civil liberties. The Coalition of Asian Pacific American Federal Employee Organizations urged the Administration to protect the rights and civil liberties of Americans of Asian descent by enforcing anti-discrimination laws. Former head of counterintelligence at Los Alamos, Robert Vrooman, stated that Wen Ho Lee was targeted due to his Chinese descent, highlighting the importance of safeguarding the rights of all Americans during investigations. The investigation into Wen Ho Lee was influenced by his ethnicity, with key figures stating that he was targeted based on his Chinese descent rather than evidence. Robert Vrooman highlighted the lack of evidence against Lee and emphasized the role of ethnicity in singling him out as a suspect. Ethnicity played a significant role in identifying Lee as a suspect, while Caucasians with similar backgrounds were ignored. Notra Trulock was also mentioned in a news report regarding the investigation. Notra Trulock compiled a list of 70 people at Los Alamos who visited China, narrowing it down to 12 suspects including Wen Ho Lee. One Caucasian scientist in the same field as Lee was not on the list. Robert Vrooman mentioned 15 people conducting nuclear weapons research who visited China but were not suspects. Trulock insisted on Lee's involvement despite lack of evidence. Notra Trulock and Daniel Bruno emphasized that race was not a factor in suspecting Wen Ho Lee at the DOE. Senators Thompson and Lieberman found no evidence of racial profiling in the initial investigation, only considering Lee's ethnicity later due to concerns about Chinese intelligence recruitment. Paul Moore, an FBI counterintelligence expert, highlighted Beijing's efforts to recruit Chinese American scientists in sensitive U.S. facilities. Paul Moore, a former FBI counterintelligence expert, highlighted China's unconventional espionage tactics, emphasizing that they manipulate foreign visitors into giving away secrets. Others argued against targeting Americans of Chinese heritage as a group to counter PRC espionage, citing concerns about racial profiling in espionage investigations. The government's use of racial profiling in espionage investigations was criticized as ineffective. Former officials and members of Congress expressed concerns about targeting Chinese-Americans as suspects without empirical data to support such claims. Representative Wu introduced a resolution to address the issue of racial profiling in the Wen Ho Lee case. The House passed H.Con.Res. 124 on November 2, 1999, calling for enforcement of security at national laboratories and investigation of discrimination allegations. Senator Feinstein introduced S.Con.Res. 53 to condemn prejudice against individuals of Asian ancestry, which was passed by the Senate on July 27, 2000. The Congressional Asian Pacific Caucus held a briefing on October 5, 1999, with Secretary Richardson testifying. Energy Secretary Richardson and others testified about suspicions of a Chinese American connection to espionage, emphasizing the need to protect national security without unfairly targeting Asian Pacific Americans. Richardson established a Task Force Against Racial Profiling in response to the allegations, aiming to address the atmosphere of distrust and suspicion found at DOE sites. The hostile work environment for Americans of Asian heritage resulted from media exploitation of espionage allegations and questioning of loyalty based on race. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigated discrimination at Livermore and Los Alamos labs. Lee's defense argued he was a victim of racial profiling and selective prosecution. Judge James Parker ordered the government to hand over documents to Wen Ho Lee's defense attorneys by September 15, 2000, to review for relevance to his case. U.S. Attorney Norman Bay denied claims of selective prosecution based on Lee's ethnicity, stating he was prosecuted for mishandling nuclear data. In May 2001, racial profiling at DOE targeted Representative David Wu, preventing him from entering DOE headquarters for an event. Representative Cox protested to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, urging action to prevent such incidents in the future. Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard and other House Members were appalled by the incident. The Committee on Appropriations expressed concern about DOE using citizenship as a security screening tool after a Chinese-American Member of Congress was denied entry to DOE headquarters. A review of the Justice Department's handling of Wen Ho Lee's case found no evidence of racism. The report found that Wen Ho and Sylvia Lee were wrongly singled out as suspects by the DOE and FBI, leading to calls for an independent review due to concerns of racial bias. There were theories that Wen Ho Lee may have leaked nuclear information to Taiwan, where he was born, rather than to China. Lee was reported to have worked as a consultant for a military research institute in Taiwan after allegedly downloading files to portable tapes in the 1990s. During a visit to Taiwan in December 1998, Wen Ho Lee accessed classified nuclear files at Los Alamos using his password. The U.S. Attorney named eight foreign governments Lee may have sought to help with the data, including Taiwan, where he had an interest in working in 1993. Despite earlier reports, new information emerged after interrogations in November and December 2000. During interrogations in November and December 2000, new questions arose about Wen Ho Lee's contacts with Taiwan. It was revealed that Lee received $5,000 from the Chung Shan Institute for consulting work in 1998, which he reportedly failed to report to the Los Alamos lab. Lee claimed that his consulting work was approved by the lab and that his bank account in Taiwan was for his sister and never held more than $3,000. The investigation also sparked a debate on the importance of China's own modernization efforts versus foreign technology acquisitions. The former director of Los Alamos, who oversaw the design of the W88 warhead, wrote a letter to the Wall Street Journal in May 1999. He criticized those in Washington for lacking knowledge on Chinese nuclear competence and the challenges of using computer codes for weapon design. He emphasized the difficulty of replicating a weapon system solely from computer code and highlighted the outdated design of the W88 warhead. In May 2001, the press reported on Danny Stillman's unpublished book about his experiences in exchanges between U.S. and PRC nuclear scientists in the 1990s. Stillman argued that China's nuclear program made advances without espionage. Congress was not adequately informed about issues at the labs, as noted by Representatives Goss and Dicks. The Cox Committee's report in December 1998 urged Congress to demand notification about such matters. The bipartisan report in December 1998 urged Congress to demand notification from the Administration due to non-compliance with congressional notification requirements. Representative Hunter criticized Elizabeth Moler for failing to testify about the W88 case in a hearing. A hearing was held in April 1999 to examine Moler's testimony accuracy and whether she instructed Notra Trulock. Elizabeth Moler was criticized for withholding critical information about espionage cases from Congress, including the W88 case. Notra Trulock testified that Moler edited his testimony to remove references to successful espionage at U.S. labs, providing an incomplete picture of the threat. Moler defended her actions by stating that some information was classified and that revealing damaging information about PRC espionage would unfairly impugn important DOE exchange programs. Trulock also testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee about the issue. Trulock criticized DOE officials for ignoring, minimizing, and ridiculing his concerns about espionage at U.S. labs. He also mentioned that senior DOE officials delayed authorizing intelligence briefings and denied approval for him to brief the House Intelligence Committee on the W88 case. DOE officials expressed concerns about negative impacts on lab credibility and exchange programs with China and Russia. Trulock stated that DOE only participated in two out of the 19 briefings on alleged espionage at the labs. Trulock criticized DOE officials for ignoring his concerns about espionage at U.S. labs. He mentioned that DOE delayed authorizing intelligence briefings and denied approval for him to brief the House Intelligence Committee on the W88 case. The Administration provided numerous briefings on cases involving China and the labs. Trulock acknowledged NSC official Gary Samore's encouragement of counterintelligence efforts to protect sensitive information at the laboratories. The House Government Reform Committee held a hearing on concerns about firings on June 24, 1999. The House Government Reform Committee held a hearing on June 24, 1999, regarding concerns about firings, demotions, and harassment of \"whistle-blowers\" at the Energy and Defense Departments. Chairman Dan Burton criticized an alleged gag order at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Energy Secretary Richardson announced an internal inquiry into allegations of obstructing briefings to Congress. The Inspector General's report did not definitively establish any intentional obstruction. Notra Trulock criticized the Inspector General's report as a \"whitewash\" and resigned from his position at DOE. Senator Specter issued a report critical of the investigations of Wen Ho Lee, citing ineptitude in the FBI's and DOE's investigations. The FBI and DOE investigations into Wen Ho Lee were criticized as \"inept.\" Senator Grassley questioned why the FBI did not inform Congress that Lee was not the main suspect in the espionage case. There were concerns about National Security Advisor Sandy Berger's handling of PRC issues. National Security Advisor Sandy Berger faced scrutiny over his handling of concerns about PRC espionage at the labs, with calls for his resignation. Discrepancies arose regarding when President Clinton was briefed on the espionage cases and his knowledge of suspected PRC espionage into the 1990s. President Clinton initially denied knowledge of any espionage during his presidency but later clarified his statement in response to reports of China seeking neutron bomb data in 1995. Sandy Berger faced scrutiny over concerns about PRC espionage at the labs, with discrepancies on when President Clinton was briefed. Berger stated he briefed the President in 1997 after DOE briefed the NSC, and again in 1997 after a more extensive briefing. He argued that there was no suspect in 1996 and that the FBI had not started its investigation. Berger also mentioned that the President did not raise the issue of PRC espionage at the October 1997 summit with PRC President Jiang Zemin. The FBI began investigating W88 data in September 1995, but FBI Director Freeh prioritized protecting information over the case in August 1997. The PFIAB stated that the White House was aware of PRC espionage at nuclear weapon labs before 1996 and that a comprehensive briefing in July 1997 warranted aggressive action. The White House knew about PRC espionage at nuclear weapon labs before 1996. In 1995, DOE officials met with the FBI on suspected PRC espionage of U.S. nuclear weapon data, leading to discussions among senior DOE, CIA, and White House officials. Former White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta was informed by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary in July 1995, prompting further actions by DCI John Deutch and National Security Advisor Anthony Lake. In 1995, DOE officials met with the FBI on suspected PRC espionage of U.S. nuclear weapon data. Senior officials, including National Security Advisor Anthony Lake, were briefed. Top law-enforcement and DOE officials, including Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh, discussed whether to indict Wen Ho Lee in December 1999. President Clinton criticized Lee's pre-trial detention in September 2000. The controversy surrounding the plea agreement for Wen Ho Lee raised concerns about national security and export control policies towards China, particularly regarding the export of high-performance computers. Critics questioned the inconsistency between labeling Lee as a national security risk one day and then reaching a plea agreement for a lesser offense the next. The Department of Commerce reported that high-performance computers were exported to China in 1998 with minimal end-use checks. Concerns were raised about U.S. satellite exports leading to transfers of missile technology to China. Despite criticisms, President Clinton emphasized strict controls on technology exports to China. There were also debates on expanding nuclear cooperation with China. The Administration expanded nuclear ties with China, including lab exchanges, despite security concerns. President Clinton promised to implement the 1985 nuclear cooperation agreement. Concerns about partisanship urged upgrading U.S. lab security and assessing damage from China's reported compromise of U.S. secrets. The FBI Director confirmed a long-standing vulnerability to intelligence compromises at nuclear weapon labs since 1988. Concerns about counterintelligence at the Department of Energy date back to 1988, with reassessments and consideration of intelligence-related legislation following the Los Alamos controversy. The Intelligence Community conducted an assessment of potential damage from leaks of nuclear weapons secrets. The FBI Director confirmed a vulnerability to intelligence compromises at nuclear weapon labs since 1988. Efforts to formalize the government's counterintelligence began after the arrest of Aldrich Ames. A Presidential Directive in May 1994 placed the policy and coordinating machinery of counterintelligence in the hands of the NSC. The National Counterintelligence Policy Board was created to coordinate CIA and FBI efforts. The Counterintelligence Policy Board focused on coordinating CIA and FBI efforts for counterintelligence at intelligence agencies. Concerns about DOE laboratories were addressed in 1998 with the issuance of PDD-61, which mandated a stronger counterintelligence program. Steps taken included hiring new professionals, doubling the budget, implementing a new screening process for foreign scientists, and conducting more extensive security reviews. In the late 1970s to 1980s, China reportedly acquired U.S. data on the neutron bomb from Livermore and passed it to Pakistan, raising concerns about nuclear weapon proliferation. Advanced U.S. warheads could provide valuable features for developing more efficient warheads, potentially leading to a more potent nuclear force if China shared U.S. nuclear weapon information with other countries. The CIA's damage assessment in April 1999 raised concerns about China potentially sharing U.S. nuclear weapon secrets with other countries, leading to nuclear proliferation worries. India conducted nuclear tests in response to reports that China may have acquired designs for the W88 warhead, citing security concerns. Members considered curtailing nuclear proliferation in light of these developments. Members considered curtailing the U.S.-China lab-to-lab program due to concerns about nuclear proliferation. Senator Shelby emphasized the need for increased security measures at labs to prevent the leakage of bomb secrets. The Intelligence Community's damage assessment in April 1999 highlighted worries about China's technical advances through contact with scientists from various countries. The review panel warned of dangers in exchanges between U.S. and PRC or Russian nuclear specialists, emphasizing the value of these contacts for addressing safety, command and control, and proliferation issues. A 1999 report by the CIA and FBI highlighted PRC scientists gathering information through U.S. national laboratories. China's nuclear facilities include the China Academy of Engineering Physics at Mianyang, Sichuan province. China's nuclear weapon installations were reorganized in 1998, with facilities partly subordinated to the People's Liberation Army. This reorganization had implications for U.S. policy on arms control and nonproliferation. Contacts with foreign nuclear scientists, including those from China, have allowed U.S. nuclear weapon labs to learn about China's nuclear weapon establishment. The engagement with scientists from China and other countries has supported arms control and nonproliferation objectives, as well as advanced U.S. interests in ensuring foreign nuclear powers have control over nuclear materials to prevent leaks to rogue states. The Department of Energy authorized limited contact with China's nuclear weapons establishment to avoid aiding their weapons program. The Department of Energy authorized restricted interactions on nuclear materials protection and verification technologies for arms control treaties, which are in our national security interest. The lab-to-lab program with China has provided valuable insights into their nuclear weapons program and helped establish an arms control program in China. Suspected PRC espionage at U.S. labs complicated the Administration's policy of engagement with China. Vice President Gore emphasized the importance of the relationship with China for influencing their behavior and improving human rights. President Clinton defended his policy of engagement with China, stating it has benefited U.S. interests in nonproliferation, Korea, and the Asian financial crisis. He emphasized the need for principled engagement with China's leaders and people to resolve differences. Critics pointed to the W88 case as evidence that engagement did not adequately protect U.S. national security. Critics argued that the W88 case revealed the failure of engagement to safeguard U.S. national security interests, advocating for a more confrontational containment policy towards China. They believed that engagement had harmed rather than benefited U.S. interests, leading to calls for a reassessment of U.S. policy towards China. Critics also highlighted ongoing challenges posed by PRC espionage and China's military, emphasizing the need for a tougher approach within the framework of engagement. James Lilley and Henry Kissinger criticized the Clinton White House's approach to China, emphasizing the need for a more defined and sustainable Sino-American relationship beyond just engagement. The W88 case raised concerns about lab-to-lab exchanges and highlighted the broader implications for the relationship with China. The W88 case raised concerns about lab-to-lab exchanges and their impact on the relationship with China, including military ties and trade relations."
