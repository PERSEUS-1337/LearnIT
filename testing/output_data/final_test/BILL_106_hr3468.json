    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Duchesne City Water Rights Conveyance Act\". It includes findings related to water rights. The Congress confirmed the establishment of the Uintah Valley Reservation in 1861 by President Lincoln. Additional lands were added to form the Uintah Indian Reservation. Lands were allotted to the Indians, and unallotted lands were restored to the public domain. President Theodore Roosevelt reserved lands for Duchesne, Utah in 1905. The United States filed applications on behalf of the Indians of the Uintah Indian Reservation. Reservation, Utah, filed two water appropriation applications, 43-180 and 43-203, for irrigation, domestic supply, and townsite purposes. The United States later filed change applications for municipal and domestic use in Duchesne, Utah. State Engineer of Utah approved the changes and issued water right certificates. Certificates numbered 1034 and 1056 were issued by the United States Indian Service in 1921 for domestic and municipal uses in Duchesne. Non-Indians settled in Duchesne and utilized the appropriated waters for townsite purposes. Congress ratified the Ute Indian Tribe's reserved water rights, with the Tribe not opposing the conveyance of water rights to Duchesne as it does not serve their interests. The Secretary of the Interior needs more authority to transfer water rights appropriated by the United States in 1905 to Duchesne for the city's use, while also providing benefits to the Ute Indian Tribe as originally intended.
