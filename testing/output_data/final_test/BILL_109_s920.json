During a Presidential election year, nominees should designate individuals for whom electors should vote if nominees are deceased or incapacitated before the electors' meeting. During a Presidential election year, if a nominee for Vice President is deceased or incapacitated, electors should give their votes to the nominee of the same political party for the office of Vice President. If a nominee for President is deceased or incapacitated, electors should give their votes to the individual designated by the nominees. In the event of the death or incapacity of both the Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees of the same political party, electors should vote for the individuals designated by the nominees.
