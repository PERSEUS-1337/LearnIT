    "content": "In Kisor v. Wilkie, the Supreme Court upheld the Auer deference doctrine, which requires courts to defer to agencies' reasonable interpretations of ambiguous regulatory language. The Court emphasized that the doctrine applies only in limited circumstances, potentially impacting future courts' review of agency actions and how agencies make decisions. This decision could have implications for the Chevron doctrine, another key principle guiding judicial review of agency actions. Auer deference, rooted in a 1945 Supreme Court decision, instructs courts to defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous regulatory language unless it is plainly erroneous. Unlike Chevron deference, which applies to agency interpretations of statutes with the force of law, Auer deference has been applied to nonbinding agency materials. Despite criticism from some Supreme Court Justices, the doctrine remains longstanding. The Supreme Court reviewed the Kisor case involving the denial of retroactive disability compensation benefits by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Court vacated the Federal Circuit's decision but was divided on whether to overrule Auer deference, with a majority voting to uphold it. Justice Kagan wrote the opinion on behalf of five Justices. Justice Kagan, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, and Sotomayor, upheld Auer deference based on stare decisis principles. She argued that the petitioner's arguments did not provide a strong enough reason to abandon the doctrine, citing extensive precedent supporting its use in administrative law. The majority expressed concerns that overturning Auer deference could lead to revisiting numerous cases that applied the doctrine, emphasizing the need for a \"special justification\" to do so. The Supreme Court did not overrule Auer deference but restated its limitations and established a multistep process for determining when it should be applied to an agency's interpretation of a regulation. This includes only deferring under Auer if the regulation is genuinely ambiguous and the agency's interpretation is reasonable. The Supreme Court established a multistep process for determining when Auer deference should be applied to an agency's interpretation of a regulation. The court must assess whether the agency's interpretation is within the zone of ambiguity, independently evaluate if it is entitled to controlling weight based on character and context, and ensure that the interpretation is the official position of the agency and reflects its substantive expertise and fair judgment. The Court remanded a case to the Federal Circuit for not adequately assessing these criteria. The Supreme Court remanded a case to the Federal Circuit for not adequately assessing whether the regulation at issue was ambiguous and if the VA's interpretation deserved deference. Justice Kagan argued for Auer deference based on agencies' expertise, political accountability, and the agency's role in interpreting regulations. The Supreme Court remanded a case to the Federal Circuit for not adequately assessing whether the regulation at issue was ambiguous and if the VA's interpretation deserved deference. Justice Gorsuch disagreed with the majority's refusal to overrule Auer, arguing that the doctrine violates the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. He proposed using the \"Skidmore doctrine\" instead of Auer deference. The \"Skidmore doctrine\" is used to interpret agency regulations, giving nonbinding weight to administrative interpretations based on thoroughness, reasoning, and persuasiveness. The Chief Justice supported upholding Auer deference, noting similarities between opinions. The Chief Justice supported upholding Auer deference, noting similarities with the Skidmore doctrine. The framework in Kisor for assessing deference may guide lower courts on agency interpretations. The Kisor Court's elaborations on the limits of Auer deference may impact future court decisions and agency practices. Congress has the option to modify the application of deference by statute, such as amending the APA to remove deference for agency interpretations of regulations. Additionally, specific statutes could dictate whether Auer deference or another standard of review should be applied to regulatory interpretations. The Supreme Court's decision in Department of Commerce v. New York addressed legal challenges to adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The Court ruled that while adding the question did not violate the Constitution or Census Act, the Department of Commerce was temporarily prohibited from doing so due to a violation of the APA by Secretary Ross. The Census Act delegates the responsibility of conducting a decennial census to the Secretary of Commerce, granting discretion on the form and content of the census. Limits are placed on how the census can be conducted, with instructions to first attempt to obtain information from federal, state, or other sources. The Census Act instructs the Secretary of Commerce to obtain information from government sources to conduct the decennial census. Secretary Ross added a citizenship question to the 2020 census based on a request from the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice requested the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census for enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Despite the Census Bureau recommending relying on administrative records for accuracy, Secretary Ross chose to include the citizenship question as well. The addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census was challenged in federal district courts in California, Maryland, and New York. Two courts concluded that including the question would harm the accuracy of the census without any legitimate benefit. Two courts found that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census would harm accuracy without any legitimate benefit. Secretary Ross violated Sections 6(c) and 141(f) of the Census Act by not relying on administrative records to the maximum extent possible and not including citizenship as a \"subject\" in the first report to Congress. Additionally, all three district courts held that Secretary Ross violated the APA by not basing his decision on reasoned decision-making. The courts found Secretary Ross's decision to add a citizenship question to the census unlawful and contrary to evidence. Chief Justice Roberts, joined by other Justices, ruled that adding the question did not violate the Constitution's Enumeration Clause. The Supreme Court upheld Secretary Ross's decision to include a citizenship question on the census, citing historical precedent and the Secretary's discretion in obtaining citizenship data for the Department of Justice. The Court found that the Enumeration Clause does not prohibit asking about citizenship and that the decision was supported by evidence, despite tradeoffs with using administrative records alone for accuracy. The Supreme Court upheld Secretary Ross's decision to include a citizenship question on the census, citing historical precedent and the Secretary's discretion in obtaining citizenship data. The Court acknowledged tradeoffs between accuracy and completeness in the options presented, with the Secretary having the discretion to choose reasonable policy alternatives. It was noted that the Secretary weighed the costs and benefits, particularly the risk of depressing census response rates among noncitizen households. Ultimately, the Court found that the Secretary reasonably considered the value of obtaining more complete and accurate citizenship data through a citizenship question. The Supreme Court upheld Secretary Ross's decision to include a citizenship question on the census, citing historical precedent and the Secretary's discretion in obtaining citizenship data. The Court found that Secretary Ross reasonably concluded that relying solely on administrative records would not provide the complete and accurate data sought by the Department of Justice. This decision did not violate the Census Act, as Secretary Ross complied with the requirement to rely on administrative records to the maximum extent possible. The Supreme Court upheld Secretary Ross's decision to include a citizenship question on the census, stating that he complied with the requirement to rely on administrative records to the maximum extent possible. The Court also found that the Secretary adequately informed Congress of his intention to modify the list of subjects by adding the citizenship question. Additionally, the Court ruled that the Secretary's decision violated the APA because his stated reason for adding the question was not the real reason. The Supreme Court upheld Secretary Ross's decision to include a citizenship question on the census, stating that he complied with the requirement to rely on administrative records to the maximum extent possible. The Court also recognized that courts may review evidence outside the agency record to probe the justifications of an agency's decision in cases of bad faith or improper behavior. The Court conducted its own review of the evidence regarding Secretary Ross's reason for adding the citizenship question, noting that there was no indication of considering VRA enforcement at the time and that the Department of Commerce went to great lengths to elicit the request to add the question. The Court found that the decision to reinstate a citizenship question could not be adequately explained by the DOJ's request for improved citizenship data. The Secretary's decision violated the APA, requiring disclosure of the reason for the decision. The case was remanded back to the Department of Commerce for further review. Concurring and dissenting opinions were expressed by all Justices, with notable dissents from Justice Thomas. Justice Thomas, along with Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, dissented from the Court's decision regarding Secretary Ross's rationale for reinstating a citizenship question. Thomas criticized the majority for considering evidence outside the administrative record, arguing that judicial review should be based on the agency's stated reasons. He disagreed with the Court's assessment of bad faith and found no evidence to support it. Justice Thomas disagreed with the Court's decision, stating that the evidence did not show Secretary Ross's decision was pretextual. He criticized the Court for departing from traditional administrative law principles. Justice Breyer, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, dissented, arguing that Secretary Ross inaccurately justified including a citizenship question on the census. The dissent criticized Secretary Ross for inaccurately justifying the inclusion of a citizenship question on the census, citing experts within the Census Bureau who found it would lead to a less accurate count. Justice Breyer also argued that the addition of the question would not improve data quality for a large segment of the population. The Supreme Court's decision in Department of Commerce barred the Trump Administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census without disclosing the Secretary's actual reason for doing so. While the Trump Administration initially tried to address the legal error, they eventually confirmed that the citizenship question will not be included in the 2020 census questionnaire. However, the Court did not rule the addition of a citizenship question as \"substantively\" unlawful, leaving open the possibility for it to be added in future census questionnaires. The Supreme Court's decision in Department of Commerce allows for a citizenship question to be added to future census questionnaires if the Secretary of Commerce discloses the reasons for doing so. The decision also opens the door for challenges to agency decisions based on pretext. Some plaintiffs may see the Court's decision in Department of Commerce as a signal for more challenges to agency actions. Justice Thomas expressed concerns about potential pretext-based challenges, but the Court emphasized that such inquiries should be rare. This could deter litigants from raising such challenges. The Supreme Court ruled that claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering are not subject to federal court review, stating that it presents nonjusticiable political questions. This decision removes the issue from federal courts' purview and assigns disputes about partisan gerrymandering to state legislatures, with a check by the U.S. Congress. The Court determined that no discernible test exists for adjudicating partisan gerrymandering claims. The Supreme Court ruled that claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering are not subject to federal court review, suggesting Congress and state legislatures could regulate it. In 1962, the Court established criteria for justiciable redistricting challenges in Baker v. Carr. The Supreme Court has not nullified a map due to partisan gerrymandering, citing redistricting as a political process. Critics argue that extreme partisan gerrymandering undermines democratic principles by entrenching an unaccountable political class in power. The Supreme Court has not nullified a map due to partisan gerrymandering, citing redistricting as a political process. In earlier cases, the Court did not establish a clear standard for adjudicating claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. Last year, the Court considered similar claims but issued narrow rulings on procedural grounds. Rucho was the first opinion on partisan gerrymandering since Justice Kennedy left the Court. Three-judge federal district courts in North Carolina and Maryland invalidated partisan gerrymandering claims before the Supreme Court's consideration. In North Carolina and Maryland, federal district courts invalidated congressional districts as unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. The courts determined that a redistricting map violates the Equal Protection Clause when the map drawer's intent was to entrench a specific party's power, resulting in dilution of voting power for the disfavored party. The courts also found that partisan gerrymandering may violate provisions in Article I regarding the selection of representatives by \"the People.\" The Supreme Court ruled in the cases of Rucho and Maryland that federal courts lack jurisdiction to address claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. This decision overturned lower court rulings in North Carolina and Maryland, instructing them to dismiss the cases for lack of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court overturned lower court rulings in North Carolina and Maryland, instructing them to dismiss cases of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering for lack of jurisdiction. Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that the Framers did not intend for federal courts to intervene in such disputes, instead assigning them to state legislatures with oversight by Congress. Congress has previously addressed partisan gerrymandering through laws requiring single-member and compact districts. The Supreme Court acknowledged its unique role in policing claims of inequality of population among districts and racial gerrymandering, but found partisan gerrymandering cases more difficult to adjudicate due to the inevitable partisan influence in the redistricting process. The Supreme Court recognizes the challenge of determining how much partisan gerrymandering is acceptable. The Chief Justice's opinion questions the idea that courts should ensure proportional representation based on statewide votes, stating it is not a norm in our electoral system. The opportunity to control electoral boundaries through apportionment is a critical part of US politics. The Rucho Court noted that historically, single-party congressional delegations were common due to at-large elections. The Chief Justice argued that proportional representation is not a constitutional right, and determining party representation based on votes would involve courts in allocating political power, which they are not meant to do. The Supreme Court rejected the idea of courts allocating political power, stating that questions of fairness in redistricting are political, not legal. They found no manageable standard for identifying unconstitutional political gerrymandering, criticizing tests used in North Carolina and Maryland cases. The Chief Justice argued against proportional representation as a constitutional right, stating that courts should not be involved in allocating political power. In the context of racial gerrymandering claims, drawing district lines based on race is suspect, but in partisan gerrymandering, some political influence is allowed. The Court criticized the test requiring challengers to forecast election outcomes and disapproved of the First Amendment argument in the North Carolina and Maryland cases. The Court found that partisan gerrymandering violates the First Amendment's freedom of association. It concluded that any level of partisanship in districting infringes on First Amendment rights, making it difficult to determine when partisan activity goes too far. The Court also rejected using Article I of the Constitution as a basis to invalidate redistricting maps. Chief Justice Roberts acknowledged that partisan gerrymandering may seem unjust but stated that the Constitution does not provide a limit for addressing such claims. He emphasized that the Court cannot intervene in extreme partisan gerrymandering issues, leaving it to Congress and the states to find solutions. Roberts warned against expanding judicial power to address this issue, suggesting that state courts may have standards to handle excessive gerrymandering. The Court acknowledged the issue of partisan gerrymandering but stated that the Constitution does not provide a limit for addressing such claims. Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that the Court cannot intervene in extreme cases, leaving it to Congress and state courts to find solutions. State courts have standards to address excessive gerrymandering, with successful results. Justice Kagan's dissent argued for establishing a standard for adjudicating unconstitutional gerrymandering, warning of potential damage to the government system. The dissent in response to the Court's suggestion that Congress and states can address partisan gerrymandering argued that legislative reform is unlikely due to those in power benefiting from it. They proposed challenging extreme gerrymandering through the federal judiciary. The ruling in Rucho limits federal courts' jurisdiction on unconstitutional gerrymandering, suggesting that Congress and states have the power to address it. Several bills have been proposed to tackle partisan gerrymandering. Several bills introduced in the 116th Congress aim to address partisan gerrymandering, including H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2019, which would establish nonpartisan redistricting commissions in each state. H.R. 44, the Coretta Scott King Mid-Decade Redistricting Prohibition Act of 2019, would limit states to one congressional redistricting per decade unless ordered by a court to comply with the Constitution or Voting Rights Act. H.R. 131 is also mentioned in the context. H.R. 131, the Redistricting Transparency Act of 2019, aims to reduce partisan influence in redistricting by requiring public oversight and participation. The Supreme Court's ruling in Rucho does not prevent state courts from addressing claims of partisan gerrymandering under state constitutional provisions, as seen in a 2015 case in Florida. The Supreme Court's ruling in Rucho allows state courts to address claims of partisan gerrymandering under state constitutional provisions. State remedies, along with potential congressional action, will likely be key in regulating partisan influence in redistricting. In American Legion v. American Humanist Association, the Court upheld the Bladensburg Peace Cross as not violating the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, limiting the applicability of Lemon v. Kurtzman. The Court's divided opinions raised significant questions. The Supreme Court's ruling in American Legion v. American Humanist Association raised significant questions regarding the Establishment Clause. The Court did not reach a majority opinion on the test to apply in future Establishment Clause claims, leaving the possibility that the Lemon test may still govern certain challenges. The Supreme Court has condensed its prior Establishment Clause decisions into a three-part test, known as the Lemon test. This test requires government action to have a secular purpose, not advance or inhibit religion, and avoid excessive entanglement with religion. However, the Court has also used variations of the Lemon test, such as the \"endorsement\" test, to analyze Establishment Clause challenges. Justice Thomas has criticized the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence as being in disarray. Justice Thomas criticized the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence as being in disarray and argued for a single consistent approach. The Court's divergent approaches were evident in cases involving government-sponsored displays with religious symbols. In McCreary County v. ACLU, the Lemon test was applied to find a violation, while in Van Orden v. Perry, a plurality suggested evaluating displays based on the nation's history. Justice Breyer concurred in upholding a Ten Commandments display in the latter case. Justice Breyer provided the deciding vote in Van Orden to uphold a Ten Commandments display at the Texas State Capitol. He believed the monument satisfied formal Establishment Clause tests and emphasized its unchallenged history for 40 years. Breyer argued that altering or removing the monument would be divisive and show hostility towards religion, which goes against Establishment Clause traditions. In a separate case, the plaintiffs in American Legion claimed Maryland violated the Establishment Clause with the Bladensburg Peace Cross, a 32-foot Latin cross on a war memorial. The Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit's decision regarding the Peace Cross, a 32-foot Latin cross on a war memorial honoring soldiers who died in World War I. Justice Alito wrote the opinion for the American Legion Court, citing factors highlighted by Justice Breyer's concurring opinion in Van Orden. The Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit's decision regarding the Peace Cross, a 32-foot Latin cross on a war memorial honoring soldiers who died in World War I. Justice Alito emphasized the historical importance of the monument and its added secular meaning in World War I memorials. The Court concluded that requiring the state to remove or deface the Peace Cross would not be neutral with respect to religion and would not promote respect and tolerance as outlined in the First Amendment. The Supreme Court overturned the Fourth Circuit's decision on the Peace Cross, a 32-foot Latin cross war memorial. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch criticized the Lemon test, advocating for a historical approach to Establishment Clause challenges. Lemon will no longer be used to assess the constitutionality of longstanding religious monuments, symbols, and practices. Justice Ginsburg dissented, highlighting the cross's religious significance as a marker for Christian soldiers' graves. Justice Ginsburg dissented on the Peace Cross case, arguing that the cross symbolizes sectarian beliefs and conveys a message of endorsement for Christianity. She believed that maintaining the monument elevated Christianity over other faiths and nonreligion, raising questions about future interpretations of the Establishment Clause. The American Legion case reevaluated the Establishment Clause, suggesting a shift towards a more lenient view on government sponsorship of religious displays. Justices Breyer and Kavanaugh proposed additional factors beyond historical practice in evaluating challenges. The ambiguity remains on what qualifies as a longstanding symbol or practice under the new test. The Supreme Court's decision in Gundy v. United States upheld Congress's delegated authority to apply registration requirements to offenders convicted prior to SORNA's enactment. Justice Kagan concluded that the delegation was constitutional and \"distinctively small-bore.\" Justice Gorsuch's dissent, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, highlighted a split on the Court's approach in reviewing authority Congress delegates. Justice Alito concurred in the judgment only, indicating willingness to rethink the nondelegation doctrine. The Court's revival of the doctrine likely depends on Justice Kavanaugh's views. The nondelegation doctrine in the Constitution prevents Congress from delegating legislative powers to other entities to maintain separation of powers. Congress can delegate certain powers with an \"intelligible principle\" to guide discretion. Justice Gorsuch's dissent in Gundy case highlighted a split on Court's approach to delegated authority. Justice Alito indicated willingness to rethink the nondelegation doctrine, with the Court's revival potentially hinging on Justice Kavanaugh's views. In the Gundy case, the Supreme Court considered the application of registration requirements under SORNA to pre-act offenders. SORNA, enacted in 2006, aims to protect the public from sex offenders by establishing a national registration system. The Court has relied on the nondelegation doctrine, requiring Congress to provide an \"intelligible principle\" to guide delegated authority. SORNA requires sex offenders to register in each state where they reside, work, or study. The Attorney General can specify registration rules for pre-SORNA offenders. In the Gundy case, the Court decided that SORNA's requirements apply to all sex offenders, including those convicted before the law's enactment. In the Gundy case, petitioner Herman Gundy was convicted of a sex offense in Maryland and later arrested in New York for failing to register as a sex offender under SORNA. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, rejecting Gundy's argument that Congress unconstitutionally delegated legislative powers to the Attorney General. In the Gundy case, the Supreme Court upheld Congress's delegation of legislative powers to the Attorney General to apply SORNA's registration requirements to pre-SORNA offenders. The Court found that as long as Congress provides a clear general policy and boundaries for the delegation, broad delegations like this are permissible under the nondelegation doctrine. In the Gundy case, the Supreme Court upheld Congress's delegation of legislative powers to the Attorney General to apply SORNA's registration requirements to pre-SORNA offenders. Justice Gorsuch dissented, arguing that the delegation gave the Attorney General too much discretion, violating separation-of-powers principles. Justice Gorsuch criticized the delegation of legislative powers to the executive branch in the Gundy case, arguing that it bypasses the bicameral legislative process and weakens minority interests and political accountability. He called for a more robust review of congressional delegations and outlined guiding principles for permissible delegation. Justice Gorsuch criticized the delegation of legislative powers to the executive branch in the Gundy case, arguing that it bypasses the bicameral legislative process and weakens minority interests and political accountability. He concluded that SORNA's delegation was unconstitutional due to lack of a single policy decision and excessive power given to the Attorney General. The dissent disagreed with the comparison to other upheld delegations, stating that SORNA's delegation is unique and not conditional. Justice Gorsuch criticized the delegation of legislative powers to the executive branch in the Gundy case, arguing that it bypasses the bicameral legislative process and weakens minority interests and political accountability. He concluded that SORNA's delegation was unconstitutional due to lack of a single policy decision and excessive power given to the Attorney General. Justice Alito concurred in the judgment of the Court in affirming the petitioner's conviction. The divided opinions in Gundy signal a potential shift in the Court's approach in nondelegation challenges and potential resurrection of the nondelegation doctrine. Justice Kavanaugh may be the critical vote to break the tie in a future case considering a revitalization of the nondelegation principle. A more restrictive nondelegation standard could invite new challenges in determining when Congress crosses the nondelegation line. A more restrictive nondelegation standard could lead to constitutional challenges to statutory provisions delegating broad authority to the executive branch. Justice Kagan warned that striking down SORNA's delegation could render many other delegations unconstitutional, while Justice Gorsuch argued that Congress can authorize the executive branch to fill in details. The Court may provide guidance on nondelegation challenges in a future case. The current nondelegation doctrine remains \"moribund\" while the Court may offer guidance on how precise Congress must be in its delegation of authority."
