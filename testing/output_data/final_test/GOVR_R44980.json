The request also excludes support for the Federal Energy Efficiency Fund/AFFECT subprogram. The FY2018 request for building technologies focuses on building energy R&D priorities, U.S.-China Clean Energy Research Center support, and early-stage R&D for commercial and residential buildings integration. Energy conservation standard compliance activities are limited to maintain compliance with statute, and late-stage R&D is not supported. The FY2018 budget request of $26 million eliminates funding for various technology application R&D projects, including Energy Star initiatives like Home Performance with Energy Star. Additionally, funding for Weatherization and Intergovernmental Programs is not included in the Administration's budget. The House Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2018 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill with a manager's amendment on July 12, 2017. The bill would provide funding for EERE of $1.1 billion, which is $1.0 billion below FY2017 and $449 million above the Administration request. H.R. 3266 was incorporated into H.R. 3219, which was passed by the House on July 27, 2017. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2018 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, S. 1609, on July 20, 2017, which would provide $1.9 billion for EERE. S. 1609 would provide $1.9 billion for EERE, $153 million below FY2017 levels and $1.3 billion above the Administration request. Concerns in the 115th Congress include EERE appropriations for FY2018 and which activities EERE should support. Congress may need to assess if EERE goals can be achieved with proposed funding cuts or limit federal R&D activities. The funding levels for specific offices and programs in H.R. 3219 and S. 1609 are based on reports accompanying the bills. H.R. 3219 would provide $1.086 billion for EERE, $18.4 million less than the committee-reported bill. It is uncertain how this reduction would be implemented. S. 1609 would provide $1.9 billion for EERE, $153 million below FY2017 levels and $1.3 billion above the Administration request. Congress is concerned about EERE appropriations for FY2018 and the activities it should support. The funding for EERE in H.R. 3219 and S. 1609 focuses on early-stage R&D, with a decrease of nearly 70% for EERE programs. Both bills address the Administration's request differently, with H.R. 3219 reflecting a shift towards early-stage research and development activities, while S. 1609 emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. Both bills propose appropriations above the Administration's request for FY2018. H.R. 3219 and S. 1609 propose appropriations above the Administration's request for sustainable transportation and renewable energy in FY2018. H.R. 3219 would allocate $268 million for sustainable transportation and nearly $190 million for renewable energy, while S. 1609 would allocate $553 million for sustainable transportation and nearly $390 million for renewable energy. Both bills support programs within vehicle technologies that the Administration's request would terminate, such as SuperTruck II and the Clean Cities program. Both H.R. 3219 and S. 1609 propose higher appropriations for sustainable transportation and renewable energy in FY2018. H.R. 3219 would allocate $268 million for sustainable transportation and nearly $190 million for renewable energy, while S. 1609 would allocate $553 million for sustainable transportation and nearly $390 million for renewable energy. Both bills support research in thin-film photovoltaics for solar energy and efforts to lower market barriers for distributed wind in rural areas. Additionally, S. 1609 includes support for solar workforce development training for veterans and continued research in wind energy projects. H.R. 3219 and S. 1609 propose higher appropriations for renewable energy in FY2018. H.R. 3219 would allocate $481 million, while S. 1609 would allocate $737 million. Both bills support research and development in marine energy, pumped storage hydropower, geothermal resources, and advanced manufacturing. The House bill and S. 1609 propose different funding allocations for renewable energy in FY2018. The House bill supports phasing out certain operations while continuing early stage R&D efforts through competitive awards. In contrast, S. 1609 provides funding for various energy innovation hubs and institutes, as well as other related activities. H.R. 3219 and S. 1609 support research, development, and market transformation of natural gas use in residential applications and commercial buildings. S. 1609 also encourages cost-effective integration techniques for deep retrofits and funding for emerging technologies like transactive controls, smart grid systems, solid-state lighting, and energy efficiency for natural gas applications. The Administration's budget for FY2018 would terminate the Weatherization and Intergovernmental Programs, which provide funding for energy efficiency efforts for natural gas applications. However, both H.R. 3219 and S. 1609 would continue to support the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and State Energy Program (SEP) to promote energy efficiency and reduce energy demand. The House bill and Senate committee bill would fund the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) at $225 million and $212 million respectively, and the State Energy Program (SEP) at $50 million in both cases."
