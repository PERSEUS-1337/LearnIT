    "content": "Initiatives to reform Senate Rule XXII were biennial rituals from 1953 to 1975, driven by frustration over filibusters blocking legislation like civil rights measures. Changes in 1975, 1979, and 1986 altered cloture rules, but interest in amending Rule XXII resurfaced in the 2000s. Reform-minded Senators in the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses tried unsuccessfully to adopt rules by majority vote on \"opening day\". Senators in the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses attempted to adopt Senate rules by majority vote on \"opening day\" without needing a supermajority vote. Rule XXII allows for ending prolonged debate on rule amendments with a two-thirds vote. Reform Senators argue that the start of a new Congress is a special time to change procedures by majority vote, citing the U.S. Constitution. The reformers in the Senate argue that the two-thirds supermajority vote required to invoke cloture on amendments to the chamber's rules hinders the Senate from exercising its constitutional right to determine its own rules. Opponents reject this argument, stating that the Senate is a continuing body with continuing rules that can be amended by a simple majority vote. The argument is that a Senate majority can always amend the chamber's rules during a Congress as long as existing rules are followed. Reformers believe the Constitution supersedes Senate rules and that the two-thirds requirement in Rule XXII infringes on the majority's right to amend rules. They cite a 1957 opinion by Vice President Nixon to support their argument. The Chair believes denying the Senate majority the right to adopt rules in a new Congress is unconstitutional. Until the Senate expresses otherwise, previous rules remain in effect, except those that deny the Senate's power to make its own rules. Lawmakers are considering amending Senate rules with majority support at the start of a new Congress. At the start of a new Congress, proponents and opponents of altering Senate rules can consider various methods, including resolutions referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration, unanimous consent, statutory changes, and establishment of standing orders. The \"nuclear option\" is a parliamentary maneuver that can be applied during a congressional session to prevent filibusters of specific measures or matters, potentially triggering a parliamentary meltdown. This option involves creating a new Senate precedent to limit debate length and obstructive tactics by Senators. Precedents in the Senate are established through rulings by the Chair, which can be appealed. If no appeal is made, the ruling stands as a precedent. If there is an appeal and the Chair is not supported by a majority vote, the decision is overruled, creating a new precedent for future Senate procedures. The \"nuclear option\" involves potentially violating established procedural standards to establish new precedential interpretations of the rules. Attempts to amend Rule XXII in the Senate involve conflicts between the right to debate and the right to decide, framed as minority protection versus majority rule. Finding a balance is challenging, especially with controversial issues, as there are no set rules for debate length and thoroughness. Former GOP Senator Judd Gregg emphasized the importance of precedent in parliamentary processes. The Senate faces challenges in amending rules due to the need for extensive debate on complex issues like cybersecurity and privacy. Extended debate, even without a formal filibuster, can delay action on important matters. It is difficult to discern the motives behind prolonged debate by Senators, whether to block \"bad\" ideas, raise awareness on national issues, or push for modifications in legislation. The difficulty in defining a filibuster was highlighted by former Senator Robert C. Byrd. Key concerns for Senators considering the constitutional option include support from the presiding officer, the majority leader, mobilizing a united majority, strategic procedural moves, the length of \"opening day,\" and the continuing body doctrine. In 1957, 1959, and 1961, Senate President Nixon provided advisory opinions that supported Senate reformers by stating that Senate rules restricting the majority's right to end debate were not applicable at the start of a new Congress. Nixon's opinions, although not binding, encouraged and inspired reform Senators for their uphill battle. Vice President Lyndon Johnson submitted a question to the Senate regarding cloture reform, assisting anti-reformers in defeating Anderson forces. Vice Presidents Humphrey and Rockefeller made rulings favoring reformers in 1969. During a strategic pre-planning session, Vice President Humphrey and reformers attempted to change Rule XXII by introducing a resolution to reduce the number of Senators required to invoke cloture. Despite their efforts, the motion to proceed to the reform resolution was met with opposition, leading to a vote of 51 ayes to invoke cloture and 47 nays. During a vote of 51 ayes to invoke cloture, an anti-reform opponent appealed the ruling of the Vice President on the ground that cloture under Rule XXII requires two-thirds of Senators present and voting. The Vice President's ruling was overturned by the Senate with a vote of 45 yeas to 53 nays, establishing a new precedent allowing a majority to amend Senate rules at the start of a new Congress. During the opening of the new 94th Congress, Majority Whip Robert Byrd referenced the 1969 effort to amend Rule XXII by majority vote. He emphasized that if a majority of Senators are determined to invoke cloture and have the support of the leadership, they can do so with a friendly presiding officer. Byrd highlighted a past ruling where 51 Senators voting to invoke cloture could do so, indicating the possibility of majority cloture in the future. During the opening of the new 94th Congress, Majority Whip Robert Byrd referenced the 1969 effort to amend Rule XXII by majority vote. He highlighted the possibility of majority cloture in the future, emphasizing the importance of leadership support. Majority leaders from both parties have historically played a crucial role in scheduling Senate business and influencing outcomes on rule reforms. During the opening of the new 94th Congress, Majority Whip Robert Byrd mentioned the 1969 attempt to amend Rule XXII by majority vote, stressing the need for leadership backing. Majority leaders have historically been pivotal in setting Senate agendas and shaping rule reform outcomes. In the current Congress, Majority Leader Mansfield allowed for two days of debate on Anderson's proposal for changes to Rule XXII, prioritizing extended debate over other legislative matters. Mansfield supported amendments to the rule but strongly opposed majority cloture, ensuring that reformers were not bound by rules from the previous Congress. He extended the \"opening day\" over several days and adjourned at times to expedite action on reform resolutions. Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson brokered major changes to Rule XXII in 1959, allowing cloture to be invoked by two-thirds of those voting and on motions to consider rule changes. He convinced opponents of filibuster reform to support these changes to prevent the Senate from being recessed for reform resolutions. The fate of filibuster reform proposals depends on the mobilization of a cohesive majority willing to battle for their procedural aims. Unity is crucial to amending Senate rules by majority vote on \"opening day,\" but maintaining unity can be challenging due to cross-pressures on debate limitations. Some Senators, even in the majority, want to preserve the filibuster. Some Senators in the majority want to preserve the filibuster to enhance their personal power. Opponents of major changes to Senate Rule XXII are likely to engage in dilatory practices to block reformers' plans, such as appealing rulings or objecting to unanimous consent requests. Protracted floor proceedings may require constant presence of reform Senators to defend their goals. Rulings in favor of reform Senators could be affirmed by tabling opponents' appeals. Outside groups and allies may be enlisted to advance or block filibuster reforms in today's hyper-partisan environment. To achieve their aims of advancing or blocking filibuster reforms, Senators must consider various factors such as the presiding officer's stance on cloture reform, the floor manager for rule amendments, the Senate Parliamentarian's sentiment, and the Vice President's alignment with the majority party. The absence or presence of the Vice President and the President pro tempore's views are also crucial in the reform debate. The President pro tempore's view on the reform matter is crucial. Senator George McGovern's 1967 reform approach involved a filibustered resolution and a motion to close debate by majority vote. Senator McGovern's motion to table a point of order was raised against his reform resolution. The Senate voted to sustain the point of order, with additional procedural developments, including an unsuccessful attempt by Majority Leader Mansfield to conclude debate. In 1971, GOP Senator Jacob Javits appealed a ruling on the Church-Pearson motion for filibuster reform, arguing for a quicker resolution without further debate. The Chair did not act on the \"nuclear\" suggestion to end debate on the reform resolution without further debate. Senators Mondale and Pearson offered compound motions to expedite the vote on the reform resolution, but faced parliamentary maneuvers and points of order. The Senate adopted changes to Rule XXII, allowing a majority to end debate on presidential nominees. Majority Leader Reid used a \"nuclear\" approach to overcome procedural obstacles and push through reforms. This could serve as a roadmap for Senators supporting changes to Senate procedure. Senator Reid used the nuclear option to change Senate procedure, sparked by the Senate's refusal to confirm three judicial nominees. After failing to win the required 60 votes to end debate, Reid would enter a motion to reconsider within two session days. Senator Reid used the nuclear option to establish a precedent in the Senate by entering a motion to reconsider the failed cloture vote on the nomination of Patricia Millet. Despite the motion being adopted, it did not receive the necessary 60 votes. The motion to reconsider the failed cloture vote on the nomination of Patricia Millet was adopted by a vote of 57 yeas to 43 nays, falling short of the required 60 votes. Senator Reid raised a point of order that a majority vote is sufficient for cloture on all nominations except for Supreme Court nominees. The President pro tempore overruled Reid's point of order, leading to an appeal that was voted on and ultimately overturned, establishing a new majority cloture precedent. The Chair's ruling on the new majority cloture precedent for most presidential nominees was upheld by a vote of 52 yeas to 48 nays. Senator McConnell appealed the ruling, but the appeal was unsuccessful. Cloture was invoked on the Millett nomination with 55 yeas to 43 nays, establishing the new majority threshold for cloture. Cloture was invoked with 55 yeas to 43 nays, establishing a new majority threshold. Formal rules and precedents could be invoked when Senators try to call up a reform resolution on \"opening day.\" Seven observations about procedural rules and practices during the first day period are uncertain due to potential set aside by unanimous consent. Rule V requires a Senator offering an amendment to provide one day's notice. A Member introducing a reform resolution on opening day typically requests unanimous consent for its immediate consideration. The reform resolution introduced on opening day may face objections due to Rule V's notice requirement. Without unanimous consent, it would be placed in a special section of the Senate's Calendar of Business for consideration on the next legislative day. If not addressed, the resolution would be referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration. The Senate rules distinguish between a \"calendar day\" and a \"legislative day.\" A legislative day starts when the Senate convenes after an adjournment and ends when it next adjourns. The majority could prevent a reform resolution from being considered by recessing instead of adjourning. A reform resolution meeting the requirements would be presented to the Senate. The reform resolution meeting the \"written notice\" and \"legislative day\" requirements would be presented to the Senate at the start of a new legislative day. The first two hours, known as the \"morning hour,\" are for routine business like bill introductions. If not completed during this time, the resolution would go back to the Calendar of Business unless the Senate agrees to continue debate. Proposed amendments to Rule XXII can lead to complex procedural tactics by both sides. Senators can use procedural tactics to amend Rule XXII, with the ability to change rules quickly. Reformers seek fair opportunities for change, while opponents understand the potential for delays. The length of reform proceedings varies, lasting days, weeks, or even months. Reformers aim to change Senate rules quickly by amending Rule XXII, with \"opening day\" proceedings lasting days, weeks, or months. Opponents criticize the length of the process and remind Senators that rules can be changed at any time during a legislative session. The reformers view \"opening day\" as their best chance to avoid supermajority hurdles and establish the principle that each new Congress can adopt its own rules by majority vote. The Senate can adopt its own rules by majority vote, not bound by entrenched rules like Rule XXII. The Senate is a continuous body with carryover Members, impeachments, treaties, and resolutions from one Congress to the next. Senate Rule V and tradition dictate that rules continue unless changed. Reform Senators argue for quick rule changes on \"opening day\" to avoid supermajority hurdles. Reform Senators argue that Senate rules can be changed by majority vote at the start of a new Congress, despite the Senate being a discontinuous institution. Opponents fear granting too much power to a transient majority. This debate revolves around which parliamentary manual should govern Senate procedures. Supporters of Senate rule change argue that the Senate should follow existing rules with revisions to promote majority rule. Reformers believe the Senate is capable of adopting new rules like the House does at the start of each new Congress. GOP Senator Strom Thurmond identified nine possible parliamentary manuals for Senate procedures. The Senate faces challenges in amending and adopting rules, with some Senators advocating for quicker processes like the House. The Senate's rules give significant procedural powers to each Senator, often leading to delays in legislative action. The Senate's advantage lies in its ability to delay or obstruct legislative action, serving as a check on hastily conceived measures. It promotes deliberation, protects minorities from majorities, and can use filibusters to extract information. The daily Senate life involves filibusters, extended debates, and cloture votes, with each Senator having significant procedural powers. The Senate's ability to delay or obstruct legislative action is a key advantage, allowing Senators to use filibusters and cloture votes to protect minorities and promote deliberation. Despite the value of unlimited debate, the Senate has historically revised its rules, such as the filibuster and Rule XXII, to adapt to changing circumstances. The Senate's use of cloture to limit debate has evolved over time, with cloture being successful only a few times in earlier years. Today, filibusters and cloture votes are common, making the Senate a 60-vote institution for approving measures. Rule XXII is the focus of debate for limiting discussion in the Senate, with discussions on protecting minority rights and the Senate's uniqueness compared to the other body. Amendments to Rule XXII are considered based on who is advantaged or disadvantaged. Proposed amendments to Rule XXII are driven by a determined majority frustrated by the 60-vote cloture hurdle. Leaders craft strategies to persuade colleagues that sacrificing personal power will enhance the Senate's governance. Public relations and messaging strategies are crucial to explain the necessity of change and counter criticisms. Other factors like the election of change-oriented lawmakers or crises also play a role in Senate's constant evolution. The Senate constantly undergoes change in response to events, issues, and crises. New Members bring additional energy and ideas, leading to procedural changes. Reform initiatives aim to balance preserving the Senate's functions and traditions with enhancing policymaking performance and oversight capacity. Senator Robert Byrd emphasized the Senate's role as an independent source of wisdom and judgment. The Senate has evolved to require 60 votes for approval of many measures, reflecting a shift from its historical use of the filibuster. Change may occur with support from Senators and constituents. Determination and hard work are essential for negotiating differences in the nation. Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen highlighted the challenge of harmonizing the diverse personalities in the U.S. Senate, emphasizing the importance of negotiation and reconciliation in resolving disagreements between Senators and political parties."
