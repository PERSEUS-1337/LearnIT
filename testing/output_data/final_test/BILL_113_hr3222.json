The Act \"Flushing Remonstrance Study Act\" acknowledges Dutch involvement in North America, the transformation of New Netherland into a settlement colony, assimilation of Dutch and English settlers in Queens County, conflicts over religious tolerance, and the banning of Quakers in Flushing. The government banned all religions outside the Dutch Reformed Church. Residents signed the Flushing Remonstrance in protest, leading to arrests. John Bowne allowed Quakers to hold services, was fined and banished, but later exonerated. The colony fell to British control in 1664. The Flushing Remonstrance is now seen as a symbol of religious liberty. The Flushing Remonstrance, a protest against religious persecution, is seen as a precursor to the First Amendment. In 1957, a postage stamp commemorated its 300th anniversary. Queens, once Dutch, remains diverse with over 2.2 million people from 100 nations.
