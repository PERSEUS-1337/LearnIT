    "content": "Construction of new nuclear power plants in the United States was almost unimaginable during the 1980s and 1990s. No reactor has been ordered in the United States since 1978, and no U.S. reactor has been completed since 1996. However, in 2003, three utilities submitted applications to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for early approval of potential reactor sites, and in 2004, DOE announced cost-sharing agreements with two industry consortia to apply for NRC licenses to construct and operate new reactors. The renewed interest in nuclear power has led to a total of 34 new nuclear units being planned by utilities and companies. This interest is driven by higher natural gas prices, improved operation of existing reactors, and uncertainty about future coal emission restrictions. Nuclear power's stable costs and low emissions, combined with tax credits and incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005, make it an attractive option for new electric generation capacity. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) and amendments to the Atomic Energy Act aim to reduce licensing delays for new nuclear plant applications. Utilities are hesitant to commit to building new reactors due to uncertainties in construction costs, nuclear waste disposal progress, and public opposition. Addressing these issues is crucial for obtaining financing for new multibillion-dollar nuclear power plants. Federal energy policy will play a key role in determining the expansion of the U.S. nuclear power industry. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 aims to reduce licensing delays for new nuclear plant applications. Utilities are hesitant to commit to building new reactors due to uncertainties in construction costs, nuclear waste disposal progress, and public opposition. Federal subsidies for new reactors are justified to diversify the nation's energy supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The tax credit for nuclear power provided by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 would offset the higher cost of electricity from new nuclear power plants compared to coal- and natural gas-fired plants. The new nuclear tax credit offsets cost disadvantage for new nuclear plants, limited to 6,000 megawatts capacity. Greenhouse gas legislation could impact nuclear power economics. Anticipation of 1,000 reactors by 2000 did not materialize in the 1970s. Despite initial expectations of 1,000 reactors by 2000, nuclear power growth slowed in the 1970s with over 120 reactor orders cancelled. Currently, 103 licensed power reactors operate in the US, generating more electricity than oil, natural gas, and hydro plants, second only to coal. Nuclear plants generate over half the electricity in six states, with production exceeding the nation's entire electrical output in the early 1960s. Since 2006, U.S. nuclear electricity generation has grown by over 20%, despite no new reactors starting up since 1996. Reactors operated at 89.8% capacity in 2006, up from around 75% in the mid-1990s and 65% in the mid-1980s. Modifications and power uprates have contributed to the growth, with over 60 requests approved since 1996, adding about 2,500 megawatts of generating capacity. The uprates added 2,500 megawatts of generating capacity, offsetting the closure of poorly performing reactors. Operating costs for nuclear power plants decreased significantly, improving the outlook for existing plants. Since 2000, 48 commercial reactors have received 20-year license extensions from NRC, allowing up to 60 years of operation. License extensions for seven more reactors are under review, with more anticipated. The trend is driven by favorable rate treatment of nuclear plants' costs in deregulated states and industry consolidation. Notable sales include the Millstone plant in Connecticut to Dominion Energy for $1.28 billion in 2001. The merger of PECO Energy and Unicom in 2000 created Exelon Corporation, consolidating 17 reactors under one entity. While no new U.S. nuclear plants have opened in the past decade, global construction continues, especially in Asia. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides incentives for new reactor construction, including tax credits and loan guarantees. The NRC streamlined the licensing process for new nuclear power facilities in 1989, introducing the Early Site Permit Program and Standard Design Certification to reduce delays and costs. The NRC introduced the Standard Design Certification and Combined Construction and Operating License (COL) to streamline the licensing process for new nuclear power facilities, allowing vendors to get their designs approved and plants to operate more efficiently. The NRC introduced reforms to streamline the licensing process for new nuclear power facilities, aiming to provide regulatory certainty before major financial investments. The process includes a three-step decision-making process and utility level project analysis, taking 2-4 years. The utility must address safety, environmental, and emergency planning issues in the pre-application process for a nuclear power facility. If the site is deemed suitable and economically viable, the utility submits information to the NRC to obtain a COL, including financial data and reactor design details. The utility must provide reactor design details and ITAAC for NRC approval to operate the plant. The NRC reviews the application, holds hearings, and grants the COL, which takes about three and a half years. The utility then decides whether to begin building the power plant, with construction estimated to take 5-7 years. After construction, the NRC verifies compliance with ITAAC before allowing the facility to operate. The streamlined licensing process for new nuclear plants aims to reduce regulatory uncertainty and make financing more feasible, especially for states with restructured electricity markets. Project financing, where the project itself is used as collateral for loans, is closely scrutinized by Wall Street for risk assessment. The nuclear industry and the NRC are hopeful that this new process will streamline the licensing process. The new licensing process for nuclear plants aims to improve risk profiles and expedite construction. Uncertainties exist, including environmental impact assessments and public input, which may prolong the 10-15 year timeline for approvals. The new licensing process for nuclear plants aims to improve risk profiles and expedite construction. Public input is likely to be vigorous, and states can intervene to delay nuclear power projects. Judicial intervention is not uncommon when opposition groups challenge regulatory decisions to prevent construction and operation. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program was initiated by the DOE in 2002 to facilitate the licensing process for new nuclear power plants. Industry applicants could receive financial assistance for licensing costs. While the original goal of deploying a reactor by 2010 will not be met, there is significant industry interest. Three utilities applied for early site permits in 2003, with one permit approved in Illinois. Industry consortia will continue the effort. The DOE continues to provide assistance to industry consortia for new nuclear power plants, with a total planned funding of about $550 million. Two consortia, led by Dominion Resources and NuStart Energy Development, are receiving assistance for COLs and first-of-a-kind engineering. Dominion is preparing for an advanced General Electric reactor at their North Anna plant in Virginia, while NuStart includes Exelon in their consortium. NuStart Energy Development, a consortium including Exelon, announced plans to seek a COL for a Westinghouse design at TVA's Bellefonte plant in Alabama and a General Electric design at the Grand Gulf plant in Mississippi. The Energy Policy Act offers a 1.8 cents/kwh tax credit for new nuclear capacity, up to $125 million annually per 1,000 megawatts, to be operational before January 1, 2021. This credit is expected to enhance the economic viability of proposed nuclear power plants. The Energy Policy Act provides a tax credit for new nuclear capacity, with the allocation of the credit among eligible reactors determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of Energy. The IRS issued guidance stating that the credit would be given to reactors meeting specific criteria, with a cap of 6,000 megawatts to be allocated proportionally among eligible plants if applications exceed this limit. The IRS guidance for the tax credit on new nuclear capacity sets a deadline for eligibility by December 31, 2008, with a cap of 6,000 megawatts to be allocated among eligible plants. The incentive for nuclear plant applicants to file with the NRC by the end of 2008 could impact the credit's effectiveness if most reactors become eligible. Only four or five reactors, ranging from 1,200-1,500 megawatts, could be covered within the 6,000-megawatt limit for tax credits. Different reactor designs are being considered, with only one or two units of each design likely to be constructed. Concerns over regulatory delays led to the inclusion of an insurance system in EPACT called \"Standby Support\" to cover costs incurred due to licensing delays for new reactors. The Standby Support program, established by DOE, provides reimbursement for costs incurred due to licensing delays for new reactors. The program covers up to $500 million for the first two reactors meeting specific criteria, with subsequent reactors eligible for 50% reimbursement of up to $250 million. Criteria include obtaining a COL, starting construction, and meeting inspection and acceptance criteria. Coverage is not provided for certain delays, such as NRC's failure to follow its own rules or pre-operational hearings. The Standby Support program covers delays caused by licensing-related litigation in state, federal, or tribal courts, even if a court rules against a nuclear plant sponsor. It aims to reduce uncertainty in the COL licensing process for new reactors, providing coverage for the first two reactors with the most uncertainty. Subsequent reactors may receive 50% reimbursement of up to $250 million. The federal government provides loan guarantees for new nuclear power plants to reduce financing costs and attract funding. If a borrower defaults, the Department of Energy can take over the project or reach an agreement with the borrower. This support aims to address the financial risks associated with new commercial reactors. The federal government provides loan guarantees for new nuclear power plants to reduce financing costs and attract funding. Loan guarantees are crucial for nuclear projects, especially for deregulated generating companies. The initial solicitation for loan guarantees under EPACT is limited to $2 billion and does not include nuclear technology. The DOE issued guidelines for initial loan guarantee proposals, with a deadline extended to December 31, 2006. EPACT requires covering subsidy costs before granting loan guarantees. Borrowers must pay the estimated subsidy cost, approved by OMB to cover default and subsidy costs. The DOE loan guarantee program requires borrowers to cover anticipated default and subsidy costs. The guidelines prefer not more than 80% of project debt to be covered by loan guarantees, potentially limiting financing for nuclear power plants. To assess the competitiveness of new nuclear plants, future electricity market prices need to be estimated. The cost of the least expensive newly constructed generating plant will set the marginal cost of bringing on new electric capacity in the long run. CRS created an example with four hypothetical powerplants to evaluate nuclear power's competitive position. Numerous assumptions about future economic, financial, and policy conditions are necessary for this assessment. The benchmark year for constructing a new power plant is set at 2015. The analysis identifies major assumptions for constructing a new power plant based on 2015 as the benchmark year. Assumptions are from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and reflect costs and technical performance. The real capital charge rate is from the Environmental Protection Agency's Integrated Planning Model (IPM). Calculations were done by CRS in constant 2004 dollars. Assumptions for coal and uranium costs reflect price trends projected by EIA. A sensitivity analysis on natural gas generating costs was performed due to historical price volatility. Based on the analysis, new coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants would be equally competitive for construction by 2015, with costs estimated to be very close. Advanced coal technology is expected to be competitive with both pulverized coal combustion and natural gas combined-cycle technology by that time. Without the production tax credit from the 2005 Energy Policy Act, nuclear facilities are not competitive with coal-fired or natural gas-fired facilities. The break-even point for nuclear power capital costs versus coal-fired facilities initiated in 2015 is estimated to be around $1,370 per kilowatt of capacity, which is lower than projected costs. It is unlikely that a new nuclear power plant would be constructed in the United States under current conditions, unless there is a sustained increase in natural gas prices and the implementation of a substantial greenhouse gas reduction program. The production tax credit from the 2005 Energy Policy Act makes nuclear power competitive with natural gas and coal-fired facilities. This advantage allows for a decision on constructing a nuclear power station to move beyond initial economic considerations. The country's increasing reliance on natural gas for electricity generation has raised concerns about overdependence. Currently, 22% of electric generating capacity is natural gas-fired, up from 7% two decades ago. Questions arise about the future of natural gas prices and the potential for nuclear power as an alternative. Recent events have shown the potential for increased natural gas prices, but power plants have long lifetimes and can be maintained indefinitely. In the competitive environment for new power plant construction, the financial investment is a key consideration. In the competitive environment for new power plant construction, the financial investment lifetime may be around 20 years due to uncertainty in the electricity market. Natural gas prices have historically stayed below $4.50 per thousand cubic feet until 2003, with projections for 2015 at $5.08. The sensitivity of natural gas-fired electric generation to prices is illustrated in cost estimates provided in Table 5. Based on cost estimates, the breakeven point for unsubsidized nuclear power compared to natural gas-fired facilities would be $6.65/mcf in 2004. The economic question is whether the current rise in natural gas prices is short-term or a long-term trend, impacting the attractiveness of building new nuclear power plants in the future. Nuclear power construction could become attractive if natural gas prices remain above $6.65 per MMBtu. Coal prices have been declining due to large, low-cost mining operations. Any greenhouse gas control program would impact new coal and natural gas generation costs, while nuclear power is assumed to have no emissions. The \"green\" nuclear power argument has gained traction in think tanks and academia, with the industry promoting it as a solution to rising greenhouse gas emissions. Some environmentalists support nuclear power as part of the response to climate change, despite opposition from the Bush Administration. Congressional proposals to reduce greenhouse gases have been introduced. Congressional proposals to reduce greenhouse gases were introduced in the 109th and 110th Congresses but have not passed. Efforts in 2003 and 2005 to implement a mandatory greenhouse gas reduction program failed in the Senate. The proposals aimed to cap U.S. emissions based on a 2001 baseline through a tradeable permit program. Concern over addressing global climate change led to the introduction of S.Amdt. 866 by 13 Senators. During the debate on the Energy Policy Act of 2005, 13 Senators introduced S.Amdt. 866, a resolution on climate change. It acknowledges the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the human contribution to this accumulation, and the need for mandatory steps to reduce emissions. The resolution calls for Congress to enact a national program of market-based limits and incentives on greenhouse gases to slow, stop, and reverse their growth without harming the economy. Several bills introduced in the 109th and 110th Congress aimed at addressing climate change through cap-and-trade permit systems and CO2 control provisions. The resolution on climate change called for mandatory steps to reduce emissions without harming the economy. The 109th and 110th Congress introduced bills for cap-and-trade permit systems to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide from electric generating facilities. The proposed legislation aimed to limit greenhouse gases with an economy-wide tradeable permit program, mandating reductions in greenhouse gas intensity annually. The program proposed by Senators McCain, Lieberman, and Jeffords would create a cost-limiting safety valve for covered entities to make payments to DOE instead of reducing emissions. The initial payment price would be $7 per ton in 2010, increasing by 5% annually. The bills aim to establish cap-and-trade programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants from specific sources. The proposed program by Senators McCain, Lieberman, and Jeffords includes unit-by-unit controls on mercury emissions and a CO2 cap to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. Different proposals have varying projected trade permit prices, with S. 2724 estimated to have the lowest price. Uncertainty surrounds the actual cost of any greenhouse gas initiative, except for the NCEP proposal which includes a safety valve. The effect of the proposals on 2015 and 2020 generation costs by fuel source is shown in Table 7. The proposed bills S. 2724, S. 1151, S. 150, and the draft proposal based on NCEP recommendations would have varying effects on fuel choice in 2015 and 2020. S. 150 would provide the greatest advantage to nuclear power, resembling the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. Table 8 shows the effects of permit prices on new electric generating costs, with nuclear power having breakeven points of $30/ton for natural gas and $15/ton for coal. The breakeven point for nuclear power compared to coal-fired facilities is around $15 per metric ton. Nuclear power could act as a safety valve for electric generation if permit prices or a carbon tax become permanent. The disposal of highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear reactors is a significant consideration for new plant construction. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 commits the government to permanent disposal of spent fuel, but the opening of the national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain has been delayed. The Department of Energy aims to start receiving waste at Yucca Mountain by 2017. In the meantime, over 50,000 metric tons of spent fuel are stored at nuclear facility sites, with a limit of 70,000 metric tons at the planned Yucca Mountain repository. The Yucca Mountain limit may be reached before new reactors come online, raising questions about the disposal of spent fuel from new nuclear power plants. Options include continued storage at reactor sites, interim storage at central locations, lifting the cap on Yucca Mountain disposal, developing additional repositories, and reprocessing spent fuel for reuse. The Bush Administration's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership proposal aims to reprocess spent fuel to reduce the need for Yucca Mountain disposal. The NRC believes onsite storage of spent fuel is safe for up to 30 years after a reactor's license expires. Lack of a permanent repository is not seen as a barrier to nuclear plant licensing. The Administration included a provision in its nuclear waste bill to address repository delays for nuclear plant licensing. Several states have laws linking new nuclear power plant approval to waste disposal capacity. State authority over nuclear plant construction is limited to economic considerations, not safety. No new nuclear plants have been ordered since state restrictions were enacted. The ability of nuclear plants to meet Supreme Court criteria has not been tested due to state restrictions. Public opposition to nuclear power has historically focused on the nuclear waste issue. Proposed new reactors without a clear waste removal plan may face increased public scrutiny, especially at sites without existing reactors."
