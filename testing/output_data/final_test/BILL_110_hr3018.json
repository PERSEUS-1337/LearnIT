The \"Family Self-Sufficiency Act of 2007\" includes provisions for establishing fees to assist families in the self-sufficiency program under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937. The Secretary will establish a fee for administering the program and funding family self-sufficiency coordinators for public housing agencies with 25 or more participants. The \"Family Self-Sufficiency Act of 2007\" establishes fees for public housing agencies with 25 or more participants. Agencies meeting performance standards can receive additional fees for employing family self-sufficiency coordinators based on the number of participating families. The \"Family Self-Sufficiency Act of 2007\" allows public housing agencies to receive funding for family self-sufficiency coordinators based on their performance and size, with the highest number funded in a single fiscal year from 1998 to 2007. In the initial year of implementing a family self-sufficiency program, agencies can receive funding for one coordinator. The \"Family Self-Sufficiency Act of 2007\" allows public housing agencies to receive funding for family self-sufficiency coordinators based on their size and performance. Each part of a State or regional public housing agency is treated as a separate agency for fee calculation purposes. The number of coordinators funded is determined by the agency's participant count. The average number of families enrolled in an agency's family self-sufficiency program during the most recent fiscal year will determine the number of coordinators funded. If funds are insufficient, priority will be given to agencies with existing programs, with remaining funds prorated based on the number of coordinators needed. The Secretary will recapture any unspent fees allocated to agencies under this subparagraph and make them available for additional fees. Within six months of enactment, the Secretary will publish performance standards for funding under subparagraph (B), including requirements for clauses (ii) and (iii). The Secretary will establish standards for leveraging resources in family self-sufficiency programs. Public housing agencies must collect and report program performance data. The Secretary will evaluate program effectiveness through random participant assignment. The Secretary will submit interim and final evaluation reports to Congress within specified timeframes. $10,000,000 is authorized for the evaluation. Up to 10% of funds can be reserved for innovative or successful family self-sufficiency programs. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 25, 2008."
