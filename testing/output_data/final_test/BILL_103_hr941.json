    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Soil and Water Protection Act of 1992\". The Congress recognizes the importance of protecting natural resources, addressing soil and water damage, and energy shortages. Farmers, ranchers, and foresters play a crucial role in energy usage and can benefit from energy-saving techniques. Practices like fertility management and conservation tillage can improve environmental conditions for future generations. The Congress acknowledges the significance of protecting natural resources, addressing soil and water damage, and energy shortages. Farmers, ranchers, and foresters can benefit from energy-saving techniques such as fertility management and conservation tillage. Federal agricultural policies influence energy conservation and environmental objectives. The Federal Energy Conservation Program is established to address energy shortages and promote energy-saving techniques for farmers, ranchers, and foresters. Federal agricultural policies play a role in influencing energy conservation and environmental objectives. The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Soil Conservation Service, establishes a Federal energy conservation program targeting efficient energy use in various agricultural practices. Grants and assistance are provided for projects demonstrating conservation tillage practices and promoting education on fertilizer and pesticide usage. The Federal energy conservation program focuses on improving energy efficiency in agricultural practices such as manure, fertilizer, lime, and pesticide usage, irrigation systems, livestock and horticultural facilities, and wood utilization for energy production. The Federal energy conservation program focuses on improving energy efficiency in agricultural practices such as manure, fertilizer, lime, and pesticide usage, irrigation systems, livestock and horticultural facilities, and wood utilization for energy production. SEC. 4. FEDERAL GRANTS. The Secretary will provide grants for energy conservation projects developed with expertise in eligible states, considering advice from State agriculture energy conservation review panels. Grants are limited to $5,000 per project, except for projects involving schools, hospitals, or other entities. In energy conservation projects, grants are limited to $5,000 per project, except for projects involving schools, hospitals, or similar institutions converting heating systems to wood burning systems, where the grant cannot exceed $150,000. Funds cannot be used for labor costs, and grants require receipts for actual project costs before being made. The Secretary allocates funds to eligible States based on farm size, energy conservation potential, and forest industry size. Up to 25% of funds for States with significant forest industry can be allocated to forest energy conservation projects. States can receive grants for energy conservation projects, with exceptions for certain institutions, and funds cannot be used for labor costs. The Secretary may provide assistance under this Act to eligible States for projects, based on cooperation plans submitted by the State and the establishment of an agriculture energy conservation review panel. States can offer assistance and services with a cost share component. The State may offer assistance and services in cooperation with the Secretary to enhance energy conservation efforts under this Act through a State Agriculture Energy Conservation Review Panel comprised of 6 members. The State Agriculture Energy Conservation Review Panel, consisting of 6 members, advises and recommends projects to the Secretary based on the criteria outlined in the Act. The Cooperative Extension Director for the State or his designee is part of the panel. SEC. 7. DEMONSTRATIONS, EDUCATION, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will establish energy-saving demonstrations at agricultural experiment stations and provide educational materials through the Extension Service. Technical and material assistance will be offered to participants by the Soil Conservation Service. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report to Congress on the Federal energy conservation program, detailing state participation, grant projects, energy efficiency practices, and future state involvement. Additionally, $150,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1994 to 1996 to implement the Act."
