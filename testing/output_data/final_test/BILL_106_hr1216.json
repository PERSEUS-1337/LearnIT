    "content": "The Act titled \"Department of Veterans Affairs Nurses Appreciation Act of 1999\" revises the authority for adjusting basic pay for nurses and certain other health-care professionals at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Effective October 1, 1999, section 7451 of title 38, United States Code, is amended to revise covered positions for registered nurses and other healthcare professionals at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Basic pay rates for covered positions will be adjusted in accordance with Title 5. Additionally, revised locality pay authority will be effective from October 1, 2002. The Secretary will adjust rates of basic pay for employees at Department health-care facilities if rates are inadequate to recruit or retain personnel. Adjustments will be made by adjusting the minimum rate of basic pay for a grade and then adjusting other rates to conform to requirements. The Secretary will adjust rates of basic pay for employees at Department health-care facilities to align with compensation rates for health-care professionals in the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor-market area of that facility. The adjustments will be based on current information from appropriate Bureau of Labor Statistics data for the survey area of the facility. The Secretary will determine adjustments in rates of pay for employees at Department health-care facilities based on survey results to align with compensation rates for health-care professionals in the area. Adjustments will not reduce any rate of pay and regulations will be prescribed to ensure competitiveness of rates for Regional and Central Office employees in covered positions. The term 'rate of compensation' for health-care personnel positions in non-Department facilities corresponds to a grade of a covered position, including pay and quantifiable benefits. The term 'rate of compensation' for health-care personnel positions in non-Department facilities refers to positions with similar education, training, and experience requirements as Department health care personnel in that grade. SEC. 3. SAVINGS PROVISION. Employees of the Veterans Health Administration receiving a specific rate of pay before the effective date of an amendment will continue to receive that rate despite the amendment."
