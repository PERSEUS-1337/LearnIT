    "content": "On August 5, 2015, an accidental spill from the Gold King Mine released three million gallons of acid mine drainage wastewater into the Animas River, contaminating water downstream. Elevated levels of metals were found initially, but concentrations decreased as the plume moved. The spill raised concerns about water quality, public health, agriculture, and wildlife, highlighting issues with inactive or abandoned hardrock mine sites in the US. Historic mining operations in the US, mostly before environmental regulations, have left over 550,000 abandoned sites on public and private lands. The Government Accountability Office estimated over 160,000 abandoned hardrock mines in western states and Alaska, with about 33,000 sites causing environmental degradation. Some sites continue to pose threats to surface water and groundwater, impacting approximately 40% of headwaters in rivers and streams in the West. Abandoned hardrock mines in the West have impacted drinking water sources, threatening communities and agriculture, increasing treatment costs, and limiting fishing and recreation. The number of mines causing harm is estimated to be 5%-10% of all sites, potentially affecting 25,000 to 50,000 locations. Cleanup efforts are being encouraged, including by third-party \"Good Samaritan\" entities to prevent future accidents. Legislation has been introduced to authorize Good Samaritan remediation for historic mine pollution, proposing incentives like reduced liability and less stringent environmental standards for cleanup activities. Proponents argue that any cleanup is better than inaction, while opponents, including environmental groups, raise concerns about liability exposure and regulatory standards hindering voluntary cleanups. Legislation proposes incentives for Good Samaritan cleanup of historic mine pollution, allowing permits with less stringent environmental standards. Stakeholders include environmental advocates, states, and the federal government. Concerns raised about exemptions potentially undermining environmental legislation. The bills propose establishing a process for identifying eligible entities and lands for cleanup of historic mine pollution with Good Samaritan permits under the Clean Water Act. H.R. 963 would amend the act's permit provision to include requirements specific to Good Samaritan permits and create a dedicated cleanup fund from mineral royalties. The bills propose Good Samaritan relief for mine cleanups under the Clean Water Act, with H.R. 963 creating a dedicated cleanup fund from mineral royalties. The legislation in the 114th Congress reflects earlier proposals with some refinements. The report discusses issues related to Good Samaritan permits for mine cleanups under the Clean Water Act, including eligibility, covered minerals, cleanup standards, liability protection, funding, revenue treatment, enforcement, state and tribal roles, permit termination, and program sunset. It does not cover all aspects of current bills or general background on inactive mines. The issue of permit eligibility for Good Samaritans in cleaning up inactive mine sites is debated, with some arguing that only government entities should be allowed to undertake cleanup actions for public welfare. Industry groups argue that mining companies have the resources, knowledge, and technology to assess and remediate inactive mine sites, even if they were not responsible for creating them. There is concern that allowing private entities to profit from remediation could shift the focus away from cleanup efforts, leading to debates over eligibility criteria for involvement in cleanup activities. Industry groups argue that private entities, including existing companies not responsible for abandoned sites, should be allowed to participate as Good Samaritans in cleanup efforts. Broadening eligibility criteria for Good Samaritan permits would encourage more entities with resources and expertise to step forward for voluntary cleanups. H.R. 963 and the Discussion Draft propose an expansive list of parties eligible for permits, such as individuals, private entities, nonprofit organizations, and federal or state commissions. H.R. 3843 does not provide a specific list of eligible entities for Good Samaritan permits, instead defining a Good Samaritan as someone with an ownership interest in the site who did not cause pollution or is not liable for cleanup costs. Orphan mine sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) under CERCLA are excluded from eligibility. The bill also excludes orphan mines that were active after December 11, 1980, even if not on the NPL. The issue of ensuring parties with legal responsibility for a site do not receive Good Samaritan permits is addressed in current bills related to the NPL. These bills state that financially capable owners or operators involved in creating pollution should not be eligible for permits. However, for abandoned or inactive mines where responsible parties may not exist, existing cleanup requirements apply. Under the proposed bills, a Good Samaritan is defined as someone not responsible for creating pollution at a site, including historic mine residue, and is not liable for cleanup. The Discussion Draft also specifies that a Good Samaritan cannot be a current or past owner or operator of the site. Some past proposals excluded the federal government from being considered a Good Samaritan due to concerns about its responsibility. The federal government is not eligible for Good Samaritan relief under proposed bills, as it is considered a responsible party for lands it owns. Critics argue that this restriction creates hurdles for cleaning up abandoned mine sites with mixed public and private ownership. None of the bills in the 114th Congress would prevent federal or state governments from being Good Samaritans. Permit applicants must make efforts to search for responsible owners or operators. Some stakeholders question the level of effort needed to identify responsible parties for cleanup. They suggest the government should bear the burden as it has the resources for the search, which can be complex and costly. Requiring industry or Good Samaritans to conduct owner/operator searches reduces resources for actual cleanup. Supporters of Good Samaritan proposals debate whether legislation should focus on remediation of abandoned hardrock mineral mines or include abandoned coal mines. Some industry and state stakeholders advocate for cleanup of both types of mines. H.R. 3843 proposes cleanup for non-coal and coal mines. Past proposals required coal mine cleanup to follow approved reclamation plans. H.R. 3843 does not require coal mine cleanup to follow approved reclamation plans. Advocates argue that including coal sites under Good Samaritan proposals is necessary due to the environmental impact of acidified mine drainage from inactive and abandoned coal mines, especially in the East. Funding for abandoned coal mine cleanup exceeds available resources, and some cleanup at less stringent standards is better than none to prevent worsening conditions over time. Opponents of including coal sites in Good Samaritan legislation argue that it could weaken existing standards for coal mine remediation projects and complicate policymakers' consideration of issues concerning hardrock mineral sites. They fear potential liability under state and federal laws for reaffecting the sites. The Good Samaritan proposals aim to incentivize voluntary cleanup of IAM sites by not imposing strict environmental protection standards. This approach addresses concerns that holding volunteers to the same standards as polluters creates disincentives for cleanup efforts. The Good Samaritan proposals aim to incentivize voluntary cleanup of IAM sites by not imposing strict environmental protection standards. Stakeholders are debating the goals and standards for cleanup, with a focus on achieving significant environmental improvement over existing conditions. The intention of cleanup, appropriate cleanup benchmarks, feasibility, and economic considerations are key points of discussion. The challenge in implementing Good Samaritan projects is to define standards that are clear yet flexible enough for individual sites. Vague cleanup standards may lead to poorly conceived projects, as noted by the National Research Council. The NRC recommended that the goal of IAM remediation at large mine sites should focus on achieving characteristics of a healthy aquatic ecosystem, rather than specific contaminant concentrations. This approach should define necessary environmental protection measures and monitoring requirements. Current bills aim to balance cleanup standards flexibly, with H.R. 3843 focusing on improving the environment and H.R. 963 encouraging partial or complete cleanup. The purpose of H.R. 963 is to encourage the remediation of inactive and abandoned mine sites for the public good. Good Samaritan permits may be issued to projects that help achieve water quality standards without worsening baseline conditions. Concerns remain about defining cleanup standards and the discretion given to permitting authorities. Proponents of Good Samaritan legislation argue that liability under environmental laws hinders voluntary cleanup of inactive and abandoned mines, specifically mentioning CERCLA and the CWA. CERCLA holds entities responsible for cleanup costs and damages from hazardous substance releases, potentially including Good Samaritans. Good Samaritans could be considered operators or arrangers under CERCLA, facing strict and joint liability. CERCLA imposes strict and joint liability on PRPs, including Good Samaritans, for cleanup costs and damages from hazardous substance releases. Good Samaritans cannot selectively address pollution issues and must meet all relevant federal and state standards. The \"polluter pays\" principle aims to reduce public funding for cleanups, but current legislative proposals do not allow PRPs to be exempt as Good Samaritans. Mining companies strongly support broad liability exemptions for Good Samaritans in cleanup activities, fearing the strict liability under CERCLA. They argue that without exemptions, parties may be deterred from remediation efforts due to potential liability risks. Recently, stakeholders, including conservation groups and states, advocate for protection from CERCLA liability to encourage voluntary cleanups. The Clean Water Act requires permits for point-source discharges into US waters, posing challenges for potential Good Samaritans. Courts have ruled that discharges from abandoned mines are point sources needing CWA permits, which impose different obligations than CERCLA liability. The Clean Water Act requires permit holders to comply with effluent limitations and water quality standards, with liability for expenses and penalties for noncompliance. The CWA allows EPA to order PRPs to clean up, but not clean up itself and seek reimbursement. Stakeholders suggest improving water quality through runoff collection or treatment systems. Following a spill at the Gold King Mine site, mine water is treated passively in settling ponds with added lime and chemicals to reduce acidity before release to a nearby creek. Nonprofit groups struggle with CWA liability and compliance due to funding constraints for water treatment facilities, creating financial risks. Many are hesitant to engage in projects with potential liability beyond permit termination. Nonprofit groups face challenges in obtaining permits for water treatment projects in remote areas with difficult monitoring access. They seek incentives for Good Samaritans to improve water quality, even if not meeting all CWA standards. Some argue that CERCLA inclusion is unnecessary if activities are covered by a CWA permit, providing immunity from liability. The liability immunity under CERCLA Sections 107(j) and 101(10) would not be available if there is no CWA permit for the project. CERCLA Section 107(d) exempts those providing care or advice on a cleanup in accordance with the National Contingency Plan, offering liability protection equivalent to other environmental laws like the CWA. Critics argue against including an exemption from CERCLA. Critics question the inclusion of an exemption from CERCLA, expressing concerns about liability shield expiration and potential negative impacts on environmental legislation. Environmental groups caution against granting exemptions to Good Samaritans, fearing it may weaken environmental laws and worsen conditions. According to proponents, liability under existing environmental laws hinders voluntary cleanups of abandoned mine sites. Some argue that Good Samaritan legislation is unnecessary as EPA can authorize cleanup projects under Superfund, tailoring liability relief and environmental requirements. EPA initiated a program in 2007 to promote voluntary cleanups of abandoned hardrock mine sites. The initiative aims to encourage voluntary cleanups of abandoned hardrock mine sites by providing administrative tools to reduce CERCLA liability for Good Samaritans. It includes a model comfort/status letter and a settlement agreement to shield Good Samaritans from potential liability. EPA initiated this program in 2007 to facilitate cleanups without formal settlement agreements. The Good Samaritan initiative, authorized by CERCLA Section 107(d), aims to reduce liability for volunteers cleaning up abandoned mine sites. The August 2015 Gold King Mine spill was not caused by a Good Samaritan but by an EPA investigation. If a Good Samaritan had been cleaning up the site under CERCLA, they may have been exempt from liability for the spill with an EPA-approved plan. EPA may determine water quality standards during remediation activities under the initiative. EPA can authorize site-specific requirements for environmental improvement during remediation activities under the Good Samaritan initiative. CWA liability may arise after completion of obligations, but a 2012 guidance addresses circumstances to avoid potential responsibilities. The guidance outlines five factors to determine CWA permit requirements for the \"operator\" of a facility. The 2012 guidance outlines factors for determining CWA permit requirements for the \"operator\" of a facility, with Trout Unlimited having experience in utilizing these tools. EPA's initiatives are seen as helpful but do not resolve all liability questions. EPA's initiatives are helpful but do not resolve all liability questions, especially regarding the CWA. The CWA tool has not been used by a Good Samaritan yet, leaving details of its application unclear. Previous proposals for liability exemption varied, some focusing on a single statute while others proposed broad protection from multiple laws. Supporters argue for exemption from federal, state, and local requirements to eliminate uncertainty. H.R. 963 would exempt a Good Samaritan permittee from various obligations and liabilities under the Clean Water Act, providing liability protection for compliance with specific sections such as effluent limitations, water quality standards, hazardous substance spills, and wetlands permits. This exemption does not include compliance with CWA Section 401, which requires state certification for federal permits or licenses. H.R. 3843 would exempt Good Samaritan permittees from compliance with Clean Water Act (CWA) and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) requirements and liability. It would also waive Section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for actions by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Good Samaritan title of the legislation. This exemption would allow EPA to issue Good Samaritan permits without conducting NEPA analysis. The Discussion Draft, like H.R. 3843, would exempt Good Samaritans from certain Clean Water Act and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act requirements and liability. It would not waive compliance with NEPA and would not exempt activities covered by a Good Samaritan permit from certain CWA requirements. Any activity not related to historic mine residue remediation would still be subject to all CWA and CERCLA requirements. The bill includes a provision exempting states or Indian tribes conducting remediation of an IAM coal mine from obtaining a CWA permit. The liability exemption in the bills would end when the permit terminates, but may not cover ongoing discharges after the project is complete. The Discussion Draft offers liability relief for past, present, and future discharges at orphan sites. The bill provides liability relief for past, present, and future discharges at orphan mining sites, addressing perpetual discharges from an IAM site. Stakeholders highlight funding as a major obstacle to voluntary cleanups, with EPA estimating remediation costs between $20 billion and $54 billion. Without additional funding, only 20% of cleanup work could be completed in 30 years. The lack of dedicated funding for reclamation and remediation of abandoned hardrock mines poses a significant challenge. Stakeholders emphasize the need for a funding mechanism to address environmental pollution problems at numerous sites. Without secured funding, concerns arise about successfully implementing a remediation program expected to last for decades or even centuries. Legislation has been proposed in the past to establish a reclamation fee on hardrock mineral extraction. Legislation has been introduced to establish a reclamation fee on hardrock mineral producers to fund cleanup of abandoned mines. The industry argues against the fee, stating that current mining practices will not lead to similar environmental problems in the future. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget proposes a reclamation fee on all hardrock mining to address abandoned mine lands. Legislation has been introduced in the 114th Congress to create an Abandoned Mine Lands Program for abandoned hardrock sites, financed through a fee on production of hardrock minerals. The program is estimated to generate $1.8 billion over 10 years. H.R. 963 proposes a cleanup fund for abandoned hardrock mines with provisions for a fee on displaced material collection and royalties on gross income from mining operations. Funds would be used for reclamation and restoration of land and water resources affected by past hardrock mineral activities. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aims to create an Abandoned Mine Lands Program for abandoned hardrock sites, funded through a fee on hardrock mineral production. The program is projected to generate $1.8 billion over a decade. Additionally, separate legislation, S. 2254, proposes a Hardrock Minerals Reclamation Fund funded by a reclamation fee and royalty fee on mining operations. The reclamation fee would be set at 0.6% to 2% of production value, while the royalty fee would range from 2% to 5% of gross income. The bill sponsors intend for Fund expenditures to be exempt from appropriations. Good Samaritan provisions in the bills address funding sources for cleanup projects, including grants under CWA Section 319 for nonpoint source water pollution management. Projects to implement abandoned mine land reclamation for water quality restoration are eligible for Section 319 funding, with restrictions on specific NPDES permit requirements. Section 319 grants have been used for education, technical assistance, project demonstration, and groundwater protection, with only a small portion allocated to abandoned mine land projects. Proposed legislation aims to clarify eligibility for Section 319 grants for abandoned mine land remediation projects. H.R. 963 includes provisions for Section 319 grants, allowing for various eligible activities including abandoned mine land reclamation. The legislation also addresses the issue of revenue disposition from Good Samaritan remediation projects involving historic mine residue. All three bills permit incidental reprocessing of wastes related to cleanup of an Inactive Abandoned Mine (IAM), but not re-mining at IAM sites. Industry stakeholders are interested in opportunities for re-mining at Inactive Abandoned Mine (IAM) sites under a Good Samaritan permit to extract valuable materials from waste material, reducing cleanup costs and benefiting economically. Some groups advocate for processing minerals in waste material at IAM sites to efficiently clean up and potentially make a profit, while others oppose the idea of for-profit cleanup, believing mineral recovery should be secondary to site reclamation. Critics worry about the redirection of proceeds from the site back to remediation or to another IAM site. Critics are concerned that mining companies could exploit liability exemptions and reduced cleanup requirements under the Good Samaritan permit to avoid responsibilities of their own operations. Industry argues that transparency in the permitting process will prevent misuse of the permit. Environmental critics highlight potential environmental issues with processing mine waste, such as cyanide heap leaching, which could create new environmental problems. Legislative complexities arise in crafting Good Samaritan permits for mining cleanup activities, ensuring no worsening of water quality conditions. Current bills limit permit activities to remediation of historic mine residue, with restrictions on new mining actions. H.R. 3843 specifies that permits cannot authorize mining activities unrelated to remediation at the site. H.R. 963 is more restrictive than H.R. 3843, requiring proceeds from recovered materials to be used for remediation costs at the same or other IAM sites. The Good Samaritan permit would end when remediation changes to development, subjecting discharges to standard environmental laws. The Discussion Draft allows re-mining for off-site remediation and cost defrayment. Permit applications must detail proposed remediation, including recycling or reprocessing. The proposed remediation includes recycling or reprocessing of historic mine residue at the site. Concerns have been raised about potential restrictions for Good Samaritans in the mining industry. Stakeholders argue for different enforcement tools for Good Samaritans to avoid citizen suits and financial penalties. Citizen suits are seen as critical for compliance with environmental laws. The CWA's enforcement authorities, including Section 309 which allows EPA to enforce requirements through administrative orders, penalties, civil actions, and citizen suits. Stakeholders are discussing alternative enforcement mechanisms for Good Samaritans in the mining industry to avoid citizen suits and penalties. The Clean Water Act (CWA) authorizes citizen suits in Section 505 for violations of effluent standards. EPA can intervene and seek injunctions and civil penalties. Section 504 allows EPA to address imminent endangerments to public health. H.R. 963 proposes using existing CWA enforcement mechanisms, potentially avoiding the need for citizen suits. H.R. 963 proposes using existing Clean Water Act enforcement mechanisms, rejecting special treatment for Good Samaritans. Compliance with a Good Samaritan permit would provide a shield against enforcement under the CWA, but permit violations would be subject to enforcement. H.R. 3843 affords fewer enforcement tools for Good Samaritans compared to CWA permit violators, with no mention of administrative penalties or citizen suits for Good Samaritan permit violations. This bill offers the permitting authority the option of an \"order to comply\" or civil action for permit violations, with lower daily civil penalties than the CWA. It does not allow for criminal penalties and shields Good Samaritan permit activities from citizen suits, although the inclusion of a separate citizen suit provision is not addressed. Violations of a Good Samaritan permit could result in civil penalties. Violations of a Good Samaritan permit under the proposed bill could result in a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per day, which some groups find daunting. There are differing opinions on whether this penalty amount should align with the Clean Water Act's penalty of $37,500 per day. The bills clarify that a Good Samaritan permit does not limit the government's emergency authorities. H.R. 3843 does not address challenges to permit issuance or denial, while H.R. 963 does not have separate judicial review provisions, but it is presumed that the Clean Water Act's provisions would apply. The Discussion Draft proposes judicial review in federal courts for actions by EPA or state/tribal permitting authority in issuing or denying permits. The role of states and tribes in the Good Samaritan permit process is debated, with all three bills giving EPA primary permit issuance responsibility, which can be delegated to qualified states/tribes. H.R. 963 and the Discussion Draft require consent/concurrence from affected states/tribes before permit issuance by EPA. H.R. 3843 and tribes must consent before EPA issues a permit. Objections from land management agencies can prevent permit issuance. Notice of permit applications must be given to local, federal, state, and tribal agencies. Consent from these agencies is not required. EPA retains oversight when a state issues an NPDES permit. EPA retains oversight when a state issues an NPDES permit, with the authority to object and issue the permit if necessary. H.R. 3843 lacks similar oversight for EPA after delegation to a state or tribe. The proposed legislation addresses the termination of a Good Samaritan permit, specifying conditions for when liability relief and regulatory exemptions would cease. A Good Samaritan permit issued under the NPDES program would be expected to expire in no more than five years, terminating when the remediation plan is completed or when activity changes from remediation to development. The legislation addresses the termination of a Good Samaritan permit under the NPDES program, specifying conditions for when liability relief and regulatory exemptions would cease. Permits would have an end date to complete activities, with termination possible for various reasons including non-commencement of work within one year, failure to complete by the specified date, or for cause. Projects authorized by a Good Samaritan permit must be completed within six years of issuance or 10 years of enactment of the legislation. The Good Samaritan permit program under the NPDES legislation may be terminated after a specific period of time, such as 7 or 10 years after enactment. Some argue that a sunset provision allows for congressional review and potential extension, while others believe ongoing programs can be reviewed at any time. H.R. 963 and the Discussion Draft propose sunset provisions for the Good Samaritan program, with different end dates. Reports to Congress are required on program implementation. Stakeholders have been discussing legislative proposals for over 15 years to encourage cleanup of inactive mine sites. Stakeholders have been working to achieve consensus on Good Samaritan issues related to abandoned mine sites. The August 2015 Gold King Mine incident has brought renewed attention to the issue, with some agreement on liability relief for voluntary remediation but disagreement on important details. The Obama Administration has not taken a position on the need for Good Samaritan legislation. Legislative proposals for creating a fund to remediate abandoned hardrock mine sites differ in key aspects, such as liability protection, funding needs, revenue questions, and standards, requiring further discussion and debate for consensus."
