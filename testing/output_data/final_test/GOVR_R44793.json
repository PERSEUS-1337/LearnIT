    "content": "The 115th Congress and the Trump Administration are reviewing U.S. policies and programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Key issues include aid allocation, military funding, and oversight. Africa saw economic growth but faces development challenges like healthcare and education needs. Key development challenges in sub-Saharan Africa include unmet needs for health, education, and social services, climate and environmental shocks, poor governance, infrastructure, poverty, lack of skilled labor, limited access to inputs and capital, political instability, and insecurity. Despite transitioning to multiparty political systems, many countries still lack accountable democratic institutions due to corruption and mismanagement. U.S. policy priorities in the region focus on enhancing democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. Human rights in sub-Saharan Africa are a priority for U.S. policy, with efforts focused on promoting democracy, human rights, and economic development through diplomacy, foreign aid, and sanctions on human rights violators. Armed conflicts and instability in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Lake Chad Basin, Central African Republic, Mali, and South Sudan continue to threaten regional security and contribute to humanitarian crises. Porous borders, weak institutions, and corruption create environments for transnational threats in some African countries. The Obama Administration pursued global development initiatives in Africa, focusing on strengthening democratic institutions, economic growth, peace and security, and development. Three African countries - South Sudan, Nigeria, and Somalia - face famine or a credible risk of famine in 2017, with security-related restrictions hindering humanitarian access. The U.S. prioritized human rights, democracy, and economic development in sub-Saharan Africa to address armed conflicts and instability in the region. The Trump Administration's approach to U.S.-Africa policy remains unclear, with key African countries being contacted early in Trump's presidency. The revised Executive Order on immigration affects nationals from Somalia and Sudan. Other priorities of the Administration are yet to be specified. The Trump Administration's approach to U.S.-Africa policy remains unclear, with key African countries being contacted early in Trump's presidency. The revised Executive Order on immigration affects nationals from Somalia and Sudan. Other priorities of the Administration are yet to be specified. In sub-Saharan Africa, economic growth has been high since the early 2000s, leading to middle class expansion, improved health indicators, and infrastructure development. However, poverty alleviation has been limited, and many African economies face structural challenges. Most African countries did not meet the U.N. Millennium Development Goals by 2015, and economic growth has slowed since then, especially for countries reliant on raw commodity exports. In sub-Saharan Africa, economic growth has been high since the early 2000s, leading to middle class expansion, improved health indicators, and infrastructure development. However, poverty alleviation has been limited, and many African economies face structural challenges. Some countries reliant on raw commodity exports have suffered declining growth due to weak global commodity prices, while others have benefited from low oil prices. Africa's largest economy, Nigeria, experienced a recession in 2016, its worst economic contraction since 1987. Some countries in Southern Africa and the Horn of Africa have faced food security crises and low growth due to drought associated with the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon. Economic growth rates and policy performance vary widely among countries in the region. The IMF described sub-Saharan Africa's outlook as \"multispeed growth\" in late 2016, with varying growth projections for commodity exporting and non-resource exporting countries. Despite overall growth, income distribution remains unequal, the informal sector is large, and unemployment rates are high. Development challenges persist despite income increases not matching growth rates. Africa's income distribution is uneven, with some countries classified as \"high income\" or \"upper-middle-income\" by the World Bank. However, poverty remains a significant issue, with 41% of the population living on less than $1.25 per day. The region also faces high levels of malnutrition and lacks institutional capacity to provide essential public services. Corruption and insecurity further hinder development efforts. Africa continues to face significant human development challenges, with high maternal and child mortality rates, prevalence of stunted growth, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Access to improved drinking water and sanitation facilities remains a steep challenge, with a significant number of deaths due to exposure to unsafe water in the region. Access to quality education in Africa remains a major challenge, with high rates of children not attending school and low literacy rates, especially among girls. Despite progress, the region still lags behind in youth literacy compared to other developing countries. Africa also has a large youth population, with a significant gap between male and female literacy rates. In 2016, 60% of sub-Saharan Africa's population was aged 24 or younger, presenting challenges for governments in education, job creation, and socio-political enfranchisement. Failure to address these issues can lead to dissent, protests, and instability. The United States had a goods trade deficit of $6.5 billion with sub-Saharan Africa in 2016, importing $20.1 billion worth of goods and exporting $13.6 billion. The United States had a goods trade deficit of $6.5 billion with sub-Saharan Africa in 2016, importing $20.1 billion worth of goods and exporting $13.6 billion. Major U.S. exports to Africa include machinery, vehicles, refined fuel products, aircraft, and wheat. Oil constitutes the largest share of U.S. imports from Africa, with key nonenergy imports being metals, vehicles, and cocoa. Nigeria and South Africa are the continent's largest economies and largest U.S. trade partners. The United States focuses on encouraging economic growth and development in Africa through trade and investment. Africa supplies the U.S. with natural resources such as oil, minerals, and metals. Members of Congress support efforts to increase trade and investment opportunities in Africa. Despite increasing interest in Africa as a destination for U.S. goods, services, and investment, many U.S. businesses remain skeptical due to economic governance challenges, difficulty of doing business, and political instability in some African countries. Lack of knowledge about opportunities and negative perceptions also contribute to the lack of U.S. business interest in the region. Despite economic growth in Africa, factors like poor infrastructure and limited market size hinder the region's business climate and potential. Infrastructure issues include unreliable transportation and inefficient ports, leading to increased costs and shipment delays. Low per capita incomes limit domestic demand, with varying efforts to boost market size through regional integration. Foreign business interest mainly focuses on major economies like South Africa. Interest in sub-Saharan Africa is mainly on major economies like South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya. The region faces a scarcity of skilled labor due to under-investment in education. Many countries rely heavily on low-skill agriculture, with farming providing up to 60% of all jobs. Economic diversification and value chain enhancement are crucial, as many economies are dependent on labor-intensive, small-scale agricultural production and unrefined commodity exports. Limited growth potential is seen due to the lack of value-added processing and production. The business sector in sub-Saharan Africa faces challenges such as constrained market size, limited access to inputs, regulatory issues, corruption, and political instability. These factors hinder the growth of skilled workforces and lead to unrealized income potential and low competitiveness compared to other regions. Political instability and conflict in many African countries undermine business confidence in the region. President Obama's Africa Strategy focused on improving legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks for trade and investment. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) has been crucial for U.S.-Africa trade policy since 2000. The Obama Administration also launched the Doing Business in Africa campaign and the Trade Africa Initiative to promote trade and investment in Africa. The Obama Administration aimed to enhance U.S.-Africa trade and investment by transforming African trade hubs into two-way centers, promoting intraregional trade, and supporting business linkages. Various U.S. agencies provided trade capacity building programs in Africa, along with Trade and Investment Framework Agreements with African countries. The United States has a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Morocco in North Africa, but no existing U.S. FTAs with sub-Saharan African countries. Negotiations for a potential U.S.-Southern African Customs Union (SACU) FTA were initiated in 2003 but suspended in 2006 due to differing views on the agreement's scope. In September 2016, the Obama Administration released a report on moving U.S. trade policy towards more reciprocal agreements with Africa, citing challenges such as economic diversity among African countries and varying levels of interest and capacity for FTA commitments. The report highlighted the importance of U.S. trade policy in the region supporting regional integration efforts and promoting economic reforms. AGOA is a nonreciprocal trade preference program for eligible sub-Saharan African countries. The ongoing policy question is how to advance U.S. trade relations beyond unilateral preferences, especially with larger African economies. The Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 extended AGOA's authorization for 10 years to September 2025, aiming to deepen economic integration within the region and strengthen U.S.-African trade ties. U.S. trade with Africa has fluctuated significantly since 2001, with energy products dominating trade flows. AGOA is seen as a potential catalyst for economic development in Africa, with nonenergy trade showing growth. Total U.S. imports under AGOA were $10.6 billion in 2016, with a few countries and products driving the bulk of these imports. Despite a recent decline, energy products, mainly crude oil, continue to be the top import under AGOA, accounting for 62% of total imports in 2016. South Africa leads in nonenergy imports at $2.8 billion, exporting a diverse range of products including motor vehicles. Kenya, Lesotho, and Mauritius primarily export apparel products under AGOA, totaling nearly $900 million in nonenergy imports. The remaining 34 AGOA beneficiary countries contributed $428 million in nonenergy imports in 2016. AGOA mandates an annual U.S.-Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum, alternating between the United States and Africa. The U.S.-Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum is held in alternate years in the United States and Africa to discuss expanding trade and investment relations, encourage joint ventures between businesses, and promote AGOA goals. The 15th Forum took place in September 2016 in Washington, DC. AGOA directs the President to provide technical and trade capacity building assistance to strengthen trade linkages between U.S. and African firms. The reauthorization of AGOA includes provisions for duty-free treatment of eligible apparel items and the third-country fabric provision. Other key provisions involve rules of origin, country eligibility reviews, and an out-of-cycle review process for compliance. The reauthorization of AGOA includes provisions for duty-free treatment of eligible apparel items and the third-country fabric provision. It also requires an out-of-cycle review of South Africa's AGOA eligibility, with the country maintaining eligibility after removing import restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports. The legislation allows for termination or partial withdrawal of preferences, encourages utilization strategies in select countries and products, and promotes the role of women in development by protecting property rights for both genders. AGOA eligibility requires protecting private property rights \"for men and women\" and promotes negotiation of trade agreements with AGOA countries. It also encourages implementation of WTO commitments and funding for agriculture capacity building. Reporting requirements include a biennial report on U.S. trade and investment relations with Africa. The biennial report on U.S. trade and investment relations with Africa, including changes in AGOA eligibility, regional integration efforts, and U.S. trade capacity building, was first released in June 2016. Democracy, rule of law, and human rights trends are key focuses of U.S. policy towards Africa, with many countries transitioning to multiparty political systems since the early 1990s. Peaceful democratic transfers of power have been seen in countries like Senegal, Cabo Verde, and Ghana. Despite progress in some African states like South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia, where strong institutions have been developed, challenges to democracy persist. Nigeria's 2015 elections marked a historic peaceful transition of power, while departures of long-serving leaders in Burkina Faso and The Gambia have been seen as positive signs. However, many African countries still face limited development of accountable democratic institutions, with elections often marred by fraud, violence, and irregularities favoring dominant parties. The trend of \"third-termism\" also poses a threat as leaders seek to extend their mandates. In Africa, leaders are extending their mandates by circumventing term limits, leading to growing protests in countries like Zimbabwe. Democratic competition and civil society activism are limited in countries such as Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Rwanda, and Sudan. Repressive laws are used to restrict political and media freedoms in some governments, while military coups have ousted governments in Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, and Guinea-Bissau. Governance hurdles in African countries include weak parliamentary oversight, legislative dominance by the executive branch, and policies benefiting incumbent parties or special interests. State institutions often lack capacity to meet citizens' needs due to corruption and mismanagement. Countries like Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Guinea-Bissau, Eritrea, Zimbabwe, and Burundi rank poorly in corruption perception. Corruption also undermines state effectiveness in Nigeria and Kenya, affecting reform-oriented leaders in Liberia, Malawi, and Mali. Transnational drug trafficking has impaired institutional capacity in countries like Liberia, Malawi, and Mali, leading to political influence and corruption in the justice sector. State weakness and violent conflict in countries such as Somalia, CAR, and South Sudan hinder the provision of basic public services and result in severe human rights abuses, often without accountability. International support for transitional justice processes aims to address these abuses as part of conflict resolution efforts. The U.S. uses diplomacy and reporting to address human rights violations in Africa, including publicly criticizing undemocratic actions and publishing annual reports on global human rights conditions. Congressional members also raise concerns through legislation. The U.S. provides foreign aid to support African electoral institutions, train political parties and civil society organizations, improve governance, and enhance human rights records of security forces. Congress imposes human rights-related restrictions on aid to specific African countries. The U.S. imposes human rights-related restrictions on aid to specific African countries, including restrictions on aid for religious freedom, child soldiers, and trafficking in persons. The U.S. imposes sanctions on countries like Burundi, CAR, DRC, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe for human rights violations. The Obama Administration eased sanctions on Sudan in 2017 due to progress on peace and humanitarian issues. The U.S. has funded tribunals in Sierra Leone, Rwanda, and Chad for human rights prosecutions and supports some ICC prosecutions. The United States supports ICC prosecutions and has tried individuals accused of human rights abuses in African countries like Rwanda and Liberia. The U.S. advocates for the establishment of an African Union court to investigate abuses in South Sudan. Armed conflict and instability in Africa threaten regional security and contribute to widespread human suffering. Multiple African countries rank among the most fragile states globally. Sub-Saharan Africa hosts a majority of the U.N.'s peacekeeping operations, with eight missions currently authorized in the region. The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) carries out peacekeeping activities in the region. The United States is a top funder of U.N. peacekeeping missions and regional stabilization operations in Africa, supporting troop contributors and conflict prevention efforts. Africa faces transnational threats due to porous borders, weak institutions, and corruption. Transnational threats in Africa, including terrorist groups like Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Al Shabaab, and Boko Haram, pose a significant risk to state stability, regional security, and U.S. national security interests. These groups have targeted urban areas popular with Westerners in mass casualty attacks since 2013. Weak law enforcement in some parts of the continent exacerbates the threat. Transnational crime networks operate in Africa due to weak law enforcement and collusion by state actors, posing a threat to state stability. Concerns have grown over links between drug traffickers and terrorist groups, as well as armed extremist groups involved in wildlife trafficking. Maritime security is also a concern in Africa's coastal waters, with illegal fishing, trafficking, and piracy being prevalent in the Gulf of Guinea, Gulf of Aden, and western Indian Ocean. Maritime security in Africa's coastal waters has been compromised by illegal activities such as fishing, trafficking, and piracy. Criminal elements take advantage of weak law enforcement to smuggle people, drugs, and weapons, as well as engage in acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea. While efforts have reduced pirate attacks off the Somali coast, the Gulf of Guinea remains one of the most dangerous regions for maritime piracy. In March 2017, pirates hijacked an oil tanker off the Somali coast, highlighting the ongoing threat of piracy in the region. Several African countries continue to face challenges from past civil wars and ongoing conflicts, with countries like South Sudan experiencing significant unrest since 2013. Other nations, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, and those in the Lake Chad Basin region, are threatened by armed extremist groups. The Gulf of Guinea remains a hotspot for maritime piracy, with a recent hijacking of an oil tanker off the Somali coast in 2017. The peace agreement in South Sudan collapsed in July 2016, leading to renewed violence. Over 50,000 people have been killed and 3.4 million displaced, creating Africa's largest refugee crisis. 4.9 million people face severe food insecurity, with 100,000 experiencing famine. Conflict persists in Sudan, particularly in Darfur, Southern Kordofan, and Blue Nile states. The United States is the largest donor of humanitarian aid to South Sudan. In mid-2016, hostilities in Sudan ceased, but sporadic attacks on civilians continue. Over 3.2 million Sudanese are internally displaced, with half a million refugees in neighboring countries. Approximately 5.8 million people in Sudan require humanitarian aid. In Somalia, the threat from Al Shabaab remains severe, exacerbated by drought and limited humanitarian access. Al Shabaab has carried out terrorist attacks in East Africa, notably in Kenya. Kenya, Uganda, Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Sierra are also at risk. The 2013 rebel overthrow of CAR's central government triggered a crisis leading to widespread violence along ethno-religious lines, resulting in massive displacement and human suffering. CAR established a transitional government with international support and held elections in early 2016, but internal stability and armed group actions remain a challenge. Insecurity in eastern DRC poses a threat to the Great Lakes region despite a U.N. peacekeeping operation. In Uganda, efforts to disarm militias have faced controversy and mass protests, with the Lord's Resistance Army still terrorizing remote areas. Burundi's President's controversial reelection sparked a violent crisis, while the Republic of Congo faces insurgency after disputed elections. In the Lake Chad Basin region, Boko Haram has become increasingly deadly in its attacks against state and civilian targets since 2010 in Nigeria, Chad, Niger, and Cameroon. Tens of thousands have been killed in Boko Haram attacks, and more than 2.6 million people have been displaced across the region. Despite a peace accord with the government in 2015, Mali's crisis persists with deteriorating security conditions due to attacks from Islamist extremist groups. Mozambique has been dealing with an armed insurgency by RENAMO since 2012, seeking electoral reforms and governance decentralization. Angola faces sporadic armed rebellion by FLEC in Cabinda. U.S. foreign aid programs aim to address Africa's development challenges. U.S. foreign aid programs in Africa target development challenges, humanitarian needs, and security. Aid is administered by USAID and the State Department, focusing on health, rule of law, countering trafficking, and military professionalism. The Department of Defense implements some assistance programs and conducts military cooperation activities in African countries. The Millennium Challenge Corporation supports large-scale projects. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) supports multiyear development projects in African countries through Compacts, which are five-year aid programs targeting key impediments to economic growth. Sub-Saharan Africa receives a significant portion of U.S. bilateral aid, with a focus on health programs. Over $8.27 billion was allocated for the region in FY2015, with an initial estimate of $7.03 billion for FY2016. Additional emergency food aid is allocated based on need throughout the year. The United States provides substantial aid to Africa through various channels, including MCC-funded assistance. Between FY2003 and FY2010, U.S. aid to Africa increased significantly, particularly in global health spending for HIV/AIDS. In recent years, the aid amount has stabilized at around $7.5 billion to $8 billion annually. Key African recipients of bilateral assistance in FY2015 included Nigeria, Tanzania, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In recent years, U.S. aid to Africa has stabilized at around $7.5 billion to $8 billion annually, with a large portion provided under presidential development initiatives. Key Obama Administration initiatives with a focus on Africa included the Global Health Initiative (GHI) to coordinate global health programs. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) coordinates global health programs such as the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) and Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) Program. It aims to strengthen health systems in developing countries and promote country ownership of health assistance programs. Key program areas include maternal and child health, family planning, nutrition, social services for vulnerable children, HIV/AIDS prevention, and disease-specific outbreak efforts. Feed the Future (FtF) is a USAID-led initiative to improve food security and reduce poverty in selected countries. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative focuses on 19 countries, including 12 in Africa, to promote public-private partnerships in agriculture. At the 2014 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, over $10 billion in private sector investments were announced. The Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) addresses climate change impacts in Africa. The Obama Administration's GCCI aims to address climate change impacts by building resilience, promoting clean energy technologies, and supporting environmental conservation in selected countries. Power Africa, a USAID-led initiative, seeks to increase access to electricity in Africa through public-private partnerships and technical assistance. Power Africa aims to increase access to electricity in Africa through public-private partnerships and technical assistance. Initially supported with financial commitments worth up to $7.8 billion, the initiative set targets to create 10,000 MW of new electricity generation capacity and provide power connections for 20 million households and businesses. President Obama later expanded the goals to include 30,000 MW in additional capacity and 60 million new power connections. President Obama announced new technical assistance of $300 million per year starting in FY2016 for Power Africa, in addition to private sector pledges. Private sector and donor commitments totaled nearly $31.5 billion by mid-2015 and grew to $43 billion by early 2016. Congress has shown interest in Power Africa, with the Electrify Africa Act of 2015 signed into law to support U.S. and international efforts. The Electrify Africa Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-121) requires the President to submit a comprehensive strategy to expand African access to power, similar to Power Africa. While it did not provide new funding, its enactment indicates congressional support for continuing Power Africa-like activities. The Trump Administration's approach to funding Power Africa or similar activities under the Electrify Africa Act is yet to be determined. Trade Africa aims to boost U.S. private sector trade and investment in Africa, focusing initially on the East African Community with goals to increase exports to the U.S., double intra-EAC trade, and reduce transit times. The Obama Administration expanded the Trade Africa initiative to new partner countries and allocated $75 million for Trade and Investment Capacity Building in Africa to improve trade competitiveness. The Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) was initiated by President Obama in 2010. The Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) was initiated by President Obama in 2010 to develop young African leaders through exchange-based fellowships. The Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders brings participants to the US for a leadership course. President Obama pledged to expand the fellowship to 1,000 participants and announced online mentoring resources and Regional Leadership Centers. The State Department's FY2017 budget request includes $20 million for Educational and Cultural Exchange. The State Department's FY2017 budget request includes $20 million in Educational and Cultural Exchange (ECE) funding for YALI, with an additional $10 million in DA to support the RLCs in South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, and Senegal. The Security Governance Initiative (SGI) is a joint endeavor between the United States and six African partners focused on improving security sector governance and capacity. The Administration committed $65 million for SGI in FY2015 and $83 million per year thereafter, with no specified end-date. Country plans vary, focusing on enhancing security agencies, strategy formulation, planning, or interagency coordination. The State Department's FY2017 request includes $14 million in Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) account funding for SGI, with additional resources expected from other accounts. DOD Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds have been identified as another source of requested SGI funding. African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership (APRRP) aims to provide high-level military capabilities for African countries for peacekeeping deployments. The African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership (APRRP) provides military support for peacekeeping deployments in six countries: Senegal, Ghana, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. The U.S. has committed $110 million per year for APRRP, focusing on promoting peace, stability, and countering threats in Africa through security assistance programs. This includes military training, equipment programs, education initiatives, and law enforcement assistance, with a growing emphasis on building counterterrorism capacity. The United States has allocated significant funding through the CTPF to build counterterrorism capacity in Africa. U.S. military advisors work with African countries and regional organizations, and the U.S. plays a key role in U.N. Security Council deliberations on African conflicts. Additionally, the U.S. provides bilateral training, equipment, and logistical support to African militaries contributing troops to peacekeeping missions in the region. The United States supports African countries in building counterterrorism capacity through programs like ACOTA and GPOI. Efforts include providing advanced military capabilities, bolstering the AU's role in peacekeeping, and countering terrorism in Africa. The Obama Administration's National Security Strategy aims to disrupt and defeat Al-Qa'ida and its affiliates in Africa. The Obama Administration aimed to disrupt and defeat Al-Qa'ida and its affiliates in Africa by strengthening civilian bodies' capacity for security and countering violent extremism through governance, development, and law enforcement efforts. This included programs to build regional intelligence, military, law enforcement, and judicial capacities, as well as efforts to strengthen aviation, port, and border security, stem terrorist financing, and counter extremist ideologies. U.S.-led regional counterterrorism efforts in Africa include the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP). The Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP) and the Partnership for Regional East Africa Counterterrorism (PREACT) are U.S.-led initiatives established in 2005 and 2009, respectively. TSCTP focuses on military and police training, border security, justice sector support, counterradicalization, and public diplomacy efforts in North-West Africa, with a growing focus on countering Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin. PREACT, a smaller initiative in East Africa, promotes regional cooperation through multinational training events. Both programs are part of broader counterterrorism assistance efforts in Africa. The U.S. conducts regional security initiatives in Africa through programs like TSCTP and PREACT, focusing on training, border security, and countering extremist organizations like Boko Haram. DOD collaborates with local forces to enhance intelligence, logistics, and surveillance. AFRICOM's Theater Campaign Plan aims to neutralize Al Shabaab, combat extremism in the Sahel-Maghreb region, contain Boko Haram, and interdict illicit activities in the Gulf of Guinea. The AFRICOM's Theater Campaign Plan aims to neutralize Al Shabaab, combat extremism in the Sahel-Maghreb region, contain Boko Haram, interdict illicit activities in the Gulf of Guinea, and build African peacekeeping capacities. The plan emphasizes counterterrorism cooperation with African partners, international allies, and U.S. civilian agencies. The U.S. military takes direct action against terrorist threats in sub-Saharan Africa, including strikes on targeted terrorist group members in Somalia. The Obama Administration expanded its military operations in Somalia in 2015 to support Somali and AMISOM forces, in addition to countering Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab. The US provides military advisors, logistical, and intelligence support in Somalia and the Sahel region. Operation Enduring Freedom-Trans-Sahara focuses on overall security, not just counterterrorism. The DOD's FY2017 budget request focuses on overall security and cooperation in East Africa, supporting operations in Djibouti, the Horn of Africa, Afghanistan, Niger, and Cameroon. Additionally, DOD provides logistics and advisory support to African forces to counter the LRA in Central Africa. The DOD provides support to African forces, including irregular groups, for counterterrorism operations in Africa. U.S. forces also engage in joint exercises, disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and security sector reform in African countries. The 115th Congress is considering U.S. policies towards Africa and foreign aid funding levels in the context of the Trump Administration's budget blueprint. Congressional actions will shape U.S. policy towards Africa and specific countries, including responses to emerging crises like famine concerns in African countries. Emerging crises like famine concerns in African countries, conflicts in South Sudan and Mali, and transnational security threats may influence U.S. policy towards Africa."
