    "content": "The \"Prescription Drug Affordability Act of 1993\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings and purposes. The Congress finds that prescription drug price inflation disproportionately affects elderly and vulnerable populations, with prices rising significantly higher than general inflation rates between 1980 and 1991. Manufacturers continue to profit greatly from those who cannot afford their medications. The Congress finds that prescription drug price inflation disproportionately affects elderly and vulnerable populations who are unable to afford their medications. Elderly patients face high out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs, with the Federal Government providing substantial subsidies to the pharmaceutical industry. For example, in 1987, the industry received a tax credit of over $1.4 billion. The Congress enacted section 936 in 1976 to help Puerto Rico attract investments for job creation, but by 1987, the pharmaceutical industry received over half of the tax benefits while employing less than 20% of the workers. The Department of the Treasury will lose $15 billion in tax revenues from 1993 to 1997 due to section 936, with 17 of the 21 most prescribed drugs in the US in 1990 authorized for Puerto Rican manufacture. The Act aims to ensure affordable pharmaceutical products for the elderly, chronically ill, and all Americans. SEC. 3. REDUCTION IN POSSESSIONS TAX CREDIT FOR EXCESSIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INFLATION. Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a reduction for excessive pharmaceutical inflation for manufacturers of certain drugs. The credit for the taxable year will be reduced by the amount of excess credit over the manufacturer's wage base, multiplied by the sum of reduction percentages for each drug. The manufacturer's wage base for eligible employees in Puerto Rico is determined by the total wages paid during the taxable year for the manufacture of specific drugs. Eligible employees must be bona fide residents of Puerto Rico and subject to Puerto Rico income tax. The reduction percentage for drugs in a taxable year is determined by multiplying the sales percentage by the price increase percentage. The sales percentage is calculated by dividing the total sales of a drug by the manufacturer by the total sales of all single source drugs. The price increase percentage for any drug in a taxable year is calculated by multiplying 20 by the excess of the percentage increase in the average manufacturer's price for the drug over the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the taxable year is compared to the base year. Total sales only include domestic sales in the United States and exclude sales to related parties. The average manufacturer's price is the average price paid to the manufacturer by wholesalers or direct buyers. The term 'manufacturer' refers to any person engaged in the production or preparation of drugs, with the base taxable year being determined based on the last taxable year ending in 1991 or the first taxable year after the drug's marketing begins. The term 'manufacturer' includes activities related to the production, preparation, propagation, compounding, conversion, processing, packaging, repackaging, labeling, relabeling, or distribution of prescription drug products. It excludes wholesale distributors of drugs and retail pharmacies. The term 'manufacturer' includes various activities related to the production, preparation, compounding, and distribution of prescription drugs. Controlled groups of corporations are treated as one person for regulatory purposes. The term 'manufacturer' encompasses activities related to prescription drug production. Controlled groups of corporations are considered one entity for regulatory purposes, disregarding certain subsections. The term 'single source drug' refers to a drug produced or distributed under an original new drug application, while 'innovator multiple source drug' refers to a multiple source drug that meets specific criteria under the Social Security Act. The amendments made by this section to the Social Security Act apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993. Dosage forms and strengths of single source or innovator multiple source drugs are treated as separate drugs, and percentages are rounded to the nearest hundredth. SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL REVENUES. The additional revenues received in the Treasury by reason of section 936(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are allocated for deficit reduction and State prescription drug assistance programs for States with high elderly or poor populations."
