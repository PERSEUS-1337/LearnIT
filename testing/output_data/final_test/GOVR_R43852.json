    "content": "Senator Susan Collins introduced S. 534, the Immigration Rule of Law Act of 2015, to prohibit funding for most of the President's Immigration Accountability Executive Action. The bill would prevent funds from being used to grant federal benefits based on policy changes outlined in the executive action memoranda. Additionally, it would prioritize the removal of aliens convicted of serious crimes like domestic violence and child exploitation. The Immigration Rule of Law Act of 2015, introduced by Senator Susan Collins, aims to prohibit funding for President Obama's Immigration Accountability Executive Action. This action includes policies that disadvantage U.S. citizens and lawfully present aliens in favor of unauthorized aliens. The Executive Action includes various programs and initiatives to improve the U.S. immigration system, with the most controversial being the granting of deferred action to up to 5 million unauthorized aliens. The President announced executive action to grant deferred action to up to 5 million unauthorized aliens through various memoranda and fact sheets. The action was taken in response to immigration system problems, with debate over its legality and political motivations. The President's executive action to grant deferred action to up to 5 million unauthorized aliens has sparked debate over its legality and political motivations. Policymakers and immigration observers acknowledge the broken U.S. immigration system but disagree on solutions, including the admission of temporary and permanent immigrants and the funding levels for enforcement measures. Challenges include over 10 million unauthorized individuals, many of whom have lived in the country for over a decade. The broken U.S. immigration system faces challenges such as over 10 million unauthorized individuals, competition for skilled workers, a long queue for lawful permanent resident status, and border security issues. Some Members of Congress support comprehensive immigration reform to address these issues. The omnibus legislative approach to immigration reform contrasts with incremental revisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. In 2013, the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill (S. 744) that included increased border security, a path to legal status for unauthorized aliens, and reforms to permanent immigrant and temporary visas. The House took a different approach to immigration reform by acting on separate bills that increased border security, expanded employment verification, and revised nonimmigrant and immigrant visas. The President's \"Immigration Accountability Executive Action\" announced initiatives covering border security, interior enforcement, DACA, DAPA, parole, waivers, high-skilled foreign workers, immigrant integration, and visa system. The report reviews the President's executive action on immigration, focusing on high-skilled foreign workers, immigrant integration, visa system, labor protection, and crime victims. It discusses border security efforts by the United States Border Patrol since the 1970s, with a focus on controlling unauthorized migration. The USBP focuses on border regions between ports of entry, with various law enforcement personnel working alongside Border Patrol agents. This includes CBP officers, ICE agents, USCG personnel, federal law enforcement officers, state and local police, and sometimes the National Guard. CBP utilizes land-based, air, and marine surveillance assets, as well as fencing and infrastructure. Despite significant growth since 2004, the Obama Administration and DHS Secretary Johnson argue that the Southwest border is more secure than ever, although some Members of Congress and others call for increased security measures. Some Members of Congress and others have urged the Administration to enhance border security. The USBP is responsible for enforcing immigration and federal laws along the border, preventing unlawful entries, including terrorists, unauthorized aliens, and contraband. USBP patrols 7,500 miles of U.S. borders and coastal waters. Staffing has increased from 9,511 in FY2004 to 18,127 in FY2014, with fluctuations in between. The expansion of USBP personnel from 9,511 in FY2004 to 18,127 in FY2014 has coincided with a decline in apprehensions at the Southwest border. The Obama Administration and DHS Secretary Johnson have highlighted these numbers as signs of improved security. CBP and USBP have developed border security plans, such as the \"2012-2016 Border Patrol Strategic Plan,\" which focuses on strategic resource allocation and rapid response to border threats. The Arizona Joint Field Command (JFC) was established in 2011 to enhance coordination of border security efforts in the Arizona area of operations. It integrates Border Patrol with CBP's other components under a unified command structure, covering the entire state of Arizona and parts of California. The JFC includes over 6,700 CBP employees and aims to effectively meet the unique challenges faced in the region. DHS announced coordination measures that go beyond the Arizona JFC, with Secretary Johnson revealing border-security plans in May 2014. A \"Southern Border and Approaches Campaign\" planning effort aims to enhance security with specific outcomes, quantifiable targets, improved information sharing, sensor integration, and unified command structures. Campaign plans will address challenges in specific geographic areas, with three Joint Task Forces commissioned by Secretary Johnson on November 20, 2014. Unlike the Arizona JFC, these task forces will focus on specific areas and involve elements beyond CBP. Three Joint Task Forces were established by Secretary Johnson in November 2014 to enhance border security. These task forces would bring together personnel from CBP, U.S. Coast Guard, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and USCIS. Two task forces would be geographically based, covering the Southern maritime border and approaches, the southern land border, and the West Coast. The third task force, Joint Task Force Investigations, would focus on investigations in support of the other task forces. The memo outlined broad missions and objectives, with a 90-day timeframe to realign personnel and establish headquarters capabilities within each task force. The memo outlined a 90-day timeframe to realign personnel and establish headquarters capabilities within each Joint Task Force. Key questions remain about the authority, metrics for effectiveness, and jurisdictional disputes within the Task Forces. The Immigration and Nationality Act grants discretion to the Attorney General and DHS Secretary to remove foreign nationals. Since 1975, policy memorandums from INS and DHS have guided immigration officers in prioritizing categories of foreign nationals for removal. ICE ERO manages custody and removal procedures for removable aliens. DHS Secretary announced new enforcement priorities in 2014, effective January 2015. Secretary Johnson announced new enforcement priorities in 2014, effective January 5, 2015, including a review of the pay scale for immigration officers in ERO. The November 20, 2014 memorandum emphasized the need for prosecutorial discretion in enforcing immigration laws due to limited resources. The November 20, 2014 memorandum emphasized the need for prosecutorial discretion in enforcing immigration laws due to limited resources, such as deciding who to stop, question, arrest, and detain. The memorandum lays out enforcement priorities, including threats to national security, border security, and public safety, aliens engaged in terrorism or espionage, aliens apprehended at the border, aliens convicted of certain offenses, and aliens convicted of felonies. The November 20, 2014 memorandum outlined enforcement priorities for immigration laws, categorizing aliens into three priorities based on their criminal history and immigration status. Priority 1 includes aliens who pose a danger to national security, while Priority 2 consists of misdemeanants and new immigration violators. Priority 3 covers aliens with final removal orders issued after December 31, 2013. The memorandum revised enforcement priorities set in 2011 and 2012 by then-ICE Director John Morton. The November 20, 2014 memorandum revised enforcement priorities for immigration laws, categorizing aliens into three priorities based on criminal history and immigration status. The most significant change is that aliens with final removal orders issued before 2014 are no longer a priority if they are not criminals or national security concerns. Other changes include increasing the priority of aliens apprehended while attempting to illegally enter the country and specifying misdemeanor offenses that make an alien a focus for removal. The November 20, 2014 memorandum on enforcement priorities specifies that detention resources should be used to support enforcement priorities or for aliens subject to mandatory detention. ICE should not detain aliens known to be suffering from serious illness, disabled, elderly, pregnant, or not in the public interest to detain. Removal statistics are used to evaluate DHS's adherence to stated policies on enforcement priorities. DHS Secretary Johnson directed OIS, in collaboration with CBP, ICE, and USCIS, to collect and publish data on apprehensions, removals, and repatriations. Secure Communities, now known as interoperability, uses biometric data to screen for removable aliens during booking. It is not an enforcement unit. ICE is notified when fingerprints match an immigration record in IDENT. Aliens identified for removal are placed in removal proceedings by ICE agents. Secure Communities was discontinued but data interoperability between DOJ and DHS continues under a new name. Enforcement priorities have changed for removable aliens identified through this process. The new program, Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), focuses on enforcing actions against aliens convicted of specific crimes, unless they pose a national security risk. Immigration detainers are used to notify law enforcement agencies of ICE's interest in detaining individuals for removal. The Secure Communities program has raised legal questions regarding the use of immigration detainers. ICE is considering replacing detention requests with notification requests for pending releases. Some argue that the program has led to unfair treatment and improper arrests based on perceived immigration status. The DHS Secretary directs monitoring of state and local law enforcement agencies transferring foreign nationals to ICE. A recalibration of workforce and pay structure for ICE ERO personnel is announced as part of the President's executive action. ERO's enforcement strategy now focuses on investigations, identification, location, arrest, prosecution, and removal. Since 2002, DHS has focused on locating and removing criminal aliens and other national security risks. However, ERO's personnel structure lags behind, causing management challenges and low morale. The President's executive action in 2014 aimed to address personnel issues and prioritize the removal of fugitive aliens. The Administration is implementing a policy to focus DHS resources on higher enforcement priorities, including locating and removing fugitive aliens. It is unclear how many fugitive aliens would qualify for deferred action initiatives, and the impact of new enforcement priorities on alien removal remains to be seen. The new PEP program aims to issue fewer detainers with state and local law enforcement, focusing on higher priority cases. The effectiveness of the new requests for notification in transferring aliens to ICE custody is uncertain. The notification would transfer aliens to ICE custody, but not all jurisdictions accept ICE requests. Addressing unauthorized alien population in the US is a divisive issue in immigration reform. Proposals for unauthorized aliens to become lawful permanent residents have been debated in Congress, with various legalization proposals introduced but not enacted. Some bills target specific segments of the unauthorized population, like the DREAM Act for certain unauthorized aliens who arrived as children. The Obama Administration has taken steps to address the impact of provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act that make certain unauthorized aliens inadmissible to the US for a specified period of time. Through executive action, temporary immigration relief in the form of deferred action and parole has been provided for specific segments of the unauthorized population. The Obama Administration has implemented relief measures, such as deferred action and parole, for certain unauthorized individuals, including those brought to the US as children. DACA was established in 2012 to provide temporary relief for eligible individuals, similar to the DREAM Act criteria. The DACA initiative, established in 2012, provides temporary relief for eligible individuals who meet specific criteria, including continuous residence in the US since June 15, 2007, and being below age 31 on June 15, 2012. In 2014, an expansion of DACA eliminated the age requirement, advanced the residency start date to January 1, 2010, and extended the initial application period. The DHS memorandum expands DACA parameters to include parents of U.S. citizens or LPRs who meet specific criteria, such as continuous residence in the U.S. since before January 1, 2010, and not being an enforcement priority. USCIS will begin accepting applications under the expanded DACA guidelines in 90 days. The DHS memorandum expands DACA to include parents of U.S. citizens or LPRs who meet specific criteria, such as continuous residence in the U.S. since before January 1, 2010, and not being an enforcement priority. Applicants would apply for employment authorization at the same time as their deferred action applications. Grants of deferred action and work authorization would be valid for three years. USCIS will begin accepting applications within 180 days. Deferred action is also addressed in another DHS memorandum, granting it to unauthorized family members of U.S. military servicemembers and veterans. Parole allows aliens to enter the U.S. temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or public benefit. It does not constitute formal admission, and individuals granted parole are still considered applicants for admission. Parole-in-place is granted to unauthorized aliens already in the U.S., while advance parole allows travel abroad for parole consideration upon return. Certain family members of U.S. military servicemembers and veterans are eligible for parole-in-place under DHS policy. Certain family members of U.S. military servicemembers and veterans are eligible for parole-in-place, including spouses, children, and parents of active duty members and former members of the U.S. Armed Forces. The DHS Secretary directed USCIS to issue new policies on the use of parole-in-place for family members of U.S. citizens and LPRs seeking to enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. This directive aims to provide consistency regarding advance parole and addresses a BIA decision related to unlawful presence in the INA. The BIA decision in the Matter of Arrabally clarified that traveling abroad after receiving advance parole does not constitute a departure from the United States, impacting the 3- and 10-year bars on admissibility for individuals unlawfully present. This decision provides clarity on the use of parole-in-place for family members of U.S. military servicemembers and veterans seeking to enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. The DHS Secretary has requested legal guidance clarifying that leaving the U.S. with advance parole does not trigger the 3- and 10-year bars on admissibility. The process of becoming a lawful permanent resident (LPR) involves multiple steps, including filing an immigrant visa petition. Admissibility is a general requirement for obtaining a visa or lawful admission to the U.S. The process of becoming a lawful permanent resident (LPR) in the United States involves admissibility requirements under the INA. Adjustment of status is available for aliens who have been inspected and admitted, or paroled, into the country, and meet specified criteria. Unauthorized aliens who entered the United States without inspection are generally ineligible to adjust to LPR status under the main INA provision. They may need to travel to their home country to apply for a visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate once a visa number is available. The Department of State consular officer may find them inadmissible to the U.S. if they return home to apply for a visa. The visa application may result in inadmissibility to the United States for 3 or 10 years due to prior unlawful presence, making the applicant ineligible for a visa. However, a waiver may be available under certain circumstances, such as extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or parent. In 2013, USCIS implemented changes to the unlawful presence waiver application process for certain spouses and minor children. The rule establishes a provisional unlawful presence waiver for certain spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens. Beneficiaries of approved immigrant visa petitions can apply for a waiver if they demonstrate extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen spouse or parent. Recipients of the waiver can attend an immigrant visa interview abroad and gain lawful admission to the United States if approved. The DHS has discretionary authority to grant an unlawful presence waiver to certain family members of U.S. citizens or LPRs. The President's executive action directed USCIS to expand eligibility for provisional unlawful presence waivers to include adult children of U.S. citizens, and spouses and children of LPRs. To qualify, an applicant must show extreme hardship to a citizen or LPR spouse. The President's executive action expands eligibility for provisional unlawful presence waivers to include adult children of U.S. citizens and spouses and children of LPRs. The DHS Secretary directs USCIS to clarify factors for determining extreme hardship and consider criteria for a presumption of extreme hardship. This executive action offers different types of immigration relief to various unauthorized population subgroups, prioritizing family unity without granting lawful immigration status directly. Congressional action is required for conferring immigration status. The expansion of the provisional unlawful presence waiver program to specified relatives of U.S. citizens and LPRs could help facilitate acquisition of LPR status. Beneficiaries of approved immigrant petitions may apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver before leaving the U.S. to pursue LPR status abroad. This waiver can help individuals subject to a 3- or 10-year bar on admission to obtain a visa and gain LPR status upon admission to the U.S. The executive action on advance parole aims to address the 3- and 10-year bars for individuals seeking admission to the United States. It would make these bars inapplicable for those granted advance parole. The expansion of the military parole-in-place program would grant parole to eligible family members of U.S. citizens and LPRs enlisting in the U.S. Armed Forces. Parole allows for adjustment to LPR status if requirements are met. Additionally, the expansion of DACA eligibility and the introduction of a new deferred action process for unauthorized parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs could provide opportunities for them. The expansion of DACA eligibility and the introduction of a new deferred action process for unauthorized parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs could enable individuals to remain in the United States, work legally, and have protection from removal. They would be considered lawfully present during the period of deferred action and would not accrue unlawful presence for admissibility purposes. However, there is no pathway to lawful immigration status, and DHS has the discretion to terminate the grant of deferred action at any time. The United States faces policy tensions in admitting foreign workers with needed skills without impacting native workers. The current employment-based LPR visa system has five preference categories based on skills and family relationships. The employment-based LPR visa system in the United States has five preference categories based on skills and family relationships, including professionals with advanced degrees, skilled workers, special immigrants, and investors. Employers petition USCIS or the U.S. Department of Labor to hire prospective immigrant workers in these categories. Temporary visas for professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers are crucial for high-skilled permanent immigration to the United States. The number of visas issued for temporary employment-based workers has more than doubled in the past two decades, with a focus on H-1B visas for professional specialty workers and L visas for intracompany transferees. The DHS Secretary announced policy changes to attract and retain highly skilled immigrants, affecting various visa categories including LPR visas, OPT for foreign students, and intracompany transfers. Additionally, a final rule was proposed to incentivize employers to sponsor temporary workers for LPR status, with DOL reviewing related labor certification policies and regulations. The Department of State (DOS) allocates visas based on preference categories and per-country limits, allowing foreign nationals with approved petitions to adjust to LPR status or receive their LPR visa. Visa retrogression caused delays in visa processing for some applicants. USCIS and DOS are working together to address these issues. The Secretary directed USCIS to collaborate with DOS to ensure timely allocation of immigrant visas and improve the visa availability system. The INA prohibits entry of immigrants for labor unless certified by the Secretary of Labor. Labor certification applications for LPR status go through the PERM system. In FY2014, over 70,000 PERM applications were submitted by employers for foreign workers. Under the President's executive action, DOL would review the PERM program and relevant regulations to make it more responsive to changes in the national workforce. Employees with pending employment-based LPR visa applications may change jobs without jeopardizing their application if the new job is in a \"same or similar\" occupational classification. USCIS was directed to consider amending regulations to ensure that long-standing visa petitions are not invalidated when employees seek to change jobs or employers. The DHS Secretary directed USCIS to issue guidance on the definition of \"same or similar\" occupational classification for foreign nationals in employment-based preference categories. The national interest waiver for certain foreign nationals with advanced degrees or exceptional ability is underutilized, and the Administration aims to provide more guidance on its use. USCIS will clarify the circumstances for using the national interest waiver in the High Skilled Memorandum. Some critics have raised concerns about the limitations of the EB-5 visa category for not allowing applicants to petition for LPR status. In the 113th Congress, legislation was proposed to allow foreign nationals who received investment money to apply for LPR status. The DHS Secretary directed USCIS to create a program using parole authority to grant entry to high-skilled foreign nationals who have secured substantial financing from U.S. investors or show promise of innovation and job creation. The DHS Secretary directed USCIS to create a program using parole authority to grant entry to high-skilled foreign nationals who have secured substantial financing from U.S. investors or show promise of innovation and job creation. The grant of parole would allow these foreign nationals to pursue research, new ideas, and businesses in the United States, giving them time to secure temporary or permanent immigration statuses. Regulations for this program must include income and resource requirements, and those who receive parole would be ineligible for federal public benefits and premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act. The OPT program for F-1 students allows up to 29 months of work in STEM fields. The policy aims to strengthen ties with degree-granting institutions and ensure consistency with U.S. worker protections. Additionally, intracompany transferees can enter the U.S. on L visas for top-level personnel. The L visa allows multinational firms to transfer top-level personnel to the United States for up to seven years without needing to prove U.S. workers won't be affected. Some worry that L visa holders may displace American workers, while others see it as a substitute for the H-1B visa with fewer labor market protections. These concerns are often raised with outsourcing and IT firms employing L visa workers. The use of L visas by outsourcing and IT firms in the United States has raised concerns about displacing American workers and transferring high-skilled jobs overseas. The DHS Inspector General noted that many foreign workers qualify for specialized knowledge, leading to the displacement of American workers. The DHS Secretary directed USCIS to clarify the meaning of \"specialized knowledge\" for L visa qualification to ensure more consistent adjudication outcomes. The Administration aims to develop new policy guidance for high-skilled workers. The United States has no national policy or dedicated office for coordinating immigrant integration efforts across federal agencies, despite the increasing foreign-born population. Immigrant integration refers to the process of immigrants becoming integrated into American society socially, economically, culturally, and politically. Federal immigrant integration programs gain importance as the foreign-born population grows. The United States lacks a national policy or office to coordinate immigrant integration efforts across federal agencies. Federal programs, both direct and indirect, aim to assist immigrants in areas such as education, citizenship, and language acquisition. States and localities also face challenges in immigrant integration, including communication, English language learning, law enforcement, education, workforce development, adult literacy, and health access. Immigration advocates argue for the need for greater efficiency and integration among federal and state agencies, suggesting the establishment of an executive branch office for immigrant integration. The need for an executive branch office for immigrant integration is highlighted, with proposals for a federal office to coordinate efforts nationally. The President's executive action aims to establish a \"White House Task Force on New Americans\" to promote best practices and improve federal agencies' integration efforts. The White House Task Force on New Americans was tasked with providing recommendations for the integration of new Americans, including naturalization benefits such as voting rights and job access. Despite the advantages of U.S. citizenship, there are disparities in sponsoring relatives for immigration. Millions of LPRs eligible for naturalization in the United States face barriers such as residency requirements, good moral character, English proficiency, and passing a government exam. The $680 naturalization fee is debated for potentially discouraging citizenship acquisition. Immigration advocates propose more payment options and wider fee waiver information for naturalization fees. The President's executive action allows credit card payments and considers partial fee waivers for the $680 naturalization fee. Currently, waivers are only available to those with incomes below 150% of the federal poverty level. The President's creation of the White House Task force on New Americans is a departure from previous federal efforts on immigrant integration. It lacks funding from Congress and aims to coordinate federal efforts for immigrant integration. Some argue against taxpayer funding for integration programs, while others see value in investments like English language instruction. Expanding payment options for naturalization fees may boost rates among potential petitioners, but fee waivers could lead to revenue shortfalls for USCIS. The U.S. immigration system is criticized for being complex, redundant, time-consuming, and costly for applicants and businesses. The U.S. immigration system is criticized for being complex, redundant, time-consuming, and costly for applicants and businesses. Despite efforts to modernize USCIS, no major overhauls have been made to improve efficiency. The White House directed the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to recommend ways to improve the legal immigration system, modernize visa processing technology, and establish metrics for improvement. These reforms are critical for USCIS, which has been undergoing a modernization program to shift to a digital platform. The White House has directed the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to recommend reforms for the legal immigration system, including modernizing visa processing technology and establishing metrics for improvement. These changes are crucial for USCIS, especially with the potential implementation of the President's executive action. Seeking recommendations to enhance the immigration system could help address challenges faced by end users and improve labor protections for foreign workers in the United States. The Department of Labor enforces minimum wage and overtime pay for foreign workers in the US, focusing on low-wage industries with many immigrant employees. ICE investigates immigration violations related to hiring unauthorized aliens. DHS issued new guidance in 2009 targeting criminal aliens and employers breaking immigration laws. In December 2011, DHS and DOL signed a revised memorandum of understanding to coordinate worksite enforcement actions targeting criminal aliens and employers who hire illegal workers. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of DHS's worksite enforcement efforts. DOL announced the creation of an inter-agency working group to enforce federal labor, employment, and immigration laws, protecting all workers regardless of legal status. The creation of an inter-agency working group aims to ensure that immigration and employment policies do not deter workers from cooperating with law enforcement, prevent misuse of federal enforcement authorities in labor disputes, and ensure consistent application of labor, employment, and immigration laws. This initiative, part of the President's executive action, lacks congressional funding but aims to improve wages and worksite conditions for vulnerable workers. The U and T nonimmigrant statuses are for victims of specified crimes and severe trafficking, respectively. Certification from law enforcement is required for U status, while optional for T status but serves as important evidence. The Department of Labor announced plans to improve wages and worksite conditions for vulnerable workers. In early 2015, the Department of Labor (DOL) announced it would provide law enforcement certification to trafficking victims applying for T status and expand certification for victims of extortion, forced labor, and foreign labor contracting fraud. DOL's Wage and Hour Division enforces labor laws and assists with human trafficking investigations, potentially encountering trafficking victims. Advocates believe DOL's enforcement of wage and hour laws could help reveal trafficking and crime victims. The President's Immigration Accountability Executive Action, announced in November 2014, aims to alleviate uncertainty for unauthorized aliens through deferred action and other provisions. It also seeks to revise enforcement priorities and improve strategic initiatives in various immigration policy areas. The effectiveness of this executive action in prompting Congress to pass permanent legislative solutions is uncertain, especially in the face of potential resistance. USCIS, the agency responsible for implementing parts of the action, may rely on additional fee revenue from deferred action petitions. Some agencies are using deferred action petitions to implement objectives, while others are trying to make changes through increased coordination and innovative use of existing resources."
