    "content": "The \"Private Property Rights Protection Act of 2005\" prohibits eminent domain abuse by states. The \"Private Property Rights Protection Act of 2005\" prohibits states from using eminent domain for economic development if they receive Federal economic development funds, with violators being ineligible for such funds for 2 years. The \"Private Property Rights Protection Act of 2005\" states that states cannot use eminent domain for economic development if they receive Federal funds. Violators must return property taken unlawfully and repair any damage to remain eligible for funds. The Federal Government is prohibited from using eminent domain for economic development. Additionally, individuals have a private right of action. Any property owner can bring a lawsuit in Federal or State court for violations of the Act, with the burden on the defendant to prove the taking is not for economic development. Relief can include injunctions. The action must be brought after condemnation proceedings for economic development use of the property. The Act allows property owners to bring a lawsuit for violations, with the burden on the defendant to prove the taking is not for economic development. The lawsuit must be brought within seven years following condemnation proceedings. The court can award attorneys' fees and expert fees to the prevailing plaintiff. SEC. 5. NOTIFICATION BY ATTORNEY GENERAL. The Attorney General must notify each State's chief executive officer of the text of the Act and property owners' rights within 30 days of enactment. Within 120 days, a list of Federal laws distributing economic development funds will be compiled and updated annually, shared with State executives, and made available online. The United States Department of Justice will publish a notice in the Federal Register and online, informing property owners of their rights under the Act for the taking of private property for public use. SEC. 6. REPORT. The Attorney General must annually report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate on States or political subdivisions violating the Act through eminent domain. The report must detail private rights of action taken and States losing Federal economic development funds due to violations. The Attorney General must report annually to Congress on States or political subdivisions violating eminent domain laws and losing Federal funds. Discussions must include instances of violations being cured. Sense of Congress regarding rural America. The Congress recognizes the importance of property rights, especially in rural lands, for the agriculture industry and economic growth. Rural lands are not high tax revenue-generating properties, and owners need long-term certainty for investment decisions. The Congress acknowledges the significance of property rights, particularly in rural areas, for agriculture and economic development. Eminent domain abuse poses a threat to property rights, including rural landowners, and Congress should safeguard these rights. Farmland and rural property takings for economic development jeopardize liberty, rural economies, and the U.S. economy. The use of eminent domain to take rural private property for private commercial uses will impact existing irrigation and reclamation projects. This can force activities from private property onto public lands, overburdening infrastructure and reducing enjoyment for citizens. Congress must protect the property rights of rural Americans against eminent domain abuse. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the definition of \"economic development\" involves taking private property without the owner's consent and transferring it to another private entity for commercial purposes or to enhance tax revenue, employment, or economic well-being. This excludes transferring property to public ownership or entities that provide public access like roads or railroads. The curr_chunk outlines various uses of public property, including for transportation, flood control, leasing to private entities, acquiring abandoned property, and clearing defective titles. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the use of public property, including clearing defective titles, taking private property for public utility, and redeveloping brownfield sites. Federal economic development funds refer to federal funds distributed to states for economic improvement. The term \"State\" includes states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other US territories. SEC. 9. SEVERABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\nThe provisions of this Act are severable. If any provision is found unconstitutional, it will not affect the rest of the Act. The Act will take effect in the first fiscal year after enactment, excluding projects with ongoing condemnation proceedings.\n\nSEC. 10. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\nThe US policy supports private property ownership and protects property owners' rights.\n\nSEC. 11. BROAD CONSTRUCTION. SEC. 11. BROAD CONSTRUCTION. This Act favors broad protection of private property rights under the Constitution. No State or political subdivision can use eminent domain over property of a religious or nonprofit organization due to its status, or risk losing Federal economic development funds for 2 years if violated. The Federal Government is prohibited from using eminent domain over property of a religious or nonprofit organization based on its status. If violated, Federal economic development funds will be withheld for 2 years, and any distributed funds must be returned or reimbursed. The Federal Government must review and report on regulations related to eminent domain within 180 days. Congress emphasizes the need to prevent unfair property takings from Hurricane Katrina survivors. Attest: JEFF TRANDAHL, Clerk. By Gerasimos C. Vans, Deputy Clerk."
