    "content": "The \"Men's Health Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. The findings section of the Act highlights important information related to men's health. The Congress finds that risks to men's health are increasing due to lack of education and preventative care, impacting not only men but also their families, employers, and governments. The gap in life expectancy between men and women has widened, with prostate cancer being a common diagnosis. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the US, accounting for 33% of cases. It is more prevalent in men over 65 and African American men have double the incidence compared to white men. Additionally, lung cancer and testicular cancer also pose significant risks to men's health. In 2007, 390 men will die of testicular cancer. Studies show women are more likely than men to seek medical attention. Early detection through screenings can increase survival rates. The ratio of men to women reduces to 85 to 100 by age 65. The growing disparity in male health suggests that declining health in men increases the risk of women becoming widows in retirement. Educating men, families, and healthcare providers on early detection of male health issues can reduce mortality rates and improve overall well-being. Regular medical exams, screenings, exercise, and healthy eating habits can save lives. Establishing an Office of Men's Health is necessary to investigate and promote men's health. Establishment of Office of Men's Health under SEC. 1711 in Title XVII of the Public Health Service Act to investigate and promote men's health. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish the Office of Men's Health to coordinate and promote men's health in the United States. The office will conduct programs to improve men's health and facilitate coordination among relevant agencies. A report on the office's activities is required within two years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish the Office of Men's Health to promote men's health in the US. Within two years of the Act's enactment, a report on the office's activities, including findings on men's health, will be submitted to Congress."
