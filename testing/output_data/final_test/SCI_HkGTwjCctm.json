    "content": "Many real-world time series have changepoints where the system's structure or parameters change, indicating critical events. Existing methods for changepoint detection face challenges when changes cannot be modeled using predefined metrics or occur gradually at multiple time-scales. To address this, a new deep neural network architecture called pyramid recurrent neural network (PRNN) is proposed, which can efficiently identify abrupt and gradual changes at multiple scales by incorporating wavelets and pyramid analysis techniques. Through experiments, PRNN is shown to detect changes with higher accuracy. Changepoints are crucial to detect in various fields like medicine, finance, and climate science. They signify important events or changes that impact decision-making. Changepoint detection can be challenging in multivariate timeseries due to complex patterns and interdependencies among variables. The pyramid recurrent neural network (PRNN) outperforms existing methods in detecting abrupt and gradual changes accurately, even at novel timescales. Various methods for changepoint detection (CPD) have been proposed, including parametric and nonparametric methods. Parametric methods make strong assumptions about data distributions, while nonparametric methods rely heavily on parameters or kernels. A nonparametric CPD method has been suggested to handle data from different domains, but like many others, it can only detect abrupt changes. In real-world applications, changes may be gradual and occur over different durations. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been utilized for time series forecasting and classification due to their ability to automatically learn functions. However, DNNs typically require a large amount of training data to detect patterns reliably. To address this limitation, a novel DNN architecture for changepoint detection (CPD) is proposed, aiming to be scale-invariant and generalize beyond observed timescales. The proposed DNN architecture for changepoint detection (CPD) includes a trainable wavelet layer and Pyramid recurrent neural networks (PRNN) on top of a multi-channel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It can detect short-term and long-term temporal patterns, abrupt to gradual changepoints, and is scale invariant. This model may have broader applications in time series analysis. Bayesian techniques like BOCPD and nonparametric models such as BID39 and BID44 are used for changepoint detection in time series analysis. GGMs are introduced for handling multivariate time series by modeling correlations using multivariate Gaussian. Model-free approaches have emerged for changepoint detection in multivariate time series, including density ratio estimation methods, kernel methods, and techniques using custom divergence functions. However, covariance matrix based methods have limitations when the change point does not significantly affect the covariance matrix. Statistics-based methods like MMD and Hotelling T-square also have their own limitations. Model-free approaches for changepoint detection in multivariate time series have limitations such as reliance on specific kernels or parameters, prior information dependency, and complexity for large sample sizes. Some methods are designed for detecting gradual changes, while others focus on anomaly detection. Our approach aims to be scale-invariant, capable of handling short and long-term temporal patterns without the need for re-engineering. Our proposed approach for changepoint detection in multivariate time series is not limited to binary classification and can be repurposed for anomaly detection by training with a one-class loss. Deep neural networks, such as CNNs, offer a promising solution for recognizing complex patterns without the need for feature engineering. Deep neural networks like CNNs and RNNs can recognize complex patterns in images and sequences, respectively. CNNs have shift-invariance, while RNN variants like LSTM can also learn shift-invariance. However, the fixed resolution of these architectures makes them sensitive to scale changes, posing challenges for changepoint detection methods. The limitations of CNNs and RNNs in recognizing gradual changes and long-term dependencies have led to the proposal of a new architecture, PRNN, that combines both CNN and RNN while addressing scale invariance. Dilated convolutions have also been used to allow long-term dependency modeling in CNNs. The PRNN architecture combines CNN and RNN to address scale invariance and long-term dependencies. Previous methods like LSTMs and GRUs have limited memory space, while Skip RNNs risk skipping temporal dependencies. Recent approaches have augmented RNNs with memory or stack, but lack scale-invariance. The PRNN models infinitely long sequences efficiently. The PRNN architecture, a new class of deep learning architectures, combines CNN and RNN to address scale invariance and long-term dependencies in multivariate time series. It models infinitely long sequences with its multi-scale RNN, forming a stack of memory cells in an arbitrary number of levels. This allows for storing longer dependencies at no additional computational cost, while preventing the loss of details in the short term. Previous methods like LSTMs and GRUs have limited memory space, while Skip RNNs risk skipping temporal dependencies. Frameworks like Feature pyramid networks and wavelet CNN cannot directly model temporal dependencies in multivariate time series for change point detection. Deep Wavelet Neural Networks (DWNN) utilize a trainable wavelet layer to convert time series into multi-scale feature maps. These maps are processed in parallel by CNN streams with shared weights, followed by a multi-scale RNN to capture long-term dependencies. The PRNN output is used for change detection with a binary classifier, addressing the scale invariance limitation of CNNs. The Neural Wavelet Layer (NWL) is a set of multi-scale convolutions applied in parallel on input time series. It uses a filter bank technique for discrete wavelet transform, producing multiple feature maps forming a pyramid of convolution responses. This process involves convolving the signal with separating convolutional kernels, outputting high-pass responses, and down-sampling low-pass responses for each iteration to generate an output pyramid. The Neural Wavelet Layer (NWL) utilizes trainable kernels to compute lowpass and highpass responses iteratively, generating a pyramid of convolution responses. The hyperparameter k can be chosen through cross-validation to control the number of iterations in the wavelet transform. The Neural Wavelet Layer (NWL) uses trainable kernels to compute lowpass and highpass responses iteratively, creating a pyramid of convolution responses. The hyperparameter k, selected through cross-validation, determines the receptive field size and computation complexity. NWL can encode input with multiple granularities simultaneously, unlike a conventional convolution layer. The Neural Wavelet Layer (NWL) can encode data at different levels of abstraction simultaneously, unlike a CNN. It can be used as a layer in a deep network with other neural layer types like convolutional layers. The input to a wavelet layer can be the output of a convolutional layer, or vice versa by applying convolution on each level of the wavelet pyramid. A Deep Wavelet Neural Network (DWNN) applies convolution on each level of the wavelet pyramid to produce a pyramid-shaped output. The network consists of a Neural Wavelet Layer (NWL) followed by parallel streams of CNN with shared parameters. The CNN has multiple layers with down-sampling strides and feature maps, applied in parallel on each level of the NWL pyramid. The output of the DWNN is a pyramid-shaped response. The DWNN generates a multi-scale pyramid of sequential feature maps encoding short-term temporal patterns. Conventional RNNs struggle with scale invariance and learning gradual patterns, leading to the introduction of a hierarchically connected PRNN to address these limitations. The proposed network, PRNN, scans the multi-scale output of a DWNN and encodes temporal patterns at different scales using a Pyramid Recurrent Layer (PRL). The recurrent state at each level and time is calculated using a nonlinear activation function and trainable parameters. The proposed Pyramid Recurrent Layer (PRL) in the PRNN network utilizes trainable parameters to define a linear transformation of states at different levels. This hierarchical structure allows for the detection of both abrupt and gradual patterns simultaneously, unlike conventional RNNs. By adjusting data granularity, long-term dependencies can be captured without losing details. The proposed Pyramid Recurrent Layer (PRL) in the PRNN network utilizes trainable parameters to define a linear transformation of states at different levels, allowing for the detection of both abrupt and gradual patterns simultaneously. This hierarchical structure enables the model to capture long-term dependencies without losing details. The PRNN is composed of a DWNN and a PRL, where an input time series is transformed into a pyramid-shaped representation and fed into the PRL for classification tasks. The PRNN network utilizes RNN cells at the lowest level of the pyramid to produce detection scores with high granularity. The detection score at each time step is calculated using trainable parameters and optimized using stochastic gradient descent. PRNN outperforms conventional deep learning baselines in detecting abrupt and gradual changes accurately, making it suitable for activity recognition. We create a synthetic dataset with 2000 time series, each with 12 variables and 8192 time steps. Each series has 4 changepoints with shifts in mean, varying in speed. The data is split for training and testing, and also by scale for robustness testing. The OPPORTUNITY dataset consists of sensor recordings from participants performing daily activities, with 72 sensors capturing 10 modalities. Activities are manually labeled with 18 types, and transitions between activities are considered changes for CPD. Ground truth is provided with temporal annotations. The Bee Waggle Dance data includes videos of honey bees performing waggle dances, with each frame labeled as \"turn left\", \"turn right\", or \"waggle dance.\" Transitions between activities are considered change points for analysis. The method is tested on \"sequence 1\" of the bee data, training on the first 256 frames. The proposed method is tested on \"sequence 1\" of the bee data, training on the first 256 frames. A CNN is used to predict detection scores for changes, with max-pooling layers reducing temporal granularity. An RNN is then applied to the CNN output, maintaining the same granularity. The proposed method involves using a DWNN followed by a Pyramid Recurrent Layer to fuse levels of the pyramid. A Skip RNN BID5 is used in place of a conventional RNN cell to test for efficiency while maintaining performance. All deep-learning baselines share a core CNN architecture with additional modules built on top. The architecture of the core CNN includes feature maps and pooling stride z. The core CNN architecture includes feature maps and pooling stride z, followed by max-pooling and ReLU activation. Different wavelet levels and kernel sizes were used for different datasets. Models were trained using Adam with early stopping to prevent overfitting. At test time, the models predict a sequence of detection scores. Changepoints are detected using non-maximum suppression with a sliding window. To detect changepoints, non-maximum suppression with a sliding window of length \u03c9 is applied to the detection scores, filtering maximum values with a threshold. AUC is evaluated by iterating over this threshold. Hyperparameter \u03c9 is tuned for each method separately using cross-validation. Real world datasets (Bee data and OPPORTUNITY data) are more challenging due to diverse changepoints formed by transitions between activity types. Multitask learning is used to address this, training the model to detect changes and classify activity by adjusting the output dimension of the last fully connected layer. Multitask learning improves results for all baselines by incorporating auxiliary information such as activity type. For GGM, a full covariance model is used to capture feature correlations. Evaluation is done on synthetic and real-world datasets using precision, recall, and AUC. A tolerance parameter \u03b7 is set to determine correct detections of changepoints. The text discusses the evaluation of changepoint detection models using precision, recall, and AUC metrics. Different train/test splits are used to demonstrate extrapolation capabilities of the models. The scale-variant split challenges the models to extrapolate patterns to unseen scales, showing the importance of scale-invariance. The results show that models like CNN and RCN struggle in parts when extrapolating to new scales. The evaluation of changepoint detection models shows that CNN and RCN struggle when extrapolating to new scales, leading to a decrease in AUC performance. DWNN performs better due to its wavelet layer and shared parameters across scales, resulting in a lower performance drop compared to other methods. In comparison to CNN and RCN, DWNN, PRNN, and PRNN-S show higher AUC performance in recognizing a mix of scales. DWNN outperforms PRNN and PRNN-S in the train on gradual and test on abrupt experiment, indicating the effectiveness of the added wavelet layer. Recurrent architectures are generally less effective for extreme generalization, with DWNN demonstrating high performance in modeling both gradual and abrupt changes in time series. In real-world scenarios, a mix of scales is common in both training and testing data. PRNN is most accurate in these cases, especially for recognizing gradual changes. The work can be adapted to detect segments instead of specific points, improving detection accuracy. CNN has a higher false positive rate and may miss changes compared to PRNN. Gaps between detected changes and ground truth are acceptable for gradual changes. In the OPPORTUNITY dataset, PRNN outperforms other methods in detecting changes accurately. PRNN-S has lower AUC than PRNN and DWNN, possibly due to skipping important information. GGM performs the lowest as an unsupervised method. When the tolerance is 64, PRNN achieves 81% AUC, while other methods achieve lower scores. The five deep learning methods, PRNN, PRNN-S, RCN, DWNN, and CNN, took varying amounts of time to train on the OPPORTUNITY dataset. Recurrent methods like PRNN and PRNN-S took longer due to backpropagation through time. DWNN outperformed RCN in most cases and was faster to train. PRNN showed superior performance with an AUC of 93% when the value of \u03b7 was no less than 5. When the tolerance is 64 (around 2 seconds, \u03b7 = 2 6 = 64), PRNN achieves 93% AUC while PRNN-S, RCN, and CNN respectively achieve 64%, 84%, 78%. PRNN-S for Bee Waggle Dance data has a higher maximum AUC of 64% compared to 51% on the OPPORTUNITY dataset. Changes in honey bee activities have a lower impact on PRNN-S detection performance due to abrupt activity changes. Lowering the tolerance from 32 to 16 significantly drops the AUC of RCN. The AUC of RCN drops significantly from 84% to 18% when the tolerance is lowered from 32 to 16. PRNN is less sensitive to this parameter and more reliable for real-world cases. A new class of DNNs is proposed that are scale-invariant and can detect abrupt to gradual changepoints in multimodality time series. The model combines CNNs with trainable Wavelet layers to recognize short-term multi-scale patterns and a pyramid-shaped RNN to model long-term patterns and fuse multiscale information. This approach reduces the amount of training data required to learn from changes. The proposed method for detecting changepoints in multimodality time series using scale-invariant DNNs shows quick detection with high reliability in real-world applications. Future work will address challenges like noisy data and missing labels by incorporating robustness and semi-supervised learning techniques. AUC results for synthetic data are evaluated using non-maximum suppression with a sliding window and threshold filtering. The tolerance parameter determines the closeness required for a detected change to be considered correct. The results of experiments on synthetic data and Opportunity and Bee Waggle Dance datasets are shown in different tables. Detected changepoints must match true changepoints within a certain time step for correct detection."
