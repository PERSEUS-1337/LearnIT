It associates visual information with textual input to generate response text, showing improved sentence generation compared to models without this association. Our proposed model effectively associates visual information with sentences for sentence generation. The encoder-decoder model can extract knowledge from conversations and generate responses based on learned dialogues. However, existing models like NCM struggle with responding to input texts requiring visual information. The text discusses the importance of incorporating visual information in generating more specific and useful texts. Studies have shown that adding image features to the encoder-decoder model can improve translation accuracy. The text proposes an Associative Conversation Model that integrates visual information with text to generate responses in dialogue systems without directly inputting images. This method aims to improve response generation by associating input text with visual information. The research introduces a model that generates visual information related to textual information in dialogue systems without directly inputting images. The model can generate response texts with useful information by associating visual information with input text, improving response generation in dialogue systems. The model generates visual information from input text in dialogue systems to improve response generation. Visual association is performed to generate corresponding visual information, which is then fused with textual information to create a response text. The approach involves generating visual information from input text in dialogue systems to enhance response generation. A mechanism is used to create visual context vectors from text, which are then fused with textual information to generate a response text. The associative conversation model uses an RNN to generate visual context vectors from textual context vectors. LSTMs are used for the textual encoder, decoder, and associative encoder. The model learns dialogue sentences by fusing textual and visual context vectors. Prior training includes a multimodal encoder-decoder model and training of the associative encoder for predicting visual context vectors. The associative conversation model involves training an encoder-decoder model to predict visual context vectors from textual context vectors. The learning process includes three steps: extracting context vectors between textual and visual information, training two models in advance, and finally learning the Associative Conversation Model. The model uses LSTMs for the textual encoder, decoder, and associative encoder to generate dialogue sentences by fusing textual and visual context vectors. The Associative Conversation Model involves training an encoder-decoder model to predict visual context vectors from textual context vectors. The model goes through three steps: extracting context vectors, training the associative encoder, and generating response text. The model uses LSTMs for encoding and decoding to create dialogue sentences by combining textual and visual context vectors. The Associative Conversation Model uses an associative encoder in the fusion layer to train the decoder with attention. Only the decoder, attention, and fusion layer are trained in this model using utterance text, video, and response text data from TV programs. Videos are used instead of images to capture actions expressed in the texts. The dataset is created from TV news programs with utterance texts, corresponding videos, and response texts extracted from closed caption texts. The closed caption texts and corresponding images from TV news programs were extracted for the dataset. The utterance text and video are represented by sequences of words and image features. Image features from a pre-trained CNN (VGG16 BID11) were used. The input to the models consists of word vectors. The model used is a multimodal encoder-decoder model. The multimodal encoder-decoder model consists of textual and visual encoders, and a decoder with attention mechanism. The context vectors are obtained from input text and video, fused to generate a response text using the attention mechanism. The attention mechanism extracts context vectors reflecting parts of the sequence corresponding to the words in the response text. The multimodal encoder-decoder model involves generating textual and visual context vectors with correspondence relations. An associative encoder predicts visual context vectors from textual ones. The decoder determines which information to focus on in the dialogue. The fused context vector in the multimodal encoder-decoder model determines how strongly textual and visual information should be referred to. Weight matrices are used to learn this relationship, and the fused context vector is passed to the decoder for predicting the next word. The fusion layer combines parameters W txt, W vis, and biases b c. The loss function for the associative encoder involves parameters of the Decoder, fusion layer, Attention FNN, textual encoder, and parameters of the decoder. The multimodal encoder-decoder model utilizes FORMULA6, \u039b, and H parameters for textual and visual encoding. The model is trained using teacher forcing to extract context vectors. The visual associative encoder is then trained to predict visual context vectors from textual context vectors using an RNN. The loss function involves parameters from various components of the model. The associative conversation model utilizes LSTM for learning long-term dependence and replaces the visual encoder with the associative encoder. The model blends textual and visual information to generate response texts. The associative conversation model uses LSTM for long-term dependence and replaces the visual encoder with the associative encoder. In step 3, the visual context vector is predicted from the textual context vector by the associative encoder, and the decoder, attention, and fusion layer are re-trained due to the different properties of the associative visual context. The loss function for the associative encoder is defined in this step. The model in step 3 uses an associative encoder to generate response texts by re-training parts other than the encoding of the context vector. Data from TV drama subtitles and corresponding videos were used for learning. Subtitles were segmented into sentences, and a pair of sentences formed a dialogue. The video frames were processed using a convolutional neural network to extract image features. The study utilized VGG16 for the convolutional neural network and extracted image features from the last pooling layer. Data from Japanese TV news broadcasts was used, with 38K dialogues and 19K vocabulary words. The comparison was made between the Associative Conversation Model and a model without association. Both models were trained on the same dialogue sentences to investigate the effect of association on generating dialogue responses. The effectiveness of visual information for response generation was also analyzed by visualizing associated objects. The study found that associating visual information effectively generates sentences with useful information. The model used single layer LSTMs for encoding and decoding, with specific dimensions set for each layer. Different optimization techniques were used in each step of the model development. In step 3 of the model development, the architecture included a textual encoder, decoder, and associative encoder. Specific dimensions were set for each layer, with Adagrad used for optimization. The weights of the decoder and attention were not updated, and the associative encoder weights remained unchanged. The baseline model utilized single layer LSTMs for encoding and decoding. The model architecture included a textual encoder, decoder, and associative encoder with specific dimensions set for each layer. Adagrad was used for optimization. The evaluation of generated sentences was based on fluency, coherence, context-dependence, and informativeness, with scores given for each criterion. The proposed model (Seq2Seq-Assc) achieved 8.109% accuracy on news test data, compared to 8.228% for the baseline model (Seq2Seq). Rule-1 in NTCIR 13 STC-2 Japanese subtask BID10 involves calculating Accuracy Acc G @k based on a specific equation. The evaluation data consisted of 50 utterances of news subtitles and dialogue sentences. The evaluation results are shown in TAB2, comparing the proposed model (Seq2Seq-Assc) with the baseline model (Seq2Seq). The proposed model (Seq2Seq-Assc) outperformed the baseline model (Seq2Seq) in accuracy for news data compared to dialogue data. This difference is attributed to the challenge of generating fluent responses in dialogue sentences. The proposed method also showed higher accuracy in generating responses with usefulness and context dependency. The baseline model had higher accuracy for dialogue sentences but almost 0.0 accuracy for both models in generating news sentences. Figure 3 displays the texts generated by both models from the test data. The proposed model outperformed the baseline in generating texts with more useful information, as shown in Figure 3. For example, the model generated a specific weather forecast with the word \"snowy\" for a given input sentence. This word was associated with the image of snow, highlighting the model's ability to generate contextually relevant information. The proposed model demonstrated superior performance compared to the baseline by generating more specific and useful information. The model associated visual information effectively, resulting in sentences with contextually relevant details. The proposed model successfully associated visual information related to the input sentence, generating contextually relevant details. The image with the highest similarity to the associative visual context was visualized, showing the effectiveness of the model in generating specific and useful information. The Japanese championships participants aim for four consecutive championships in women's singles, with expectations of snowy and windy conditions. The model successfully generates response texts with useful information, such as associating a snow scene with the word \"snowy\" based on visual information. The model successfully generates response texts by associating visual information with words, such as generating \"snowy\" from a snow scene. It can also associate visual information with specific topics, like generating \"gold medal\" from a scene of a skating player winning in the \"Skating Championships\". Attention weights show how words are generated, with focus on relevant information. The model successfully generates response texts by associating visual information with words, such as generating \"snowy\" from a snow scene. It can also associate visual information with specific topics, like generating \"gold medal\" from a scene of a skating player winning in the \"Skating Championships\". Multiple examples show successful associations between input sentences and images. However, there are still some issues with visual information being associated with different topics than the input sentence. The proposed model can improve by increasing training data and using general dialogue sentences for re-learning. This approach allows for more efficient training and better responses in colloquial tones. In studies on conversation models using multimedia data, BID6 utilized deep neural network models trained on social media data to enhance response generation quality. While previous studies focused on Image-Grounded Conversations, our approach considers conversations without images. Recent research has shown that incorporating image features into translation models, such as BID1, BID3, BID7, BID8, and BID13, improves translation accuracy. Our approach, similar to BID13 and BID3, utilizes images during training to enhance translation quality. The model used by BID3 incorporates a mechanism to generate latent variables for translation. They employ a multitask learning model that improves translation performance by inputting text and outputting text and image features. Their approach includes an attention-based encoder-decoder structure with two decoders for text and image features. In contrast, our approach extends this by using a video sequence of image features for training. Our model extends the BID3 approach by incorporating a fusion layer to extract knowledge from noisy data, focusing on dialogue tasks rather than translation. Unlike BID3, our model is not a multitask learning model and receives input of visual information, allowing for attention to visual information during training. The Associative Conversation Model proposed in this study integrates visual information with text input to generate responses in dialogue systems. Experimental results show that associating visual information with input texts improves the quality of response texts compared to models without this association. The method can generate visual information related to textual information through end-to-end learning, making it valuable for constructing text-based dialogue systems. The proposed method integrates visual information with text input to improve response quality in dialogue systems. Examples show how visual association affects sentence generation, such as associating \"Yokozuna\" with the wrong person in an image. The model can generate visual information related to text through end-to-end learning, valuable for constructing dialogue systems. The proposed model integrates visual information with text input to improve response quality in dialogue systems. It can generate visual information related to text through end-to-end learning. The model associated an image of a person riding a bicycle likely to fall over due to a strong wind, generating words like \"traffic\" and \"windstorm\". Tomorrow morning, isolated snowstorms are expected around the Japan Sea side of western Japan and eastern Japan, with vigilance necessary for windstorms and high waves. Tomorrow morning, it will be sunny in many places from western Japan to eastern Japan, with a warning about windstorms, heavy blizzards, and snowdrift affecting traffic."
