    "content": "The Act titled \"Consolidation Prevention and Competition Promotion Act of 2017\" aims to prevent consolidation and promote competition. Congress finds that competitive markets are crucial for ensuring opportunity, quality, and choice for consumers and businesses. Competition fosters small business growth, reduces economic inequality, and spurs innovation. Market concentration leading to anticompetitive behavior hinders entrepreneurship, depresses wages, and increases economic inequality. Additionally, undue market concentration can consolidate political power, undermining democracy in the United States. The anticompetitive effects of market power include higher prices, lower quality, reduced choice, and innovation. Monopsony power allows firms to force suppliers to lower prices, impacting business opportunities and product quality. Horizontal, vertical, and conglomerate mergers can harm competition. Unprecedented consolidation is reducing competition. Since 2008, there has been over $10 trillion in mergers and acquisitions in the United States, leading to a 50% increase in reviews by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The Clayton Act is crucial in preventing anticompetitive mergers, but recent court decisions and enforcement policies have weakened its effectiveness. The purpose of this Act is to address anticompetitive harms by focusing on the impact of mergers on quality, choice, innovation, competition, entry barriers, and monopsony power. It aims to restore the original intent of the Clayton Act and eliminate the requirement to prove harmful effects of a merger to a near certainty. The Act aims to clarify that mergers violating the Clayton Act may lower quality, reduce choice, innovation, exclude competitors, increase entry barriers, or raise prices. It also establishes that harm to competition need not be substantial, but more than de minimis, and includes the term \"monopsony\" to address acquisitions creating such a situation. Additionally, it sets decision rules for certain acquisitions. The Act requires parties in certain large acquisitions to prove that the acquisition will not harm competition significantly. SEC. 3. UNLAWFUL ACQUISITIONS. Section 7 of the Clayton Act is amended to replace \"substantially\" with \"materially,\" include \"or a monopsony\" after \"monopoly,\" and set criteria for determining the effect of an acquisition on competition. The Clayton Act is amended to set criteria for determining the effect of an acquisition on competition, including thresholds based on the value of assets, sales, or market capitalization of the acquiring and acquired companies. The Clayton Act is amended to establish criteria for assessing the impact of an acquisition on competition, with thresholds based on the value of assets and voting securities. The acquiring and acquired companies must prove that the acquisition will not significantly reduce competition or create a monopoly. SEC. 4. POST-SETTLEMENT DATA. Section 7A of the Clayton Act is amended to require persons who enter into agreements with the Federal Trade Commission or the United States regarding acquisitions to submit annual information for 5 years to assess the competitive impact, including pricing, availability, and quality of products or services in the market. The Clayton Act is amended to require parties in agreements with the Federal Trade Commission to provide annual information for 5 years to evaluate the competitive impact of acquisitions, including cost-saving efficiencies, consumer benefits, and effectiveness of divestitures in preserving competition. The Clayton Act is amended to require parties to provide necessary information for the Federal Trade Commission and Assistant Attorney General to assess the competitive impact of acquisitions. This includes defining terms, exempting irrelevant information, and prescribing rules to carry out the purposes of the section. SEC. 5. OFFICE OF COMPETITION ADVOCATE. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"agency,\" \"covered company,\" \"Office,\" \"Chairman,\" and \"Commission.\" The Office of the Competition Advocate is established within the Federal Trade Commission, with the Competition Advocate reporting directly to the Chairman.
