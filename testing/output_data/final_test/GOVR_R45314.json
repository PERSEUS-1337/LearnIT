    "content": "Federal immigration laws outline procedures for excluding and removing non-U.S. nationals who do not meet entry criteria in the United States. Aliens are entitled to due process before removal, including notice of charges, the right to counsel, a hearing before an immigration judge, and the ability to appeal decisions. Congress has authority over admitting aliens, and the government can exclude them without traditional due process. An alien seeking initial entry into the United States may be excluded without traditional due process protections, as outlined in Section 235(b)(1) of the INA. Expedited removal procedures allow for the quick removal of arriving aliens without valid entry documents or who have attempted fraud. However, in some cases, aliens expressing fear of persecution may be entitled to certain procedural protections before removal. An alien expressing fear of persecution may obtain administrative review of his claim, leading to formal removal proceedings for asylum. INA Section 235(b)(1) allows expedited removal of certain arriving aliens and expands to those present in the US without valid entry documents or who attempted fraud. Expedited removal is a key component of immigration enforcement, primarily applied to arriving aliens, those who arrived by sea within the last two years without admission, and those found within 100 miles of the border within 14 days without admission. President Trump's executive order in 2017 directed DHS to expand expedited removal, but it has not been fully implemented yet. The report provides an overview of the statutory and regulatory framework governing expedited removal under INA Section 235(b)(1), including exceptions and judicial review. It also discusses legal challenges and potential issues if expedited removal is expanded. The Supreme Court has recognized the government's authority to expel or exclude aliens from the US. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the government's authority to expel or exclude aliens from the US, stating that an alien's admission is a privilege without a vested right. The Court has held that the government's decision to deny entry is generally not subject to judicial review, and immigration officials have the duty to specify procedures for implementation. The Supreme Court has recognized the government's authority to expel or exclude aliens from the US, stating that admission is a privilege without a vested right. Initially, the Court held that this authority covered both foreign nationals seeking entry and those already within the country. However, the Court later ruled that lawfully admitted aliens are entitled to Fifth Amendment due process protections in removal proceedings. The Supreme Court has ruled that all aliens in the United States, including those who entered unlawfully, are entitled to due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. This includes the right to notice of charges and a hearing before an executive or administrative tribunal. The Supreme Court has established that aliens physically present in the United States are entitled to due process protections, but those seeking entry do not have the same rights. The \"entry fiction\" doctrine allows courts to treat aliens at the border as if they had never entered the country, denying them constitutional protection. The Supreme Court has established that aliens seeking entry into the United States are not entitled to the same constitutional rights as those physically present in the country. This is known as the \"entry fiction\" doctrine, which considers aliens at the border to be outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Once an alien enters the country, they may become subject to constitutional rights and protections. The Supreme Court has applied this principle to aliens detained within the country's borders pending determinations of their admissibility. The Supreme Court has ruled that aliens seeking entry into the United States do not have the same constitutional rights as those already present in the country. This is known as the \"entry fiction\" doctrine, which considers aliens at the border to be outside the country's jurisdiction. The Court has applied this principle to cases where aliens are detained within the country pending admissibility determinations. In a specific case, the Court held that the government had the executive power to deny an alien admission without a hearing, stating that the decision was not subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court has broad power over the admission and exclusion of aliens seeking entry into the United States. Aliens at the border may be denied admission without due process protections, while those already in the country are entitled to such protections before removal. The \"entry fiction\" doctrine allows aliens detained within the US to be treated as if they have not entered the country for constitutional purposes. The application of this doctrine to aliens already in the US is still uncertain. The expedited removal process was established by Congress in 1996 under IIRIRA to address the issue of aliens already in the United States. Before this, federal immigration law distinguished between arriving aliens and those already in the country, leading to different proceedings for removal. The application of the \"entry fiction\" doctrine to aliens within the US remains unclear. In 1996, Congress enacted IIRIRA, making significant changes to immigration laws. The new framework focused on whether an alien had been lawfully admitted into the US. Lawfully admitted aliens could be removed if they met deportability grounds, while those not admitted could be denied entry and removed. IIRIRA, enacted in 1996, made changes to immigration laws by focusing on whether aliens were lawfully admitted into the US. It removed the distinction between deportation and exclusion proceedings, establishing a standard formal removal process applicable to all aliens. Additionally, it created an expedited removal process for certain arriving aliens who lack valid entry documents or have attempted fraud. Under the new procedure established by IIRIRA in 1996, certain arriving aliens could be summarily removed without a hearing if they lack valid entry documents or have committed fraud. The Attorney General (now the Secretary of DHS) was given discretion to apply this procedure to other inadmissible aliens who were not admitted or paroled into the US and could not prove continuous presence for two years. Table 1 shows the differences between expedited removal, pre-IIRIRA deportation/exclusion proceedings, and post-IIRIRA formal removal proceedings. Following IIRIRA in 1996, the former INS initially applied expedited removal to arriving aliens as mandated by the statute. Cuban nationals arriving by aircraft were exempt due to diplomatic relations. The term \"arriving alien\" was defined by the INS in regulations. The term \"arriving alien\" was initially defined by the INS to include aliens seeking admission or transit at a port of entry, as well as those interdicted at sea. Over time, expedited removal authority was expanded to cover various categories of aliens, including those who entered the U.S. by sea without admission, Cuban nationals, and those apprehended near the border within 14 days. Despite these expansions, the agency has never utilized expedited removal for Cuban nationals. The agency has never fully utilized expedited removal authority as authorized by INA Section 235(b)(1) since 1997. Expedited removal is currently applied to arriving aliens at designated ports of entry and certain aliens who arrived by sea without admission. Aliens who arrived in the United States by sea, not admitted or paroled, and in the country for less than two years, or encountered within 100 miles of the border, not admitted or paroled, and in the US for less than 14 days, are subject to expedited removal if they fall under INA Section 212(a)(6)(C) and (a)(7) for inadmissibility. This generally applies to aliens without valid entry documents or who try to gain admission through fraud. Aliens who arrive in the United States without proper documents or attempt to gain entry through fraud are subject to expedited removal. This includes those with expired passports, lacking valid visas, or seeking entry for reasons that require different authorizing documents. Aliens can be subject to expedited removal if they arrive in the United States without proper documents or through fraud, such as presenting false information on a visa application or falsely claiming to be a U.S. citizen. If an immigration officer determines an alien is inadmissible, they may be ordered removed without a hearing unless additional grounds for inadmissibility are found. Aliens can be subject to expedited removal if they arrive in the United States without proper documents or through fraud. The alien may be ordered removed without a hearing unless they indicate an intent to apply for asylum or fear of persecution. The alien will also be barred from reentering the United States for five years, with potential for longer bans based on special factors. U.S. Customs and Border Protection typically leads the expedited removal process, which involves multiple agency determinations, especially in cases where asylum may be sought. The expedited removal process involves multiple agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), in determining the credibility of asylum claims and issuing removal orders. Immigration Judges (IJs) may also be involved in reviewing USCIS determinations of credible fear of persecution. The expedited removal process involves USCIS determining an alien's credible fear of persecution. If credible fear is found, the alien goes through formal removal proceedings before an Immigration Judge for relief adjudication. Upon arrival in the US, aliens are subject to inspection by immigration officers at designated ports of entry during primary inspection. If discrepancies are found in documents or statements, further scrutiny is conducted. During secondary inspection, immigration officers question aliens to assess admissibility. Statements under oath may be obtained to determine the purpose of the alien's visit to the US. Interpretative assistance is provided if needed for communication. During secondary inspection, immigration officers question aliens to assess admissibility and may obtain sworn statements to determine the purpose of their visit to the US. If deemed inadmissible, aliens are taken to a U.S. Border Patrol station for processing, where they are required to provide statements on their identity, nationality, and inadmissibility, which are recorded on Form I-867. The alien must review and sign each page of the form, including any corrections made. DHS regulations require immigration officers to prepare a Notice and Order of Expedited Removal (Form I-860) with charges of inadmissibility for aliens. Aliens suspected of being in the US without admission must have a chance to prove otherwise. Expedited removal is limited to grounds involving lack of entry documents or fraud. If additional charges are pursued, aliens are placed in formal proceedings. If an alien is found in the US without admission, DHS may pursue additional charges and place them in formal removal proceedings under INA Section 240. An expedited order of removal can become final after supervisory review, and the alien may be served with Form I-860 to acknowledge receipt. The alien is not entitled to an administrative hearing or appeal of the expedited removal order and will be removed from the United States. Alternatively, DHS may allow the alien to voluntarily withdraw their application for admission to depart immediately, managing resources efficiently. Under DHS policy, immigration officers consider various factors to determine if an alien can withdraw their application for admission, including seriousness of violation, previous inadmissibility findings, intent to violate the law, ability to overcome inadmissibility, age, health, and humanitarian considerations. The agency has discretion to permit withdrawal and immediate departure instead of formal removal. Under DHS policy, immigration officers assess factors to decide if an alien can withdraw their application for admission and leave the U.S. instead of facing removal proceedings. Regulations state that an alien allowed to withdraw their application will be detained until departure unless parole is granted. In expedited removal cases, aliens are usually ordered removed without a hearing, but exceptions exist. Administrative review is triggered if an alien claims asylum, fears persecution, asserts U.S. citizenship, LPR status, or refugee/asylee status. In these cases, removal is delayed until the claim is considered. When Congress established expedited removal in 1996, special protections were included for aliens claiming relief from removal. An alien expressing intent to apply for asylum or fear of persecution is entitled to administrative review before removal. This review includes an interview with an asylum officer to determine if the alien has a credible fear of persecution or torture, which is a screening process to assess eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) defines \"credible fear of persecution\" and \"credible fear of torture\" as significant possibilities for an alien to establish eligibility for asylum or protection under the Convention Against Torture. The screening standard for credible fear requires only a substantial possibility of success on the merits of the application, not a likelihood. This determination is not a full assessment of the alien's claims but a preliminary check for viability. USCIS may conduct a credible fear interview at a designated port of entry or detention center. Before the interview, the alien can consult with another person and present evidence. The immigration officer must provide information about the interview process and the right to request a review of the asylum officer's determination. The asylum officer conducts a nonadversarial interview to determine if the applicant has a credible fear of persecution or torture. An interpreter is provided if needed, and a summary of the applicant's statements is created for review and correction. The asylum officer creates a written record of the credible fear determination, including a factual summary and decision on persecution or torture. The determination is reviewed by a supervisory officer before becoming final. If credible fear is established, the alien enters formal removal proceedings with the opportunity to seek various forms of relief and appeal decisions. An alien who fails to establish a credible fear of persecution or torture may seek judicial review of a final order of removal. If an asylum officer determines lack of credible fear, the alien can request review by an Immigration Judge (IJ) using Form I-869. If the alien declines further review, they will be issued Form I-860 for expedited removal from the United States. If an alien requests review of a negative credible fear finding, an Immigration Judge will conduct a de novo review within 7 days. The review is limited to the issue of credible fear and may be done in person, by phone, or video. If the IJ agrees with the negative finding, the alien will be removed, and the decision is final with no appeal. DHS can reconsider a negative finding after IJ concurrence. The alien may request reconsideration of a negative credible fear finding by the USCIS asylum office, which may lead to a second interview or a positive determination. If an Immigration Judge finds credible fear, the alien can pursue asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT protection in formal removal proceedings under INA \u00a7 240. In late 2002, the United States and Canada entered into an agreement that bars certain non-Canadian nationals arriving from Canada from applying for asylum in the United States. If such aliens express a fear of persecution, they must be returned to Canada to seek protection under Canadian law. If the asylum officer determines that the alien does not qualify for an exception, they will be ineligible to apply for asylum in the United States. The expedited removal process in the United States includes exceptions for certain aliens, such as lawful permanent residents, refugees, asylees, and U.S. citizens. If an alien claims one of these statuses, an asylum officer will assess their credible fear of persecution or torture. The implementing regulations require verification of the claimed status before issuing an expedited removal order. The verification process for expedited removal orders includes checking all available DHS data systems to confirm an alien's claimed status as a lawful permanent resident, refugee, asylee, or U.S. citizen. If the status cannot be verified, the alien will be advised of penalties for perjury and allowed to make a sworn statement before an expedited removal order is issued and reviewed by an Immigration Judge. If the Immigration Judge (IJ) determines an alien has not been admitted as an LPR, refugee, granted asylum, or is not a U.S. citizen, the expedited order of removal is affirmed, and DHS proceeds with removal. There is no appeal. If the individual has been admitted as an LPR, refugee, granted asylum, or is a U.S. citizen, the expedited order is vacated, and proceedings are terminated. DHS may admit the individual or initiate formal removal proceedings under INA Section 240. U.S. citizens cannot be subject to removal proceedings. An alien who is a lawful permanent resident (LPR) cannot be issued an expedited order of removal unless certain conditions are met, such as abandonment of LPR status, prolonged absence from the US, engagement in illegal activities, or committing specific criminal offenses. An LPR seeking admission may have their inspection deferred to present required documents or may be found inadmissible due to criminal activity, leading to formal removal proceedings. If an immigration officer finds an alien inadmissible under certain circumstances, formal removal proceedings may be initiated. However, if the alien holds refugee or asylum status and meets certain criteria, an expedited order of removal cannot be issued. The alien may apply for a refugee travel document if certain conditions are met, such as not abandoning their refugee or asylum status and being outside the US for less than a year. If an alien is found inadmissible, formal removal proceedings may be initiated. However, refugees or asylees meeting specific criteria can apply for a refugee travel document and be readmitted to the US. Unaccompanied alien children must go through formal removal proceedings under INA Section 240, with access to pro bono counsel and the option of voluntary departure. In limited circumstances, DHS may allow a UAC to voluntarily return to a contiguous country like Mexico or Canada instead of facing removal proceedings, provided the child is not a victim of human trafficking, does not fear persecution, and can withdraw their application for admission. Immigration authorities can detain aliens pending removal, with expedited removal leading to detention until a removal decision is made. Aliens in expedited removal may be detained pending removal from the United States, with the possibility of release on bond, recognizance, or supervision. Extended detention of alien minors and parents is limited by a court settlement agreement. The regulations require that aliens in expedited removal be detained for determination of their status, with the possibility of parole for urgent humanitarian reasons or public benefit. DHS has discretion to parole aliens during expedited removal proceedings if necessary for medical emergencies or law enforcement objectives. The agency has discretion to grant parole to aliens in expedited removal for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, such as medical emergencies or law enforcement objectives. Parole decisions are not subject to review, and aliens with credible fear of persecution or torture may be detained pending asylum consideration, with the possibility of parole for specific cases like serious medical conditions or certified women. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for the release on parole of certain aliens, including those with serious medical conditions, pregnant women, alien juveniles, witnesses in legal proceedings, and those whose continued detention is not in the public interest. Mandatory detention applies to arriving aliens with credible fear of persecution, who are not eligible for bond hearings and can only be considered for parole by DHS during formal removal proceedings. Aliens apprehended between ports of entry and placed in formal removal proceedings following a positive credible fear determination are not subject to mandatory detention under INA Section 235(b)(1). They fall under INA Section 236(a)'s discretionary detention authority and can seek a redetermination of their custody status at bond hearings before an IJ. Applicants for admission not subject to expedited removal are covered under INA Section 235(b)(2). The INA provides for the detention of certain aliens who are inadmissible or subject to removal. Arriving aliens in formal removal proceedings are mandatorily detained, while those apprehended within the US following entry without inspection are not subject to mandatory detention. Detention may be considered for parole in specific circumstances such as serious medical conditions or cases where detention is not in the public interest. Detention is generally mandatory for arriving aliens in formal removal proceedings, but those who enter without inspection are not subject to mandatory detention. A court settlement agreement limits the detention period for alien minors, requiring transfer to a qualifying adult or licensed facility. The Flores Settlement applies to both accompanied and unaccompanied minors. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the Flores Settlement applies to both accompanied and unaccompanied minors. While the agreement does not require DHS to release parents with their children, in practice, family units are typically released pending removal proceedings due to difficulties in separating them. A federal district court also found that family separation without a determination of parental unfitness likely violates due process. DHS has broad detention authority over aliens seeking admission, but detaining minors and their accompanying relatives poses challenges. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the Flores Settlement applies to both accompanied and unaccompanied minors, with concerns about the indefinite detention of aliens pending removal proceedings. The court upheld an injunction for individualized bond hearings after six months' detention, citing serious constitutional concerns. The Ninth Circuit considered constitutional concerns regarding due process protections for aliens in the United States, including returning LPRs under INA Sections 235(b), 236(a), and 236(c). They ruled that these provisions should be interpreted with implicit time limitations. However, the Supreme Court in Jennings v. Rodriguez disagreed with this interpretation, stating that it was \"implausible\" and did not contain such limitations. The Supreme Court upheld DHS's authority to detain aliens pending removal proceedings, but left unresolved the constitutionality of indefinite detention. The Court remanded the case to address the plaintiffs' claim of due process violations. The alien has limited rights to seek judicial review of an expedited order of removal, with exceptions under Section 242 of the INA. The federal courts of appeals can generally review a final order of removal, but judicial review of expedited removal orders is restricted unless falling within specific exceptions. This includes challenges to an immigration officer's decisions and policies related to expedited removal proceedings. The alien's ability to challenge expedited removal orders is limited under Section 242 of the INA. While federal courts of appeals can review final removal orders, expedited removal orders have specific restrictions. Exceptions exist for habeas corpus proceedings to challenge the underlying order, with jurisdiction limited to specific issues. The petitioner in the habeas action must prove if they are an alien, were ordered removed under expedited removal provisions, and can show evidence of being an LPR, admitted as a refugee, or granted asylum. The court's review is limited to whether the removal order was issued and if it pertains to the petitioner, with no review of admissibility or relief eligibility. If the petitioner is not subject to expedited removal or has lawful status, the court may not provide a remedy. The court may order a hearing for an alien seeking permanent residence, admitted as a refugee, or granted asylum in formal removal proceedings. An alien subject to expedited removal can challenge its validity in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on specific issues. A lawsuit challenging expedited removal must be filed within 60 days of the implementation of the challenged provision. The D.C. District Court considers this requirement jurisdictional. An alien can appeal a district court's order within 30 days, with appellate courts conducting expedited reviews. In some cases, an alien criminally charged with unlawful reentry can challenge an expedited removal order. The INA Section 276 imposes criminal penalties on aliens who reenter the US after being denied admission, deported, or removed. In United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, the Supreme Court ruled that aliens prosecuted for unlawful reentry can challenge the validity of their removal order during criminal proceedings if they were denied judicial review. The Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Mendoza-Lopez that aliens prosecuted for unlawful reentry can challenge the validity of their removal order during criminal proceedings if they were denied judicial review. In response, Congress added a new clause to the unlawful reentry statute allowing aliens to challenge the validity of the removal order if they exhausted administrative remedies. The Ninth Circuit ruled that a defendant charged with unlawful reentry can challenge an expedited removal order if it is deemed \"fundamentally unfair,\" following the precedent set by United States v. Mendoza-Lopez. The Ninth Circuit has determined that expedited removal proceedings can be considered \"fundamentally unfair\" if certain due process rights are violated, such as lack of interpretative assistance, notice of charges, and review of sworn statements. Challenges to expedited removal orders in criminal prosecutions for unlawful reentry are limited to cases where the order was deemed \"fundamentally unfair.\" The expedited removal process has faced legal challenges due to limited procedural protections and strict limitations on judicial review. Courts have mostly dismissed challenges for lack of jurisdiction or rejected them on substantive grounds. These cases raise concerns about the constitutionality of the expedited removal statute. In 1997, immigrant assistance organizations and aliens challenged the new expedited removal regulations in federal court. In Lawyers Association v. Reno, plaintiffs argued that expedited removal procedures lacked protections for aliens entering the US, violating due process rights. The district court upheld the procedures, stating they advanced Congress's goals and fell within the statute's command for summary removal without further review. The court upheld Congress's authority over alien admission, stating aliens at the border have no constitutional due process protections. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the dismissal of complaints, ruling organizational plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge expedited removal procedures. Some courts have addressed challenges to the application of expedited removal in individual cases despite jurisdictional limitations. A federal district court in Michigan allowed judicial inquiry into whether the expedited removal statute was lawfully applied in habeas corpus proceedings. The court reviewed whether expedited removal orders were lawfully applied to aliens, striking down implementation for Lebanese nationals with fraudulent documents. The Third Circuit disagreed with considering lawful application in habeas proceedings, stating it contradicted the statute's plain language. The expedited removal statute explicitly bars judicial review of its application to individual aliens, as seen in the Fifth Circuit's decision on habeas proceedings. Some courts have reviewed expedited removal orders for unlawful reentry prosecutions under INA Section 276, with the Ninth Circuit allowing review under INA Section 276(d). The Ninth Circuit allows review of expedited removal orders for unlawful reentry prosecutions under INA Section 276(d). In a recent case, the court found that an arriving alien's claim of a violation of the right to counsel lacked merit as nonadmitted aliens have no right to representation. However, in another case, the Ninth Circuit ruled that an alien was entitled to due process during expedited removal proceedings if apprehended within the United States. The courts have addressed challenges to expedited removal orders, with petitioners arguing violations of due process due to detention without counsel and inability to contest charges of inadmissibility. Despite the right to file a petition for review, courts have dismissed challenges to expedited removal orders citing lack of judicial review in such cases. The courts have ruled that jurisdictional limitations prevent judicial review of expedited removal orders, despite concerns about arbitrary or discriminatory behavior in the process. Immigration authorities have applied expedited removal to three main categories of aliens. The expedited removal process applies to aliens who arrived at designated ports of entry, by sea within two years, or within 100 miles of the border within 14 days. The Secretary of DHS can expand this to any inadmissible alien without entry documents or through fraud, regardless of location, as long as they haven't been admitted or paroled and have been in the country for less than two years. President Trump's executive order expanded expedited removal under INA Section 235(b)(1) on a larger scale. DHS Secretary Kelly announced initiatives to promptly remove aliens apprehended after crossing the border illegally due to a surge in illegal immigration and a backlog of immigration court cases. Some immigrant rights advocates have criticized the proposed expansion of expedited removal, warning that it could strip immigrants of due process rights. Extending the process to aliens away from the border may face legal challenges, as aliens in the US, even unlawfully, are entitled to some due process protections before removal. Expanding expedited removal to cover aliens in any part of the United States may conflict with constitutional notions of due process protections. While some courts have limited these protections for aliens near the border, it is uncertain how this principle applies to those in the interior or with ties to the US. The Supreme Court has emphasized admission by immigration authorities as a key factor. The Supreme Court views admission into the United States as crucial in determining an alien's entitlement to constitutional protections. The length of time spent in the country may also influence the extent of these protections. This could potentially support the application of expedited removal to aliens in the interior who have been in the US for a short period. However, the Court still considers an alien's physical presence in the US as the critical factor in assessing due process rights. The Supreme Court considers an alien's physical presence in the United States as crucial in determining their entitlement to constitutional protections. If the Department of Homeland Security expands expedited removal nationwide, courts may face challenges regarding the federal government's power over admitting aliens and the limits of that power for aliens already in the country. The former INS limited expedited removal to aliens arriving in the US, defining \"arriving alien\" to include those seeking admission at a port of entry, in transit, or interdicted at sea. Opposition to including sea-interdicted aliens was countered with BIA precedent on territorial waters crossing not constituting entry into the US. The INS declared that aliens who have not physically entered the United States are considered arriving aliens, including those interdicted at sea. Paroled aliens are also classified as arriving aliens, as parole does not constitute admission into the US. The INS reserved the right to expand expedited removal procedures to additional classes of aliens based on operational needs, such as sudden influxes or the need to increase enforcement effectiveness. This expansion would involve more complex determinations of fact and management challenges. Upon IIRIRA's passage, the new expedited removal statute covered only arriving aliens in the United States, including aliens arriving at a port of entry, aliens in transit at a port of entry, and aliens interdicted at sea brought into the United States. The INS considered but did not implement a pilot program in 1999 to extend expedited removal to criminal aliens convicted of unlawful entry who had not been admitted or paroled into the United States. The INS proposed expanding expedited removal to aliens convicted of unlawful entry, not admitted or paroled into the US for less than two years, and serving criminal sentences in Texas. Despite citing authority and need for the expansion, it was not implemented. In 2002, expedited removal was authorized for a new class of aliens arriving in the US by sea. In 2002, the INS authorized expedited removal for a new class of aliens who arrived in the United States by sea and had not been admitted or paroled, and had not been in the US for at least two years. The expansion did not include aliens arriving at designated ports of entry or interdicted at sea, nor did it apply to Cuban nationals due to longstanding US policy. The INS authorized expedited removal for aliens arriving in the US by sea, excluding Cuban nationals. This was to deter illegal migration by sea and prevent diversion of resources from national security efforts. The INS implemented expedited removal for aliens arriving in the US by sea to quickly remove those who do not establish a credible fear. DHS later authorized CBP to use expedited removal for aliens unlawfully present within 100 miles of the border and not admitted or paroled for at least 14 days. The DHS extended expedited removal to aliens encountered shortly after unlawfully entering the US through the border to enhance national security and deter illegal entries. The DHS limited expedited removal to aliens who were not Mexican or Canadian nationals, or those with criminal or immigration violations. Logistical difficulties were cited for initiating formal removal proceedings for nearly 1 million third-country nationals apprehended each year, leading to the need for detention pending return arrangements or formal removal proceedings. The DHS applied expedited removal to third-country nationals in border areas due to limited resources for detention. Mexican and Canadian nationals with criminal or immigration violations were also subject to expedited removal. The agency recognized the geographical limitations of expedited removal under INA Section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii) and focused on border areas for this designation. The DHS applied expedited removal to aliens apprehended immediately proximate to the land border with negligible ties to the U.S. within 100 miles of the border. This was due to limited resources for detention and focused enforcement on unlawful entries with close spatial and temporal nexus to the border. DHS limited expedited removal to aliens apprehended within 14 days of entering the US and within 100 miles of any international land border, excluding Cuban nationals. Implementation began on August 11, 2004, expanding the authority to aliens encountered within the country's border. DHS expanded expedited removal authority to the entire Southwest border, giving Border Patrol agents greater control to protect against the terrorist threat and disrupt human smuggling cycles. DHS expanded expedited removal to the entire U.S. border with Mexico, followed by the U.S.-Canadian border and coastal areas. Secretary Chertoff stated that this process helps protect the nation's boundaries and swiftly removes illegal aliens. DHS expanded expedited removal to the northern border sectors of Blaine, WA; Spokane, WA; Havre, MT; Grand Forks, ND; Detroit, MI; Buffalo, NY; Swanton, VT; and Houlton, ME, citing the disruption of human smuggling cycles. The policy change also affected Cuban nationals following the restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba and the end of the \"wet-foot, dry-foot\" policy. In response to the restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba, DHS eliminated the exception to expedited removal for Cuban nationals arriving in the United States by aircraft at designated ports of entry. This decision was based on the increased attempts by Cuban nationals to illegally enter the country and Cuba's agreement to facilitate the return of its nationals ordered removed from the US. Cuban nationals arriving by sea without admission or parole were also now subject to expedited removal. DHS removed exceptions for Cuban nationals arriving in the US by sea or within 100 miles of the border, subjecting them to expedited removal regardless of how they entered the country. This change was attributed to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the US and Cuba."
