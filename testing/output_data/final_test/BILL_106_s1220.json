    "content": "The Act titled \"Rural Methamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999\" defines key terms like Administrator, Committees, midsize city, rural area, and small city. It requires a report on methamphetamine consumption in rural areas, small cities, and midsize cities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must annually report on methamphetamine consumption issues in rural areas, small cities, and midsize cities. The report includes an analysis of differences in consumption patterns, incidence of abuse, treatment resources, and the relationship between consumption and lack of treatment in rural areas. The Secretary of Health and Human Services reports annually on methamphetamine consumption in rural, small, and midsize cities, analyzing consumption patterns, abuse incidence, treatment resources, and the relationship between consumption and treatment availability. The report also examines geographic differences in substance abuse treatment availability and its impact on the methamphetamine abuse problem in the United States. SEC. 4. CLEANUP OF METHAMPHETAMINE LABORATORIES AND PRODUCTION MATERIALS. Authorization of $20,000,000 annually for the Drug Enforcement Administration to address the financial burden on communities from cleaning up drug-related hazardous waste like clandestine laboratories. The bill authorizes $20,000,000 annually for the Drug Enforcement Administration to clean up drug-related hazardous waste, including clandestine laboratories. This includes improving response times for cleanup through additional personnel, equipment, and facilities. The funds are in addition to any other amounts authorized for the Administration for these activities. SEC. 5. Investigative assistance for state and local law enforcement regarding methamphetamine. Congress finds that local law enforcement agencies lack the necessary language skills to effectively combat methamphetamine trafficking, which is often linked to Mexican drug trafficking organizations. This hinders their ability to communicate with suspects and utilize investigative tools, highlighting the importance of providing DEA Special Agents with Spanish language capability. Special Agents with Spanish language skills can assist State and local law enforcement in combating methamphetamine trafficking. The Drug Enforcement Administration will establish a cadre of 20 Special Agents with Spanish language capabilities to work on methamphetamine-related drug trafficking issues nationwide. The Administrator will allocate Special Agents to combat the national methamphetamine threat. $4,700,000 is authorized for the Drug Enforcement Administration in fiscal year 2000, with $3,000,000 for establishing a cadre of agents and $1,700,000 for PCS costs of senior agents. SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION AND STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL. Congress finds that the spread of methamphetamine abuse and production in the United States has created challenges for law enforcement agencies due to the ease of production and the dangerous chemicals involved. To address this, there is a need to expand the training capabilities of the Drug Enforcement Administration for local law enforcement personnel. The Drug Enforcement Administration will establish regional training centers to reduce travel costs and enhance training for State and local law enforcement personnel. Additionally, four regional satellite training centers will be set up for providing clandestine training purposes. The Drug Enforcement Administration will establish training centers nationwide to provide clandestine laboratory training to law enforcement personnel. Special Agents, Drug Prevention Specialists, and Support personnel will be assigned to these centers to work with communities on developing drug prevention programs. The Drug Enforcement Administration will establish regional centers with $30,000,000 in funding for drug prevention programs and training support. Additionally, specialized clandestine laboratory training programs will be established. The Administrator will establish Advanced Clandestine Laboratory Investigations schools for law enforcement personnel, Additional Basic Clandestine Laboratory Certification Schools, and a \"Train the Trainer\" program to provide skills for recertification and awareness training. Authorization of appropriations is included for these programs.

THEFT AND TRANSPORTATION OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. This section amends the Controlled Substances Act to make it unlawful to steal anhydrous ammonia or transport stolen anhydrous ammonia across state lines. Penalties include imprisonment or fines as specified in the Act.
