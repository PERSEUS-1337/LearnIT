Postpartum depression is a mood disorder that affects many women during and after pregnancy. It can be categorized into three subgroups: \"baby blues\", postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, and postpartum psychosis. \"Baby blues\" is characterized by mood swings, feeling overwhelmed, tearfulness, irritability, poor sleep, mood changes, and vulnerability. Postpartum mood and anxiety disorders include symptoms like worsening baby blues, postpartum psychosis involves losing touch with reality, distorted thinking, and hallucinations. Around 400,000 women experience postpartum mood changes annually, with baby blues affecting up to 80% of new mothers. Postpartum depression is treatable if promptly diagnosed. Postpartum depression, if promptly diagnosed, can be treated with a personalized regimen of care including social support, therapy, medication, and hospitalization. However, it often goes undiagnosed or untreated due to social stigma, the myth of motherhood, self-diagnosis challenges, shame, lack of understanding, and economic pressures. Untreated postpartum depression can lead to further mental health issues, substance abuse, job loss, divorce, social alienation, and self-destructive behavior. Untreated postpartum depression can lead to social alienation, self-destructive behavior, and impact society through infant development, child abuse, neglect, or family disruption.
