Landowners are converting grassland into crop production in response to higher market prices and national policies encouraging crop production for energy. The USDA estimates that 90.5 million acres nationwide will be planted in corn in 2007. The expansion of corn acres nationwide in 2007 is driven by various factors, including land conversion from other crops and idled land. Economic incentives from biofuels, rising corn prices, and advances in biotechnology are contributing to this trend. Federal farm commodity support programs may also be facilitating the conversion of land. The availability of federal farm commodity support programs is incentivizing farmers to convert land from native grass to commodity crops, providing protection from financial loss if crops fail. Concerns about land conversion in the Northern Plains include disruption of old-growth grasslands, loss of wildlife habitat, and rapid increases in land rental rates and sale prices. Some argue that increased production leads to economic activity in rural communities, lower federal spending due to high commodity prices, and meeting the demand for renewable domestic fuel supply. The report discusses grassland conversion to cropland in the Northern Plains, with limited data available due to recent trends. Anecdotal evidence suggests an increase in conversions, but the actual amount is difficult to determine. The focus is on the impacts of land use changes in South Dakota and other areas, with concerns about loss of wildlife habitat and disruption of old-growth grasslands. The Northern Plains land use activities and changes are evaluated through three data sets showing declines in pasture, rangeland, and cropland between 1982 and 2003. Other land categories like forest land, development, water areas, CRP acres, and federal lands have increased. Grazing land acreage saw a national net decline between 1997 and 2003 according to NRI data. Between 1997 and 2003, there was a national net decline in grazing land acreage of about 1% per year, totaling 1 million acres annually. In the Missouri River Basin, there was a decline of 1.3 million acres in pasture and rangeland between 1992 and 2003. Recent statistics on grassland conversion concerns have been obtained from a new database maintained by three states within USDA's Farm Service Agency. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) collects data on land use changes to track commodity planting trends. FSA started recording new cropland acres converted from pasture and rangeland in three states in 2002 and 2005. Participation rates in FSA programs are high, but the data may under-represent total grassland conversion. The limited data on grassland conversion collected by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) may not accurately reflect the actual rate of conversion. Concerns have been raised about potential underestimation of land conversion in 2007. Ducks Unlimited and other organizations conducted research on land conversions in the Missouri Coteau region, but current data limitations prevent definitive conclusions. The Missouri Coteau region in central North and South Dakota, part of the prairie pothole region, has seen 144,000 acres of native grassland lost to cropland conversion between 1984 and 2002, as observed through LandSat satellite imagery. Between 1984 and 2002, 144,000 acres of native grassland were converted to cropland in the Missouri Coteau region, with the majority of the conversion occurring in the Hyde-Hand region of central South Dakota. The analysis area is limited in scope and excludes the time period of current interest. Policy issues such as commodity programs, expiring Conservation Reserve Program contracts, and conservation compliance may impact land conversion rates and patterns. Evidence shows the conversion of lands with no previous cropping history, but the extent of this is unclear. The conversion of lands with no previous cropping history is a concern in central South Dakota, with attention from cattle associations and wildlife organizations. Commodity programs are believed to promote land conversion, as noted by witnesses at a House Agriculture Committee field hearing. Judge Jessop, a grassland producer from South Dakota, testified that commodity programs like the marketing loan program and crop insurance program are blamed for \"sod busting\" in the region. Newly converted land lacks base acres or payment yields, making it ineligible for some commodity programs, but still eligible for marketing loans and crop insurance. Critics argue that these programs incentivize farmers to convert grassland into production. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) allows farmers to retire environmentally sensitive land for 10 years. Concerns arise as a high number of CRP acres are set to expire in South Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana. Approximately 23% of CRP acres nationwide are in these states. Only 2.9 million acres will be re-enrolled after a sign-up period in 2006. Approximately 2.9 million acres are set to leave the Conservation Reserve Program in 2007, with uncertainty on how landowners will use the land. South Dakota has the lowest re-enrollment rate, with only 63% opting to extend their contracts. The controversy over grassland conversion is intensified in the Northern Plains where CRP contracts are expiring. Land previously enrolled in commodity programs maintains its base acres and payment yield throughout the CRP contract. Enrollment in CRP maintains base acres and payment yield throughout the contract. Lands can receive direct payments and counter-cyclical payments after CRP contracts expire. Speculation arose about early release from CRP contracts to meet corn demand for ethanol, but USDA will not offer penalty-free releases based on 2007 planting intentions. Terminating a CRP contract requires forfeiting rights to payments, refunding received payments with interest, and paying liquidated damages to the CCC. The Food Security Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-198) included provisions like Sodbuster to prevent erosion on highly erodible land. Compliance allows farmers to participate in USDA programs. The Sodsaver provision in the Administration's 2007 farm bill proposal would make all converted grassland permanently ineligible for USDA program benefits, expanding on the existing Sodbuster provision to address the issue of land conversion in the Northern Plains region. The Sodsaver provision in the Administration's 2007 farm bill proposal would make producers ineligible for USDA programs on converted grassland, including conservation programs. Despite support from farm and environmental organizations, the South Dakota Cattlemen's Association only supports it if crop insurance is excluded. Data shows ongoing land conversion from grassland to cropland in the Northern Plains, but questions remain unanswered about the specifics of these conversions. The ongoing land conversion from grassland to cropland in the Northern Plains raises questions about the types of land being converted, the environmental impact, and potential changes in public policy to address this issue. Speculation on future patterns of land conversion is influenced by factors such as market prices for commodities, technological advances, and commodity policies. Discussions on conversion are intended to shape future decisions and actions. Land conversion from grassland to cropland in the Northern Plains raises questions about driving forces, impacts on wildlife, and technological advances. Concerns include rising rental prices for grazing land, changes in hunting opportunities, and the potential reversibility of adverse effects on wildlife. Technological advances and sustainability in the Northern Plains are key factors in the conversion of grassland to cropland. Questions arise about the impact on soil moisture, potential for increased production, and economic incentives. Additionally, concerns about dealing with dry conditions and the effects of various farm bill proposals on land conversion are important considerations. The conversion of grassland to cropland in the Northern Plains raises questions about economic incentives, crop insurance implications, and conservation compliance. Concerns about soil moisture, production increase, and the impact of farm bill proposals on land conversion are also important considerations. The Administration's proposed Sodsaver in the Northern Plains could reduce land value by limiting options for producers, potentially affecting land conversion rates and the land market in the region."
