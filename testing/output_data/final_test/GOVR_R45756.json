The report analyzes U.S. military EW funding across RDT&E and procurement appropriations, comparing funding profiles between fiscal years and projecting funding across the FYDP. DOD aims to invest around $9.7 billion in FY2021 for EW programs, as identified by the EW EXCOM. Specific EW-related programs and an overview of electronic warfare are not covered in this report. The EW EXCOM identified RDT&E program elements from military services and defense agencies for DOD investments in electronic warfare in FY2019 and FY2020. China and Russia have heavily invested in EW-related systems to compete against U.S. C2ISR networks. The Russian military sees electronic warfare as a form of armed struggle using electronic means to disrupt enemy communication systems. China has also developed advanced electronic warfare capabilities to disrupt adversary command and control systems, including space-based systems. The Chinese military regularly conducts exercises to test and demonstrate these capabilities, as highlighted in the DOD's annual report to Congress. The National Defense Strategy Commission has identified electronic warfare as a critical capability for achieving defense goals. The DOD has identified electronic warfare (EW) as a critical capability to achieve defense goals and improve platform survivability. The Executive Branch and Congress have prioritized EW programs, establishing the EW EXCOM to identify emerging technologies and develop an EW Strategy. The EW EXCOM identified program elements and projects with EW facets in each service's RDT&E appropriations, excluding procurement lines due to complexity. Some program elements may not clearly refer to EW capabilities, like DARPA's Electronics Technology. The report treats the list of 65 program elements as encompassing DOD EW programs, comparing FY2019 budget requests with FY2020 and FY2021 requests for Army, Navy, Air Force, DARPA, DISA, Joint Staff, and OSD. The FY2021 budget request includes Space Force programs previously part of the Air Force request. DOD procurement documents identify research and development program elements related to electronic warfare (EW). Analysis found 28 EW procurement programs in FY2019, 36 in FY2020, and 33 in FY2021. Some efforts like the F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet and MQ-9 Reaper drone included EW procurement funding. The FY2021 budget request includes Space Force programs previously part of the Air Force request. DOD procurement documents identify electronic warfare (EW) research and development programs. Analysis found 28 EW procurement programs in FY2019, 36 in FY2020, and 33 in FY2021. Some programs like the F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet and MQ-9 Reaper drone included EW procurement funding. DOD has prioritized EW funding above other programs, comparing funding requests between fiscal years to assess changes in the EW portfolio. Table 1 provides an overview of FY2019 EW RDT&E funding request, enacted funding, and projected funding for EW program elements in departments and agencies. The FY2019 request serves as a baseline to compare how DOD changed its funding priorities for FY2020. DOD requested $5.53 billion in EW RDT&E for FY2019, with the Navy requesting the most funding ($2.44 billion), followed by the Air Force, Army, DARPA, and other organizations. EW funding was expected to peak in FY2019 and decrease through FY2022, with a slight increase in FY2023. Congress enacted approximately $5.8 billion for EW RDT&E in FY2019, with additional funding allocated to OSD OT&E for testing. The FY2020 budget request for EW RDT&E in DOD includes additional funding for testing, with increases for Operational Test and Evaluation and the Army. The Navy and DARPA saw slight decreases in funding. The DOD budget requested $504 million more for RDT&E in FY2020 compared to FY2019, with a focus on EW capabilities for the Navy and Army. In FY2020, there was an overall increase of $140 million in EW research and development funding. The Air Force received an additional $139 million, with increases for Advanced Aerospace Sensor Technologies and EW Quick Reaction Capabilities. The Navy received an extra $58 million for programs like F/A-18 Infrared Search and Track. DARPA and Army funding for EW research and development saw reductions. The FY2021 RDT&E request includes approximately $5.7 billion for Precision, Navigation, and Timing equipment development. The Navy requested the most funding, followed by the Army. The Army increased EW RDT&E funding by $305 million compared to FY2020. The Air Force restructured programs and transferred some to the Space Force. Top programs with increased funding include the Army's Rapid Capability Development and Maturation program, F/A-18 Infrared Search and Track development, and the Eagle Passive Active Warning System. The FY2021 RDT&E request includes increased funding for various programs, with the largest increases seen in Precision, Navigation, and Timing equipment development, the Army's Rapid Capability Development and Maturation program, and the Eagle Passive Active Warning System. Some programs experienced reductions in funding, such as the B-2 Defensive Management System and DARPA's Sensors and Processing Systems program. The FY2021 request aligns closely with FY2020, projecting $25.6 billion over five years. The FY2021 request for EW RDT&E funding is $5.5 billion, representing an 11.7% increase from FY2019 projections but a 1.7% decrease from FY2020. The overall change from FY2019 to FY2021 is double the requested increase in overall DOD funding from FY2019 to FY2020. The Administration requested $4.55 billion for EW-related procurement activities in FY2019, with the Navy requesting the most funding. The Air Force and Army received the most funding, with projections to decline through FY2021 before increasing in FY2022 and FY2023 due to the Next Generation Jammer entering production. Congress added $431 million in appropriations, with the Air Force receiving an additional $444 million for EC-37B aircraft and other enhancements. The Navy and SOCOM saw minor decreases in appropriations. The Administration requested $4.56 billion in EW procurement for FY2020, with the Navy requesting the largest amount followed by the Air Force and the Army. The Air Force's request increased the most compared to the previous year, attributed to new programs and modifications. Total procurement for EW equipment was $4.2 billion. In FY2021, procurement for EW equipment was $4.2 billion, with the Navy and Air Force requesting the largest proportions. Funding for the Space Force was included in the request for the first time. Navy procurement saw significant decreases, particularly in programs like MQ-4 Triton and AN/ALQ-32s. Overall, procurement in FY2021 is the lowest of the three fiscal years tracked. In FY2021, procurement for electronic warfare (EW) equipment saw significant changes. Funding for Assured Precision Navigation and Timing (PNT) equipment, Patriot Modifications, and Integrated Fire Protection Family of Systems (IFPC) increased, while funding for MQ-4 Triton and AN/ALQ-32s decreased. The Navy is reevaluating its EW programs for the surface fleet, with a 22.5% reduction in procurement funding compared to the FY2020 request. The FY2021 FYDP projects $22.8 billion in funding over the next five years. In FY2021, electronic warfare (EW) procurement funding saw changes. The Navy had a significant decrease in funding, while the Army had an increase. Overall, DOD is prioritizing EW procurement in alignment with the National Defense Strategy. The DOD requested a 4.9% increase in funding compared to FY2019 projections, with a 7.1% increase in EW procurement from the FY2019 request. Planned funding levels for RDT&E decline over the FYDP, but programs like NGJ and E-11 BACN are transitioning to fielded systems. The Administration plans to accelerate the Next Generation Jammer and F-15 electronic warfare systems. The DOD requested a significant increase in funding for electronic warfare systems in FY2021, with a $662.5 million increase compared to FY2019 projections. However, the FY2021 request is $591.3 million lower than the FY2020 request. The overall funding level for EW programs is a potential issue for Congress, with approximately $9.7 billion requested for the EW portfolio in FY2021. The DOD requested a significant increase in funding for electronic warfare systems in FY2021, with a $662.5 million increase compared to FY2019 projections. Congress may question if $10.2 billion is sufficient for DOD missions or if it is too much. They may also inquire about unique vs. overlapping programs and historical funding levels for EW. Congress could use spending ratios to assess the current portfolio. The current portfolio of EW programs is highly classified, making it difficult to assess DOD's spending on EW. This lack of unclassified information poses an oversight issue for Congress. Some argue that DOD has not prioritized EW in recent years, but budget projections suggest a shift towards increased investment. Congress may consider requiring DOD to report all EW-related funding for procurements to ensure transparency and prevent funding from other sources. The EW EXCOM notes that many procurement programs include EW-related spending. The EW EXCOM has highlighted the challenge of differentiating between procurement programs with EW-related spending. This report does not cover all EW-related programs, potentially missing some funding. Congress may require DOD to report all EW-related procurements separately. The FY2019 NDAA mandated an independent assessment of DOD's EW plans and programs, including U.S. and adversary programs, orders of battle, and doctrine. The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments conducted a study on adversary programs, orders of battle, and doctrine to recommend countermeasures for the U.S. military. The FY2020 NDAA required a similar study on electronic warfare programs and plans, urging DOD to update its 2017 Electronic Warfare Strategy. Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to integrate and enhance EW mission areas across DOD for competitive advantage in the electromagnetic spectrum. The FY2020 NDAA required the Department of Defense to develop a defense-wide strategy for electronic attack operations, including countering activities by malign actors. The strategy was delivered in 2019, but much of the detail remains classified."
