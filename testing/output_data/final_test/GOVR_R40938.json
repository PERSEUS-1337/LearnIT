The Supreme Court upheld that Ch\u00e1vez could take the oath of office at a later date when his health improves, despite opposition leaders arguing for an interim President. Henrique Capriles accepted the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution. On December 16, 2012, Venezuela held state elections where President Ch\u00e1vez's party won 20 out of 23 states. Opposition candidate Henrique Capriles won in Miranda. Ch\u00e1vez announced his cancer had returned and supported Vice President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. President Ch\u00e1vez faced health complications after his surgery in December 2012. He won reelection in October 2012 with 55% of the vote. The White House congratulated the Venezuelan people on the peaceful election process. Venezuelan security forces captured Colombian drug trafficker Daniel Barrera in 2012. Venezuela has undergone political changes under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, raising concerns about democratic institutions and freedom of expression. Ch\u00e1vez was elected in 1998, transforming the political system with significant support from Venezuelans. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's election in 1998 marked a rejection of Venezuela's traditional parties due to mismanagement of oil wealth and corruption. Ch\u00e1vez, representing the Patriotic Pole coalition, focused on constitutional reform to address elite dominance and misuse of state oil revenues. Venezuela experienced political stability from 1958 to 1989, but faced economic and political challenges afterwards. President Carlos Andres Perez's austerity program led to riots and violence, with two military coups attempted in 1992. Perez was dismissed in 1993 for misusing public funds, and Rafael Caldera brought some stability as president in December 1993. Rafael Caldera became president in December 1993, bringing political stability. However, his government faced a severe banking crisis costing over $10 billion. Despite some economic improvement in 1997, a sharp drop in oil prices led to a deep recession in 1998. Under President Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela underwent significant political changes, leading to the establishment of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in 1999 through a new constitution approved by the people. President Ch\u00e1vez implemented political reforms in Venezuela, including the elimination of the Senate and the establishment of a unicameral National Assembly. He also extended the presidential term to six years with the possibility of immediate reelection. In the 2000 mega-election, Ch\u00e1vez easily won a second term with 60% of the vote. However, his popularity declined after 2001 due to concerns about his leftist agenda and government effectiveness. In April 2002, massive opposition protests and military pressure led to the brief ouster of Ch\u00e1vez from power. He was restored by the military after an interim president's hardline measures alienated the public. The political opposition continued to press for his removal through a general strike and a recall referendum in 2004, which Ch\u00e1vez won by a substantial margin. In response, the Ch\u00e1vez government purged and packed the Supreme Court with its own supporters, undermining judicial independence. The rise in world oil prices from 2004 fueled Venezuela's economy, leading to the implementation of social programs that reduced poverty by 20% by 2007. Despite concerns of radicalization, Ch\u00e1vez was reelected in 2006 with 63% of the vote. The closure of a critical television station in May 2007 sparked protests and global condemnation. In 2007, the closure of Caracas Television (RCTV) led to protests and worldwide condemnation. President Ch\u00e1vez's proposed constitutional amendment package for \"socialism in the 21st century\" was defeated in a December 2007 referendum. University students played a key role in both the RCTV protests and defeating the constitutional reform. In 2008, Ch\u00e1vez formed the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) to unite his supporters. The government continued nationalizing key industries like food, cement, and steel, following previous nationalizations of electricity and telecommunications companies. In 2008, state and local elections in Venezuela showed mixed support for the government and opposition. Pro-Ch\u00e1vez candidates won most governor races, while the opposition secured governorships in key states. Pro-Ch\u00e1vez candidates also dominated mayoral races, with the opposition winning some municipalities, including Caracas. In 2008, state and local elections in Venezuela showed mixed support for the government and opposition. Pro-Ch\u00e1vez candidates won most governor races, while the opposition secured governorships in key states. The opposition includes newer parties such as Primero Justicia (PJ), Proyecto Venezuela, and Un Nuevo Tempo (UNT), as well as leftist parties that defected from the Chavista coalition. In 2008, Venezuela's Supreme Court upheld the disqualification of 272 individuals from running for office, including high-profile opposition candidates like Leopoldo L\u00f3pez. The government claimed most disqualified were its own supporters, while the opposition argued otherwise. In November 2008, President Ch\u00e1vez announced plans to seek changes to the constitution to lift the two-term limit for the presidency. The National Assembly voted to hold a referendum on the constitutional amendment, expanding it to apply to all elected officials. Venezuelans approved the reform in February 2009 with a 55% vote in favor. President Ch\u00e1vez proclaimed victory after a referendum in February 2009, with 55% voting in favor of lifting the two-term limit for the presidency. The amendment was controversial due to the defeat of a similar reform package in December 2007. Opposition argued the 2009 amendment was illegal as it violated the constitution's prohibition on reintroducing rejected reforms in the same period. Student groups were active in opposing both reform efforts. During the 2009 referendum campaign, Venezuelan security forces used force to disperse student protests against the abolishment of term limits. President Ch\u00e1vez campaigned for the constitutional change, arguing it would not guarantee his reelection indefinitely but allow him to continue his revolutionary project until 2019. Opposition parties, including Podemos, united against the referendum. President Ch\u00e1vez campaigned vigorously for the amendment to abolish term limits, citing economic problems and the need to maintain support. His popularity among poor Venezuelans, driven by social programs, played a crucial role. The National Assembly, dominated by Ch\u00e1vez supporters, also influenced the referendum's outcome. In the 2010 legislative elections in Venezuela, pro-Ch\u00e1vez supporters won 98 seats while opposition parties won 67 seats. President Ch\u00e1vez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) won 94 seats, with other government supporters winning additional seats. The opposition coalition known as the Democratic Unity Platform (MUD) won 65 seats. Overall, nationwide participation was high at 66.45%. In the 2010 legislative elections in Venezuela, the ruling party fell short of the three-fifths majority needed for decree powers, despite winning a majority of seats. The combined opposition narrowly won the popular vote with 51%, but the government maintained control due to support in rural districts. In the 2010 legislative elections in Venezuela, the ruling party, President Ch\u00e1vez's PSUV, did not secure a three-fifths majority for decree powers despite redrawing electoral districts. The opposition coalition gained substantial representation, benefiting from public concerns about the economic situation and high crime rates. President Ch\u00e1vez's popularity had declined to less than 40%, leading to a challenging electoral environment. The Venezuelan government faced economic challenges and high crime rates during the 2010 legislative elections. Despite criticism for not allowing international observers, the elections were monitored by domestic organizations with almost 2,500 observers. Laws passed before the new National Assembly inauguration were seen as threats to free speech and democratic governance. The outgoing National Assembly approved an \"enabling law\" in early January 2011, granting President Ch\u00e1vez decree powers for 18 months. This was criticized by the US and WOLA for undermining the new assembly's authority. President Ch\u00e1vez used the law over 50 times, making significant changes like nationalizing the gold industry. The National Assembly approved measures including changes to broadcast media laws and restrictions on Venezuelan human rights groups. President Ch\u00e1vez won reelection in the 2012 presidential election with a record turnout. President Ch\u00e1vez won reelection in the October 7, 2012 presidential election with 55% of the vote, compared to 44% for opposition candidate Henrique Capriles. Venezuelans approved a constitutional referendum in 2009 abolishing term limits for elected officials, allowing Ch\u00e1vez to run for another term. The presidential inauguration is set for January 10, 2013. Venezuela's opposition held a primary in February 2012, choosing Henrique Capriles Radonski as their candidate with 62% of the vote. Capriles, a member of the Primero Justicia party, is the governor of Miranda. Just over 2.9 million Venezuelans voted in the primary, representing 16% of registered voters. Capriles focused on reconciliation and national unity in his campaign. Henrique Capriles Radonski, chosen as the opposition candidate in the primary election, focused on reconciliation and national unity. Despite being the underdog in the general election race against President Ch\u00e1vez, Capriles showed potential for an upset victory according to some polls. Capriles had potential for an upset victory in the election, focusing on energizing his campaign with multiple rallies. Ch\u00e1vez, despite health issues, had advantages with a strong economy and loyalty from supporters due to social programs. Critics argue that the housing program under Ch\u00e1vez was aimed at boosting his popularity for the upcoming election, using state resources and media for campaign purposes. Despite his dominance in television media, Ch\u00e1vez faced challenges due to concerns about crime rates, economic mismanagement, and shortages of food and electricity. In 2012, Ch\u00e1vez's health status was a wildcard in the presidential race, but he claimed to have recovered from cancer. Capriles had more campaign appearances than Ch\u00e1vez. Concerns arose about the Venezuelan military's reaction to an opposition victory. General Rangel stated that the military supported the socialist project and would not back an opposition government. In 2012, concerns were raised about potential violence in the Venezuelan presidential race, with fears of radical elements on both sides resorting to violence if their candidate lost. Two supporters of Capriles were shot and killed during a campaign event, leading to accusations of rising violence by Ch\u00e1vez supporters. Despite these concerns, Ch\u00e1vez won reelection with 55.25% of the vote. President Ch\u00e1vez won reelection in 2012 with 55.25% of the vote, receiving over 8.1 million votes. He won all but two of Venezuela's 23 states, with a narrow victory in Capriles's home state of Miranda. The election day was peaceful with minor irregularities reported. Capriles congratulated the Venezuelan people on their high participation in the election and accepted defeat graciously. He announced his intention to run for reelection as governor of Miranda state in the upcoming regional elections. The 2012 presidential election in Venezuela showed a significant strengthening of support for the opposition, with Capriles receiving about 2.2 million more votes than in the previous election. Despite his loss, an opposition victory would have potentially reduced tensions in bilateral relations with the United States. President Ch\u00e1vez secured his fourth presidential victory, affirming his popular support and government's social programs. In the December 16, 2012 state elections in Venezuela, President Ch\u00e1vez and the PSUV won 20 out of 23 states, solidifying their support. Despite being in Cuba for cancer treatment, Ch\u00e1vez's party secured a strong victory, with opposition candidates only winning three states. President Ch\u00e1vez's health issues have raised concerns about Venezuela's political future, with a fourth surgery in December 2012 leading to the indefinite postponement of the presidential inauguration. Despite this, opposition candidates only won three states in the December 2012 elections, solidifying Ch\u00e1vez's support. President Ch\u00e1vez's health issues began in June 2011 with emergency surgery for a pelvic abscess and a cancerous tumor removal. He announced his battle with cancer in July 2011, underwent chemotherapy in Cuba, and declared victory over cancer by October. Ch\u00e1vez appeared frail, reducing public appearances, including his TV program. In late 2011, Ch\u00e1vez resumed public appearances, hosting foreign leaders and returning to his TV program. However, in January 2012, he gave a lengthy speech to show his improved health. Shortly after, a new lesion was found, leading to surgery in Cuba in February 2012. Ch\u00e1vez battled cancer, undergoing multiple treatments in Cuba. Despite claiming to be cancer-free in July 2012, he later announced a recurrence and underwent a fourth surgery. He expressed support for Vice President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in case of his absence. Ch\u00e1vez, battling cancer, appointed Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as his successor in case of his absence. Complications arose after his December 11 surgery, leading to respiratory issues. Maduro announced on January 8, 2013, that Ch\u00e1vez would not be sworn in as scheduled on January 10. This uncertainty has impacted Venezuela's political system. On January 9, 2013, Venezuela's Supreme Court upheld the interpretation of Article 231 of the Constitution, allowing President Ch\u00e1vez to take the oath of office at a later date due to his health condition. This decision also allowed current government officials to continue exercising their functions, including Vice President Maduro. The Court President clarified that Ch\u00e1vez's medical treatment in Cuba fell under Article 231, not Article 234, which deals with temporary absences. The Supreme Court upheld the interpretation of Article 231, allowing President Ch\u00e1vez to delay his oath of office due to his health condition. Some argued for interim President until new election or recovery. Opposition leader Capriles accepted the court's decision but expressed ongoing uncertainties. Capriles accuses the court of being politically motivated in their decision regarding Ch\u00e1vez's inauguration delay. Latin American leaders express hope for Ch\u00e1vez's recovery and support for the delay. The State Department emphasizes that the succession issue is for Venezuelans to decide. The State Department emphasizes that Venezuelans must decide on a democratic and transparent transition in Venezuela. If President Ch\u00e1vez does not recover, a new presidential election will be held within 30 days as per the Constitution. Henrique Capriles is likely to be the opposition candidate in the scenario of a new election. Venezuela's major economic sector is petroleum, accounting for 90% of exports and half of the government's fiscal income. Despite its oil wealth, economic conditions deteriorated in the 1990s, with poverty levels increasing from 32.2% to 48.5% between 1991 and 2000. If President Ch\u00e1vez does not recover, a new election will be held within 30 days, with Vice President Maduro likely to run as a Chavista candidate to protect Ch\u00e1vez's legacy. Between 1991 and 2000, poverty levels in Venezuela increased from 32.2% to 48.5%, while extreme poverty rose from 11.8% to 23.5% by 2000. Political instability and polarization in 2002-2003 led to economic decline, with a national strike causing a contraction of the economy. However, from 2004-2008, Venezuela experienced economic growth due to rising oil prices, with the economy growing by over 18% in 2004 and averaging 8.6% annually from 2005 to 2008. President Ch\u00e1vez utilized the economic boom to advance his \"Bolivarian revolution\" by implementing state-led development models, renegotiating contracts with foreign investors for government control, and nationalizing various industries. This allowed for increased spending on social programs known as misiones, covering education, health, nutrition, and more. The Venezuelan government implemented various social programs, including education, health, nutrition, and housing, to reduce poverty rates from 48.6% in 2002 to 27.6% in 2008. However, the global financial crisis and oil price drop caused economic contraction in 2009 and 2010. Poverty rates slightly increased in 2010 but economic growth resumed in 2011 due to higher oil prices and increased government spending. The Venezuelan government increased fiscal spending to support Ch\u00e1vez in the 2012 presidential election, leading to 5% estimated growth. However, high inflation rates and shortages of basic goods have posed significant economic challenges. The government has nationalized some domestic producers in response to the shortages, causing tension with the private sector. Since 2002, companies in various sectors have been nationalized in Venezuela, including energy, food, finance, and telecommunications. The government has faced criticism for nationalizing companies without compensation or legal procedures. Foreign companies often resort to international arbitration for settlements. In Venezuela, foreign companies have faced nationalization without compensation. ExxonMobil won a $900 million settlement in 2012, but has another case pending at ICSID. President Ch\u00e1vez rejected ICSID decisions and started the process to withdraw from the organization, which could take up to 15 years. In January 2010, Venezuela devalued its currency, the bolivar fuerte, to boost government revenues. The government established multiple fixed exchange rates, leading to increased revenue but also inflationary pressure. In January 2011, the government unified the exchange rates by eliminating the lower rate for essential imports. The government of Venezuela has adjusted its exchange rates, moving to a rate of BsF4.3/U.S.$1 for all imports, aiming to simplify the system. Concerns about inflation have been raised, with analysts predicting a potential devaluation of the currency in 2013 due to its overvaluation. Venezuela heavily relies on oil exports, which make up 90% of its exports, leading to a positive trade balance. Venezuela's trade surplus grew from $16.7 billion in 2003 to a high of $44 billion in 2008 as oil prices increased. However, the decline in oil prices in 2009 led to a decrease in exports, reducing the trade surplus to almost $18 billion. With the recovery of oil prices, the trade surplus grew to $46 billion in 2011. Venezuela's economy heavily relies on oil exports, with the United States being a major market, although its share of Venezuela's oil exports has been declining. In 2010, about 29% of Venezuela's imports were from the United States, down from 38% ten years earlier. The United States remains the largest origin of Venezuelan imports, despite declining percentages over time. Relations between the United States and Venezuela have been strained due to concerns about human rights, military arms purchases, and alliances with Cuba and Iran. Relations between the United States and Venezuela have been strained due to concerns about human rights, military arms purchases, alliances with Cuba and Iran, and Venezuelan territory being used by Colombian guerrilla and paramilitary forces. The U.S. has designated Venezuela annually as failing to adhere to international anti-drug obligations since 2005, leading to restrictions on defense sales since 2006. Tensions escalated after President Ch\u00e1vez's brief ouster in 2002, with Venezuela alleging U.S. involvement, which the U.S. denied. After Ch\u00e1vez's ouster, the United States expressed solidarity with the Venezuelan people, citing undemocratic actions by the Ch\u00e1vez administration as the cause. The interim government, however, took drastic measures like dismantling the National Assembly and suspending the Constitution, losing support from the military and paving the way for Ch\u00e1vez's return to power. The U.S. urged Ch\u00e1vez to govern democratically, while many Latin American nations condemned the coup. Many Latin American nations condemned the overthrow of Ch\u00e1vez as a coup, leading to deteriorating U.S.-Venezuelan relations. The perception of U.S. support for efforts to remove Ch\u00e1vez contributed to tensions. Political rhetoric escalated from 2002 to 2006, but toned down in the second half of 2006 after Ch\u00e1vez criticized President Bush at the United Nations. In 2008, U.S. policy towards Venezuela focused on positive engagement with Latin America, despite tensions over potential links between the Venezuelan government and the FARC. President Ch\u00e1vez urged the FARC to end its armed struggle, leading to a shift in policy towards refraining from conflicts with him. In 2008, U.S. policy towards Venezuela aimed for positive engagement despite tensions. Assistant Secretary of State Tom Shannon expressed commitment to improving relations with Venezuela. However, relations soured when Venezuela expelled U.S. Ambassador Patrick Duddy in solidarity with Bolivia. In September 2008, the United States expelled the Venezuelan Ambassador in response to accusations of fomenting unrest. The U.S. also criticized Venezuela's efforts against drug trafficking and froze the assets of high-ranking Venezuelan officials for alleged ties to the FARC. In October, assets of an Iranian-owned bank in Caracas were frozen for links to Iran's ministry of defense. During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, Barack Obama emphasized principled bilateral diplomacy. Barack Obama's Administration aimed to engage with adversaries like Venezuela's President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez through principled diplomacy. Despite tensions and diplomatic disputes, the U.S. remained committed to constructive engagement with Venezuela, focusing on anti-drug and counter-terrorism efforts. In 2009, Ambassadors were returned, but in 2010, an agreement for a U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela was revoked, leading to further diplomatic tensions. In 2009, President Obama expressed concerns about Venezuela's assistance to the FARC, leading to tensions with President Ch\u00e1vez. However, Ch\u00e1vez later expressed interest in restoring bilateral relations to Clinton-era levels. At the fifth Summit of the Americas, Obama met with Ch\u00e1vez and other leaders, with Ch\u00e1vez open to the return of the U.S. Ambassador to Caracas. In June 2009, the United States and Venezuela agreed to return respective ambassadors, with U.S. Ambassador Patrick Duddy resuming his post in Caracas and Venezuelan Ambassador Bernardo Alvarez returning to Washington, DC. Despite hopes for improved relations, Secretary of State Clinton emphasized the need for dialogue between the two countries on various issues. Clinton also expressed hope for strong leadership in Venezuela without resorting to authoritarian measures. State Department officials expressed concerns about media intimidation and political restrictions in Venezuela. Secretary of State Clinton questioned Venezuela's military purchases. In 2010, Director of National Intelligence Blair testified on Chavez's authoritarian political model undermining democracy. Chavez's regional influence may have peaked, but he continues to support political allies in neighboring countries. President Ch\u00e1vez's regional influence may have peaked, but he is likely to support likeminded political allies and movements in neighboring countries and seek to undermine moderate, pro-U.S. governments. Ch\u00e1vez and his allies are expected to oppose nearly every U.S. policy initiative in the region, including free trade, counter drug and counterterrorism cooperation, military training, security initiatives, and U.S. assistance programs. In 2010, the Venezuelan government criticized comments by U.S. Ambassador-designate Larry Palmer and officially revoked its agreement for his appointment as Ambassador. In December 2010, Venezuela revoked its agreement for Larry Palmer's appointment as Ambassador, leading to the State Department revoking Ambassador Bernardo Alvarez's diplomatic visa. The full Senate did not act on Palmer's nomination by the end of the 111th Congress. In February 2011, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified about President Ch\u00e1vez's declining influence in Latin America due to economic conditions and waning popularity. Assistant Secretary of State Arturo Valenzuela criticized Venezuela's National Assembly for approving a law delegating powers in December 2010. In 2010, Venezuela's National Assembly approved a law delegating legislative authority to the executive for 18 months, criticized by Arturo Valenzuela for undermining the incoming National Assembly's authority. The US State Department determined Venezuela's lack of cooperation with antiterrorism efforts for the sixth year, leading to a continuation of the arms embargo since 2006. Additionally, on May 24, 2011, the State Department sanctioned the Venezuelan oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PdVSA), under the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Act. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Act of 2010 sanctioned Venezuela's oil company, PdVSA, for providing two shipments of reformate to Iran. The sanctions restrict PdVSA from U.S. government contracts and financing but exclude its subsidiaries. President Obama also criticized Venezuela for failing to meet international counternarcotics measures for the seventh consecutive year. The determination maintained that individuals in the Venezuelan government and security forces were involved in drug trafficking activities. Positive steps were noted, such as transferring major drug traffickers and signing a counternarcotics agreement with Colombia. In 2012-2013, the Venezuelan Consul General in Miami was declared persona non grata, and allegations were made about Iranian and Venezuelan diplomats recruiting students for cyberattacks against the United States. The State Department issued the 2012 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, highlighting Venezuela as a preferred trafficking route for cocaine. President Obama expressed concerns about Venezuela's democracy and fair elections. The US remained open to deepening anti-drug cooperation with Venezuela. The Obama Administration does not view President Ch\u00e1vez's actions as a serious national security threat, with General Douglas Fraser also stating that Venezuela is not seen as a threat. After Ch\u00e1vez's reelection in October 2012, the US congratulated the Venezuelan people on their participation in the peaceful electoral process. In November 2012, discussions were held to improve bilateral relations and enhance cooperation. The State Department is open to dialogue with Venezuela on various issues, including counternarcotics cooperation. They emphasize the importance of a democratic and legal political succession in Venezuela. The United States has traditionally provided small amounts of foreign assistance to Venezuela, focusing on counternarcotics and democracy programs. Assistance levels have varied over the years, with a shift away from counternarcotics assistance since FY2008. In FY2009, $0.5 million in INCLE assistance was provided. The United States has provided democracy-related assistance to Venezuela through various foreign aid accounts and government-funded organizations. USAID supported democracy projects in Venezuela from 2002 to 2010 to monitor democratic stability and strengthen institutions. Over 600 small-grant and technical assistance activities were funded during this period. From 2002 to 2010, USAID funded assistance activities in Venezuela to enhance access to information, promote citizen participation, and democratic leadership. In FY2011 and FY2012, the US provided $5 million and $6 million each year for democracy assistance, with a request for $3 million in FY2013. The assistance aims to promote good governance, raise awareness about social issues, increase confidence in the democratic process, and encourage citizen participation. The report on FY2013 foreign aid appropriations directs $5 million for democracy programs in Venezuela, with differing recommendations between the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The 112th Congress approved a Continuing Appropriations Resolution, FY2013, funding foreign aid at the same level as FY2012. The 113th Congress will need to address foreign aid appropriations for the balance of FY2013, with NED funding democracy projects in Venezuela since 1992. Funding for these projects increased under the Ch\u00e1vez government, with amounts ranging from $800,000 in FY2007 to $1.53 million in FY2011. The Venezuelan government and Ch\u00e1vez supporters have strongly criticized U.S. government funding for democracy projects in Venezuela. Critics argue that NED-funded groups in Venezuela are involved in domestic politics, supporting claims of U.S. regime change. U.S. officials defend democracy promotion activities, criticizing Venezuelan government's intimidation tactics against S\u00famate leaders. The State Department denies charges against the government in Venezuela, calling them an attempt to intimidate civil society. NED's program in Venezuela focuses on promoting citizen participation, civil and political rights, freedom of expression, and conflict mediation. Congress reaffirmed NED's duty to adhere to core principles in 2004. Venezuela's National Assembly approved a measure in 2010 that could hinder foreign assistance to civil society groups. The legislation in Venezuela prohibits civil society organizations from receiving international funds for defending political rights or monitoring government bodies, causing concerns among human rights organizations and U.S. officials about the deteriorating democratic institutions and threats to freedom of speech and press under the Ch\u00e1vez government. The government in Venezuela has undermined free expression, workers' freedom of association, and human rights groups' ability to protect rights. A Human Rights Watch report from July 2012 highlighted the worsening human rights situation in the country, citing legislation that expanded government powers to limit free speech and suppress critics. The Supreme Court has rejected the idea of serving as a check on presidential power and dismissed the authority of the Inter-American system of human rights. President Ch\u00e1vez has prevented the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights from visiting Venezuela for almost a decade and announced the country's withdrawal from the system in July 2012. The Venezuelan government under President Ch\u00e1vez has been criticized for undermining free expression, workers' freedom of association, and human rights groups' ability to protect rights. The State Department's 2011 human rights report highlighted government actions to impede freedom of expression and criminalize dissent, including harassment and intimidation of media outlets and journalists. The accumulation of power in the executive has allowed the government to intimidate, censor, and prosecute critics. The State Department report criticizes Venezuela for judicial intimidation, unlawful killings, torture, prison violence, arbitrary arrests, and threats against NGOs. Prison violence was highlighted in a clash resulting in 25 deaths. The report also mentions political prisoners, with a Venezuelan NGO listing 13 by August 2012. In Venezuela, there were 13 political prisoners by August 2012, with some being released after varying lengths of detention. Judge Mar\u00eda Lourdes Afiuni was arrested in 2009 after ordering the release of a businessman imprisoned since 2007. President Ch\u00e1vez called for a 30-year sentence for the judge, leading to criticism from U.N. human rights experts. Judge Afiuni was held in poor conditions for over a year. Judge Afiuni was held in deplorable conditions for over a year, insulted and threatened by inmates. She received inadequate health treatment until released from prison and placed under house arrest on February 2, 2011. International human rights groups called for charges to be dropped. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention asked Venezuela to release her, stating her detention was retaliation. Afiuni revealed in a 2012 interview that she was raped in 2010 while in prison and had an abortion. In May 2010, retired General Ra\u00fal Baduel was sentenced to 7 years and 11 months in prison on corruption charges. Hunger strikes have been used as a form of protest in Venezuela, with Franklin Brito dying during one in 2010. In 2011, over 80 students ended a 23-day hunger strike after the government agreed to review cases of alleged political prisoners. In May 2011, a former PdVSA employee died after a hunger strike protesting firings. In November 2011, jailed editor Leocenis Garcia was released after a hunger strike. NGOs and human rights organizations expressed concern about legislation restricting civil society organizations. The Ch\u00e1vez government in Venezuela has restricted international funding for human rights organizations, limited freedom of speech and press through legal harassment and discrimination against media outlets, and expanded state-owned media to counter perceived media imbalance. The Committee to Protect Journalists documented the Ch\u00e1vez government's attacks on private media and establishment of state media for propaganda. The closure of RCTV in 2007 led to protests and condemnation worldwide. RCTV was allowed to operate as a subscription-based cable station but was taken off the air in January 2010. In January 2010, the Venezuelan government removed RCTV-Internacional from the air, along with five other stations. This action was believed to be an attempt to silence RCTV-Internacional, which had been critical of the Ch\u00e1vez government. The government claimed the stations violated broadcasting laws by not airing government announcements and presidential speeches. This decision was influenced by a decree stating that cable stations must have 70% foreign programming to be considered international. The government shutdown RCTV-Internacional and five other stations on January 24, 2010, leading to widespread criticism from domestic and international entities. OAS Special Rapporteur and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed strong opposition, while human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch and Reporters without Borders also criticized Venezuela's actions. Globovisi\u00f3n, a critical television news station, was also targeted by the government in 2009. Globovisi\u00f3n, a critical television news station, faced government crackdowns and fines for its coverage, including the arrest of its president for offensive remarks against President Ch\u00e1vez. In 2011, the station was fined $2.1 million for its reporting on a prison standoff, and in 2012, it was attacked, leading to condemnation by the Committee to Protect Journalists. In early March 2012, Globovisi\u00f3n journalists covering an opposition rally were attacked by members of the ruling PSUV. In June 2012, Globovisi\u00f3n agreed to pay a $2.1 million fine after Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered its assets frozen. The Ch\u00e1vez government targeted 240 radio stations for license revocation in 2009, leading to the closure of 32 stations. Press rights groups criticized these actions as government attempts to control media and suppress dissent. In Venezuela, privately owned newspapers face self-censorship due to reliance on government advertising. Press rights groups criticized the prosecution of a journalist for reporting on nepotism and a court's ban on publishing violence images before elections. The director of a political magazine was murdered in 2009 after covering drug trafficking cases. In Venezuela, a former police officer was convicted for the murder of a magazine director who covered drug trafficking cases. The presumed instigator, Walid Makled Garcia, was arrested in Colombia and extradited to Venezuela in 2011. Another journalist, Wilfred Iv\u00e1n Ojeda, was shot and killed in 2011, prompting calls for a thorough investigation. Additionally, a Venezuelan newspaper was temporarily closed in 2011, with two executives charged for inciting hatred. In Venezuela, the newspaper 6to Poder was temporarily closed in 2011, and two executives were charged for inciting hatred and insulting public officials. The editor, Leocenis Garcia, was imprisoned but released after a hunger strike. Anti-Semitic acts have been on the rise in Venezuela, with an increase in vandalism, caricatures, and expressions of hatred towards the Jewish community. In Venezuela, there has been a rise in anti-Semitic acts, including vandalism, caricatures, and expressions of hatred towards the Jewish community. Government-affiliated media outlets have broadcasted anti-Semitic comments, and there have been incidents of anti-Semitic rhetoric, graffiti, and property vandalism. In 2009, a Caracas synagogue was vandalized, leading to criminal charges against 11 individuals, including 8 police officers. President Ch\u00e1vez called on the Jewish community to denounce Israel's actions, while the government orchestrated anti-Israel demonstrations. In response to the 2009 synagogue attack in Venezuela, government officials, including President Ch\u00e1vez, condemned the incident and promised to ensure the safety of the Jewish community. The State Department and Members of Congress also spoke out against the attack, calling for an end to the intimidation and harassment faced by the Jewish community. In the aftermath of the 2010 Gaza flotilla incident, Venezuelan government's anti-Israeli rhetoric led to continued anti-Semitic language in the media. Jewish leaders raised concerns about anti-Semitism in state-owned media during a meeting with President Ch\u00e1vez. In 2011, a state-owned radio station featured readings from the anti-Semitic \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\" and in 2012, attacks in the media portrayed opposition candidate Capriles negatively due to his Jewish heritage. Capriles, a practicing Catholic, is the grandson of Polish Jewish immigrants who survived the Holocaust. Venezuela is a major supplier of oil to the US, exporting 944,000 barrels per day in 2011, totaling $42 billion in exports. PdVSA, Venezuela's state-run oil company, owns CITGO, which operates three crude oil refineries. Venezuela, a major oil supplier to the US, is diversifying its export destinations. China has become a significant importer of Venezuelan crude oil. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the hemisphere and the second-largest natural gas reserves after the US. Venezuela's proven natural gas reserves are mainly associated with oil production. In 2009, Repsol YPF discovered a major offshore gas field in the Gulf of Venezuela. Under President Ch\u00e1vez, the government increased control over oil reserves by converting operating agreements with foreign companies to joint ventures. Chevron and BP were among the companies affected by this change. Venezuela's oil production has been declining in recent years, with Chevron, PetroVietnam, CNPC, Eni, Petronas, Repsol, and other foreign companies partnering with PdVSA for Orinoco Belt resources. Production was around 2.36 million barrels per day in 2010, down from 2.64 mbd in 2008. The decrease is attributed to natural decline, maintenance issues, and older field problems. Oil production in Venezuela has been declining due to natural decline, maintenance issues, and compliance with OPEC production cuts. Despite this, total oil production in 2011 increased to 2.47 mbd, with crude oil accounting for 2.24 mbd. Venezuela has continued to be a major supplier of oil to the United States, although there have been concerns about the security of this supply due to threats made by Ch\u00e1vez. In 2006, the Government Accountability Office issued a report on the potential disruption of Venezuelan oil supply. An explosion at a Venezuelan oil refinery in 2012 raised concerns about neglect in maintenance and safety by the government. The largest oil union called for the resignation of the head of PdVSA, Rafael Ramirez. Critics accused President Ch\u00e1vez of using PdVSA funds for social programs instead of infrastructure investment. Venezuela's border with Colombia is a major transit route for drugs. Venezuela's extensive border with Colombia serves as a major transit route for drugs destined for the United States. In 2005, Venezuela suspended cooperation with the U.S. DEA due to allegations of spying. Despite being designated as a country failing to adhere to international narcotics agreements, economic sanctions were waived by Presidents Bush and Obama to support democracy programs in Venezuela. In 2012, Venezuela was designated for the eighth consecutive year as not adhering to anti-drug obligations. The United States and Venezuela were close to signing an anti-drug cooperation agreement in 2006, but Venezuelan approval has not happened yet. The Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 14 Venezuelans for narcotics trafficking, including seven officials. Assets of two senior Venezuelan intelligence officials were frozen in September 2008. The assets of Venezuelan officials General Hugo Carvajal, General Henry Rangel, and former interior minister Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez Chac\u00edn were frozen for allegedly aiding FARC in drug and weapons trafficking. General Rangel later became defense minister and then governor of Trujillo, while Rodr\u00edguez Chac\u00edn became governor of Gu\u00e1rico. In 2011, four more Venezuelan officials were sanctioned for supporting FARC's activities. Some Venezuelan military officials, including General Henry Rangel and General Cliver Alcala Cordones, have been linked to drug trafficking activities. There are concerns that elements of the Venezuelan military are increasingly involved in drug trafficking, with reports suggesting they have taken direct control of drug shipments and routes. President Ch\u00e1vez was reportedly pressured by military leaders involved in drug trafficking to negotiate the extradition of Venezuelan drug trafficker Walid Makled. Increased counternarcotics cooperation between Venezuela and Colombia since 2010 has led to the arrest of several top Colombian drug traffickers in Venezuela. Most recently, Daniel Barrera, also known as \"El Loco,\" was captured in September 2012 in Tachira state. Barrera had been overseeing the flow of drugs from Colombia through Venezuela to outside markets since 2008. He was on the U.S. Treasury Department's drug kingpin list and indicted for cocaine trafficking to the United States. In September 2011, a Colombian drug trafficker was arrested for cocaine trafficking to the United States. His 2012 arrest was a result of cooperation among law enforcement officials from Colombia, Venezuela, Britain, and the United States. Venezuela was highlighted in the March 2012 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report as a preferred trafficking route for cocaine due to porous borders, weak judicial system, and corrupt political environment. The report estimated 161-212 metric tons of cocaine transiting through Venezuela. According to the 2012 INCSR, Venezuela seized 42 metric tons of drugs in 2011, including cocaine and marijuana. Three fugitives wanted on drug charges were deported to the United States in 2011. The State Department expressed readiness to deepen cooperation with Venezuela to counter drug trafficking. The INCSR suggested that improving cooperation between Venezuelan and U.S. law enforcement agencies, including signing the 2005 addendum to the 1978 Bilateral Counternarcotics MOU, could lead to joint counternarcotics projects and demand reduction programs. Other proposed cooperative activities include counternarcotics and anti-money laundering training programs, Venezuelan participation in the U.S. Coast Guard's International Port Security Program, and activation of the Container Inspection Facility at Puerto Cabello. These efforts aim to increase information exchange, aid in arrests, dismantle criminal networks, prosecute narcotraffickers, and reduce the flow of illicit drugs through Venezuelan airspace and land. President Obama determined that Venezuela had \"failed demonstrably\" in meeting international counternarcotics measures due to government and security forces' involvement in drug trafficking activities. Since ceasing cooperation with the DEA in 2005, bilateral counternarcotics efforts have been limited to fugitive deportations to the United States. The U.S. Coast Guard's activities in Venezuela mainly involve coordinating fugitive deportations to the United States and conducting maritime interdiction operations. Venezuela allows the Coast Guard to board Venezuelan-flagged vessels suspected of drug trafficking but demands the return of confiscated items without providing follow-up information. Despite some positive steps taken by Venezuela, such as transferring drug traffickers to the U.S. and Colombia, the U.S. has criticized Venezuela for not meeting international counternarcotics measures. The Venezuelan government has been taking significant antidrug measures, including international anti-drug cooperation agreements and participation in the OAS's Inter-American Drug Abuse Control of Drug Commission. They seized 63 metric tons of illicit drugs in 2010, with a zero tolerance policy towards drug trafficking and numerous drug-related arrests. They have increased patrols along the border with Colombia and acquired new radar stations and incinerators for drug disposal. The Colombian government acquired new radar stations and incinerators to combat drug trafficking. President Juan Manuel Santos announced the extradition of Venezuelan businessman Walid Makled Garcia, wanted for narcotics trafficking and several killings in Venezuela. Makled claimed to have close ties with high-level Venezuelan officials. Walid Makled Garcia alleged close links with Venezuelan officials, paid for favors and protection. President Ch\u00e1vez accused the US of using fabricated claims to justify an attack. Makled is wanted in the US for drug trafficking and was indicted for trafficking cocaine. President Obama designated him as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker. Colombia respected Venezuela's extradition request. President Santos respected Colombia's extradition processes but faced pressure from US Congress to extradite Makled to the United States instead of Venezuela. Makled alleged ties to Venezuelan officials and claimed to have paid off legislators and generals. He was questioned by US officials before his extradition on May 9, 2011. US officials had expressed concerns about Venezuela's military purchases. In January 2006, the United States denied licenses for the transfer of U.S. technology for military transport planes sold to Venezuela by Spanish companies. The proposed sale was seen as potentially destabilizing in Latin America. Spain initially planned to proceed with the sale using non-U.S. technology, but later canceled the deal due to economic reasons. Venezuela criticized the U.S. action as \"imperialist,\" and similar concerns were expressed to Brazil about military sales to Venezuela. Venezuela expressed interest in purchasing light-attack aircraft from Brazil, containing U.S. technology. The State Department prohibited the sale due to Venezuela's lack of cooperation in U.S. antiterrorism efforts. Venezuela turned to Russia for military equipment, buying fighter jets, helicopters, armored vehicles, air defense missiles, and small arms. Venezuela purchased Russian fighter jets due to the US refusal to sell spare parts for its aging F-16 fleet. President Ch\u00e1vez secured a $2.2 billion credit line from Russia in 2009 for military equipment, followed by a $4 billion deal in 2011. Concerns have been raised by US intelligence officials about Venezuela's military purchases and its potential to spark an arms race in the region. Venezuela's military build-up, particularly its purchases from Russia, has raised concerns among US intelligence officials and neighboring countries. The arms build-up could potentially fuel an arms race in the region, with Venezuela's military capabilities being three to four times what is necessary for external defense. There are also worries about rifles from Venezuela ending up in the hands of groups like the FARC, although officials have not confirmed this. The purpose behind Venezuela's military build-up is believed to be focused on using asymmetric capabilities and tactics, as well as empowering the population in a home guard sense. While Venezuela's military purchases from Russia have been significant, concerns have been raised about the country's overall military capabilities due to logistic, maintenance, and transportation shortfalls. Secretary of State Clinton urged transparency in Venezuela's arms purchases to prevent diversion to insurgent groups or criminal organizations. Despite acquiring over $6 billion worth of military equipment from Russia since 2005, US intelligence officials have noted that Venezuela's armed forces lack proper training and logistics. Venezuela has purchased over $6 billion worth of military equipment from Russia since 2005, but their armed forces lack training and logistics capacity. President Ch\u00e1vez defends the purchases as necessary for self-defense against the United States, while Foreign Minister Maduro dismisses U.S. criticisms. Venezuela's focus on countering U.S. influence in the region has waned, with deteriorating economic conditions and declining popularity for Ch\u00e1vez at home and abroad. President Ch\u00e1vez's declining popularity and economic conditions in Venezuela have limited his influence beyond his core allies. He supported Bolivia's Evo Morales and launched ALBA as an alternative to the Free Trade Area of the Americas, focusing on poverty reduction and cooperation in various areas. ALBA, launched in 2004 by Venezuela and Cuba, has expanded to include eight countries in areas like health, education, and finance. Despite some countries joining and leaving, ALBA has been criticized for spreading Ch\u00e1vez's influence in the region. Venezuela has provided significant assistance to Cuba through a preferential oil agreement. Cuba benefits from a preferential oil agreement with Venezuela, receiving over 90,000 barrels of oil per day. In return, Cuba provides various services to Venezuela, including medical personnel, advisers, and assistance in sports, education, agriculture, communications, and security programs. Venezuela has also made investments in Cuba, such as upgrading oil refineries and constructing joint projects like a nickel plant. Construction of a joint Cuban-Venezuelan nickel plant began in western Cuba in June 2010. Venezuela provides oil assistance to Cuba, which is crucial for the country's economy. President Ch\u00e1vez has used \"oil diplomacy\" to supply oil to other Caribbean nations through the PetroCaribe program, raising concerns about Venezuela's influence in the region. President Ch\u00e1vez used \"oil diplomacy\" to supply oil to Caribbean nations through the PetroCaribe program, offering financing up to 70% based on oil prices. Most Caribbean nations are members, with exceptions like Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. In Central America, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala joined PetroCaribe. Venezuela temporarily stopped oil exports to Honduras in 2009 but resumed in 2012. PetroCaribe aims to establish a regional supply network and development fund for participating countries. Favorable opinions of President Ch\u00e1vez in Latin America are weak, as shown in the Latinobar\u00f3metro survey. Despite a slight improvement in 2011 due to sympathy for his illness, he still ranked among the least favorite leaders. In contrast, President Obama remains highly popular in the Americas. U.S. officials have expressed concerns about Venezuela's lack of cooperation on antiterrorism efforts, sympathetic statements for Colombian terrorist groups, and relations with Cuba and Iran. Since May 2006, the United States has imposed an arms embargo on Venezuela due to concerns about its lack of cooperation on antiterrorism efforts and support for the FARC. Financial sanctions have been imposed on seven Venezuelan government and military officials for their ties to the FARC. The US imposed an arms embargo on Venezuela in May 2006 due to concerns about its support for the FARC. Financial sanctions were imposed on Venezuelan officials for aiding the FARC in weapons and drug trafficking. General Rangel and former interior minister Rodr\u00edguez Chac\u00edn were among those sanctioned. General Rangel later became defense minister and then governor of Trujillo, while Rodr\u00edguez Chac\u00edn became governor of Gu\u00e1rico. Additional sanctions were imposed on four more Venezuelan officials in September 2011 for supporting FARC's illegal activities. According to State Department testimony, Colombian-Venezuelan cooperation on terrorism and security is increasing, with Venezuela deporting FARC and ELN members to Colombia. President Ch\u00e1vez has called for a political reconciliation process with the FARC. Evidence suggests FARC members are still sheltering in Venezuela, though not as close to the border as before. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2011 noted Venezuela and Colombia's dialogue on security and border issues. President Ch\u00e1vez stated his government would not allow illegal armed groups in Venezuelan territory. Peace talks with the FARC began in 2012 with support from Venezuela and Chile. President Ch\u00e1vez emphasized the need for a political solution to the conflict. The 112th Congress approved the Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012, signed into law in December 2012, amid concerns about Iran's ties with Latin America. The Senate approved the Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012, requiring an assessment of threats posed by Iran in the region and a strategy to address them. The law aims to counter Iran's presence by working with allies and partners in the region. Iran's longstanding ties with Venezuela date back to their founding membership in OPEC in 1960. Iran increased its trade with Latin America, especially Brazil, during President Khatami's term. However, it was under President Ahmadinejad's rule in 2005 that Iran actively pursued diplomatic and economic ties with Latin American countries to overcome international isolation. The close relationship between Ahmadinejad and Ch\u00e1vez drove the strengthening of bilateral ties, leading to numerous agreements in construction, energy, and manufacturing sectors. During an April 2009 trip to Tehran, Ch\u00e1vez and Ahmadinejad inaugurated a new development bank for economic projects in both countries, with each country reportedly providing $100 million in initial capital. Weekly flights between the two countries began in 2007 but were curtailed in September 2010. The State Department expressed concern about these flights, citing lax immigration and customs controls. An April 2010 unclassified Department of Defense report to Congress on Iran's military power highlighted Iran's Qods Force increasing its presence in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela. In recent years, there have been allegations of Venezuela and Iran collaborating on a missile base, cyberattacks, and increased military presence in the region. However, the U.S. Southern Command maintains that Iran's focus in the region has been diplomatic and commercial, with no evidence of a significant military presence. Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed these claims as false, and the Department of State also refuted the allegations. In Mexico, attempts were made to recruit students for cyberattacks against the United States, but U.S. officials could not confirm the allegations. A Venezuelan diplomat, Livia Acosta, was expelled from the U.S. for her involvement. President Ahmadinejad visited Latin America, signing cooperation agreements with Venezuela in various fields including nanotechnology and technology. During a visit, President Ch\u00e1vez expressed solidarity with Iran, a target of U.S. imperialism. Venezuela has played a key role in Iran's relations with leftist governments in the region. Iranian President Ahmadinejad also visited Cuba, Nicaragua, and Ecuador, signing agreements with little evidence of fulfillment. Despite signing agreements during his tour of Latin America, analysts doubt that this will result in significant Iranian investment or financial support. Ahmadinejad's trip was seen as propaganda to show Iran's international relations and proximity to the United States, with some characterizing it as lackluster. The U.S. intelligence community remains concerned about Iran's connection with Venezuela, but Ahmadinejad's visit was deemed unsuccessful. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2011 noted Venezuela's cooperation with Iran, but President Obama and General Douglas Fraser downplayed the national security impact. The US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan companies and individuals for alleged support for Iran and Hezbollah. The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan individuals and companies for their support of Hezbollah, a Shiite group backed by Iran. Sanctions were imposed on Venezuelan Military Industries Company (CAVIM) in 2008 and Banco Internacional de Desarollo in 2008 under Executive Order 13382. The United States imposed sanctions on Banco Internacional de Desarollo, C.A., under Executive Order 13382 for its links to the Export Development Bank of Iran. Sanctions were also imposed on Venezuela's state oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA), for providing $50 million worth of reformate to Iran. The sanctions prohibited PdVSA from competing for U.S. government contracts, securing financing from the Export-Import Bank, and obtaining U.S. export licenses. In September 2009, President Ch\u00e1vez announced plans for a \"nuclear village\" in Venezuela with Iranian assistance for peaceful purposes, which raised concerns among U.S. officials. The transfer of Iranian nuclear technology to Venezuela would violate U.N. Security Council Resolutions. In September 2010, President Ch\u00e1vez considered starting a nuclear energy program, with Russia agreeing to help build a nuclear power plant in October 2010. However, after Japan's nuclear disaster in March 2011, Ch\u00e1vez halted the nuclear program. Conflicting statements were made in September 2009 regarding Iran's involvement in Venezuela's search for uranium deposits. Minister Rodolfo Sanz claimed Iran was assisting, but Minister Jesse Chacon denied it, while Minister Rafael Ramirez stated Venezuela had no plans to explore uranium. Ramirez stated that Venezuela lacks a plan to explore or exploit its uranium deposits, with no current mining activities. U.N. Resolution 1929 prohibits Iranian investment in foreign uranium projects. U.S. concerns about Iran's ties to Latin America include connections to Hezbollah, linked to bombings in Argentina. Sanctions have been imposed on individuals and companies in the region for supporting Hezbollah, including in Venezuela. In June 2008, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two Venezuelans for supporting Hezbollah. U.S. citizens are prohibited from transactions with them. In June 2012, sanctions were imposed on three dual Lebanese-Venezuelan citizens and a Venezuelan company involved in drug trafficking linked to Hezbollah. State Department reports indicate Hezbollah fundraising in Venezuela. The Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012 (H.R. 3783) was signed into law on December 28, 2012. It requires the Secretary of State to assess the threats posed by Iran's presence in the Western Hemisphere and develop a strategy to address them within 180 days. The strategy must include unclassified policy recommendations. The policy recommendations in H.Res. 247 aim to counter Iran's growing threat in the Western Hemisphere by working with allies and partners. H.R. 2542 calls for increased cooperation on counter-terrorism initiatives with Venezuela designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. Introduced July 14, 2011; referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs; ordered reported (amended) by the House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere December 15, 2011. The bill would withhold U.S. contributions to the OAS if Article 20 of the Inter-American Democratic Charter is not invoked regarding Venezuela's violation of the Charter. H.R. 2583 (Ros-Lehtinen). Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2012. Reported, amended, by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs September 23, 2011. Section 931 of the bill would have provided that no funds authorized under the Act. Section 931 of H.R. 5857/S. 3241 would restrict funds to governments of Argentina, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Ecuador, or Bolivia. The House bill allocates $5 million for democracy programs in Venezuela, while the Senate bill recommends $3 million through the National Endowment for Democracy. The 112th Congress did not complete action on a full-year foreign operations appropriations, but approved a Continuing Appropriations Resolution, FY2013 (P.L. 112-175), which funds regular foreign aid accounts at the same level as in FY2012. H.R. 6067 (Ros-Lehtinen) introduced the Western Hemisphere Security Cooperation Act of 2012, imposing restrictions on U.S. nuclear cooperation with countries assisting nuclear programs. The 112th Congress did not complete action on a full-year foreign operations appropriations but approved a Continuing Appropriations Resolution, FY2013 (P.L. 112-175), which funds regular foreign aid accounts at the same level as in FY2012. The Western Hemisphere Security Cooperation Act of 2012 imposed restrictions on U.S. nuclear cooperation with countries assisting nuclear programs, including those aiding Venezuela or Cuba. Additionally, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Disinvestment Act of 2010 amended the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 to subject gasoline sales to Iran to U.S. sanctions. The Senate Committee on Armed Services reported S. 3454 (Levin), the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2011, with a provision requiring a report on Venezuela related to terrorism issues. The report was to detail activities by the government of Venezuela in supporting terrorist organizations and governments on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. The Senate approved a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2011 requiring a report on Venezuela's support for terrorist organizations and governments on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. This report focused on activities by the government of Venezuela in the Western Hemisphere that undermine the national interest of the United States, including groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, the ELN, and the FARC. The Director of National Intelligence was mandated to provide a report within 180 days on Venezuelan military and intelligence activities. The House bill did not include a similar Venezuela report requirement, and the October 7, 2009, conference report to the measure did not include the Senate provision. The House approved its version of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2010 and FY2011 with a provision that would have required a report on Iran's and Hezbollah's actions in the Western Hemisphere. The provision cited the State Department's 2008 terrorism report noting passengers on flights connecting Tehran and Damascus with Caracas were subject to only cursory immigration and customs controls. Iran had sought to strengthen ties with Western Hemisphere countries to undermine U.S. foreign policy. The Senate did not consider the measure. The House bill did not include a similar Venezuela report requirement, and the October 7, 2009, conference report to the measure did not include the Senate provision. H.R. 375 (Ros-Lehtinen), introduced in 2009, aimed to restrict nuclear cooperation with countries assisting Venezuela or Cuba's nuclear programs and authorize the President to impose foreign aid and export controls on countries not fully cooperating with U.S. counterterrorism efforts. H.R. 2475 and H.R. 4436 introduced provisions related to nuclear cooperation with countries assisting Venezuela or Cuba's nuclear programs and expressed concerns about Iran's use of nuclear cooperation agreements for proliferation. The bill required an annual report on nuclear cooperation agreements involving Iran, Belarus, or Venezuela and the sale of weapons from Belarus to state sponsors of terrorism. Resolutions were introduced expressing concerns about democracy in Venezuela and violations of civil rights. Before Venezuela's legislative elections in September 2010, resolutions were introduced expressing concerns about civil liberties violations and supporting free and fair elections in Venezuela. Additionally, there were resolutions addressing anti-Semitism in Venezuela, with one expressing concern about the growing threat of anti-Semitism in South America, including Venezuela, Bolivia, and Argentina, and another expressing support for the Jewish community in Venezuela. Resolution introduced in Congress to condemn anti-Semitic acts in Venezuela, urge safety measures for the Jewish community, express concern about collaboration between Iran, Hezbollah, and the Venezuelan government, and call for increased cooperation on counterterrorism initiatives. H.Res. 872 (Mack) sought to designate Venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism and enhance collaboration with allies in Latin America on counterterrorism efforts. Appendix A provides links to various U.S. Government reports on Venezuela, including background notes, human rights practices, terrorism, and business guides. The reports cover information from 2011 and 2012. The International Religious Freedom Report for 2011, Venezuela, and other U.S. Government reports on Venezuela for 2012 can be accessed through provided links. In 2012, President Obama determined that Venezuela had failed to meet international counternarcotics measures. Peace talks between Colombia and FARC were announced, with support from Venezuela and other countries. An explosion at a Venezuelan oil refinery in August 2012 raised concerns about government safety measures. An explosion at a Venezuelan oil refinery in August 2012 killed over 40 people, sparking concerns about government neglect of maintenance and safety at PdVSA. General Douglas Fraser stated that Venezuela is not seen as a national security threat, with Iran's connection being primarily diplomatic and economic. President Obama expressed general concern about Iran's destabilizing activities globally but noted that Chavez's actions did not pose a serious national security threat. The State Department issued its 2011 report on Venezuela on May 24, 2012. The State Department's 2011 human rights report on Venezuela highlighted government actions impeding freedom of expression and criminalizing dissent. Venezuela was also cited for not fully cooperating with the US on antiterrorism efforts and being a preferred trafficking route for cocaine. On March 7, 2012, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs reported a measure requiring a strategy to address Iran's presence in the Western Hemisphere. President Ch\u00e1vez underwent surgery in Cuba to remove a malignant pelvic lesion, returning for radiation treatment multiple times. In July 2012, Ch\u00e1vez claimed to be \"cancer free.\" In early July 2012, Ch\u00e1vez declared he was \"cancer free\" and prepared for reelection. Venezuela's opposition parties held a primary, won by Henrique Capriles Radonski. The Department of State expelled Venezuelan Consul General Livia Acosta for alleged cyberattack recruitment. President Ch\u00e1vez appointed General Henry Rangel. On January 6, 2012, President Ch\u00e1vez appointed General Henry Rangel as defense minister despite previous financial sanctions. In June 2011, House subcommittees held a hearing on Venezuela's sanctionable activities. President Ch\u00e1vez underwent emergency surgery in Cuba in June 2011. In 2011, the State Department imposed sanctions on Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PdVSA) for providing reformate to Iran. The sanctions prohibited PdVSA from U.S. government contracts and financing, but excluded subsidiaries like Citgo. Venezuela was also found to be non-cooperative in antiterrorism efforts. Colombia extradited alleged trafficker Walid Makled Garcia to Venezuela. Colombia extradited alleged Venezuelan trafficker Walid Makled Garcia to Venezuela, who is also wanted in the United States on drug trafficking charges. The State Department issued reports on human rights issues in Venezuela and its role as a preferred trafficking route for cocaine. On February 2, 2011, Judge Mar\u00eda Lourdes Afiuni was released from prison after ordering the release of a businessman. Human rights groups called for dropping corruption charges against her. Venezuela revoked the appointment of the U.S. Ambassador, leading to diplomatic tensions. President Ch\u00e1vez was granted decree powers for 18 months by the National Assembly on December 17, 2010. On November 16, 2010, Colombian President Santos agreed to extradite Venezuelan businessman Walid Makled to Venezuela, despite US extradition requests. Venezuela's 2010 elections resulted in pro-Ch\u00e1vez supporters winning 98 seats in the National Assembly, a setback for Ch\u00e1vez as they fell short of the majority needed for key actions. President Obama declared Venezuela had \"failed\" in September 2010. On August 30, 2010, hunger striker Franklin Brito died protesting the seizure of his farm in 2004. Venezuela's cooperation with the United States on counterterrorism was reduced to an \"absolute minimum\" in 2009. Venezuela suspended diplomatic relations with Colombia on July 22, 2010. On August 10, 2010, new Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos met with President Ch\u00e1vez to reestablish diplomatic relations after tensions over Colombian guerrillas.
