    "content": "The Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig explosion in 2010 caused the largest oil spill in U.S. waters, with over 200 million gallons released over 84 days. BP was the main party responsible for response and compensation. The incident was the worst since the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska. The Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska cost approximately $5 billion in today's dollars for cleanup and damages. In comparison, the 2010 Gulf spill by BP is projected to cost around $41 billion, including various expenses like cleanup, penalties, and claims. The incident received significant attention in 2010, raising multiple policy issues. The 2010 Gulf spill by BP raised policy matters on oil spill liability and compensation framework, determining responsibility for cleanup costs, damages, and limitations. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) signed by President George H. W. Bush addresses liability and compensation issues related to oil spills. It includes provisions for distributing costs between responsible parties and a trust fund funded by a per-barrel tax on oil. Responsible parties have liability caps, with the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund covering costs above those limits up to $1 billion per incident. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes liability and compensation framework for oil spills. The responsible party, defined by OPA, is crucial for fulfilling obligations and simplifying the compensation process by assigning liability. This mechanism eliminates the need to determine the party at fault for the spill. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes liability and compensation framework for oil spills. The responsible party, as defined by OPA, includes owners, operators, or charterers of vessels, owners or operators of onshore facilities, and lessees or permittees of offshore facilities. This framework simplifies the compensation process by assigning liability without the need to determine fault for the spill. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes liability for oil spills. Responsible parties include owners, operators, or charterers of vessels, owners or operators of onshore facilities, and lessees or permittees of offshore facilities. The Act also includes deepwater ports, pipelines, and abandoned vessels, creating a unified liability regime. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes strict liability for responsible parties in case of oil spills, covering discharge to navigable waters, shorelines, and the exclusive economic zone of the United States. Liability includes cleanup costs incurred by government or private parties, following the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan. OPA also expands the scope of damages for which an oil spiller would be liable. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes strict liability for responsible parties in case of oil spills, covering discharge to navigable waters, shorelines, and the exclusive economic zone of the United States. Damages include natural resources, real or personal property, subsistence use, and revenues. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes strict liability for responsible parties in case of oil spills, covering discharge to navigable waters, shorelines, and the exclusive economic zone of the United States. Damages include loss of profits, impairment of earning capacity, and net costs of providing public services. OPA provides limited defenses from liability such as Act of God, act of war, and act or omission of certain third parties. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes strict liability for responsible parties in case of oil spills, covering discharge to navigable waters, shorelines, and the exclusive economic zone of the United States. OPA provides liability limits for those responsible for a spill, with conditions such as acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct, violation of federal safety requirements, and cooperation with response officials to maintain liability caps. The liability limits for oil spills are not usually well defined until after the response, and litigation may be necessary to resolve the issue. Vessel liability limits are based on the size of the vessel, with a cap of $304 million for single-hull tank vessels and $190 million for double hull tank vessels. Onshore facility liability is limited to $350 million. The President has the authority to decrease this limit through regulations, but this has not been done. The liability limit for deepwater ports like LOOP is $350 million, but can be adjusted by the Secretary of Homeland Security to a minimum of $50 million. Offshore facilities have unlimited liability for oil removal costs and a $75 million limit for other damages. MODUs, like the Deepwater Horizon, have a liability cap as tank vessels, with excess costs treated as offshore facility liability. The liability limits for offshore facilities, including MODUs, have not been adjusted since 1990 despite the requirement to do so every three years. If adjustments had been made, the liability limit for economic and natural resource damages would be around $125 million. OPA mandates that vessels and offshore facilities must maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover oil spill response and compensation costs. The liability limits for vessels and offshore facilities are tied to financial responsibility levels, with vessels having a single liability cap for removal costs and damages. Offshore facilities have unlimited liability for removal costs, leading to different financial responsibility limit provisions. Offshore facilities in federal waters must demonstrate $35 million financial responsibility, unless the President determines a greater amount (not to exceed $150 million) is justified. The financial responsibility amount is based on a facility's worst-case discharge volume, with facilities over 105,000 barrels needing to maintain $150 million. The Coast Guard's National Pollution Funds Center implements financial responsibility provisions for vessels. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement enforces requirements for offshore facilities related to oil spill liability. Congress established the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund in 1986, but it was not funded until after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. The fund was activated in 1990 with a 5-cent-per-barrel tax on oil, which was reinstated in 2006 by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund was established in 1986 but funded after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill. The fund was activated in 1990 with a 5-cent-per-barrel tax, increased to 8 cents in 2008, and set to increase to 9 cents in 2017 before terminating at the end of that year. The National Pollution Funds Center manages the trust fund, which plays a key role in liability and compensation for oil spills. The fund requires claims to be presented to responsible parties before being submitted to the OSLTF for compensation. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) allows claimants to seek compensation from responsible parties or directly from the OSLTF. If a responsible party denies a claim later awarded by the OSLTF, the government may seek reimbursement. The OSLTF has a per-incident cap of $1 billion, limiting payments. This cap could prevent compensation for claimants initially denied by responsible parties. Regulations for the OSLTF claims process are detailed in 33 C.F.R. Part 136 and a guidance document is available for assistance. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) allows for compensating claimants initially denied by responsible parties. Costs beyond the per-incident limit could be addressed through state laws or federal authorities like the Stafford Act for emergency declarations. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill raised questions about oil spill liability and compensation framework, highlighting debates on cost allocation among responsible parties, the oil industry, and the general treasury. Policymakers may need to consider the Deepwater Horizon incident's magnitude and liability issues. BP has funded response operations and paid over $10 billion in costs and damage claims exceeding its liability limit. The Gulf Coast Claims Facility was established to handle claims independently. The Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF) was created by BP to handle claims independently, financed with incremental payments totaling $20 billion. In response to the Deepwater Horizon spill, Congress considered proposals to increase the liability limit for offshore facilities, with some suggesting removal of the limit entirely. The House passed legislation in July 2010 to eliminate the liability limit, while the Senate had a comparable bill on its Legislative Calendar but did not vote on it. Members of the 112th Congress have also proposed eliminating the liability limit. In the 112th Congress, proposals have been made to eliminate the liability limit for offshore facilities, which has been a longstanding part of the oil spill framework. Removing this limit would significantly change U.S. oil spill policy by shifting the burden of costs from a major spill solely to the responsible party. This change could reduce the risk of depleting the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) during a catastrophic spill, but the OSLTF would still serve as a compensation backstop within a system of unlimited liability. Increasing or eliminating the liability limit for offshore facilities could change U.S. oil spill policy by shifting costs to the responsible party. However, this may not guarantee full funding for response costs and compensation. Some argue that the current liability cap distorts economic decisions and provides incentives for oil spills, while others see it as a subsidy to the offshore oil industry. The liability cap for offshore oil facilities is seen as a subsidy to the industry. Increasing or removing the cap could pose insurance challenges, but the market may adjust. Evidence suggests insurers are offering coverage up to $10 billion to $20 billion. Some argue that higher liability limits could disadvantage companies unable to self-insure, making insurance costly or unobtainable. This could lead to smaller companies being excluded from offshore operations, benefiting major oil companies. However, others believe that companies should bear the costs of their activities. The OSLTF's $1 billion cap could be reached with incidents like Deepwater Horizon, with expenditures exceeding $690 million as of November 7, 2010. The trust fund expenditures and obligations have surpassed $690 million, with BP reimbursing the federal government over $600 million. Proposals in Congress aim to increase the per-incident cap due to concerns about funding levels in the OSLTF, which had an unobligated balance of approximately $1.7 billion. The OSLTF unobligated balance was $1.7 billion in FY2010, projected to reach $2.7 billion by FY2014. While these levels may be enough for common spills, they may not suffice for catastrophic spills like Deepwater Horizon. Data from a 2007 GAO report suggests the projected levels could address typical spills, but major spills exceeding liability limits are infrequent but impactful. The impact of limit of liability claims on the OSLTF could be significant. Out of 51 major oil spills since 1990, 10 resulted in limit of liability claims. Proposals in Congress have been made to increase the per-barrel tax for the OSLTF. Potential CWA penalties could also contribute to funding the OSLTF. The OSLTF overrides general provisions by transferring CWA penalties, including those from the Deepwater Horizon incident. The revenue generated depends on factors like the amount of oil discharged, negligence, and direct capture by BP. The recent National Commission report addressed these issues. The recent National Commission report provided a range of $4.5 billion to $21.5 billion for possible CWA penalty revenue. Legislation has been proposed to redirect Deepwater Horizon penalties for Gulf restoration. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy and timeliness of payments through the Gulf Coast Claims Facility for OPA claims. The 111th Congress held hearings on compensation and claims process issues, with continued interest in the 112th Congress. Evaluating criticism towards the GCCF is challenging due to lack of transparency. The GCCF offered its final claim payment methodology for public comment in February 2011, based on assumptions about Gulf ecosystem and economy recovery. The GCCF's final claim payment methodology includes a future losses assumption that is reassessed every four months. The methodology includes expert opinion but lacks transparency on how the assumption was derived. Some argue that the GCCF's payment effectiveness may be overstated, with 38% of submitted claims paid as of February 10, 2011. The GCCF's payment effectiveness is questioned due to a significant portion of quick payments. These expedited claims make up 34% of total paid claims, but if excluded, the percentage decreases to 29%. Concerns were raised in a Senate hearing about whether BP and the GCCF processed claims according to NPFC procedures. NPFC received 500 claims related to the Gulf spill, adjudicated 200, and all were denied. The NPFC adjudicated 200 claims related to the Gulf spill, all of which were denied. The status of the remaining claims was not discussed, making an assessment of the BP/GCCF claims process premature. OPA does not give a federal agency authority to oversee responsible party claims activities, but proposals have been made to address this issue. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the time period in the OPA claims process. Several proposals from Congress aimed to shorten the 90-day waiting period for claim settlement through the OSLTF or litigation. Stakeholders criticized the \"proximate cause\" language in GCCF protocols, prompting the Administrator to address concerns. The GCCF's August 2010 protocol stated they would only pay for harm directly caused by the spill, aligning with OPA guidelines. The GCCF's causation determinations of OPA claims will be guided by OPA and federal law interpreting OPA and the proximate cause doctrine. Determinations of non-OPA claims will be guided by applicable law. In October 2010, Administrator Feinberg announced the removal of the geographic proximity text for claim eligibility. The GCCF will only pay for harm or damage that is proximately caused by the Spill, aligning with OPA guidelines. The OPA provision does not address geographic proximity but holds responsible parties liable for removal costs and damages resulting from oil spills. The OSLTF does not consider proximate cause, but must establish a cutoff point to determine compensable injuries. The Deepwater Commission noted the challenge of determining how closely linked lost profits must be to a spill to be compensable. The Gulf Coast Claims Facility has faced difficulties in processing claims due to this issue. The current liability limits and per-incident cap may not be enough to cover costs from a catastrophic spill. Options to address this issue depend on Congress' objective of providing full restoration and timely compensation without burdening taxpayers. \"Timely\" compensation means access to funds without court involvement. Several options for Congress to address the issue of liability limits for oil spills include increasing the limits for responsible parties to pay a greater portion of the total spill cost before accessing trust fund dollars. Different limits could be set for various offshore activities to account for different oil spill risks. Policymakers in the oil exploration sector should consider various factors influencing the risk of oil spills and their containment. A comprehensive risk assessment of these factors is needed to guide policy decisions. Increasing financial responsibility coverage for OCS drilling activities, based on specific criteria like technology use or location, could be beneficial. Congress could gradually raise coverage amounts to allow for adjustment. Congress could increase coverage amounts through a staggered approach to allow the market to adjust. Remove or raise the per-incident cap on the trust fund to prevent depletion with one incident. Increase the per-barrel oil tax to raise the fund's balance quickly. Authorize \"repayable advances\" via appropriations to ensure the fund has resources for cleanup and claim awards. Require the industry to establish a significant fund for response actions and injured party compensation, complementing the existing OPA system. The 112th Congress has introduced proposals to address liability and compensation framework issues related to catastrophic spills in U.S. waters. Interest in these issues raised by the 2010 Gulf oil spill has decreased, but legislative activity may be influenced by various factors. Some argue that establishing a system to withstand a catastrophic event may not justify the costs and consequences. The 112th Congress may consider various factors when addressing liability and compensation framework issues related to catastrophic spills in U.S. waters, such as Gulf region conditions, independent inquiries, claims process information, and natural resource damage assessment results. The passage of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 after the Exxon Valdez spill took 18 months."
