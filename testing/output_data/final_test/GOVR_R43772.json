    "content": "The Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998 imposed a three-year moratorium on new taxes on Internet access and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. It also established the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce. The moratorium was extended through the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act in 2001 and subsequent extensions have been made to address changes in the law. The Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act (ITNA) extended the Internet tax moratorium through November 1, 2007. It included DSL connections under the moratorium but excluded Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. The Act also allowed state and local governments to tax VoIP services and directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to investigate the impact of the moratorium on state and local taxes. The Internet Tax Freedom Act Amendments Act of 2007 extended the Internet tax moratorium through November 1, 2014, with provisions for grandfather protections and revoking them if states repealed Internet access taxes. ITFA was extended multiple times in subsequent Congresses, with the latest extension through October 1, 2015. In the 114th Congress, the moratorium on taxing Internet access was made permanent by P.L. 114-125 after being extended multiple times. The extension prohibited states from imposing new taxes on Internet access services. The moratorium on taxing Internet access, made permanent by P.L. 114-125 in the 114th Congress, exempts the sale and purchase of Internet access services from taxation under ITFA. However, costs related to acquired services, like ISP leasing capacity over fiber, may be subject to taxation. Internet access is often bundled with other services, and if charges can be separated, Internet access remains tax-exempt. This affects consumers, ISPs, and state/local governments. The Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) prohibits state and local governments from imposing sales taxes on monthly payments to ISPs for Internet access. This limits taxable activities, potentially reducing state and local revenues by an estimated $6.5 billion annually. The Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) prohibits state and local governments from taxing Internet access. Initially, 13 states were grandfathered in to continue taxing, but some have since eliminated the tax. Currently, seven states collect a total of $563 million annually from Internet access taxes. The grandfather clause protecting pre-1998 taxes is set to expire in June 2020. The Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act (ITNA) established an additional grandfather clause for certain taxes on Internet access before November 1, 2003, which expired on November 1, 2005. ITFA prohibits multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce, allowing for state, county, and city taxes on transactions. The Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) prohibits discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce, ensuring that the same tax rate is applied to similar items regardless of how they were purchased. It also outlines conditions where a remote seller's use of online services does not establish a minimal connection to a state for taxation purposes. Some businesses exploit nexus limits in ITFA to avoid sales tax through Internet kiosks or dot-com subsidiaries, claiming they are exempt. Critics argue this is an abuse of tax laws, while the collection of use taxes remains a separate issue from ITFA's moratorium on Internet taxes. The issue of taxing interstate electronic commerce is different from ITFA's focus on Internet access and discriminatory taxes. It centers on the Supreme Court's Quill Corp. v. North Dakota decision and the Commerce and Due Process Clauses of the Constitution, which require a physical presence or nexus for a state to impose taxes. This impacts electronic commerce firms with servers or warehouses in one state but selling goods nationwide. The Quill decision established nexus for taxing interstate electronic commerce, where firms do not collect use taxes from buyers in states without physical presence. Compliance with use tax remittance is low. Tax policy is evaluated based on equity, efficiency, and simplicity. The ITFA moratorium on taxing Internet access will be evaluated based on these characteristics and other relevant factors. The Internet's impact on state and local governments in terms of tax policy equity is evaluated based on horizontal and vertical equity. Horizontal equity focuses on similar tax burdens for similar individuals, while vertical equity considers the ability to pay. The Internet provides services subject to taxation, and the moratorium on taxing Internet access is under scrutiny. The Internet tax moratorium provides a tax advantage to services offered online, creating inequitable tax treatment and violating horizontal equity principles. It acts as a subsidy by eliminating state and local taxes on Internet access, lowering the effective price for consumers. The Internet tax moratorium eliminates state and local taxes on Internet access, reducing the effective price for consumers. While higher-income individuals have greater Internet access, the subsidy may help lower-income individuals. However, the subsidy does not satisfy the principle of vertical equity as both upper- and lower-income individuals benefit from it, despite differing capabilities to pay taxes on Internet access. The Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) moratorium on taxing Internet access benefits both low- and high-income individuals, improving economic efficiency by expanding access. However, the blanket nature of the moratorium reduces economic efficiency gains. Connecting more businesses and individuals to the Internet provides benefits to all users, generating external benefits. The moratorium on taxing Internet access acts as a subsidy, lowering costs and increasing access. This can improve economic efficiency by bringing more individuals online, creating external benefits for users. The subsidy provided by the Internet access tax moratorium may be too large compared to the external benefits of individuals joining the Internet. As the Internet grows, the external benefits of new users decrease, and congestion may lead to negative consequences. The blanket design of the subsidy likely results in wasteful spending, as many individuals would still purchase Internet access even with taxes applied. The Internet access subsidy may be wasteful economically as revenue could be used more productively elsewhere. Better targeting the subsidy to those who struggle to afford Internet access would be more efficient. States have missed out on potential revenue due to the federal moratorium, with estimates suggesting they could collect $6.5 billion annually from taxing Internet access. However, it is unlikely that all states would impose such taxes, as some have voluntarily eliminated them. The federal moratorium on Internet taxes has led to lost revenue for states, with estimates suggesting they could collect $6.5 billion annually. Some states currently collect sales tax on Internet access, generating $563 million per year. The National Governors Association is concerned about federal encroachment on state autonomy and hopes to revise the moratorium to allow taxation of more activities related to Internet access. The moratorium on taxing Internet access simplifies compliance for ISPs across multiple tax jurisdictions, estimated to range from 7,600 to 14,500."
