Both insurers and banks play vital roles in the economy, with protections in place for consumers in case of insolvency. Federal insurance funds provide similar protections as state-based insurance guaranty funds, which may be important if Congress considers federal regulation of insurers. Provision for policyholders of insolvent insurers began in the late 1930s, with some states having security funds for disabled workers and policyholders of insolvent insurers by the 1950s. In the late 1960s, Congress considered a federal fund similar to the FDIC for property-liability policyholders, but state regulators and insurers objected. A model law was created by states by 1974, with life and health insurance guaranty fund laws enacted after insolvencies in the 1980s and 1990s. All states had enacted these laws by late 1992, guided by three principles. The model laws for insolvent insurers were guided by three principles: policyholders should not lose risk protection, losses should be shared, and claim payments should not be delayed. Property-liability and life insolvencies are handled differently, with the insurance commissioner taking steps to protect policyholders once financial trouble is determined. This can include ordering corrective actions, suspending business, or petitioning for rehabilitation through a state court. The insurance commissioner can petition a state court for rehabilitation or liquidation of an insolvent insurer. The court's order appoints the commissioner as liquidator, who then appoints a receiver to take possession of the insurer's assets. Cooperation among states is crucial, with the insurer's domicile state typically taking the lead in the liquidation process. The insurance commissioner appoints a lead receiver for an insolvent insurer's liquidation. Ancillary receivers are appointed by regulators in other states where the insurer operated. Guaranty funds and national associations assist the receivers. Each state's guaranty fund is triggered by the liquidation order, funded by all licensed insurers in the state. Insurers contribute proportionate shares for insolvency cases after liabilities and assets are evaluated. The guaranty fund is created by insurers remitting their allocated share for insolvency cases. It is responsible for policyholders in each state and provides protection within statutory limits. An order of liquidation terminates existing policies, suspends claims payments, and prioritizes policyholders' claims over general creditors. The laws prioritize policyholders' claims over general creditors in insolvency cases, with guaranty associations processing claims but not covering all of them. Coverage is usually capped at $300,000, excluding punitive damages. Insurers assess themselves to fund the difference between assets and claims, with assessments limited to 1-2% of premium volume annually. If insufficient, other types of insurance may be assessed. The entry of an order of liquidation of a life insurer does not cancel life or health insurance policies or annuity contracts to preserve policyholder's risk protection. Life insurance guaranty associations often continue coverage by selling or transferring policies to another insurer. Life insurance guaranty associations typically sell or transfer covered policies to another insurer to meet obligations. Coverage limits include $300,000 for death benefits, $100,000 for cash values, and $100,000 for health insurance benefits. Guaranty association coverage excludes policies with investment risk and HMOs. Insurers assess themselves for any shortfall, with annual assessments up to 2% of premium volume. The FDIC, PBGC, and NCUSIF are federally administered protection plans created by Congress to protect deposits in banks, participants in defined benefit pension plans, and \"share\" accounts in credit unions. These protection systems aim to maintain confidence in financial intermediaries and spread potential losses in case of a financial institution failure. Unlike the insurance guaranty fund system, these protection plans have coverage limits and are funded through assessments on the institutions they protect. The insurance guaranty fund system differs from federally administered protection plans like FDIC, PBGC, and NCUSIF in various ways, including the existence of the protection fund before insolvency, risk-based payments by contributors, and the ability to recoup costs. Opinions on the effectiveness of the current insurance guaranty fund system vary, with supporters citing $21 billion in claims paid out over four decades. NOLHGA reports protecting 2.2 million policyholders since 1983, guaranteeing over $21.2 billion in benefits. Critics of the current state insurance guaranty fund system argue for federal reform or replacement due to inefficiency, slow processes, and distortion of incentives. They suggest risk-based assessments similar to FDIC requirements to address risk-taking behavior and cost imposition on conservative insurers. Incentives are further distorted by tax offsets and insurers' ability to exploit the system. In the 110th Congress, Senators introduced the National Insurance Act of 2007, requiring federally licensed insurers to participate in state guaranty funds. Versions of the Act were also introduced in the 109th and 108th Congress. In the 108th and 107th Congress, various legislation was introduced to establish federal licensing and regulation for interstate insurers, including creating a pre-funded national insurance guaranty association and allowing insurers to elect federal regulation. Senator Schumer proposed an optional federal charter for insurers, requiring participation in a state-based system of policyholder protection. Congress may face policy issues if considering federal chartering for insurers. The policy issues Congress may face when considering federal chartering for insurers include whether to establish a federally based protection system or require participation in the state-based guaranty fund system. There are concerns about direct federal costs for a federally based system and indirect costs for insurers, policyholders, and taxpayers if insurers participate in a state-based system. Incentives may be misaligned, with states bearing the financial burden of insolvencies without control over federal regulation effectiveness. Creating a federal policyholder protection system for federally regulated insurers could lead to economic inefficiencies and stress the federal budget. The inclusion of state-regulated insurers in such a system may distort incentives. Insurers in a federal policyholder protection system could distort incentives by separating solvency regulation from consequences. Excluding state-chartered insurers may destabilize protection systems. Congress faces challenges in deciding which policyholders to protect and setting recovery limits, especially for regional disasters and business liability coverages. If Congress were to create a federal policyholder protection system, there would be debates on pre-funding or post-funding. Insurers may prefer post-funding, while competitors like banks may argue for pre-funding. Technical issues would arise, such as maintaining separate funds for different types of insurers and calculating appropriate fund balances. Life insurers and property-liability insurers calculate appropriate fund balances based on their risk profiles. Creating a federal policyholder protection system could lead to debates on how insurers' assessments should be determined. Some argue that flat assessment rates dilute market discipline, but profiling insurers' risks could be complex and contentious. Insurers currently hold additional capital based on their risks, with life insurers categorizing riskiness of investments and property-liability insurers considering types of insurance underwritten. Feasibility of analogous calculations for guaranty fund assessments is uncertain. Other issues include access to the Federal Reserve Board's discount window for insurers. In considering federal regulation of insurers, key issues include whether insurers should have access to the Federal Reserve Board's discount window and the relationship of federal policyholder protection to the FDIC. The decision on maintaining policyholder protection against insolvency is crucial, with considerations on offering federal protection or requiring federally regulated insurers to participate in the state system. Technical issues such as funding, scope, administering agency location, and market discipline enforcement would need to be addressed if Congress opts for federal protection."
