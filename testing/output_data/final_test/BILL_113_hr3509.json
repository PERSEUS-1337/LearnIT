On January 12, 2010, a massive earthquake struck near the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince, leaving an estimated 220,000 people dead, including 103 United States citizens, 101 United Nations personnel, and nearly 18 percent of the nation's civil service. Additionally, 300,000 were injured, 115,000 homes destroyed, and 1,500,000 people displaced. The Post Disaster Needs Assessment estimated that 15 percent of the population were directly affected, with economic losses totaling $7,804,000,000. Before the earthquake, Haiti already had low socioeconomic indicators and high income disparity. The disaster caused $7.8 billion in damages. Over 6.7 million people in Haiti are food insecure, and an outbreak of cholera in 2010 led to over half a million cases and 8,000 deaths, straining the public health sector. The international community, led by the United States and the United Nations, provided significant humanitarian aid to Haiti after the earthquake, with donors pledging over $10 billion for relief efforts. The response included support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United States Southern Command. Since 2010, over $3.6 billion in US assistance has been allocated for Haiti, with funds designated for humanitarian relief, recovery, reconstruction, and development. This includes support for a recovery plan led by USAID, which involves projects like building a power plant for the Caracol Industrial Park in northern Haiti. On October 9, 2013, the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs held a hearing on the effectiveness of US aid to Haiti post-earthquake. The Government Accountability Office reported that USAID had only disbursed 31% of its reconstruction funds in Haiti by June 30, 2013. The port project was 2 years behind schedule and over budget by $189 million, the housing project was reduced by 80%, and the sustainability of the power plant was questioned. Donors have faced challenges in implementing recovery programs in Haiti, with many people still displaced, high unemployment, corruption, land rights issues, wage violations, an unfavorable business climate, and weak government capacity. Recommendations include establishing a reporting mechanism for Congress to ensure effective oversight of funding distribution. To achieve stability and economic growth in Haiti, donor assistance must be coordinated with the government's commitment to transparency, a market economy, rule of law, and democracy. The statement of policy in section 3 emphasizes the importance of coordination between donor assistance and the government's commitment to transparency, a market economy, rule of law, and democracy in Haiti. The United States supports sustainable rebuilding and development in Haiti by promoting efforts led by the Haitian people and government, building long-term capacity, addressing the needs of both women and men equally, restoring natural resources, and providing transparent reporting on progress and evaluations. The United States supports sustainable rebuilding and development in Haiti by promoting local procurement, fair elections, and democratic principles. Congress emphasizes the importance of transparency, accountability, democracy, and good governance in decisions regarding US assistance, including aid to Haiti. The Secretary of State must provide Congress with a report every 180 days on Haiti's post-earthquake recovery efforts, including the Haiti Rebuilding and Development Strategy, US government agencies' work in the recovery effort, and the progress of US efforts in advancing the strategy. The Department of State's report on Haiti's post-earthquake recovery strategy must include updates on any changes made, progress towards housing reconstruction, and meeting specific goals and objectives. The report on Haiti's post-earthquake recovery strategy must include updates on land ownership, secure tenure, water and sanitation, housing finance, and efforts to attract private sector investments to the Comprehensive Investment Plan (CIP). It should also describe the construction and sustainability of the proposed port, projected timeline, and cost for completion. The report on Haiti's post-earthquake recovery strategy should include updates on land ownership, secure tenure, water and sanitation, housing finance, and efforts to attract private sector investments to the Comprehensive Investment Plan (CIP). It should also detail the quantitative and qualitative indicators used to evaluate progress, financial commitments, and risk mitigation measures to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in United States assistance. The report on Haiti's post-earthquake recovery strategy should include updates on strengthening Haitian governmental and non-governmental capacity, consulting with government ministries and local authorities, engaging with civil society and grassroots organizations, and implementing new programs under the Post-Earthquake USG Haiti Strategy. The report on Haiti's post-earthquake recovery strategy should include updates on efforts to address corruption, promote public accountability, engage the Haitian private sector, and leverage public-private partnerships for recovery and development activities. The report on Haiti's post-earthquake recovery strategy should include updates on efforts to engage the private sector in recovery and development activities, coordinate programs with other donors, address the needs of vulnerable populations, assess the impact of agriculture and infrastructure programs on food security and livelihoods, and communicate progress to the Haitian people in Haitian Creole. The report on Haiti's post-earthquake recovery strategy should include updates on efforts to engage the private sector in recovery and development activities, coordinate programs with other donors, address the needs of vulnerable populations, assess the impact of agriculture and infrastructure programs on food security and livelihoods, and communicate progress to the Haitian people in Haitian Creole. Additionally, it should detail Haiti's steps to strengthen its capacity to receive individuals who are removed, excluded, or deported from the United States. The House of Representatives passed the document on December 12, 2013, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
