    "content": "The \"Class Action Fairness Act of 2005\" amends title 28 of the United States Code. Congress found that class actions are valuable but have been abused, harming class members and defendants. Plaintiffs' lawyers have been criticized for receiving large fees while providing little benefit to class members. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 aims to address abuses in class actions that harm class members and defendants. It seeks to ensure fair recovery, uphold diversity jurisdiction, and promote commercial innovation. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 aims to address abuses in class actions by providing greater protections for class members through new sections added to 28 U.S.C. These sections define terms like Class Action, Class Counsel, and Class Members to ensure fair recovery and uphold diversity jurisdiction. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 defines terms like Plaintiff Class Action and Proposed Settlement, aiming to address abuses in class actions by ensuring fair recovery for class members. Section 1712 focuses on judicial scrutiny of noncash settlements in class actions to prevent lawyers from benefiting more than class members. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 requires judicial scrutiny of noncash settlements in class actions to ensure fairness for class members. Attorneys' fees in contingent fee cases must be based on redeemed coupons or hours billed, not on unredeemed coupons. Additionally, judges may not approve a class action if it results in a loss for class members. The provision in the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 prohibits class action settlements that would result in a net loss for class members due to attorney's fees. It also prevents discrimination based on geographic location in awarding recoveries and requires defendants to notify federal and state officials of settlement details before it takes effect. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 requires defendants to notify federal and state officials of settlement details within 90 days. Failure to comply allows class members to walk away from the settlement agreement. Federal diversity jurisdiction for class actions only exists if every member is a citizen of a different state from every defendant. The proposed law aims to provide additional protection for out-of-state litigants in class actions by establishing a minimal diversity rule and considering the total amount of damages at stake to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement. Federal district courts would have original jurisdiction over class actions exceeding $5,000,000 where there is diversity among plaintiffs and defendants. The minimal diversity rule applies in federal courts when less than one-third of plaintiffs and primary defendants are from the state where the suit is filed. The court must consider national or interstate interests, state laws governing the claims, and the class action's pleading to avoid federal jurisdiction. The criteria for determining federal jurisdiction in class action lawsuits include the forum's connection to the class members, the number of citizens from the state where the action was filed compared to other states, and whether similar class actions have been filed. The criteria for federal jurisdiction in class action lawsuits include actions seeking monetary relief for 100 or more persons with common legal issues, with exceptions for actions on behalf of the general public under state statute. The minimal diversity rule does not apply if two-thirds or more of plaintiffs and defendants are from the same state, if defendants are states or governmental entities, or if the total plaintiffs are less than 100. Section 5 allows for the removal of class action lawsuits from state court to federal court without the consent of all defendants. Section 6 requires a report on class action settlements to be submitted to the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives within 12 months of enactment. Section 7 discusses the enactment of Judicial Conference Recommendations related to class action reform amendments to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It appears redundant as it specifies the effective date of the amendments. The legislation applies to civil actions commenced on or after the date of enactment, with jurisdictional and removal components similar to previous Congresses. Proponents argue for increased sanctions against lawyers bringing frivolous claims to court. The legislation aims to increase sanctions against lawyers who file frivolous claims, but opponents argue it would burden the federal court system, go against federalism principles, and make consumer litigation more challenging."
