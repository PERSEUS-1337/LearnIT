    "content": "The governors of states historically filled Senate vacancies with temporary appointments until special elections could be held. The 17th Amendment allowed for direct election of Senators and gave states the option to fill vacancies by election or temporary gubernatorial appointment. Gubernatorial appointment to fill Senate vacancies has been the prevailing practice since 1913, with 41 states allowing executives unrestricted appointment authority. The presidential election of 2008 resulted in the highest number of Senate vacancies in over 60 years, with four vacancies occurring due to incumbent Senators becoming President, Vice President, or receiving cabinet appointments. The report reviews the constitutional origins of Senate vacancies and the appointment process. Controversies in Illinois and Massachusetts led to unsuccessful proposals for special elections. Recent vacancies in 2012 and 2013 generated little controversy. Proposals to eliminate or restrict gubernatorial power to name temporary Senators are also discussed. Senate vacancies occurred in the 112th and 113th Congress due to the death and resignation of several Senators. Governor Neil Abercrombie appointed Lieutenant Governor Brian E. Schatz to fill Senator Daniel K. Inouye's seat until a special election in 2014. President Barack H. Obama also made announcements regarding Senate vacancies. President Barack H. Obama nominated Senator John F. Kerry for Secretary of State in December 2012. Kerry's confirmation by the Senate led to his resignation as Senator of Massachusetts. William (Mo) Cowan was appointed as interim Senator until a special election winner was certified. Senator Cowan served until the special election winner took office, following Massachusetts law for filling the vacant seat. Following the resignation of Senator John F. Kerry as Secretary of State, a special election was held in Massachusetts to fill the vacant Senate seat. Representative Edward J. Markey won the election and was sworn in on July 16 to serve until 2015. In New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie appointed an interim Senator to fill the vacancy left by the death of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who had announced his retirement. Governor Chris Christie announced a special primary and general election to fill a Senate vacancy in New Jersey. He appointed Jeffrey S. Chiesa to serve until the special election. In South Carolina, Senator Jim DeMint resigned to lead The Heritage Foundation, and Governor Nikki Haley appointed Tim Scott to serve until a special election in 2014. In 2014, Senator DeMint resigned, and Senator Scott was sworn in to serve until 2017. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 addressed Senate vacancies, proposing governors fill vacancies if the state legislature is not in session. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 addressed Senate vacancies by proposing that governors fill vacancies if the state legislature is not in session. The provision was seen as necessary to prevent gaps in the Senate due to some legislatures meeting only once a year. Edmund Randolph of Virginia explained the importance of preventing chasms in the Senate, while James Wilson of Pennsylvania argued that state legislatures met frequently enough to handle vacancies. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 addressed Senate vacancies by proposing that governors fill vacancies if the state legislature is not in session. The provision aimed to prevent gaps in the Senate due to some legislatures meeting only once a year. Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut argued against executive appointment, but the motion was voted down. The Committee on Style and Arrangement made minor alterations before the provision was approved and inserted into Article I, Section 3. The provision for governors to fill Senate vacancies during recesses was approved by the Constitutional Convention and incorporated into the Constitution. There was little debate on this provision during ratification, and governors appointed temporary Senators for 124 years with minimal controversy. During the period from 1789 through 1913, state governors made 20 contested Senate appointments, with only 8 being excluded by the Senate. The primary issue was whether vacancies occurred during legislative recesses. Historian George Haynes noted that the Senate often rejected appointments made by governors when the legislature had the chance to fill the vacancies but failed to do so due to deadlocks. On average, there were 3.3 senatorial appointments per state during this time, with the number varying based on the state's length of time in the Union.

On average, there were 3.3 senatorial appointments per state during this time, with the number varying based on the state's length of time in the Union. Satisfaction with the status quo began to erode after the Civil War, leading to support for a constitutional amendment for direct popular election of the Senate. During the decades following the Civil War, state legislatures faced criticism for prolonged and deadlocked Senate elections. This led to 14 unfilled Senate seats for extended periods, resulting in a compromised election process tainted by corruption. Wealthy individuals and corporations were often accused of bribing for influence. The rise of support for direct election of Senators was fueled by corruption, with corporations and wealthy individuals accused of bribing state legislators to secure favored candidates. Once elected, Senators were seen as prioritizing party leaders and sponsors over constituents. This movement was part of a broader effort to strengthen representative democracy and expand voting rights, gaining support from progressive elements in both major parties and emerging political movements like the Populist and Socialist parties. The movement for direct election of Senators gained momentum due to corruption and a focus on party interests over constituents. The House of Representatives supported popular election amendments, but the Senate did not act. States, like Oregon in 1904, successfully implemented direct election through the initiative process. The movement for direct election of Senators gained momentum in the early 20th century, with over half the states adopting versions of the Oregon system by 1911. Pressure on the Senate increased, leading to petitions for a direct election amendment and Article V convention. Deadlocked elections and media coverage furthered the cause, culminating in both chambers revisiting the issue in 1911. In early 1911, both chambers revisited the issue of direct election of Senators. H.J.Res. 39 proposed that each state elect two Senators for six years, with electors having qualifications similar to those for the state legislature. Vacancies would be filled by election or temporary appointment by the state legislature. The proposed amendment for direct election of Senators included a controversial clause that would have given states sole authority over the election process, causing a delay in congressional proposal. Supporters argued it protected state sovereignty, while opponents saw it as a threat to voting rights. The 17th Amendment, allowing for direct election of Senators, faced opposition over a clause giving states control of elections. Despite debates and a tie vote in the Senate, the amendment passed with little discussion on the vacancies clause. Senator Bristow proposed a clause allowing state legislatures to empower their governors to make temporary Senate appointments until elections are held, similar to current procedures for filling vacancies. The 17th Amendment directed the governor to call special elections to fill Senate vacancies, similar to the process for the House of Representatives. After a year of debate, the amendment was ratified by the states in record time. The 17th Amendment was ratified on May 31, 1913, leading to precedents on Senate special elections and governors' power to appoint vacant seats. In Maryland, a special election was held to fill a Senate vacancy, challenging the governor's authority to issue the election writ. The Senate debated and seated the elected Senator. In Alabama, the governor sought to appoint an interim Senator. The governor of Alabama sought to appoint an interim Senator to fill a vacancy created in 1913 after the 17th Amendment was ratified. The Senate declined to seat the appointee, stating the governor needed state law authorization. The Senate Historical Office records 193 Senator appointments since 1913, including recent ones like Senators Schatz, Scott, Cowan, and Chiesa. Since 1913, there have been 193 Senator appointments, including Senators Schatz, Scott, Cowan, and Chiesa. 14 appointees were women, with some serving until a successor could be elected. 61.1% of appointees sought election, with 52.5% being successful. The data exclude \"technical\" resignations. The practice of appointing Senators-elect to serve out the balance of a term by state governors ended in 1980. A study from 1945 to 1979 found a low success rate in primary elections for appointed Senators seeking election in their own right. Scholars have investigated the electoral fate of appointed Senators. Scholars have found that appointed Senators who run for election often face mixed electoral success, being only half as likely to win and a significant portion failing to secure their party's nomination. Despite being full members of the Senate, their low survival rate in elections suggests they are not fully embraced by voters. Currently, 45 states allow governors to temporarily appoint Senators to fill vacancies, while some states require special elections or legislative approval for such appointments. Currently, 45 states allow governors to temporarily appoint Senators to fill vacancies, while some states require special elections or legislative approval for such appointments. Oregon, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin have specific provisions for filling Senate vacancies, with some states empowering the governor to appoint only the winner of a special election to fill the Senate seat for the balance of the term. Additionally, Connecticut restricted the governor's appointment authority in 2009, requiring legislative approval for filling Senate vacancies. A 2009 study by the Senate Judiciary Committee classified states based on their special election scheduling requirements. Eight states allow quick special elections with interim gubernatorial appointments, while 37 states permit gubernatorial appointments until the next general election. Alabama, Vermont, and Washington require governors to call special elections within 90 days (Vermont and Washington) or \"forthwith\" (Alabama) for vacancies, with exceptions for general election proximity. Special elections must coincide with general elections in these states under specific conditions. Several states have different systems for filling Senate vacancies. Some states allow the governor to make temporary appointments until the next general election, while others require special elections to be held within a specific timeframe. California and New Jersey have the option for a \"quick special election\" depending on the remaining term length. Some states have provisions for filling Senate vacancies, with varying rules on temporary appointments by governors and special elections. Eighteen states require appointees to serve until the next general election, potentially up to 30 months. Four states impose party-related restrictions on temporary replacements. Arizona mandates the appointed Senator to be of the same party as the previous incumbent. Arizona, Hawaii, Utah, and Wyoming have party-related restrictions for appointing temporary Senators. Critics argue that these requirements add unnecessary qualifications beyond constitutional criteria. Controversies in 2008 and 2009 led to proposals in some states to limit gubernatorial power in filling Senate vacancies. Bills affecting the governor's appointment authority under the 17th Amendment were introduced in several state legislatures. Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island passed legislation revising Senate vacancy procedures in 2009. In Connecticut, Senate bill SB 913 led to Public Law 09-170, eliminating gubernatorial authority to appoint temporary Senators in most cases and requiring special elections to fill vacancies. In 2009, Rhode Island eliminated the governor's appointment authority for Senate vacancies, while Massachusetts reinstated the governor's authority to fill vacancies by appointment. Senator Edward Kennedy proposed a temporary appointment law in Massachusetts due to concerns about the existing special election schedule. In response to Senator Kennedy's death in 2009, Governor Patrick urged expedited legislation for a gubernatorial appointment to fill the Senate vacancy until a special election on January 19, 2010. Paul G. Kirk was appointed to fill the vacancy, and state Senator Scott Brown won the special election. The 2010 special election in Massachusetts resulted in state Senator Scott Brown being chosen to serve the remainder of the term until January 3, 2013. Controversies surrounding Senate vacancies post-2008 elections led to proposed changes in the 111th Congress, but similar legislative activity did not occur in the 112th Congress. H.R. 899, introduced by Representative Aaron Schock, aimed to mandate special elections within 90 days of a Senate vacancy certification. H.R. 899 proposed expedited special elections to fill Senate vacancies within 90 days of certification. The bill also allowed for reimbursement of up to 50% of election costs by the Election Assistance Commission. The bill aimed to provide expedited special elections to fill Senate vacancies and assist states with election expenses. It addressed concerns about conflicts with the 17th Amendment by allowing gubernatorial appointments but would have led to shorter tenures for appointed Senators. Additionally, it included a program for reimbursing state and local governments for special election costs to avoid unfunded mandate objections.

Additionally, it included a program for reimbursing state and local governments for special election costs to avoid unfunded mandate objections. The bill may have faced a constitutional challenge for not being a constitutional amendment, but it had a better chance of passage due to lower hurdles for bills. The bill H.R. 899 aimed to eliminate states' authority to make temporary Senate appointments, but no further action was taken on it after being introduced in 2009. Another proposal, S.J.Res. 7, sought a similar amendment and was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Unlike bills, constitutional amendments face higher hurdles for passage. H.J.Res. 21, introduced by Representative David Dreier in 2009, aimed to change constitutional procedures for Senate vacancies by requiring election by the people and eliminating state temporary appointments. The 17th Amendment aimed to extend the voters' right to choose Senators through special elections for vacancies, aligning with the progression of previous amendments expanding voting rights. Supporters emphasized the importance of Senators being chosen by the people, while opponents may have raised concerns about the proposed changes. Opponents of the 17th Amendment argued that it was unnecessary to change the Constitution, as the provision for temporary Senate appointments had served the nation well for nearly a century. They believed the proposed amendment was an overreaction to a rare situation that resolved itself in a short time, and raised concerns about the financial strain special Senate elections would impose on states. They also questioned the issue of continuity in government. Critics of the proposed amendment raised concerns about the impact on the Senate's ability to reconstitute itself in case of a crisis like a terrorist attack. The amendment could potentially prolong the time needed to fill Senate vacancies. Both resolutions were referred to constitutional subcommittees for further review. The Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution approved S.J.Res. 7 but no further action was taken. Controversies surrounding Senate vacancies during the 2008 election led to media analyses, legislative proposals, and public interest. Senator Kennedy's death and the special election to succeed him generated even more attention at the state and federal levels. The special election to fill the Massachusetts Senate vacancy caused by Senator John Kerry's resignation did not generate significant national interest in the process of filling Senate vacancies. Proposed bills in the 111th Congress aimed at reforming Senate vacancy procedures faced obstacles in the legislative process and constitutional challenges. Interest in reforming Senate vacancy procedures at the federal level has subsided since 2010. The proposed constitutional amendments faced obstacles to passage and ratification, none progressed beyond the committee investigation stage."
