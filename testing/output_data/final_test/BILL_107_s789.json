    "content": "The Act aims to retain Armed Forces members in critical specialties by establishing an education savings plan for reenlistments and extensions of service. The Act establishes a savings plan for education expenses and contingencies for armed forces members based on their years of service and commitment to perform qualifying service. The Act establishes a savings plan for education expenses and contingencies for armed forces members based on their years of service and commitment to perform qualifying service, which includes service on active duty in a specialty designated as critical for a minimum of six years. A commitment can be in the form of a reenlistment for enlisted members or an agreement for commissioned officers. The Act establishes a savings plan for education expenses and contingencies for armed forces members based on their years of service and commitment to perform qualifying service. The total face amounts of United States savings bonds purchased for a member under this section vary based on the type of commitment: $5,000 for paragraph (1), excess of $15,000 for paragraph (2), and excess of $30,000 for paragraph (3). The total amount of benefit payable for a member when United States savings bonds are purchased under this section is the sum of the purchase price of the bonds and the amounts withheld for taxes. The amount withheld for taxes is treated in the same manner as deductions from the member's basic pay. If a person fails to complete obligated service after receiving benefits, they must repay a portion of the total amount paid. The repayment is considered a debt owed to the United States, but the Secretary may waive it under certain circumstances. The discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 does not release a person from debts arising from enlistment agreements within five years. The benefits provided under this section are in addition to any other special pays for qualifying service, and regulations are administered by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation administer regulations for benefits provided under this section, which are in addition to any other special pays for qualifying service. The Coast Guard falls under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Transportation when not operating as a service in the Navy. Section 323 of title 37, United States Code, establishes an incentive bonus savings plan for education and other contingencies. It will take effect on October 1, 2001, applying to reenlistments and agreements for qualifying service entered into on or after that date."
