    "content": "In recent years, concerns have arisen about the U.S. food safety system due to outbreaks of foodborne illnesses and unsafe food imports. There is a debate on whether farmers should be subject to mandatory safety standards or encouraged to follow voluntary strategies for producing safe foods. Some critics argue that the \"carrot\" approach to food safety is no longer effective, as consumers rely on foreign sources for food. Existing laws and regulations impose restrictions on food producers, including requirements on animal drugs and pesticides. Market-based incentives and voluntary standards set by food chains also play a role in regulating safety. High-profile illness outbreaks have brought on-farm practices into focus. In 2008, a Salmonella outbreak affected over 1,300 people in the US and Canada, initially linked to tomatoes but later traced to serrano peppers from Mexico. In 2006, contaminated spinach caused over 200 illnesses and three deaths in California, possibly due to E. coli contamination from wild pigs or contaminated water sources. Numerous recent recalls and illness outbreaks have been linked to E. coli O157:H7 in raw or undercooked beef products. The bacteria is endemic in the live U.S. cattle population and can become a greater hazard if measures are not taken to control its spread on ranches and feedlots and in processing plants. In July 2010, CDC noticed a spike in cases of infection with Salmonella Enteritidis, a strain commonly associated with shell eggs, which are regulated by FDA. FDA found the same pathogen on two egg farms in Iowa, leading to a nationwide recall of over 500 million eggs. Samples collected at the facilities matched the DNA fingerprint of the outbreak strain detected from manure and traffic areas in and around the facility. Pathogens, including bacteria and viruses, are the main cause of foodborne illnesses. They are commonly found in animal products like raw meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood. Fruits and vegetables, often consumed raw, are also a concern. Pathogens can be acquired at the farm level and may not always be eliminated through processing or cooking. In November 2010 through January 2011, over 100 people in 16 states and Washington, DC, were sickened by Salmonella-contaminated sprouts from an Illinois organic farm. On-farm food safety is complicated by a variety of pathogens associated with each food product. Viruses like hepatitis A can come from human feces, parasites like Cryptosporidium and bacteria such as Salmonella Enteritidis and E. coli O157 can proliferate on the farm. Factors like animal density and handling practices affect the prevalence of these pathogens. Some hazards in on-farm food safety include aflatoxin fungus infecting crops, improper pesticide application on fruits and vegetables, and nonbiological contaminants. The effectiveness of pre-harvest controls depends on avoiding safety issues throughout the food production chain. The impact of food safety measures before harvest on foodborne illnesses is not always clear. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ensures the safety of domestic and imported foods, except for major meat and poultry species. The FDA is governed by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act added new provisions to the FFDCA in 2010. The FDA, under the FFDCA and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, shares responsibilities for egg safety with the USDA. FDA has authority to regulate on-farm activities but mainly focuses on inspections of food processing facilities, testing for adulterants, and enforcing CGMP requirements. Compliance failures can lead to enforcement actions and penalties. The FDA enforces regulations on food safety, with penalties for non-compliance. Certain establishments are exempt, such as those solely involved in harvesting or storing raw agricultural commodities. Record-keeping requirements are outlined in the FFDCA, with additional rules for high-risk foods. If the Secretary suspects adulteration or a threat, further actions may be taken. The FDA enforces food safety regulations with penalties for non-compliance. Certain establishments are exempt, like those involved in harvesting or storing raw agricultural commodities. FFDCA \u00a7 415 allows officers to access and copy records related to adulterated food if there is a threat to health. Food facilities must register with the FDA. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) amended the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to require registration of facilities engaged in food manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding in the US. The term \"facility\" includes factories, warehouses, and establishments, but excludes farms, restaurants, and retail food establishments. The FFDCA exempts farms but does not define the term. FDA regulations implement these provisions. The FDA regulations provide guidance on how farms are treated under the Food Safety Modernization Act. Farms are exempt from facility registration requirements if they are in one physical location devoted to growing and harvesting crops or raising animals. The term \"farm\" includes facilities that pack or hold food, as long as the food is grown, raised, or consumed on that farm or another farm under the same ownership. The FDA regulations exempt farms from facility registration requirements if they are in one physical location devoted to growing and harvesting crops or raising animals. The agency relies on farmers adopting good agricultural practices to reduce hazards before harvest, focusing on the safety of fresh fruit and vegetables. Recommendations cover water use, manure application, and worker sanitation. The FDA has initiatives to improve lettuce and tomato safety, including farm visits and guidance documents for growers. The FDA published a final rule in July 2009 requiring shell egg producers to implement safety measures to prevent on-farm contamination of eggs by Salmonella Enteritidis (SE). This rule addresses SE testing in poultry houses, procurement of chicks and pullets, pest control, biosecurity programs, disinfection of poultry houses, and on-farm refrigeration of eggs. It applies to farms with 3,000 or more laying hens, unless they sell directly to consumers. The FDA's final rule in July 2009 requires safety measures for shell egg producers to prevent Salmonella Enteritidis contamination. The rule applies to farms with 3,000 or more laying hens, with exceptions for direct sales to consumers. Small producers have until July 9, 2012, to comply. FDA published guidance to help small producers follow the rule. Additionally, FDA is developing a proposed produce safety regulation and new provisions in the FSMA address hazard analysis, preventive controls, safety standards for produce, and traceability. The FSMA provisions include risk-based preventive controls, safety standards for produce, and traceability requirements. The USDA's FSIS regulates the safety and labeling of meat, poultry, and catfish products under the FMIA and PPIA. Agency oversight begins at slaughter facilities to prevent adulterated meat and poultry from entering commerce. The USDA's FSIS regulates the safety and labeling of meat, poultry, and catfish products under the FMIA and PPIA, preventing adulterated products from entering commerce through inspections before and after slaughter. Farmers and ranchers are not directly subject to these regulations, but slaughter establishments are required to reject unhealthy animals to prevent contamination. Under the FFDCA, FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine regulates drugs and feeds for animals to ensure food safety. FDA's rule prohibits the use of ruminant materials in animal feeds to prevent the spread of BSE. The FDA works to prevent the spread of BSE, a rare disease that can be transmitted to humans through infected tissues. They collaborate with FSIS to test for drug residues in meat and poultry, conduct follow-up inspections of livestock producers, and monitor raw milk for drug residues. The EPA regulates pesticides used in food crops under FIFRA. Under FIFRA and FFDCA, it is prohibited to use pesticides in a way that goes against approved label instructions. EPA sets tolerances for pesticide residues in food to prevent harm to health. Foods with residues exceeding tolerances are considered adulterated. FDA monitors residue limits, while EPA and states enforce FIFRA. FDA Science Board noted limitations in monitoring compliance with approved pesticide usage. State and local authorities have limited monitoring capabilities for on-farm practices. Under the Animal Health Protection Act, USDA's APHIS aims to protect livestock and poultry from diseases like BSE, avian influenza, and bovine tuberculosis. Salmonella Enteritidis, found in poultry, is a major cause of foodborne illness. APHIS can impose regulatory requirements on producers to control animal diseases. USDA is proposing a new approach for individual states. USDA is proposing a voluntary program for states to choose their own level of animal identification and traceability for livestock populations to control animal diseases and improve food safety. Some policymakers believe animal ID can contribute to food safety by linking to a farm-to-retail food traceability system. AMS oversees programs to ensure agricultural products meet quality standards. Under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, AMS offers voluntary testing and process verification programs funded by industry user fees. These programs use third-party audits to help producers certify product quality, although they are not regulatory in nature. AMS aims to facilitate commercial agreements and provide consumers with more information about their purchases. In 2007, AMS sought feedback on a federal marketing program for leafy greens safety standards. Agricultural associations later requested a national marketing agreement for leafy greens, which differs from an order in its voluntary nature. California and Arizona already have similar state orders in place. Nearly 120 handlers in California, representing 99% of leafy greens volume, have committed to selling products grown in compliance with food safety practices accepted by the LGMA board. Mandatory third-party audits verify compliance. A national agreement would cover the remaining 10% of leafy greens production in the nation, ensuring adherence to safety practices aimed at enhancing produce quality. Some food safety advocacy organizations are concerned that AMS, primarily providing quality and grading services, would be conducting safety inspections. The USDA (AMS) is involved in a national agreement for leafy green vegetables, with inspections conducted on a fee-for-service basis. AMS requested $2.3 million from Congress to initiate the agreement, which would be managed by an industry committee. Violations of FDA law are expected to be reported to the FDA by agricultural inspectors. In March 2010, FDA announced plans to establish safety standards for fresh produce production and packing. Produce groups support using the LGMA as a model for new food safety regulations. The 111th Congress passed the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act in December 2010, focusing on FDA-regulated foods. The 112th Congress is expected to continue food safety regulation efforts. The 112th Congress will oversee the implementation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), including FDA's coordination with other federal agencies like USDA and DHS. Funding for the implementation of FSMA is a concern, with potential impacts on farms, especially produce growers. New standards for produce safety and other requirements such as facility registration, records access, food traceability, and preventive controls could affect on-farm activities. The enacted law reflects compromise language addressing concerns about economic and regulatory effects on small businesses. Congress modified provisions to address potential effects on small farms, food processors, and agricultural interests in the food safety debate. The FSMA was modified to address small-farm concerns in a substitute manager's amendment. Some farm groups are still advocating for additional changes. The new provisions will establish standards for produce safety, affecting on-farm activity, especially for produce growers. The FSMA was modified to address small-farm concerns by introducing new on-farm safety standards, facility registration requirements, records access, food traceability, preventive controls, and inspection resource targeting. These provisions may impact small businesses and farming operations, but coordination with USDA and state authorities is emphasized. The specific business requirements and extent of impact remain unclear pending agency rulemaking and HHS Secretary discretion. The FSMA was modified to address small-farm concerns by introducing new on-farm safety standards, facility registration requirements, records access, food traceability, preventive controls, and inspection resource targeting. The impact on small businesses and farming operations remains unclear pending agency rulemaking and HHS Secretary discretion. It is difficult to estimate the extent of exemptions for food processing operations and farms from new requirements, as definitions are yet to be determined. Some farms engaging in food processing may be affected, but data on the percentage of farms involved in processing are not available. Additionally, data is lacking on the percentage of grower-processors that may qualify for exemptions for locally sold foods. FSMA \u00a7 105 establishes new safety standards for produce, requiring science-based minimum standards for safe production and harvesting of fruits and vegetables. The proposed rules will include standards for growing, harvesting, sorting, packing, and storage operations. Data on the percentage of grower-processors that may qualify for exemptions is not available. The FSMA establishes safety standards for produce, including requirements for sorting, packing, storage, soil amendments, hygiene, packaging, temperature controls, animal encroachment, and water. Proposed rules aim to be flexible for different types of entities, including small businesses and direct-to-consumer sales, while considering conservation and environmental standards. Certified organic production rules must not conflict with organic requirements. The FSMA prioritizes raw fruits and vegetables linked to foodborne illness outbreaks, includes provisions for public input and timelines, grants variances for states and foreign governments, and considers exemptions and extended deadlines for small businesses. The FSMA prioritizes raw fruits and vegetables linked to foodborne illness outbreaks, includes provisions for public input and timelines, grants variances for states and foreign governments, and considers exemptions and extended deadlines for small businesses. Small businesses are given one to two years to comply with registration requirements, and certain farms are exempt from new produce standards based on their sales value. FSMA \u00a7 101 amends FFDCA \u00a7 414 and modifies the circumstances under which the HHS Secretary could access the records of facilities. The exemption for both facilities and farms may be revoked in the event of a foodborne illness outbreak linked to an exempted facility or farm. Farms that fall within the definition of a \"facility\" would be affected by these amendments. FSMA \u00a7 102 amends FFDCA \u00a7 415 to require biennial facility registration, with new information requirements and terms for suspending registrations. Farms are not affected unless they process food for sale. The FSMA does not set a registration fee but considers small businesses and clarifies retail food establishments exempt from registration requirements. FSMA \u00a7 103 establishes new requirements for preventive controls for food safety in facilities, excluding farms unless they process food for sale. The law allows exemptions for facilities solely engaged in specific activities like producing food for animals or storing raw agricultural commodities. The FSMA \u00a7 103 establishes preventive control requirements for food safety in facilities, with exemptions for certain activities and small businesses. Small businesses have two years, and very small businesses have three years after final regulations for implementation. Certain food processing operations are exempt from new requirements if they are very small businesses or meet specific criteria. The FSMA \u00a7 103 establishes preventive control requirements for food safety in facilities, with exemptions for certain activities and small businesses. Small businesses have two years, and very small businesses have three years after final regulations for implementation. A \"very small business\" as defined by FDA in rulemaking, or if the facility's \"average annual monetary value\" of all food sold during the previous three-year period was less than $500,000, provided that the food is sold directly to \"qualified end users\" such as consumers, restaurants, or retail food establishments located in the same state where the facility sold the food or within 275 miles of the facility. Such a facility would need to demonstrate that it either has \"identified potential hazards associated with the food being produced,\" and is implementing and monitoring these preventive controls, or that it is \"in compliance with State, local, county, or other applicable non-Federal food safety law.\" Foods produced from such a facility would also need to provide the facility's name and address on a food packaging label or at the point of purchase. FSMA \u00a7 201 specifically requires the HHS Secretary to inspect food facilities (as defined under FFDCA \u00a7 415) and to allocate inspection. FSMA \u00a7 204 requires the HHS Secretary to inspect food facilities based on risk profiles, with lower-risk facilities inspected every four years and higher-risk facilities annually. Farms processing food for sale are subject to inspections, while others are excluded. The Secretary must establish pilot projects to improve tracking and tracing of foods during outbreaks within 270 days of enactment. The FSMA \u00a7 204 mandates the HHS Secretary to inspect food facilities based on risk profiles, with lower-risk facilities inspected every four years and higher-risk facilities annually. Farms processing food for sale are subject to inspections, while others are excluded. The Secretary must establish pilot projects to improve tracking and tracing of foods during outbreaks within 270 days of enactment. Recipients of food must prevent or mitigate foodborne illness outbreaks and address threats of adverse health consequences due to adulterated or misbranded food. Projects must include processed food and fruits/vegetables, reflecting food supply diversity. At least three different types of foods with significant outbreaks in the past five years must be included in the projects. The Secretary will establish additional record-keeping requirements for high-risk foods within two years of enactment. The Secretary will designate high-risk foods within one year of enactment based on specified criteria. Record-keeping requirements include information protection, public input, and rules on retention of records. Certain exemptions and modifications may be made for specific programs and food producers. The Secretary has the authority to modify requirements or exempt foods/facilities if product tracing is not necessary for public protection. The law allows the Secretary to request information from U.S. farms, with limitations, but not on commingled foods. Failure to comply with record-keeping provisions is prohibited, with considerations for small businesses given delayed implementation timelines. Farm and rural groups, particularly small farms and processors, are concerned about the potential impact of new food safety requirements. They are worried that the proposed regulations could be too costly and burdensome for small businesses, outweighing the intended public health benefits. Suggestions for addressing these concerns include waiving certain requirements, extending compliance deadlines, providing financial assistance, and exempting certain businesses from the regulations. The current Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act already exempts some businesses from specific food safety requirements. The FFDCA exempts certain businesses from food safety requirements, such as farms, restaurants, retail food establishments, and fishing vessels. Definitions of \"small\" businesses are based on financial measures like annual income or sales. USDA uses gross cash income to classify farms, with a \"small commercial farm\" defined as having income of $10,000 or less. USDA defines small commercial farms based on gross cash income, with a range of $10,000 to less than $250,000 annually. About one-third of crop and livestock producers fall into this category. The share of small commercial farms varies by commodity, with roughly 10% of fruit and vegetable producers considered small commercial farms. Definitions of small businesses vary in legislation and by agency, such as the Small Business Administration setting different thresholds. The Small Business Administration (SBA) and USDA have different thresholds for defining small businesses, with SBA setting the limit at $750,000 in annual sales. USDA uses this threshold to identify small and very small meat and poultry plants for oversight activities. Adjusted gross income (AGI) is also used to differentiate farm sizes in legislation. Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is a key income measure used to differentiate farm sizes and for tax purposes. It includes income from all sources, with business income contributing on a net basis after expenses. AGI limits are used in the farm bill to determine eligibility for commodity program benefits, with the 2008 bill setting limits at $500,000 for non-farm AGI and $750,000 for farm AGI. Farms with less than $500,000 AGI make up over 95% of U.S. farms. Farms with less than $500,000 AGI represent over 95% of all U.S. farms. Data on the percentage of farms engaging in food processing is unavailable. Limited data exists on market channels for locally produced foods. Small food processors are defined by the number of employees according to SBA standards. Most food processors are considered small businesses with no more than 500 employees, according to SBA standards. FDA regulations exempt certain small food processing businesses, like juice processors employing fewer than 500 persons, from HACCP requirements. This means that as many as 84% of juice businesses are not covered by HACCP. Small businesses exempt from FDA regulations if they meet specific criteria, such as annual sales less than $500,000 or employ fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees. About 12% of fruit and vegetable manufacturers fall into this category. Producers of raw agricultural ingredients of juice are not covered by HACCP requirements. FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) enacted in the 110th and 111th Congress for food safety. Farm and rural groups express concerns about economic and regulatory effects on farms and food processors. During the 111th Congress's food safety debate, concerns were raised by small farms, food processors, and rural groups regarding new food safety requirements in proposed legislation. Representative Rosa DeLauro introduced a comprehensive food safety bill (H.R. 875), sparking worries that small and organic farms could be undermined in favor of industrialized agriculture. Concerns were raised about the impact of new food safety requirements on small and organic farms during the 111th Congress's food safety debate. Some groups criticized the ambiguity in the definition of a \"food production facility\" in the proposed legislation, fearing that organic producers and backyard gardeners could be penalized. Representative DeLauro defended her bill, H.R. 875, stating that its focus was to address myths and ensure food safety. DeLauro defended her bill, H.R. 875, emphasizing its focus on food safety in interstate commerce and not on regulating backyard gardens or farmers markets. Despite concerns about its impact on small farms, consumer advocacy groups supported the bill and urged affected parties to seek improvements rather than oppose it. Carol Tucker Foreman suggested tailoring requirements based on different types of agriculture. H.R. 2749, the House food safety vehicle, was modified to exempt direct-to-market farms from some traceability provisions. Small farm advocates opposed this and other sections of the bill, expressing concerns about FDA applying facility registration requirements to farms that do processing activities like washing and packaging fruits and vegetables. The regulatory framework of H.R. 2749 burdens small farms and local food processors, who provide a safe alternative to industrial food. Small farms and organic growers object to registering their facilities and being inspected by federal authorities. Traditional agricultural groups also express concerns about the bill. Traditional agricultural groups raised concerns about H.R. 2749, stating that it could impose redundant on-farm regulatory authorities and significant costs on small farms and food producers. They argued that the FDA lacks the expertise to regulate certain agricultural practices and that the bill may violate U.S. trade commitments, potentially leading to retaliation against U.S. agricultural exports. The House-passed bill includes provisions to address the impact on small, organic, direct-to-market, and sustainable farming operations. H.R. 2749 includes provisions exempting most commodity producers selling directly to consumers from facility registration requirements. It also mandates regulations to consider the impact on small-scale farms, wildlife habitat, conservation practices, and organic production methods. Agriculture groups continued to push for modifications to address farm interests following the House bill passage. Agriculture groups urged Congress to address farm concerns with H.R. 2749, emphasizing the need to mitigate potential impacts on small, organic, direct-to-market, and sustainable farming operations. Senate HELP Committee modifications to S. 510 included flexibility for various types of entities in raw agricultural commodity production, consideration of conservation and environmental standards, and assurance of no conflict with the Organic Foods Production Act. The Senate's August 2010 manager's amendment to S. 510 included provisions to address the impact of food safety requirements on small businesses and farming operations. It allowed for exemptions or limitations on compliance requirements for certain farming operations and food processors, as well as discretion for the HHS Secretary to exclude low-risk operations. The amendment also ensured new regulations would not conflict with existing federal policies, minimize regulatory burden, and reduce unnecessary paperwork. The Senate's August 2010 manager's amendment to S. 510 included provisions to address the impact of food safety requirements on small businesses and farming operations. It allowed for exemptions or limitations on compliance requirements for certain farming operations and food processors, as well as discretion for the HHS Secretary to exclude low-risk operations. Senator Jon Tester continued to push for further amendments to address small farm interests despite additional modifications made to assist small entities in complying with proposed requirements. Senator Tester announced amendments to the Senate bill S. 510 in 2010 to address small farm interests. The amendments included limited traceback and record-keeping requirements based on income levels and exemptions for producers selling directly to consumers. These amendments were not included in the Senate manager's amendment in August 2010. Tester later introduced a modified version of the amendment with Senator Kay Hagan, which included provisions for \"very small\" businesses. Under proposed amendments, certain qualified facilities, including \"very small\" businesses, would be exempt from certain food safety requirements. Instead, they would need to provide documentation to HHS showing implementation of preventive food safety controls and compliance with relevant food safety laws. These modified requirements would apply to producers classified as \"very small\" with annual sales under $500,000 and sales directly to \"qualified end-users.\" Qualified end-users include consumers, restaurants, or retail food establishments. The provision would delay implementation deadlines for small and very small businesses after the enactment of new regulations. It also mandates a study of the food processing sector by HHS in collaboration with USDA. The Senate-passed bill exempts certain food processing operations from HACCP requirements and certain farms from new produce standards. The Senate-passed bill exempts certain food processing operations and farms from new produce standards. Food facilities can qualify for an exemption from HACCP requirements if they are a \"very small business\" or if their annual food sales are less than $500,000 to qualified end users within a certain distance. Facilities must demonstrate hazard identification and compliance with food safety laws. Products must include facility information on packaging. The Tester-Hagan amendment in the enacted law exempts certain food facilities and farms from produce standards based on sales and direct sales to qualified end users. Exemptions can be revoked in case of a foodborne illness outbreak or HHS Secretary's determination. Farm groups supported the amendment, while the United Fresh Produce Association opposed it. The United Fresh Produce Association (UFPA) opposed adding exemptions based on operation size, production practices, or geographic location to the food safety proposal. Concerns were raised about consumer confidence, potential exemptions for small foreign producers, and creating loopholes in food safety requirements. Public health and consumer groups also expressed opposition to the Tester-Hagan amendment. The coalition of groups opposed the modified Tester-Hagan amendment, citing concerns about exemptions based on sales volume and the need for labeling requirements for high-risk foods. They called for FDA to conduct market analyses to determine appropriate thresholds for exemption and questioned aspects of the proposed amendment, such as the 400-mile designation and inclusion of grocery stores and restaurants in \"direct sales.\""
