The country hosts millions of foreign nationals temporarily and welcomes 1 million lawful permanent residents annually. Foreign nationals must meet criteria specified in the Immigration and Nationality Act to be eligible for admission and not be deemed inadmissible based on specified grounds. Foreign nationals may be deemed inadmissible based on health-related grounds specified in the INA. Questions arise about the adequacy of these provisions in dealing with potential pandemics. Congress faces challenges in updating health-related grounds for exclusion, balancing economic harm from travel restrictions, and ensuring resources for screening potentially infected travelers. DOS and DHS play key roles in administering laws and policies. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of State (DOS) are key in administering laws and policies on alien admission. DOS issues visas, USCIS approves immigrant petitions, and CBP inspects all entering the US. HHS determines health-related inadmissibility, while CDC in HHS protects against communicable diseases for foreign nationals. Aliens must undergo reviews by DOS consular officers and CBP inspectors for admission to the US. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of State (DOS) play key roles in administering laws and policies on alien admission to the United States. Applicants undergo reviews by DOS consular officers and CBP inspectors to ensure they are not ineligible for visas or admission under various grounds for inadmissibility, including health-related grounds, criminal history, security concerns, public charge, illegal entry, and more. The exclusion of aliens based on health or communicable diseases dates back to the Immigration Act of 1891. The Immigration Act of 1891 added grounds for exclusion based on loathsome or dangerous contagious diseases, with a requirement for medical inspection of arriving aliens. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 included seven health-related grounds for exclusion. The Immigration Amendments Act of 1990 streamlined the grounds for inadmissibility into nine categories, including communicable diseases of public health significance. In 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act amended the INA to require prospective immigrants to show proof of vaccination against certain diseases. This included mumps, measles, rubella, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, influenza type B, and hepatitis B. The policy debate since 1990 focused on HIV/AIDS, leading to amendments in 1993 and 2008 to address this issue. The Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 removed the statutory barrier for foreign nationals with HIV/AIDS entering the US. A final rule by DHS allows consular officers to grant nonimmigrant visas to HIV-positive applicants meeting certain requirements for visits up to 30 days. The CDC also amended its regulations to exclude HIV from the list of communicable diseases of public health significance. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) deems foreign nationals with certain communicable diseases inadmissible. The Secretary of Health and Human Services defines these diseases, including chancroid, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis. The list is not exhaustive and may include diseases listed in a Presidential Executive Order. The executive order lists various communicable diseases, including cholera, diphtheria, tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers, SARS, and novel influenza viruses that may cause a pandemic. The CDC Director determines if a disease poses a public health emergency of international concern based on its seriousness, unusual emergence, risk of spread in the US, and transmissibility. The CDC determines the threat of disease importation into the US, particularly tuberculosis (TB) with drug-resistant strains causing concern. Instructions and preparedness plans are in place for screening travelers infected with TB. About one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with over 1 million deaths annually from TB disease. Some individuals with TB disease are contagious and can transmit the disease. In 2005, processing of Hmong refugees in Thailand was halted to ensure completion of TB treatment before entering the US. Concerns arose in 2007 when individuals with drug-resistant TB were allowed entry despite being flagged for interdiction. This led to a reassessment of federal coordination for TB and other contagious diseases. In 2013, nearly 10,000 TB cases were reported in the US, with 65% among foreign-born individuals. The case rate of TB among foreign-born persons is significantly higher than among U.S.-born persons. The proportion of TB cases among foreign-born individuals has been steadily increasing since 1993. Medical screening for TB is required for refugees and foreign nationals seeking LPR visas in the US, but CBP does not have specific provisions for TB screening at ports of entry. Most TB cases among foreign-born individuals in the US are due to reactivation of latent TB infection acquired in their countries of origin. Foreign nationals seeking visas in the US undergo medical examinations conducted by designated physicians to ensure they are not symptomatic of communicable diseases. The CDC provides guidance to civil surgeons and panel physicians for these exams. Civil surgeons designated by USCIS conduct medical exams for foreign nationals adjusting to legal permanent resident status in the US. A medical examination is required for foreign nationals seeking legal permanent residency or refugee status in the US, and may be necessary for those applying for nonimmigrant visas. Costs are generally covered by the individual, except for refugees. Children under 15 require a physical exam and proof of immunizations. CDC guidelines outline the responsibilities of designated physicians conducting these exams. Physicians conducting medical examinations for foreign nationals must meet INA requirements. CDC guidance outlines the assessment process, including medical history, physical exam, and diagnostic tests. The physician completes DS-2053 or I-693 forms based on visa processing location. Reports are valid for one year, and the presence of designated diseases may not always lead to exclusion. Foreign nationals diagnosed with tuberculosis are classified into different categories based on their infectiousness. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive health-related grounds for inadmissibility under certain circumstances, allowing individuals with communicable diseases to still enter the country. Waivers are available for certain individuals to enter the country if they are related to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. The Secretary can waive health-related grounds for inadmissibility if it is in the national interest. In FY2013, 362 potential LPRs were initially denied visas due to communicable diseases, but 377 people obtained waivers and were granted LPR visas. In FY2013, 17 potential nonimmigrants were denied visas due to a communicable disease, while four individuals obtained waivers and received nonimmigrant visas. Foreign nationals can be rendered inadmissible for not being vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases such as mumps, measles, rubella, polio, and tetanus. Vaccinations for various diseases are required for visa applicants, including mumps, measles, rubella, polio, tetanus, and hepatitis B. Additional vaccinations may be necessary based on recommendations from the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices. Visa denials due to lack of vaccination can be overcome with proof of vaccination, but fraudulent records are treated the same as no records. Waivers for vaccination requirements may be granted in certain circumstances. The United States has 328 official ports of entry, including 16 preclearance offices in other countries. CBP officers screened 362 million individuals in FY2013 for admissions, with the majority occurring at land borders. Land borders pose the most significant challenge for screening infectious diseases due to long inspection lines. The CDC is responsible for providing technical instructions to civil surgeons and panel physicians conducting medical examinations for immigration. Quarantine stations are located in some international airports and near a few land ports of entry, but they are limited in number compared to the total ports of entry. Staffing all ports of entry for routine health screening is not feasible, so the CDC focuses on select locations for monitoring. The CDC, through their Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ), trains CBP inspectors to watch for ill persons and public health concerns at ports of entry. CDC approves physicians at POEs and tests are done in consultation with CDC guidance. CBP officers are responsible for observing travelers for signs of communicable diseases like fever, jaundice, respiratory problems, bleeding, weakness, or paralysis. CDC officials are stationed at the border during immigration emergencies to protect public health. CBP officers are trained to watch for signs of illness in travelers at ports of entry. They are not qualified to diagnose or treat medical conditions. Ill persons who need medical attention are identified through various scenarios, including self-disclosure or suspicion by CBP officers. CBP officers are trained to watch for signs of illness in travelers at ports of entry. They may isolate individuals matching public health alerts and notify CDC and local health authorities. Personal protective equipment is provided for handling suspected cases. CBP officers are trained to watch for signs of illness in travelers at ports of entry and may isolate individuals with communicable diseases. CDC coordinates with CBP to identify individuals from areas with disease outbreaks, focusing on exit-based airport screening. CDC emphasizes controlling diseases at the source and states that Ebola poses little risk to the U.S. general population. The CDC's policies and procedures outline the obligations of physicians conducting medical examinations for foreign nationals seeking visas, including a thorough medical history assessment. This includes reviewing hospitalizations, chronic conditions, illnesses, psychoactive drug and alcohol use, harmful behavior, and psychiatric illness. The physician conducting medical examinations for foreign nationals seeking visas reviews medical records for history of harmful behavior, psychiatric illness, and tuberculosis. Other records like police, military, school, or employment are also considered to determine any illnesses or disabilities that significantly impact well-being. Symptoms related to cardiovascular, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric disorders are specifically asked about. Infectious diseases like tuberculosis, HIV, syphilis, chancroid, and gonorrhea are also assessed. The physical examination for foreign nationals seeking visas includes evaluation for excludable communicable diseases and Class A and Class B conditions. It involves assessing mental status, intelligence, cognition, and behavior, as well as examining various body systems and conducting diagnostic tests for communicable diseases and other conditions."
