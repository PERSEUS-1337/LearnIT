    "content": "Visual attention mechanisms in image captioning models have been improved by replacing traditional softmax attention with sparsemax and Total-Variation Sparse Attention (TVmax). TVmax promotes sparsity and enhances interpretability by selecting relevant groups of features. Results on Microsoft COCO and Flickr30k datasets show improvements over softmax, with TVmax outperforming other attention mechanisms in caption quality and attention relevance. The goal of image captioning is to generate a descriptive textual caption for a given image. Image captioning combines text generation with object detection in images. Designing models with structural bias can improve adequacy by preserving image information. State-of-the-art approaches use encoder-decoders with visual attention, focusing on features from CNNs pretrained on image recognition datasets. In this paper, the focus is on visual attention over features generated by a CNN without explicit object detection. The attention mechanism plays a crucial role in identifying relevant image regions in an unsupervised manner. The standard choice for mapping scores into probabilities is softmax, but it can lead to a lack of focus and repetitive captions for complex images with many objects. In this work, novel visual attention mechanisms are introduced to select only relevant features of an image. Softmax is replaced with sparsemax to obtain sparse attention weights, and a new mechanism called Total-Variation Sparse Attention (TVMAX) is proposed to encourage similar weights for related spatial locations. The paper introduces a new attention mechanism called Total-Variation Sparse Attention (TVMAX), which improves interpretability and feature selection in generated captions. The mechanism is compared with softmax and sparsemax attention in human evaluation experiments. The paper presents three main contributions: a novel visual attention mechanism using sparse attention, a new attention mechanism called TVMAX for selecting compact objects, and an empirical comparison of various attention mechanisms. These mechanisms improve the quality of generated captions, increase interpretability, and enhance feature selection in spatial locations. The proposed selective visual attention mechanisms use sparsemax for better isolation of relevant image regions, allowing for sparse outputs with minimal complexity. This sparsity enhances feature selection in spatial locations, improving caption quality and interpretability. The proposed TVMAX visual attention mechanism is a non-trivial generalization of sparsemax for better isolation of relevant image regions, enhancing feature selection and improving caption quality. The generalized fused lasso penalty encourages fused solutions where w_i is close to w_j for i \u223c j in a graph defined by edges E. The proximal operator seeks a vector w that approximates z well and is encouraged to be fused, with efficient algorithms existing for certain edge configurations like chains. The 1D total variation problem can be solved in O(k) time using the taut string algorithm. For 2D total variation, exact algorithms are not available, but iterative methods can be applied by splitting the penalty into column-wise and row-wise 1D problems. TVMAX combines 2D total variation regularization with sparsemax to promote sparsity and encourage attention weights of adjacent spatial locations to be the same. TVMAX is a transformation that combines 2D total variation regularization with sparsemax to encourage sparsity and similarity in attention weights of adjacent spatial locations. The optimization function involves a constrained fused lasso approximator, with the solution p required to be a probability distribution vector. The computation of generalized fusedmax is efficiently done following a specific method outlined in Proposition 1. The proof of computing generalized fusedmax is provided in Appendix A.2. Proposition 1 offers a shortcut for deriving the Jacobian of generalized fusedmax using the chain rule. Proposition 2 presents a group-wise characterization of prox \u03bb\u2126 E, simplifying the computation of a generalized Jacobian of gfusedmax. This generalizes previous work to generalized fused lasso with a simpler proof in Appendix A.3. The forward pass of TVMAX can be computed efficiently by chaining algorithms for TV2D and sparsemax. The Jacobian of TVMAX can be calculated using the Jacobians of sparsemax and Total Variation proximal operator. The backward pass involves spreading credit evenly across fused positions, inspired by flood filling algorithms. To compare attention mechanisms, a simple encoder-decoder model with visual attention is used. A pretrained CNN generates a feature map for an image, which is then processed to obtain feature maps used for caption generation. The text discusses the use of input and output attention in a model for generating captions based on image information. Attention weights are computed using LSTM hidden states and image features to select relevant information for word generation. The text discusses the use of input and output attention in a model for generating captions based on image information. The image features are transformed using a feedforward layer to produce the image representation, which is then used to predict the next word. The models were trained on datasets like MSCOCO and Flickr30k using an LSTM hidden size of 512 and a word embedding size of 256. Training was done for 50 epochs with the Adam optimizer and a learning rate decay after the 10th epoch. The text discusses the use of selective attention mechanisms in caption generation models trained on MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets. Results show that sparsemax and TVMAX attention mechanisms outperform softmax, indicating that selective attention reduces repetition. The study compares the performance of selective attention mechanisms in caption generation models, showing that TVMAX and sparsemax outperform softmax. Despite slightly slower inference times, TVMAX and sparsemax still yield better captions and attention relevance in human evaluation. TVMAX and sparsemax outperform softmax in caption generation models, with TVMAX showing superior results in human evaluation for attention relevance and caption quality.softmax attention tends to repeat references, while TVMAX selects relevant features more effectively. TVMAX and sparsemax outperform softmax in caption generation models by reducing repetition and selecting compact regions effectively. TVMAX generates longer sentences but promotes structured and sparse attention simultaneously, leading to better human evaluation results. The Jensen-Shannon divergence values show that sparsity in attention distribution results in less repetition. The mean JS values for softmax, sparsemax, and TVmax are 0.12, 0.29, and 0.34, respectively. TVMAX shows the highest percentage of reference objects being referred to in captions. Sparsemax and TVMAX have lower average image areas receiving zero attention compared to softmax. Softmax weights are spread widely across the image, missing relevant regions. The softmax weights are spread widely across the image, missing relevant regions, while sparsemax and TVMAX have zero weights for non-relevant spatial locations. TVMAX model better identifies relevant parts of the image, offering improved interpretability and generating coherent captions. TVMAX correctly identifies groups of features, leading to more accurate captions compared to sparsemax and softmax models. Neural models with visual attention mechanisms have gained interest for image captioning. Different attention mechanisms have been studied to refine visual information. Hard attention focuses on one region at a time, while bottom-up and top-down attention select relevant bounding boxes. An hierarchical attention network includes a patch detector, object detector, and concept. The hierarchical attention network includes a patch detector, object detector, and concept detector. Object detection models are less demanding on the attention mechanism but limited by bounding box accuracy. Sparse attention, proposed in prior works, focuses on relevant features for prediction. Niculae & Blondel (2017) introduced 1D fusedmax to improve attention distribution. The authors improved interpretability without sacrificing performance by introducing a generalized fused attention mechanism, extending 1D fusedmax. They utilized sparse and structured visual attention, specifically sparsemax and TVMAX, to enhance feature selection for caption generation. Results showed superior performance in image captioning tasks, with better feature selection and improved model interpretability. Future applications include using TVMAX attention for other multimodal problems like visual question answering. TVMAX attention can be applied to other multimodal problems such as visual question answering and tasks with prior knowledge of data structure like graphs or trees. Human evaluation involved selecting scores for captions generated by models using different attention mechanisms and assessing if the models attended to relevant image regions. The study involved human evaluation of captions generated by models using different attention mechanisms. Attention plots were assessed for relevance by 6 evaluators, with scores ranging from 1 to 5. The mean scores for captions and attention relevance were computed, and the results are presented in Table 2. Additional attention visualization in Figure 4 shows examples of captions generated using different attention mechanisms. The study evaluated captions generated by models using various attention mechanisms. Figure 5 displays examples of captions produced with different attention types: softmax, sparsemax, and TVMAX. The captions describe scenes like a soccer player running and a group playing soccer."
