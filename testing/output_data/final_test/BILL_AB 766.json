    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Health and Safety Code is amended to establish a grant program for school health centers to receive technical assistance and funding for expansion and development. Centers must offer a range of services and provide primary healthcare supervised by licensed professionals. The school health centers offer a range of services including physical examinations, immunizations, diagnosis and treatment of injuries, management of chronic conditions, basic laboratory tests, referrals to specialty care, reproductive health services, nutrition services, mental health services, and oral health services. The school health center works with the school nurse to provide health education, promotion, first aid, medication administration, enrollment in health insurance programs, screening for health services, referral to offsite services, public health surveillance, and emergency response procedures. Grant funding may be available if the school does not have a nurse, but the center is not meant to replace a school nurse. (4) Ensure a written contract with health care providers for coordination of services, confidentiality, and integration into the school environment.\n(5) Provide services to all students regardless of ability to pay.\n(6) Open during normal school hours, with flexibility based on community needs and resources.\n(7) Establish protocols for referring students to outside services when the center is closed.\n(8) Arrange transportation between school and the health center if not on school property. Planning grants are available for assessing the need for a school health center and developing partnerships. Applicants must have a letter of interest from a school or district. Grantees must seek input from various stakeholders on community health needs and establish protocols for referring students to outside services when the center is closed. Assess the school and community data to estimate the percentage of students without health insurance and those eligible for Medi-Cal or other public health programs. Evaluate the interest and capacity of healthcare providers to offer services at a school health center, and determine the need for specific cultural or linguistic services. Facilities and startup grants ranging from $20,000 to $250,000 per year for three years are available to establish a school health center. An additional $100,000 may be provided in the first year for construction, purchase, or renovation. Grant funds can cover costs for facility design, equipment, supplies, and personnel. Preference is given to proposals with cost-sharing plans among schools, health providers, and community organizations for construction and renovation. Applicants must meet specific criteria for these grants. To establish a school health center, a community assessment is needed to determine the need. A contract with a healthcare provider and a mechanism for coordinating services among staff while maintaining confidentiality is required. The center must participate in health promotion activities and policies for a healthy school environment. The school health center must focus on outreach, enrollment in health insurance programs, public health prevention, surveillance, and emergency response for students. It should also be able to provide linguistic or cultural services as needed, have a plan for maximizing third-party reimbursement revenue, and continuously assess its capacity to provide services. Sustainability grants are available for school health centers to enhance programming, including oral and mental health services. Applicants must meet criteria and be eligible as Medi-Cal providers with billing procedures in place for public insurance programs. The department provides technical assistance grants to support school health center grantees. Qualified contractors with expertise in planning, facilities development, and operation are eligible. Grant funding preference is given to schools in medically underserved areas. Schools eligible for technical assistance grants include those with a high percentage of low-income, uninsured, or Medi-Cal/Covered California-insured students, large numbers of limited-English-proficient students, in areas with health professional shortages, and low-performing schools ranked in the bottom three deciles of the state's Academic Performance Index. The department will receive funds annually for an evaluation conducted by an outside evaluator through a competitive bidding process. The evaluation will track the number of grantees establishing and maintaining school health centers, detailing challenges and lessons learned. Data from Section 124174.3 may be used, and collaboration with the Public School Health Center Support Program is required. The evaluation will be posted on the department's website. This section will only be implemented if funds are appropriated in the annual Budget Act or other statute."
