The Commercial Revitalization Tax Act of 1995 introduces a new Commercial Revitalization Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The credit allows for a percentage of qualified revitalization expenditures on qualified buildings over a 10-year period. Rules similar to section 42(f) apply to buildings placed in service. Qualified revitalization buildings must be located in eligible commercial revitalization areas, have a commercial revitalization credit allocated, and allow for depreciation.

The term 'qualified rehabilitation expenditure' pertains to capital expenses for nonresidential real property or improvements in connection with constructing or substantially rehabilitating a qualified revitalization building. The aggregate amount of qualified revitalization expenditures for a building in a taxable year is limited to $10,000,000, excluding certain expenditures like straight-line depreciation. The taxpayer must use straight-line depreciation for any expenditure, excluding land acquisitions, if the alternative depreciation system does not apply.

The taxpayer must use straight-line depreciation for any expenditure, excluding land acquisitions, if the alternative depreciation system does not apply. Acquisition costs include expenses for acquiring buildings, interests in buildings, and land related to the building. Any land in connection with building costs exceeding 30 percent of qualified revitalization expenditures are eligible for commercial revitalization areas like empowerment zones or enterprise communities. For commercial revitalization areas, substantial rehabilitation or reconstruction requires qualified revitalization expenditures to exceed 25 percent of the fair market value. This applies to designated low-income census tracts or nonmetropolitan areas. Qualified revitalization expenditures for a qualified revitalization building must exceed 25 percent of the fair market value for substantial rehabilitation or reconstruction. The expenditures are taken into account when the rehabilitated building is placed in service, with progress expenditure payments following similar rules as section 47. There is a limitation on the aggregate credits allowable for buildings in a state. The commercial revitalization credit amount allocated to buildings in a state is limited and determined by a commercial revitalization credit agency. The agency follows rules similar to section 42 for allocation. The State commercial revitalization credit agency allocates a portion of the State commercial revitalization credit ceiling for each calendar year based on the population of low-income census tracts and nonmetropolitan areas within the State compared to all States. The national ceiling for the State commercial revitalization credit is $100,000,000 for 1996, $200,000,000 for 1997, and $400,000,000 for calendar years after 1997. Special rules similar to section 42(h)(3) apply, and low-income areas are defined as those where at least 50 percent of residents earn no more than 60 percent of the median household income. The commercial revitalization credit agency is defined as any agency authorized by a State to carry out this section. The term 'State' includes a possession of the United States. Responsibilities of Commercial Revitalization Credit Agencies include plans for allocation of the commercial revitalization credit dollar amount with respect to any building. The dollar amount for a building is zero unless allocated through a qualified allocation plan approved by a commercial revitalization credit agency. The agency must notify the local jurisdiction's chief executive officer and allow for comments on the project. The term `qualified allocation plan' refers to a plan that outlines selection criteria for priorities of a commercial revitalization credit agency, considering factors like project contribution to a strategic plan, increase in employment, and resident involvement. The section outlines requirements for the active involvement of residents and nonprofit groups in eligible commercial revitalization areas, along with monitoring procedures for compliance. It also specifies that the section does not apply to buildings placed in service after December 31, 2000.
