    "content": "A lead systems integrator is a contractor hired by the federal government to execute defense-related acquisition programs, particularly system-of-systems programs. They have broad responsibilities including requirements generation, technology development, source selection, construction, procurement, testing, and administration. Two types of LSIs are defined in the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act. Lead systems integrators (LSIs) are contractors hired by the federal government to execute defense-related acquisition programs, particularly system-of-systems programs. LSIs have broad responsibilities including requirements generation, technology development, source selection, construction, procurement, testing, and administration. Examples of programs being executed with LSIs include the Army's Future Combat System (FCS) and the Coast Guard's Deepwater acquisition program, both of which have experienced problems such as costs and schedule overruns. The Department of Defense (DOD) announced the cancellation of the Future Combat System (FCS) contract and divided it into separate programs due to a lack of in-house expertise. Federal agencies like DOD have turned to the Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) concept for complex acquisition programs. The downsizing of the DOD acquisition workforce and the increase in procurement activities have contributed to the insufficient expertise in executing large programs. The use of Lead Systems Integrators (LSIs) in complex acquisition programs is supported for promoting technical innovation and system optimization. Private-sector firms are often more knowledgeable in rapidly developing technologies compared to federal agencies. The Army's decision to expand the FCS LSI role from development to production was criticized for ceding source selection leverage. The Coast Guard announced it would gradually assume the LSI role for the Deepwater program, while the Department of Justice is investigating parts of the program. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced the restructuring of the FCS program, with the U.S. Army eventually assuming the LSI role. Concerns were raised about using private-sector LSIs for complex defense acquisition programs, leading Congress to mandate an FCS milestone review. GAO has audited the FCS program's cost, schedule, and performance, with concerns about actual performance. The GAO expressed concerns about the delayed demonstration of the fully integrated FCS program, which could lead to increased costs. Congressional hearings on the Deepwater program highlighted oversight issues, including design deficiencies and mismanagement. The DOD Inspector General raised questions about accountability and recommended changes to the program's acquisition strategy. Some observers worry that LSI arrangements may limit government visibility. LSI arrangements can lead to government visibility issues in program aspects like costs, optimization studies, source-selection procedures, and system performance. Lack of transparency may hinder effective oversight, increasing risks of cost overruns, schedule delays, and poor product quality. Concerns arise due to the three-year rotation cycle of senior military officers and decreased in-house technical expertise at DOD. Observers are concerned about the government's reduced ability to independently assess programs executed by LSIs, which could complicate future bid evaluations. There are worries about conflicts of interest in LSI arrangements, such as tailoring system requirements to favor their own products or subsidiaries, potentially increasing costs and limiting innovation. Some observers are concerned about potential conflicts of interest in LSI arrangements, where LSIs may certify their own work, leading to doubts about the validity of certifications. This issue has been raised in connection with the Deepwater program. Acquisition programs with LSIs can span many years, making it challenging for outside firms to compete effectively. Some observers are concerned that incumbent LSIs may have an advantage in challenging outside firms due to their knowledge and potential disruptions in switching contractors. This could hinder the government's ability to improve LSI performance through re-competition. Additionally, there are worries about LSIs designing programs to limit competition for successor programs. The LSI might design the SOS architecture to favor their products, potentially hindering competition. Options to address this include reducing the need for LSIs, setting conditions for their use, ensuring transparency and preventing conflicts of interest. The House and Senate conferees for the Fiscal Year 2010 and 2011 Coast Guard Authorization Act resolved their differences and sent the bill to the President on October 4, 2010. One provision in the bill would prohibit the use of lead system integrators within the Coast Guard for all acquisition contracts awarded after the enactment of this bill. The bill prohibits the use of lead system integrators for Coast Guard acquisition contracts awarded after its enactment. The DFARS was revised to address conflicts of interest with private-sector LSIs. The final rule allows limited use of LSIs for certain new contracts, implementing Section 802 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act. The bill clarifies the status of the Lead System Integrator function for the U.S. Army's FCS Program, specifying the length of time the contractor can serve as the LSI. The Secretary of the Army must certify to congressional defense committees when the prime contractor is no longer the lead systems integrator. Any modification to the existing FCS contract for the purpose of commencing full-rate production of major systems or subsystems is considered a new contract."
