    "content": "Two main families of reinforcement learning algorithms, Q-learning and policy gradients, have been shown to be equivalent with a softmax relaxation and entropic regularization. This equivalence is related to the convex duality of Shannon entropy and the softmax function, known as the Donsker-Varadhan formula. The result provides a short proof of the equivalence and leads to a new policy inequality relative to soft Q-learning. Policy gradients aim to maximize expected rewards by improving policies with entropic regularization to prevent degenerate results. The current text discusses the breakthrough in the field of reinforcement learning, where the equivalence between soft Q-learning and softmax entropic policy gradients was proven. The paper introduces the concept of convex duality to expedite the proof process and highlights the importance of understanding the fundamental reasons behind this equivalence. The text introduces a transportation inequality linking policy optimality gap to Kullback-Leibler divergence. It discusses notation abuse, reward expansion, and the addition of Shannon entropic regularization for numerical stability. The objective becomes a free energy functional with regularization strength \u03b2. The text also mentions the convexity of J as a functional of \u03c0 and the Gibbs variational principle for policy evaluation. The text discusses the variational principle for policy evaluation, focusing on finding the optimal value of the policy functional J for an optimal policy \u03c0*. It involves convex duality principles and the Legendre-Fenchel transformation, with a focus on the entropy functional and convex conjugates. The text also explores the relationship between derivatives and convex conjugates in the context of policy optimization. The text discusses the Gibbs variational principle in the context of entropy functional and convex conjugates. It highlights the relationship between the dual Legendre representation of the entropy functional H and the relative entropy with respect to a reference measure. This principle is significant in various scientific fields such as thermodynamics and large deviations. The Gibbs variational principle, also known as the Donsker-Varadhan variational formula, relates to maximum entropy and maximum likelihood estimation in statistics. Information geometry combines these views and suggests a dually flat Riemannian information manifold exists. The result involves a rewards function or its estimator, reaching a supremum for a measure defined by the Gibbs-Boltzmann measure. In the special case of the uniform policy, the result aligns with previous findings. The Donsker-Varadhan variational formula connects maximum entropy and maximum likelihood estimation in statistics. It involves a bounded measurable function on probability measures, with a unique maximum attained by a specific probability measure. This formula is linked to reinforcement learning through the one-step soft Bellman operator. The one-step soft Bellman operator defines V*(s) depending on the reference measure \u00b5 for off-policy actions. Soft Q-learning and policy gradients yield the same result when trained optimally. Standard Q-learning is a special case with no entropy regularization. The proof extends from the bandit setting to the general case by inserting V*(s) into the representation formulas. The proof extends to the general case by applying the Bellman optimality principle to the soft-max operator, ensuring a unique fixed point. The soft-Bellman operator is shown to be nonexpansive, as demonstrated in the literature. This extends to the multi-step case, proving the nonexpansiveness of the soft-Bellman operator for the supremum norm. The proof involves the entropy-regularised policy gradient functional and the Donsker-Varadhan formula. It shows the existence and uniqueness of the softmax Bellman operator, which can be used in Q-learning-like iterations with a strong estimator of rewards. The curr_chunk discusses the convergence of different estimators in Q-learning-like iterations and the recovery of rewards distribution using parameterised critic. It also introduces an inequality relating policy optimality gap to Kullback-Leibler divergence. The proof in the curr_chunk relates to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the current policy and the optimal policy. It involves ideas from convex analysis and Legendre transformation, focusing on a real-valued bounded random variable X. The Hoeffding inequality is used to show that X is sub-Gaussian, leading to a formula for measures P and Q. This formula is then applied to the advantage return r in the context of Q-learning iterations. The curr_chunk discusses the relationship between Kullback-Leibler trust regions and policy improvement using convex analysis and Legendre transformation. It establishes an equivalence involving integrable random variables, convex functions, and mutually absolutely continuous measures. The proof utilizes the Donsker-Varadhan formula to show the equivalence in terms of the Legendre transformation of a function applied to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The Legendre transformation of f applied to D KL (Q||P) allows for the use of various softmax temperatures \u03b2 i in algorithms to estimate f. Entropic reinforcement learning has been explored with different motivations, including exploration with intrinsic rewards and entropic regularization for convergence in actor-critic frameworks. Taking steepest KL divergence steps is also considered a practical reinforcement learning method. The steepest KL divergence steps in reinforcement learning were adopted by Schulman & Abbeel, focusing on entropic regularization following the Bellman equation. Schulman also proved the equivalence, in the limit, of policy gradient and soft Q-learning methods. Convex optimization results and neural network methods are also discussed in related works. BID10 covers analysis and partial differential equation methods. Dual formulas for entropy functional in reinforcement learning have potential ramifications. Research will focus on interpreting findings in a large deviations framework. Smart drift change techniques could reduce variance for Monte-Carlo estimators. Exploiting concentration inequalities for more bounds on state value function is a goal. A theory on the correspondence between convex approximation algorithms and reinforcement learning methods is still lacking. Contributions in this area are hoped for through further work."
