    "content": "Telehealth involves using electronic technologies for remote clinical healthcare, education, and administration. Examples include videoconferencing, store-and-forward imaging, and remote monitoring. The term \"telemedicine\" is sometimes used specifically for clinical services like diagnosis and treatment at a distance. The 114th Congress has introduced legislation related to telehealth that could impact access, cost, and quality of care under federal programs like Medicare. The federal government has initiated various programs to increase access to telehealth services across different agencies. Examples include the Department of Veterans Affairs supporting over 2.1 million telehealth visits to veterans, the Department of Defense reporting over 34,000 telehealth visits at military installations, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reporting $17.6 million in Medicare payments for telehealth visits in 2015. Trends show sustained interest in telehealth access, utilization, and innovation. Market analysts predict that private insurers will increase the number of plans offering telehealth services. Institution-to-institution contracts may lead to patients paying out-of-pocket for convenient telehealth services. Alternative payment models for reimbursement are expected to expand in 2016. Telehealth services are expected to expand in 2016, with evidence showing effectiveness for chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease. However, more robust evidence is needed for telehealth in various medical specialties. The report discusses the need for more evidence on patient telehealth experiences, cost and quality measures, and telehealth activities at federal agencies. It focuses on assessing telehealth's impact on health care access, cost, and quality. The report highlights the importance of telehealth initiatives in improving the quality of care by making it more patient-centered, reliable, accessible, and safe. Various laws, policies, and guidance provide different descriptions for telehealth and telemedicine, emphasizing the need for clarity and distinction. Telehealth technologies, including videoconferencing and mobile technologies, are used for delivering healthcare in different formats. Medicare and Medicaid programs acknowledge the use of telehealth services, with some state laws defining and restricting the terms. The definition of telehealth may vary among states, with some using \"telemedicine\" for clinical services. These distinctions impact federal policies, such as Medicare reimbursement for telehealth services. FedTel, a workgroup supported by HRSA, oversees various federal agencies involved in telehealth activities. The curr_chunk discusses how 26 federal agencies are involved in telehealth activities, focusing on three agencies directly involved in patient care and one overseeing health insurance financing. The VA, DOD, and IHS use telehealth to provide care to veterans, military beneficiaries, and underserved tribal populations. The VA, DOD, and IHS utilize telehealth to provide care to veterans, military beneficiaries, and underserved tribal populations. Telehealth activities in federal agencies are summarized, with a focus on the American Telemedicine Association's guidelines for providers to use professional judgment in deciding when to use telemedicine. Providers are advised to consider patient condition, available resources, and their expertise in using telemedicine. The American Telemedicine Association encourages providers to use professional judgment when deciding to use telemedicine, considering patient condition, available resources, and expertise. The VA operates the largest integrated health care system in the US, with various healthcare facilities across states and territories. Conditions for telemedicine use may change based on new evidence and technology advancements. In FY2015, the VA employed 298,546 medical care and research professionals and served 6.8 million unique patients. Telehealth technologies used include Clinical Video Telehealth for live-video consultations and Home Telehealth for monitoring chronic conditions. Telehealth technologies, such as Store-and-Forward, are significant for reaching rural populations and reducing travel time to health care facilities. The VA's data shows that mental illnesses, particularly PTSD, are major concerns for veterans, and telehealth supports their use of medical apps for managing symptoms. The VA provides telehealth services to veterans, including tools for symptom-tracking and self-assessment for PTSD. Studies show the impact of VA telehealth systems on veterans' health, cost of care, and patient experience. In 2015, 2.1 million telehealth consultations were delivered to over 677,000 veterans through various integrated networks. 45% of veterans receiving telehealth services live in rural areas. The VA plans to increase telehealth services to nearly 762,000 veterans in 2017. Access to telehealth is associated with reduced hospital admissions and high patient satisfaction rates. The VA and DOD provide telehealth services to veterans and military personnel, resulting in reduced hospital admissions and cost savings. DOD's health care network includes hospitals, clinics, and telehealth components, with a goal of enhancing EHR support for telehealth. The U.S. Army's Surgeon General highlights the extensive reach of Army telehealth systems, providing health services across 18 time zones and over 30 countries. In FY2013, the MHS conducted 30,000 telehealth encounters, mostly for psychological health issues like PTSD. DOD telehealth initiatives include research and development through the Telemedicine & Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC). The Telemedicine & Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) conducts research on health informatics, telemedicine, mobile health, and computational biology. The National Center for Telehealth and Technology (T2) coordinates resources for developing telehealth networks across the DOD. Telehealth has enhanced collaborative opportunities for DOD health providers in pain management through the Project Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) initiative. Project ECHO, a telementoring model, closed the knowledge gap in pain education and promoted inter-professional collaborative practice in rural and underserved communities. It serves military units and the VA, focusing on conditions like traumatic brain injury and behavioral health. However, mental health stigma in the military hinders servicemembers from seeking care for conditions like PTSD due to privacy concerns. The Indian Health Service (IHS) is a federal health system that provides care for American Indians and Alaska Natives through a network of hospitals and clinics. It employs various healthcare professionals to serve members of federally recognized tribes in rural settings. The Indian Health Service (IHS) employs a range of healthcare professionals, including engineers, sanitarians, pharmacists, and dentists, to serve American Indians and Alaska Natives. Telehealth services are utilized to provide healthcare to isolated communities with limited access to transportation. Collaborations with federal agencies and private networks support telehealth services for IHS beneficiaries, including partnerships with the VA and DOD. One example is the Alaska Federal Health Care Partnership (AFHCP). The Alaska Federal Health Care Partnership (AFHCP) coordinates telehealth services for AI/AN populations in Alaska, providing 36,229 telehealth consultations in 2013. AFHCAN improves access to care through telemedicine, offering audiology and ENT services remotely, reducing the need for in-person appointments and allowing expedited care for needy patients. In 2013, the Alaska Federal Health Care Partnership (AFHCP) conducted over 36,000 telehealth consultations, saving an estimated $8-10 million in patient travel costs. AFHCAN collaborates with HRSA to operate the National Telehealth Technology Assessment Center (TTAC). The IHS Tele-Behavioral Health Center of Excellence (TBHCE) was established in 2008 to provide behavioral health services nationwide through real-time video connections, resulting in various benefits for patients. The IHS-JVN Teleophthalmology Program has expanded to include 92 sites in 25 states, with over 16,000 exams performed annually. The program is more effective and less costly than conventional eye exams for detecting diabetic retinopathy, leading to a 50% increase in compliance with standards of care. Improvements in enterprise measures have been variable, with an increase in IHS DR exam rate from 49.1% to 58.6% over seven years. The section discusses Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement policies for telehealth and evolving health reforms focusing on population health, cost reduction, and quality enhancement. Medicare is a federal program providing healthcare benefits to seniors and individuals with disabilities at an annual cost of $632 billion. Medicare provides health insurance payments to seniors and individuals with disabilities at a cost of $632 billion annually. Medicare payments are organized through four parts: Part A (hospital insurance), Part B (physician services), Part C (managed care), and Part D (prescription drugs). Telehealth policies under Medicare Part B, Part C, and Part D, as well as grants from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) for telehealth demonstrations and projects, are discussed. Medicare Part B reimburses physicians for telehealth services. Medicare Part B reimburses physicians for medically necessary services and preventive services, including telehealth. Providers receive the same reimbursement for telehealth services as they would for face-to-face services under the Medicare Fee-For-Service Program. Telehealth coverage is subject to limitations. Medicare Part B reimburses providers for telehealth services at the same rate as face-to-face services. Eligible providers include physicians, nurse practitioners, and psychologists. Authorized services for telehealth reimbursement include office visits and individual psychotherapy. Synchronous communication is required for telehealth, except in Alaska and Hawaii where asynchronous technology is allowed in federal programs. Telehealth technology is allowed in federal demonstration programs for originating sites in rural health professional shortage areas or participating in approved telemedicine projects. Medicare Part B reported 38,000 telehealth visits in CY2009, with no reported expenditures. In CY2009, Medicare Part B reported 38,000 telehealth visits with no reported expenditures. Six years later in CY2015, telehealth visits increased to 192,692, with providers receiving nearly $18 million. Telehealth reimbursement is a small portion of overall Medicare spending due to modest provider adoption. Medicare Advantage plans under Part C receive fixed monthly payments to offer medical services, including telehealth, to beneficiaries. Medicare Part C offers telehealth services to enrollees based on CMS guidelines. MA plans have provided telehealth services through various technologies. Total Part C telehealth expenditures are unknown. In 2014, Medicare Part C expenditures totaled $85.7 billion. Medicare Part D covers outpatient prescription drugs through MAPD or PDP plans. The MTM program coordinates pharmacy care for patients with multiple medical conditions under Part D. Annual medication reviews for patients with multiple medical conditions under Part D plans must be conducted in-person or via telehealth consultations. AHRQ has funded research on using health information technology to improve care within MTM programs. Part D expenditures for prescription drugs in FY2014 totaled $77.7 billion. Medicare is focusing on telehealth through selected demonstrations and innovation awards to generate evidence on access, cost, and quality. The IDEATel demonstration from 2003 to 2005 researched telemedicine networks to enhance care. The IDEATel study, conducted from 2003 to 2005, focused on telemedicine networks to improve care for 1,364 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes in underserved areas of New York. The project included remote patient monitoring for blood glucose levels and high blood pressure, informatics, and specialized curricula for healthcare professionals. While the project did not reduce Medicare costs overall, it did show clinical benefits such as improved diabetes care and communication with healthcare providers. The Health Care Buddy (HCB) demonstration, from 2006 to 2009, also supported research on intensive care management. The Health Care Buddy (HCB) demonstration, from 2006 to 2009, focused on provider-based intensive care management services to improve quality of care and reduce costs for 1,767 Medicare beneficiaries with chronic diseases. Beneficiaries received a handheld device (Health Buddy) for daily monitoring, leading to reduced hospitalization rates and decreased monthly costs by $1,500 to $2,500. Since 2012, CMMI has funded telehealth projects under the Health Care Innovation Awards, with some activities reported through ACOs and the BPCI initiative. The total amount of telehealth funding within CMMI is unknown, and projects studying different models supporting telehealth are ongoing. Published data on access, cost, and quality are not yet available. Legislative and regulatory changes are expected to bring more telehealth-related changes to Medicare. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) established the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) for Medicare providers starting January 1, 2019. MIPS requires compliance with performance standards, composite scores, and incentive payments, including clinical practice improvement activities like telehealth and remote monitoring. MIPS implementing regulations are expected in early 2016. CMS also published a final rule in 2015 allowing ACOs to use telehealth and remote patient monitoring technologies to improve care. In 2015, CMS announced the \"Next Generation ACO Model\" to enhance care coordination for Medicare beneficiaries, expanding eligible settings for patient care. Awardees under the BPCI initiative can use telehealth services beyond specified sites, with mixed results in studies on cost savings and quality improvements. Medicaid is a federal-state program that finances medical services for 65 million people, with total payments in CY2014 reaching $494 billion. States have flexibility in designing their Medicaid programs, including deciding on telehealth services for payment, leading to significant program variation. The text summarizes states' policies for telemedicine equipment under Medicaid, highlighting the variability in coverage and reimbursement for telehealth services. Studies on the quality of telehealth activities under federal Medicare program show mixed results, with limited comparability due to varying care settings. Various federally funded health programs, such as the VA, DOD, IHS, and Medicare, have adopted telehealth technologies and services, indicating a growing use and payment for telehealth-related services. Despite the growing adoption of telehealth technologies by various healthcare programs, there are still unresolved issues regarding access, quality, and cost of care. The relationship between cost and accessibility of services is a key concern, as increased utilization of telehealth services may impact the overall costs of care. Some believe that early interventions through telehealth can help manage chronic conditions and reduce future expenses, while others argue that increased access may lead to higher costs. Increasing access to telehealth services may impact the cost effectiveness of healthcare systems. Further research is needed to assess the quality of care provided through telehealth compared to traditional methods. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to questions of quality, but additional studies are necessary to evaluate the impact of telehealth programs on key measures of quality. The curr_chunk discusses the need to assess the quality of telehealth services and the importance of uniformity in terminology across federally funded health programs. It also provides information about FedTel, a group of representatives from federal agencies involved in telemedicine. FedTel is a group of representatives from various federal agencies involved in telemedicine, including AHRQ, CDC, CMS, USDA, DOL, TATRC, AMEDD, T2, DOT, VA, BOP, FCC, FDA, HRSA, IHS, ITA, NASA, NIH, NIJ, NIST, NSF, and others. The ACA created incentives for telehealth advancement through Medicare and Medicaid pilots and programs, with provisions allowing for the incorporation of telehealth technologies in grant making processes. The ACA incentivizes the design of innovative healthcare delivery models to reduce costs and improve quality in Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP programs. This includes funding for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to test new payment and service delivery models. Additionally, the Medicare Shared Savings Program encourages coordination among providers to enhance care quality and reduce unnecessary costs for beneficiaries. The ACA authorizes demonstration projects to improve care quality and reduce costs for Medicare beneficiaries. This includes using telehealth systems for home-based care for chronically-ill patients. Physicians must have a face-to-face encounter with patients before certifying eligibility for home health services or durable medical equipment under Medicare. Telehealth systems rely on broadband for 21st Century healthcare, providing instant remote access to medical specialists and records. Broadband is essential for improving care quality, reducing costs, and facilitating immediate diagnoses and care for patients. The FCC is the primary authority in the United States for communications law, regulation, and technological innovation, supporting telehealth activities through various initiatives, including program funding and interagency coordination. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 authorized the Rural Health Care Program with funding capped at $400 million annually. The program aims to improve health care quality for patients in rural communities by providing eligible health providers with access to telecommunications and broadband services through three programs: the Healthcare Connect Fund, the Telecommunications Program, and the Rural Health Care Pilot Program. The RHC Telecommunications Program, established in 1997, ensures rural health care providers pay no more than urban counterparts for services. The Rural Health Care Pilot Program, established in 2006, funds up to 85% of costs for deploying broadband health care networks. As of 2015, it supported nearly 50 active pilot projects, but is closed to new applicants. In 2010, the FCC recommended HHS make arrangements with private insurers contracting with Medicare for tax credits providing telehealth services to Medicare beneficiaries, not yet implemented. In 2014, the FCC created the Connect2Health Task Force to support health telecommunications activities and FCC health-oriented activities. The FCC and ONC are working to increase broadband access for healthcare support through 2020. The Department of Commerce supports telehealth through grants and collaborations with federal agencies, overseen by the NTIA. The NTIA established the BTOP program with $4.7 billion from ARRA to increase broadband access and adoption. The NTIA's Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) aims to increase broadband access by providing grants to healthcare providers, schools, libraries, and other organizations. Telehealth project grants, some totaling $250 million, are awarded through BTOP for innovative programs. The United States Department of Agriculture administers telehealth grants through the Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) Program and the Community Connect Program. Impediments such as lack of award acceptance and noncompliance with grant terms have been reported by BTOP. The Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) Program funds advanced telecommunications in health care and education in rural communities. It provides direct loans and grants to various entities for acquiring telehealth equipment and services. The Community Connect Program aims to increase broadband access in underserved areas. The Community Connect Program provides financial assistance to expand broadband services in rural areas lacking minimum broadband speed. Funds can be used for constructing facilities, improving community centers, and financing bandwidth costs for critical community facilities for two years. The Department of Health and Human Services coordinates telehealth activities across various agencies. The Department of Health and Human Services coordinates telehealth activities across various agencies, including HRSA, ASPR, NIH, AHRQ, CDC, and FDA. The Office for the Advancement of Telehealth manages five telehealth grant programs to support telehealth coordination and networks for underserved populations. The Licensure Portability Grant Program (LPGP) supports clinical licensure coordination across state lines for healthcare providers in rural and underserved communities. Grants from the Evidence-Based Tele-Emergency Network Grant Program (EB-TNGP) aim to expand access to care in remote emergency departments. The Rural Child Poverty Telehealth Network Grant Program (RCP-TNGP) supports telehealth networks in developing innovative solutions for child poverty in rural areas. The Rural Child Poverty Telehealth Network Grant Program is a three-year pilot program supporting telehealth networks to address health care challenges for children in impoverished rural areas."
