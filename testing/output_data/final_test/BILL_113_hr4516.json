    "content": "The \"She Is Ready Act\" is the short title of the Act. The Act includes findings in Section 2. Congress found that the 1994 Direct Ground Combat Definition and Assignment Rule was rescinded in 2013, allowing female members to serve in combat roles by 2016. This decision was based on merit and performance, reflecting the reality of female service members already serving in combat zones. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff directive requires gender-neutral occupational standards for assessing and assigning members by September 2015. Concerns exist about transparency and research in opening closed occupations to female members, especially in the Army and Marine Corps. Thousands of previously closed positions and units in the Armed Forces have been opened for assignment to female members, but many positions and units still remain closed to them. SEC. 3. REMOVAL OF ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS TO THE SERVICE OF WOMEN IN THE ARMED FORCES. The Secretaries of the military departments are required to promptly assign female members of the Armed Forces to military occupational specialties, positions, and units without delay. The Secretary of Defense must open all positions in occupations to women in any unit of the Armed Forces. Validation and oversight of gender-neutral occupational standards are also mandated. The Secretary of Defense is required to validate gender-neutral occupational standards for the Armed Forces to ensure consistency with existing laws. The Secretaries of the military departments must collaborate with an independent research entity to establish performance outcome-based standards for military occupations, ensuring accurate prediction of duties and equitable measurement of individual capabilities. Improved leadership and responsiveness in the implementation of the Women in Service Implementation Plan. The Secretary of Defense directs transparency in the implementation plan for women in service, ensuring all jobs, positions, and units are open to female members by January 1, 2016. The Office of the Secretary of Defense must promptly respond to notices of newly opened positions and avoid delays in transmitting them to Congress. The Secretary of Defense directs transparency in the implementation plan for women in service, ensuring all jobs, positions, and units are open to female members by January 1, 2016, in accordance with the Joint Memorandum issued on January 24, 2013. SEC. 5. Effective evaluation of physical standards and oversight of armed forces implementation plans. The Secretary of the Navy must provide Congress with information on the validation of physical standards for Navy and Marine Corps members. Additionally, details on Marine Corps research involving female members volunteering for specific training courses must be submitted within 30 days. The Marine Corps is required to provide information on the metrics used for research requirements in the Expanded Entry-Level Training Research, evaluation criteria, duration of studies, data utilization for opening closed occupations, and ensuring fair evaluation mechanisms for infantry and closed occupations. Female members of the Marine Corps who graduate from the enlisted infantry course will be eligible for assignment to an infantry occupational specialty. The Secretary of the Army will allow female Army members to apply to Army Ranger School for leadership training opportunities. The Special Operations Command will provide Congress with their approach for integrating women into Special Operations Forces within 90 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 6. FEMALE PERSONAL PROTECTION GEAR. The Secretary of Defense will ensure properly designed combat equipment for female Armed Forces members. SEC. 7. REVIEW OF OUTREACH AND RECRUITMENT EFFORTS FOCUSED ON OFFICERS. The Comptroller General of the United States will review Services' Outreach and Recruitment Efforts aimed at increasing women representation in the officer corps. This includes evaluating current initiatives, identifying new recruiting efforts, and determining resources needed to increase military service academy accession by 20 percent in a four-year period. The Comptroller General will review Services' efforts to increase women representation in the officer corps, aiming for a 20 percent increase in military academy accession within four years. A report on the review results must be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the enactment of this Act."
