The Congress acknowledges that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has recognized Israel's right to exist in peace, accepted UN resolutions, committed to peaceful coexistence, and assumed responsibility over its elements. Israel has also recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people, and both parties signed the Declaration of Principles in 1993. The Declaration of Principles was signed at the White House in 1993. Subsequent agreements established a Palestinian Authority for the Gaza and Jericho areas, transferring powers to an elected Palestinian Council. The interim agreement between Israel and the PLO allows for the assumption of authority by an elected Palestinian Council in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Permanent status negotiations for these areas are set to begin by May 1996. The Congress has granted the President the authority to suspend certain restrictions on the PLO, contingent on the PLO's continued adherence to commitments made in the Declaration of Principles. The PLO has committed to renounce terrorism, amend the Palestinian Covenant, and prevent hostilities against Israel. The President has certified four times that the PLO is upholding its commitments. The Congress acknowledges the PLO's progress in fulfilling commitments but urges further denunciation of terrorism and peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflict. Key actions include amending the Palestinian National Covenant, preventing acts of terror, and excluding groups promoting violence from participation. The Congress urges individuals to cease terrorism, anti-Israel rhetoric, confiscate unlicensed weapons, cooperate in transfer proceedings for accused terrorists, and respect civil liberties and human rights.
