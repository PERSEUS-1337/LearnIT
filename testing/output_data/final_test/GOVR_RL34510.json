    "content": "President George Bush signed a bill increasing the federal minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act in 2007. The minimum wage was raised in steps to $7.25 per hour by July 24, 2009. Additionally, wages in the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa were increased to match the federal minimum wage. This increase in minimum wage often led to discussions on other FLSA-related issues like overtime pay and child labor. The report discusses various topics related to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), including child labor, industrial homework, and minimum wage issues. It also covers the historical evolution of the act, administration, interpretation of provisions, judicial decisions, and enforcement issues. The topics are suggestive and not definitive. The report discusses issues related to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), including a sub-minimum wage for youth workers. The concept of a youth sub-minimum wage was actively debated during the 1960s and 1970s. Proponents argued for lower wages for youth workers, regardless of experience. During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a debate about implementing a sub-minimum wage for youth workers, despite opposition from organized labor and civil rights groups who believed any further reduction would be unfair and counter-productive. During the 1970s, there was a debate over a sub-minimum wage for youth workers. Republicans initially proposed an 80% sub-minimum, which failed. In 1977, Democrats joined with a proposal for youth under 19 to work at 85% of the standard minimum wage. The debate over a sub-minimum wage for youth workers in the 1970s failed to gain traction, with proposals from both Republicans and Democrats not succeeding. President-elect Ronald Reagan was believed to support a youth sub-minimum wage, but various hearings on the issue did not lead to legislative success. Representative Erlenborn viewed the issue as a standoff between those advocating for a higher minimum wage for all workers and those calling for a sub-minimum rate for youth. In the 1980s, the concept of a sub-minimum wage for youth workers evolved into a youth opportunity wage and then a training wage. President George H. W. Bush proposed a new minimum wage increase with a sub-minimum wage for new workers, but Congress initially rejected it. After negotiations, a bill was passed with a youth wage set at $3.35 per hour, or 85% of the minimum wage. The youth opportunity wage program, starting at $3.35 per hour, was divided into two parts for youth under 20 years-of-age. Part one required a cumulative total of 90 days at the sub-minimum wage with no conditions. Part two included an additional 90-day period with a training wage component. The program was experimental from April 1, 1990, to April 1, 1993, but almost no one used the training wage and it was not extended. The sub-minimum wage for youth was included in a bill that went through debates and approval in the House before being passed by the Senate and signed into law by President William Clinton. The law allowed employers to pay youth under 20 years of age $4.25 per hour for the first 90 days of employment. Subsequently, the general minimum wage was raised to $5.15 an hour, but the youth wage was not adjusted. In 2007, when the general minimum wage was raised again, no mention was made of the sub-minimum wage for youth, leaving it at $4.25 per hour. The sub-minimum wage for youth, set at $4.25 an hour, is a separate issue from the general wage floor. The FLSA expanded to cover retail and service employees in the 1960s and 1970s, including 'tipped employees' who receive tips from the public. Under the tip credit provisions, all covered workers must receive at least the federal minimum wage, with employers required to pay at least $2.13 per hour directly. Employers may need to supplement tips to meet the minimum wage requirement. Employers must pay at least $2.13 per hour to tipped workers, with the level of tip credit varying over the years. Organized labor prefers a zero tip credit, where the standard minimum wage is paid directly by the employer. On the other hand, industry prefers a 100% credit, arguing that the employer deserves reimbursement for providing the context for the worker's services. The tip credit has become an issue of equity and percentages in the debate between labor and industry. In the 1961 amendments to the FLSA, the Secretary of Labor was tasked with investigating pay rates for employees in certain industries exempt from the Act. This led to reports on tipped and non-tipped employment, paving the way for the 1966 amendments which added a new tip credit provision. Tipped employees were defined as those receiving over $20 a month in tips, allowing employers to count up to 50% of the minimum wage as a tip credit. The tip credit provision in the FLSA has seen various adjustments over the years. Initially set at 50% of the minimum wage in 1966, it was later reduced to 45% and then 40% by 1980. In 1989, Congress increased it back to 45% and then to 50% in 1991. Amendments in 1996 further modified the FLSA, incorporating changes into industry-specific bills. The tip credit provision in the FLSA has undergone several adjustments over the years, with changes incorporated into industry-specific bills. The bill locked the minimum cash wage for tipped employees at $2.13 per hour, while raising the general minimum wage to $5.15 per hour. This resulted in a decrease in the employer's obligation to employees, with the cash wage obligation set to decrease further to 29.4% of the minimum wage when the federal minimum wage increases to $7.25 in July 2009. The tip credit provision in the FLSA has seen changes over the years, with the employer required to supplement the difference between $2.13 per hour and the amount earned through tips. The real value of the employer's contribution to tipped employees may decline with inflation, shifting the payment responsibility to customers. Possible modifications to the tip credit arrangement include adjusting the terms or returning to a percentage figure. In June 2007, the Supreme Court ruled on Long Island Care at Home v. Coke. In Long Island Care at Home v. Coke (U.S., No. 06-593, 6/11/07), Evelyn Coke challenged the denial of overtime pay and minimum wage for companionship services. Justice Breyer's opinion exempted third party employees providing companionship services from minimum wage and overtime pay coverage. Efforts in the early 1970s to extend coverage under the FLSA to companions faced opposition due to potential costs to employers. In the early 1970s, efforts to extend coverage under the FLSA to companions faced opposition due to potential costs to employers. Allen Nixon, president of the Southern States Industrial Council, expressed concerns about the high cost of in-home care for his mother-in-law who had suffered a total stroke. A survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census in 1971 found that there were 2.4 million private household workers, with females making up three-fourths of the workforce. Many older domestic workers had little economic alternative. The FLSA coverage for care-givers posed challenges. There were concerns about accurate reporting of earnings for social security. The debate on extending coverage to domestic workers was divided. Carl Perkins (D-KY) argued that extending coverage to domestic workers would improve working conditions and dignity. In 1974, new legislation (H.R. 4757) aimed to apply minimum wage and overtime pay to most domestic workers, supported by AFL-CIO but objected by Representative Bella Abzug (D-NY) due to exceptions for live-in workers. The final bill (P.L. 93-259) included minimum wage and overtime pay provisions, but coverage for all companionship arrangements was not clearly defined. The 1974 legislation aimed to extend minimum wage and overtime pay to domestic workers, with regulations defined by the Wage and Hour Administrator. Some employees were exempt under certain sections of the Act, but new regulations exempted domestic employees employed by a third party from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements. The 1974 legislation aimed to extend minimum wage and overtime pay to domestic workers, with regulations defined by the Wage and Hour Administrator. Domestic employees employed by a third party are exempt from these requirements under certain sections of the Act. The companionship exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act has seen little compliance and proposed rules have not moved forward. The role of family and friends in providing companionship services has evolved over time. The 1974 amendments led to changes in companionship services, resulting in workers providing in-home care with duties not previously envisioned. The Clinton Department of Labor aimed to narrow the wage/hour exemptions to cover more workers, focusing on the charity/companionship nexus under three scenarios. These scenarios required fellowship with the patient to be a significant component of the companion's duties, taking up at least 50% of the caregiver's time in some cases. Under the Clinton proposal, companionship duties must make up a significant portion of the caregiver's time, with personal interaction being a key aspect. Activities like reading, chatting, playing cards, or going for a walk would qualify as companionship services. The rule would require minimal third-party employment and could subject all work to minimum wage and overtime laws. The Bush Administration extended the comment period for the services exemption proposal inherited from the Clinton rule. DOL received over 800 responses by the July deadline, with opposition from employers in the home health care industry and some within the Administration. The change could result in higher fees for care providers, with arguments that existing regulations align with the statute and legislative history. Some supported the proposal, citing the need for stable workforce conditions in home care services. In April 2002, DOL withdrew the Clinton companionship proposal, leading to a return of the matter to the courts. The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the exemption of third party employees providing companionship services from FLSA requirements. Bills were introduced in 2007 to address employment imbalances for care-givers. Indexation of minimum wage has been a long-standing topic among economists and some states have already implemented it. In recent years, several states including Arizona, Missouri, Montana, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington have indexed their minimum wage. The concept of indexation involves anchoring the minimum wage to an economic variable like the consumer price index (CPI) or average hourly earnings in manufacturing (AHE). Proponents believe that linking the minimum wage to the CPI would help it keep pace with inflation automatically. However, there are differing opinions on whether indexation would work at the federal level. Some suggest that indexation of the federal minimum wage to an economic variable could provide stability and assurance to low-wage workers as the cost-of-living increases. However, there are differing opinions on whether having Members of Congress actively involved in setting the minimum wage is more beneficial than using a formula. During the 1930s and 1940s, Congress debated and eventually agreed on a federal minimum wage of 25 cents per hour, to be phased up to 40 cents an hour over seven years. A wage board was established to assess industries' ability to meet the minimum wage. Indexation of the minimum wage became a topic of discussion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1940s and 1950s, the issue of indexation of the minimum wage was discussed with bipartisan support but no action was taken. In the early 1970s, there were proposals to raise the minimum wage to $3.00 an hour and index it to the CPI, but no action was taken. During the Carter Administration, there were renewed proposals for a $2.50 minimum wage with indexation at 50% of hourly earnings. Various proposals were put forward, including a $3.00 minimum wage with automatic adjustments based on average hourly earnings in manufacturing. During the Reagan Administration, the minimum wage indexation was eliminated by a vote in the House. When George H. W. Bush took office, interest in raising the wage and indexing it resumed in Congress. Some Members expressed concerns about indexation, but not all were opposed to the concept. During the Reagan Administration, the minimum wage indexation was eliminated by a vote in the House. Representative Tommy Robinson (D-AR) expressed concerns about adding indexing to the minimum wage, fearing it would lead to a veto. New legislation was enacted without indexation (P.L. 101-157) after the 1989 amendments. Interest in indexation has been sustained, but it has not been linked to more general enactments in later years. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), small businesses earning $500,000 or less in gross receipts are exempt from minimum wage and overtime payment requirements. However, workers engaged in interstate commerce may still be covered by the statute. The FLSA initially applied mainly to industrial employees, leaving out agricultural, retail, and service workers, as well as those not involved in interstate commerce. Some small businesses were excluded from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) due to their size, but many anticipated the act would eventually include more employers and workers. Concerns were raised about federal regulation and whether profitable small businesses should be exempt from paying the federal minimum wage based on their size. Some argued against the minimum wage for small businesses, citing concerns about bookkeeping costs and unfamiliar processes. The defense was framed as protecting employees of small firms from potential job loss due to reduced profits. Some argued against the minimum wage for small businesses, citing concerns about job loss and economic impact. One Senator proposed excluding firms with 10 or fewer employees from wage/hour coverage, while others emphasized the importance of fair wages for all workers, regardless of company size. Pennsylvania emphasized the negative impact of industries paying wages below the standard needed to support American families. Senator William Borah supported a minimum wage for a decent living as part of national policy. Debates focused on the wording of the statute and exemptions for specific industries. In 1977, a general small business exemption was set at $362,500, with other options for specific industries. The 1989 amendments consolidated exemptions, setting a figure of $500,000 for small enterprises not to be covered under the FLSA. This aimed to eliminate confusion among employers and workers. The Committee supports a true small business exemption with a streamlined threshold test. The law was signed in mid-November 1989, and changes required some firms to now fall under an interstate commerce test. Employers need to categorize employees to determine exemption eligibility. The 1989 legislation introduced tests for the small business exemption, including a general test at $500,000 and an individual test based on employee work. Despite attempts to correct the exemption, Congress did not make any changes. Special treatment under Section 14(c) of the FLSA allows persons with disabilities to be employed at lower rates based on productivity. The origins of Section 14(c) are linked to the National Industrial Recovery Act of the early New Deal, which led to complaints of employers exploiting codes of conduct to lower labor standards for workers, particularly older workers and minorities. The FLSA later established a minimum wage floor of 75% for workers under Section 14(c). The minimum wage for sheltered workshops was based on earning capacity to avoid disrupting rehabilitation efforts by charitable groups. The social services industry dominated the program, but representation for persons with disabilities was unclear. Practical problems arose in program administration, with some disabled individuals seeking employment in the private sector at minimum wage or better. Some workers in sheltered workshops were marginally disabled and could function almost as well as standard workers with minor assistance. Others were severely disabled, leading to issues in how to pay workers responsible for different segments of a product. Advocacy groups for the disabled were fragmented. Advocacy groups for the disabled, representing individuals with various disabilities, faced debates on whether the disabled should be seen as 'clients' or 'patients' in terms of treatment. In 1986, new hearings led to the establishment of the commensurate rate compensation structure for disabled workers, where wage rates were determined based on productivity and comparable to nonhandicapped workers in the same area. This system continued to be implemented at the discretion of employers. In mid-March of 1994, Representative Austin Murphy (D-PA) convened an oversight hearing on the 1986 legislation regarding disabled workers' compensation. Testimony fell into three groups: industry representatives, nonprofit employers, and work administrators. Few complaints had emerged, and the subcommittee wanted to understand why. Industry representatives were satisfied with the current system, while James Gashel, a spokesman for the blind, criticized the ineffectiveness of safeguards. Donald Elisburg, a former Assistant Secretary of Labor, described the system for challenging workshop abuses as futile. Legislation introduced in 2000 by Representative Johnny Isakson and Senator Christopher Dodd addressed the treatment of the blind, but no new laws were passed. In 2001, Representative Isakson introduced legislation regarding the treatment of the blind and handicapped, but it did not pass. The issue has since become dormant. The minimum wage under the FLSA applies to most areas, with Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the CNMI having special wage structures. In 2007, American Samoa and the CNMI were brought under the national minimum wage. In 2007, American Samoa and the CNMI were brought under the national minimum wage, with plans to align with the FLSA standard. The Samoan Islands consist of Western Samoa and American Samoa, with a history of treaties and leases with the United States dating back to the late 19th century. In 1951, authority over American Samoa was transferred to the Department of the Interior (DOI) for economic development. In 1948, a legal case involving Bermuda raised concerns about insular wage rates, impacting Samoa. In 1956, Van Camp Sea Foods sought a special minimum wage arrangement under the FLSA, leading to a congressional amendment for insular development. The Congress amended the statute to accommodate insular development, leading to the insular minimum wage being raised by 50 cents per hour in 2007. The rate is scheduled to increase each year until it reaches the federal rate, aligning American Samoa with the same minimum wage structure as the States of the Union. The CNMI, previously controlled by Spain, Germany, and Japan, was part of the United Nations Trust Territory administered by the United States after World War II. The Northern Mariana Islands, like Guam and American Samoa, have a commonwealth status with the United States. Most of the population resides on Saipan, with other islands sharing in density. Initially a Trust Territory, the islands were not considered part of the United States, leading to a lack of U.S. standards for the local population. In 1947, the Northern Marianas lacked trade unions and wage standards. By 1976, there was no minimum wage law in place. The Covenant divided labor standards between CNMI and the US, with the US regulating overtime pay and CNMI handling minimum wage and alien labor immigration. Goods produced in CNMI were to be labeled as Made in America. US-DOL was slow in fulfilling its responsibilities. The US-DOL was slow to address labor issues in the Northern Marianas, where the garment industry became a major employer with imported workers. Congressional hearings focused on alleged sweatshop conditions. In 2007, the CNMI minimum wage was raised by 50 cents, with annual increases planned until reaching a set rate. The CNMI minimum wage will be raised by 50 cents each year until it matches the general FLSA rate. Both American Samoa and CNMI face challenges in finding employment for their residents due to industries leaving the islands. Representative Eni F. H. Faleomavaega and Governor Benigno Fitial are working towards economic prosperity for their respective territories. Representative Eni F. H. Faleomavaega and Governor Benigno Fitial of American Samoa and the CNMI are collaborating to address the current situation regarding minimum wage regulations. The history of minimum wage statutes dates back to the early 20th century, with various states experimenting with wage regulation. The Supreme Court's decision in 1937 in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish allowed for federal regulation of labor standards, leading to the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938. Federal legislation has since expanded intermittently in the realm of minimum wage and related issues. The federal Act has been expanded since 1938, with minimum wage legislation primarily handled by the federal government. In the 1980s, there was a temporary increase in the minimum wage under the Bush presidency, but it declined in value until 1996. A two-step increase in 1996 and 1997 brought the wage floor to $5.15. In 2007, the federal minimum wage was raised to $7.25 an hour by mid-2009, but the real value had declined due to inflation. States began taking action with 34 states having wage rates higher than the federal minimum, some indexing the rate for regular increases. The shift from federal action to state control regarding wage laws may have implications for public policy, industry, labor, and investors. Each state may have its own wage standards and other aspects of wage/hour laws, leading to potential competition between high-wage and low-wage states. This could impact investment decisions, especially in regions with cross-border traffic or 'right-to-work' laws. Each state may have different conditions, such as allowing or disallowing tip credits or sub-minimum rates for youth workers. Each state can set its own employment conditions as long as they align with the federal standard under the FLSA. States with higher rates may compete for jobs and development. A proposed rule by Wage/Hour Administrator Tammy McCutchen aimed to update minimum wage and overtime coverage for certain workers, sparking controversy and congressional hearings. The Department of Labor issued a final rule in April 2004, supported by organized labor, affecting EAP workers' classification. The rule required workers to be paid at least $23,660 per year and meet specific job criteria to be exempt from the FLSA. The Department of Labor's final rule in 2004 set criteria for EAP workers to be exempt from FLSA, requiring a salary of at least $23,660 per year. If paid over $100,000 annually, there is a presumption of meeting qualifying criteria. EAP employees do not need overtime pay if they meet salary and duties tests. The duties test for qualification under the Department of Labor's final rule in 2004 involves analyzing the worker's independent discretion, judgment, work assignments, and hiring/firing power to determine exempt status. Various professions like emergency medical technicians, funeral directors, journalists, paralegals, and chefs require a precise analysis of job duties to differentiate between exempt and non-exempt status. The Department of Labor's final rule in 2004 involves analyzing workers' discretion, judgment, work assignments, and hiring/firing power to determine exempt status. Questions about primary duties and their importance to the employer need to be addressed for each type of work, often in the context of the work environment. The duties test can be complex and involve various categories of workers, leading to potential litigation. The Department of Labor's final rule in 2004 aims to benefit low-wage workers by restoring overtime protections. Labor Secretary Elaine Chao emphasized the importance of clear, concise, and updated rules to protect vulnerable workers with little bargaining power. Labor Secretary Elaine Chao emphasized the importance of clear, concise, and updated rules to protect workers with little bargaining power. The final rule in 2004 was praised by Chao for its significant gains to workers, but there were concerns about how it might affect higher-earning workers who could lose overtime pay protections. The dispute continued into the 109th Congress. Labor Secretary Elaine Chao praised the final rule in 2004 for its gains to workers, but concerns remained about potential impacts on higher-earning workers. Despite predictions of negative effects, reports indicated that people were actually gaining overtime protection. There were few issues in contention, and the real test will be the long-term impact on different types of workers. The white-collar exemption regulations have led to new wage and hour litigation opportunities. The emphasis on the duties test has increased, with courts showing inconsistency in their application. The impact of the regulations on workers' pay and duties is being questioned, especially for non-EAP workers. The new Section 13(a)(1) regulation may impact workers' status as executive, administrative, or professional, potentially reducing litigation. The exact number of affected individuals is uncertain due to conflicting interpretations."
