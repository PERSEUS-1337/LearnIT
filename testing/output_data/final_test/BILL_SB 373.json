    "title": "SB 373",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to increase full-time faculty in California Community Colleges to enhance student services and meet mission goals. The Community College Excellence in Education Act requires all districts to report total full-time equivalent faculty by March 31, 2016. Effective July 1, 2016, each district's maximum allowable number of full-time equivalent faculty positions for teaching overload assignments is determined based on the district's full-time faculty percentage until it reaches 75 percent. Upon reaching this threshold, the district must take specific actions. The board of governors will determine if a district failed to comply with faculty percentage requirements and may reduce the district's apportionment accordingly. The district's designated amount will be deposited in the county treasury but cannot be spent until approved by the board of governors. The governing board can apply for exemption from the requirements if it causes a serious hardship. Upon applying for an exemption, the district's governing board must provide relevant parties with a copy of the application. Within 30 days, these parties can submit a written statement opposing the application. The board of governors will then decide whether to grant an exemption for amounts less than $1,000, which can be immediately spent by the governing board. The board of governors can grant an exemption of $1,000 or more if serious hardship is found. If no exemption is requested or denied, the designated amount must be returned to the State School Fund. The board enforces these requirements and may require district governing boards to submit reports and information. A district cannot assign a contract faculty member hired after July 1, 2016, to teach overload assignments until they achieve tenured status as a full-time regular faculty member. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act incurs state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be made according to the Government Code."
