    "content": "When analyzing U.S. individual income tax rates, it's crucial to understand the differences between statutory rates (STRs), marginal effective rates (MERs), and average effective rates (AERs). STRs are prescribed by law and vary based on taxable income, with lower rates for lower incomes due to the progressive nature of the tax system. Effective rates, whether marginal or average, show how STRs are influenced by taxes. Effective rates, whether marginal or average, measure how tax provisions affect someone's taxable income or tax liability. MER shows the percentage of additional income taxed, while AER indicates the total income taxed. Average tax rate is generally lower than marginal tax rate due to special provisions in the tax code and individual financial circumstances. Factors like earned income tax credit, alternative minimum tax, and personal exemptions can create differences between effective and statutory rates. Personal circumstances such as income sources, deductions, number of children eligible for tax credits, and filing status can also impact MERs. Most economists believe that taxpayers change their economic behavior in response to Marginal Effective Rates (MERs), influencing decisions on work, spending, and saving. MERs can impact decisions like taking on overtime, bargaining for wages, or entering the labor force. The current income tax system is a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which reduced individual tax rates. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86; P.L. 99-514) reduced individual tax rates to two statutory rates: 15% and 28%, with a 5% surcharge on certain upper-income households. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90; P.L. 101-508) replaced the surcharge with a 31% rate and imposed limits on deductions and exemptions for upper-income households. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93; P.L. 103-66) added two new statutory rates at the upper income scale. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced individual tax rates to two statutory rates: 15% and 28%, with a 5% surcharge on certain upper-income households. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 replaced the surcharge with a 31% rate and imposed limits on deductions and exemptions for upper-income households. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 added two new statutory rates at the upper end of the income scale: 36% and 39.6%. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 added a new 10% statutory rate and reduced the top four statutory rates to 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35%. Subsequent acts further modified tax brackets and limitations for higher-income taxpayers. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced individual tax rates to two statutory rates: 15% and 28%, with a 5% surcharge on certain upper-income households. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 replaced the surcharge with a 31% rate and imposed limits on deductions and exemptions for upper-income households. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 added two new statutory rates at the upper end of the income scale: 36% and 39.6%. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 added a new 10% statutory rate and reduced the top four statutory rates to 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35%. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 collectively accelerated and extended the tax rate reductions enacted under EGTRRA through 2010. Congress extended the Bush-era individual income tax cuts through 2012 under the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The 112th Congress permanently extended each of the Bush-era tax rates, except for the top rate which increased from 35% to 39.6%. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made another significant change by permanently extending the Bush-era tax rates. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 temporarily reduced five of the seven individual income tax rates under prior law. For tax years after 1987, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 simplified individual income tax rates to 15% and 28%, with a 5% surcharge on certain upper-income households. The rates were adjusted in subsequent acts, with the top rate reaching 39.6% in 1993. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 temporarily reduced five of the seven individual income tax rates. The 5% surcharge created a third statutory tax rate of 33% in 1988, known as an income tax rate \"bubble.\" It aimed to maintain income tax burden distribution and meet revenue targets by eliminating tax benefits for upper-income households. The surcharge phased in and out based on income levels, affecting the 15% tax bracket and personal exemptions. The 5% surcharge phased out the tax benefits of the 15% tax bracket and personal exemptions based on income levels. The phaseout range varied depending on the number of personal exemptions claimed on the tax return. The 15% tax bracket benefits were illustrated through an example for joint returns in 1988. The difference in taxing income at 28% instead of 15% was $3,867.50. OBRA90 introduced a three-tiered marginal income tax rate structure, eliminating the tax rate bubble from TRA86 and implementing new limitations on deductions and phasing out tax benefits for higher-income households. OBRA90 phased out tax benefits for higher-income households by limiting itemized deductions based on adjusted gross income. Capital gains income was taxed at a maximum of 28% starting in 1991, compared to TRA86 which taxed it as ordinary income at rates peaking at 33%. This provision effectively raised the marginal income tax rate of affected taxpayers by approximately one percentage point. The limitation on itemized deductions based on adjusted gross income was scheduled to expire after tax year 1995 under OBRA90 but was later extended. Deductions for medical expenses, casualty and theft losses, and investment interest were not subject to this limitation. The $100,000 threshold for the limitation was indexed for inflation for tax years after 1991. OBRA90 also phased out the tax benefits of the personal exemption for higher-income households by reducing each personal exemption by 2% for each $2,500 of AGI exceeding certain threshold amounts. Starting in 1992, the personal exemption phaseout provision was indexed for inflation and was set to expire at the end of 1995. An example showed how affected taxpayers would lose 28% of their total personal exemptions if their AGI exceeded the threshold. The excess AGI divided by $2,500 would determine the disallowance amount. OBRA93 brought changes to individual tax benefits. OBRA93 introduced new marginal tax rates of 36% and 39.6% for high-income earners, with a 10% surtax for incomes over $250,000. The top tax rates were retroactively effective from January 1, 1993, but penalties for underpayment were waived. Taxpayers could pay additional taxes in installments over two years. The new tax brackets were not indexed for inflation in 1993 and 1994. EGTRRA made significant changes to the marginal tax rate structure, including creating a new 10% bracket in 2001. The act's provisions were set to phase in over time, but subsequent legislation altered the original schedule. All EGTRRA provisions, as amended, were set to expire at the end of 2010. The 10% tax rate bracket was established by EGTRRA in 2001 and was later expanded and accelerated by subsequent legislation. In 2008, the bracket was set at $7,000 for single filers and $14,000 for joint filers, with inflation adjustments starting in 2009. Additionally, the top four marginal income tax rates were reduced under EGTRRA, from 28%, 31%, 36%, and 39.6% to 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35%. EGTRRA also eliminated the limitation on itemized deductions and personal exemptions for high-income taxpayers. The 2001 act repealed the limitation on itemized deductions and personal exemptions for high-income taxpayers, phased in between 2006 and 2009. The limitation was completely repealed for 2010 but was scheduled to reappear in 2011. Measures to reduce the marriage penalty affected the rate bracket structure, increasing the income range of the 15% tax bracket for married couples filing joint returns. The upper dollar limit of the 15% tax bracket for joint returns was set to increase from 2005 to 2008 under EGTRRA. The 2001 act increased the standard deduction for joint returns and accelerated changes to the individual income tax rate structure, including tax rate reductions, expansion of tax brackets, and lower rates for long-term capital gains and dividends. The 2001 act increased the standard deduction for joint returns and accelerated changes to the individual income tax rate structure, including tax rate reductions, expansion of tax brackets, and lower rates for long-term capital gains and dividends. The subsequent WFTRA extended various tax provisions, including the 15% top rate and 0% rate for low-income taxpayers, marriage penalty relief, and the expansion of the 10% income tax bracket through 2007. The EGTRRA sunset provision led to reductions in tax rates for long-term capital gains and dividends under JGTRRA, which were extended through TIPRA until the end of 2010. A last-minute agreement in 2010 extended all Bush-era individual tax cuts through 2012 via TRUC. ATRA legislation in 2013 made the Bush-era rates permanent and restored the top marginal tax rate to 39.6%, also extending the repeal of the personal exemption phaseout for taxpayers with AGIs of $250,000 or less for single filers and $300,000 or less. The phaseout of tax benefits applied to taxpayers with AGIs of $250,000 or less for single filers and $300,000 or less for married couples filing jointly. Individual income tax rates remained unchanged after ATRA until the enactment of P.L. 115-97 in December 2017, which introduced new tax brackets ranging from 10% to 37%. The rates are set to revert to 2017 levels starting in 2026. Additionally, passthrough businesses saw changes in how their income was taxed. The 2017 tax revision made changes to individual income tax rates and deductions for the 2018-2025 tax years. It introduced a new deduction under Section 199A for passthrough businesses, allowing for a 20% deduction on qualified income. Key changes included the termination of the personal exemption, an increase in the standard deduction, elimination of the deduction for miscellaneous expenses, and suspension of the overall limit on itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers. During periods of high inflation, a progressive income tax based on nominal dollars can result in automatic tax increases, leading to unintended changes in the tax burden by income class. Without indexation, taxpayers face growing tax liabilities as nominal incomes rise faster than real incomes. The effects of inflation on tax liabilities can be significant, even in low inflation periods. Without indexation, taxpayers face growing tax liabilities as nominal incomes rise faster than real incomes. A hypothetical example shows the impact over time for individual taxpayers' tax burdens. For instance, a household with an AGI of $35,000 in 1988 would have had a taxable income of $22,200 in 2017 without indexation. Without indexation, taxpayers face growing tax liabilities as nominal incomes rise faster than real incomes. For example, a household with an AGI of $35,000 in 1988 would have had a taxable income of $22,200 in 2017, resulting in a tax liability of $3,330 and an average tax rate of 9.5%. If the 1988 tax structure had remained in place without inflation adjustments, the household's AGI would have been $71,766 in 2017, leading to a taxable income of $58,966, a tax liability of $12,643, and an average tax rate of 17.6%. The family's income tax burden increased by 85% from 1988 to 2017 due to bracket creep caused by inflation. With an indexed individual income tax, their tax burden would have remained constant. Indexed adjustments would have increased the standard deduction to $10,252 and personal exemptions to $3,998 in 2017. This would have resulted in a taxable income of $45,522 and adjusted tax brackets. The taxable income and adjusted brackets in 1988 resulted in an income tax liability of $6,828 with an average tax rate of 9.5%. Congress added indexation to the individual income tax in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 to prevent automatic tax increases due to inflation. This was done to avoid unfair tax burdens on taxpayers and maintain incentives to work and invest. Indexing was added to the individual income tax in 1981 to prevent automatic tax increases due to inflation, maintaining incentives to work and invest. The list of indexed elements has expanded over the years, including tax provisions like standard deductions and the EITC. Year-to-year changes in indexed amounts are usually small, benefiting taxpayers over time. Under current law, certain key elements of the tax system, such as the child tax credit and the threshold amounts for the 3.8% tax on net investment income, are not adjusted for inflation. This results in the erosion of the value of the credit over time and reduces the number of eligible taxpayers. While most elements are indexed for inflation, there are exceptions like the EITC and transportation benefits. The calculation methodology for inflation adjustments in tax elements varies slightly, with exceptions like the EITC and transportation benefits. Adjustments were based on the CPI-U percentage exceeding a base period, rounded down to the nearest multiple of $50. Rounding down affected yearly accuracy but not cumulatively. The inflation adjustment factor for the personal exemption in 2017 was calculated based on the CPI-U values from 1988 and 2016, resulting in a personal exemption of $4,050. Starting from 2019, the Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U) will be used for adjustments instead of the CPI-U. The Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U) replaces the CPI-U for measuring price changes faced by the average urban consumer. The indices track prices of goods and services monthly based on a fixed basket obtained from spending patterns of American families. The CPI-U market basket is revised every two years, and analysts argue it overstates cost of living due to not fully accounting for consumer buying pattern changes. The Chained CPI-U is more accurate in reflecting changes in consumer spending patterns in response to price increases or decreases. It calculates inflation by comparing consumer purchases before and after price changes, adjusting for substitutions like buying more chicken when beef prices rise. The Chained CPI-U adjusts for consumer substitutions in response to price changes, creating an index that reflects shifts in buying patterns. It leads to lower estimates of the cost of living increase over time compared to the CPI-U. The annual average increase for the chained CPI-U from 2000 to 2012 was 29.4%, lower than the CPI-U's 33.3%. However, using the chained CPI-U for tax adjustments has drawbacks due to its frequent revisions. Switching to the chained CPI-U for adjusting key tax elements for inflation may lead to more bracket creep and push more taxpayers into higher tax brackets, resulting in an increase in federal tax revenue over time. The chained CPI-U increases more slowly than the CPI-U, causing tax bracket thresholds to rise by smaller amounts annually. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this change will have significant financial implications. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates a $134 billion revenue gain from switching to the chained CPI-U for inflation adjustments. Inflation rates fluctuated between -0.4% and 3.2% since the Great Recession, leading to no cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits in 2010. If sustained deflation occurs, income tax elements could decline in constant dollars but cannot fall below their base-year values. The limitation on income tax elements falling below their base-year values is unlikely to come into play soon due to current values being much higher than base values.
