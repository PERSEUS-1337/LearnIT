    "content": "The Kurds, a significant ethnic group in the Middle East, have never achieved statehood despite their population of 20-25 million. They were granted minority status in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria after World War I. In Iraq, Kurds make up 15-20% of the population and have more national rights compared to other host countries. In Iraq, Kurdish dissidence led by the Barzani clan faced suppression by Saddam Hussein's regime. Mulla Mustafa Barzani founded the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and rejected Baghdad's autonomy plan in 1974. His revolt collapsed in 1975 when Iran stopped supporting it under the \"Algiers Accord\" with Iraq. Barzani passed away in 1979, and KDP leadership was taken over by his son, Masoud. The KDP and PUK are dominant among Iraqi Kurds, with differences in leadership, revenue control, and relations with Baghdad. The KDP is strong in northern Kurdish areas, while the PUK is strong in the south. In the 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war, Iraqi forces used lethal gas attacks against Kurdish targets, including Halabja in 1988. During the Iran-Iraq war, Iraq conducted chemical attacks on Kurds, leading to a campaign that forced many Kurds to leave their homes. The U.S.-led containment of Iraq in the 1990s allowed for Kurdish autonomy, with a \"no-fly zone\" established to protect them from Iraqi forces. Kurdish leaders later joined the Iraqi National Congress, operating from Iraqi Kurdish territory. In 1992, Iraqi Kurds set up an administration in their enclave and held elections for a provisional parliament. The KDP and PUK each gained 50 seats, with Christian groups also represented. The Kurdish parliament called for a Federated State of Kurdistan within Iraq, causing concerns among Arab leaders and neighboring states with large Kurdish populations. The uneasy power-sharing between KDP and PUK collapsed into armed clashes in early 1994. In early 1994, the KDP-PUK power-sharing collapsed into armed clashes over territorial control. The nadir in PUK-KDP relations occurred in mid-1996 when the KDP enlisted Saddam's regime to seize Irbil. The Kurdish regional authority split into KDP and PUK entities, but negotiations led to a \"Washington Declaration\" in September 1998. In February 2003, opposition groups in Kurdish-controlled territory prepared for post-Saddam Iraq. The Kurds have been a pro-U.S. group in Iraq both before and after the ousting of Saddam Hussein's regime. They have cooperated with U.S. officials and sought support for their positions in disputes with other groups in Iraq. Discussions on various U.S.-Kurdish issues, including the U.S. drawdown, took place during KRG President Masoud Barzani's visit to Washington in January 2010. During his visit to Washington in January 2010, KRG President Masoud Barzani met with U.S. officials regularly. The Kurds supported the U.S. decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein, but there was minimal combat in northern Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Turkey did not allow U.S. invasion forces to enter through its territory, so U.S. forces moved up from Kuwait. The Kurds entered national politics on equal footing with Iraq's Arabs after Saddam's regime fell. After Saddam Hussein's regime fell, the Kurds in Iraq entered national politics on equal footing with the Arabs for the first time. They participated in the U.S.-led occupation administration and held seats on the Iraq Governing Council. The Transitional Administrative Law preserved the Kurds' autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government and allowed them to maintain their militia, the peshmerga. The Kurds in Iraq gained significant political power after Saddam Hussein's regime fell. The Transitional Administrative Law did not give them control of Kirkuk but allowed them to reclaim their homes. The Kurds successfully included a provision in the TAL giving them veto power over the constitution. They supported the constitution in the 2005 referendum as it met their demands for autonomy and federalism, recognizing the Kurdistan Regional Government. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq has the power to amend national laws, maintain security forces, and establish embassies. Arabic and Kurdish are official languages. The KRG participated in Iraqi elections in 2005, with Masoud Barzani selected as President of Kurdistan. During 2005-2009, Masoud Barzani's nephew Nechirvan served as the Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Nechirvan's term was extended due to health issues and party turmoil, eventually being replaced by Barham Salih in 2009. The peshmerga primarily protect Kurdish areas, with some also serving in Arab cities as part of the Iraqi Security Forces. In 2007, security control over the KRG provinces was transferred to Kurdish ISF units. In 2009, Masoud Barzani was reelected as KRG President with 70% of the vote. The KNA elections were competitive, with voters choosing from 24 lists in a closed-list system. In the 2009 KNA elections, 24 lists competed, including the dominant Kurdistani list and the opposition Change List led by Nechirvan Mustafa. The Kurdistani list won 59 seats, maintaining majority control of the KNA. In the 2009 KNA elections, the Kurdistani list maintained majority control with 59 seats. In the recent election, the bloc's seats dropped to 82, while Gorran unexpectedly won 25% of the vote and 25 seats. The Reform and Service List secured 13 seats, and various parties won the remaining seats. The KRG implemented a quota system with reserved seats for Assyrian Christians, Turkmen, and Armenians. No reserved seats were allocated for Yazidis or Shabaks. The July 25 vote excluded Kirkuk and three KRG provinces due to unresolved issues with the central government. In the 2009 KNA elections, the Kurdistani list maintained majority control with 59 seats. Gorran unexpectedly won 25% of the vote and 25 seats, weakening the PUK. Despite this, Barham Salih was named KRG Prime Minister in August 2009. The Kurds' political strength in Iraq, bolstered by their close ties with the United States, has led to tensions with Iraqi minorities, neighbors, and Arab leaders who view their demands as excessive. The Kurds feel that the central government is not fulfilling its promise of a diverse democracy post-Saddam. The US administrations have supported the Kurds' cooperation. The Obama Administration has decided to establish a U.S. consulate in Irbil as a sign of appreciation for the Kurds' support and to prevent violence in the north. Two embassy branch offices will also be set up in Kirkuk and Mosul. Another U.S. consulate will be established in Basra, while branch offices in Anbar and Najaf are delayed due to funding issues. The Committee on Appropriations supported placing facilities along Arab-Kurdish fault lines, with the Administration following the recommendation. The Kurds, especially the PUK, have been active in post-Saddam politics, forming alliances and winning seats in national elections. Talabani became President of Iraq, and the Kurds gained control of Nineveh and Diyala provinces. In the December 2005 elections, the Kurdistan Alliance won 53 seats. In the December 2005 elections, the Kurdistan Alliance won 53 seats, but their strength in the government was not as strong due to Sunni Arab participation. Budgetary issues have been contentious, with Arab leaders attempting to cut the Kurds' revenue share in the 2008 budget deliberations. The Kurds agreed to a revenue share determined by a postponed census. The Kurds want peshmerga salaries paid from national revenues, but a census in October 2010 may reduce their revenue share. It's unclear if the Iraqi constitution allows KRG to buy weapons, but the central government had no objection to a reported purchase from Bulgaria in 2008. Kurdish parties were aligned with mainstream Shiite Islamist parties from 2003-2008. Minister Nuri al-Maliki received support from the Kurds in facing political challenges, including from within his own Shiite community. However, by the end of 2008, the Kurds began to break with Maliki due to his failure to meet their core demands, leading to a rift between them. Relations between the Kurds and Prime Minister Maliki soured in late 2008 due to disagreements over unconstitutional policies and political developments in Nineveh Province. The outcome of the 2010 parliamentary elections further shaped KRG-government relations, with the Kurdish opposition running separately from the main parties. The main Kurdish factions are no longer \"kingmakers\" in central government politics after the 2010 elections. The two main factions lost seats, while other Kurdish factions like Gorran and the Kurdistan Islamic Union gained seats. Despite this, there is a deadlock in forming the next government due to disagreements among Iraq's Arabs. Disagreements among Iraq's Arabs over the selection of the next Prime Minister persist. The Kurds prefer Adel Abdul Mahdi, but lack enough support to replace Maliki. With Maliki's slate having 89 seats, a Sunni-backed slate has 91, and a rival Shiite slate has 70, the Kurdish bloc's 43 seats are not decisive. Allawi is considered acceptable by the Kurds, but the outcome remains uncertain. The top Kurdish leaders are cautious about pushing for outright independence due to opposition from neighboring countries like Turkey, Iran, Syria, and Arab Iraq. However, there is concern that younger Kurds may eventually seek independence. Tension with the Maliki government arises from the Kurdish insistence on integrating Kirkuk/Tamim and cities in Diyala and Nineveh provinces into the Kurdistan Regional Government. The integration of Kirkuk into the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is a source of tension with the Maliki government and minorities in the north. Kirkuk's significance lies in its oil reserves, which Turkey fears could fuel Kurdish independence aspirations. The Iraqi constitution mandates a referendum on Kirkuk's status, delayed in 2008 at the Kurds' reluctant acceptance. The U.N. Assistance Mission-Iraq (UNAMI) is analyzing and making recommendations on integrating Kurdish-inhabited cities in Diyala and Nineveh provinces into the KRG. The U.S. strategy aims to convince Kurds that this gradual process could lead to gaining control of Kirkuk, reducing tensions. UNAMI is studying cities like Khanaqin, Sinjar, Makhmour, and others. A June 2008 UNAMI report leaned towards Kurds on some territories but suggested keeping others under central government control. The Kurds have reportedly been using their intelligence service to prepare for a referendum on these territories. The Kurds have been pressuring Arabs and Turkomans to leave Kirkuk to strengthen their position. The referendum on Kirkuk's status is contingent on a census, but the constitutional deadline has passed. The Obama Administration supports Article 140 of the Iraqi constitution addressing the Kirkuk dispute. UNAMI is exploring ways to resolve the issue of disputed territories. UNAMI recommended joint Baghdad-KRG administration of Kirkuk in a report circulated on April 22, 2009. The proposal did not bring resolution to the disputed territories issue, widening differences between Kurds and the central government. Kurdish influence in Nineveh and Diyala provinces decreased after Sunni Arabs won control in the January 31, 2009, elections. Al Hadba'a, a Sunni Arab slate, won 19 out of 37 seats in Nineveh province, reducing Kurdish influence. Atheel al-Nujaifi is now governor, leading to clashes with Kurds who do not recognize his authority in Kurdish areas. In Diyala Province, the Kurdistan Alliance came in third with six seats, while the Sunni Arab Accord Front took first with nine seats. In Diyala Province, the Kurds are in a subordinate position in the provincial administration, weakening their political control over Kurdish-inhabited towns like Khanaqin. Tensions over Kirkuk have caused delays in passing election laws for provincial and national elections, with Kurdish leaders holding up the laws in response to disputes with Iraqi Arabs and the central government. President Talabani vetoed an election law in 2008 due to concerns about power-sharing in Kirkuk. In the midst of tensions over Kirkuk, Kurdish leaders threatened to boycott national elections unless the law accommodated their views on voter eligibility. A compromise was reached using the 2009 food rationing list, leading to the passage of the election law in November 2009 and elections held in March 2010. Despite Kurd-Arab tensions, clashes between the peshmerga and Iraqi forces occurred. In August 2009, Gen. Raymond Odierno unveiled a plan to build confidence between Kurdish peshmerga and Iraqi Security Forces with the help of the U.S. military and diplomats. Additional U.S. military personnel were deployed to the north to partner in patrols, setting up 15 joint checkpoints along the Kurd-Arab frontier in Nineveh and Diyala provinces. The plan included sharing intelligence, coordinating command and control, and providing training to peshmerga at a military base in Kirkuk. The United States provided training to Iraqi forces at a military base in Kirkuk for joint patrols. Concerns arose about replacing this effort as U.S. troops in Iraq decreased. Gen. Odierno suggested a U.N. force could take over the neutral partner role from the U.S. as tensions in northern Iraq grew among Iraqi minorities. Iraqi minorities in northern Iraq fear Kurds pushing them out to gain power. Provision for reserved council seats for minorities was removed from election law, leading to protests and attacks on Christians in Mosul. Some minorities have returned but remain fearful. Some minorities upset over limited reserved seats in election law. Christians call for protection force in Nineveh Plains. Kurds want control over oil revenues and new exploration. Suspicions that Kurds aim for independence through oil reserves. Kurds dependent on central government for energy exploitation. The Kurds rely on the central government to access their energy resources through the national oil pipeline grid. Disagreements over a national hydrocarbon framework law have led to tensions between Baghdad and the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG). Efforts to reach a compromise on oil laws and revenue-sharing have been unsuccessful, with the U.S. Embassy expressing doubts about a comprehensive agreement. The KRG has signed development deals with foreign firms under its own oil law, despite disagreements with Iraq's Oil Minister. Deals include Genel, Hunt Oil, Dana Gas, BP, DNO Asa, OMV, SK, Talisman, and Addax. The Hunt Oil deal raised controversy due to ties to Bush Administration officials. Baghdad agreed to link northern oil fields in KRG territory to Iraq's main oil export pipeline in December 2008. In May 2009, the KRG and Baghdad agreed to allow oil exports from the Taq Taq field, with the KRG receiving 17% of the revenue. However, exports were suspended in October 2009 due to payment disputes with energy firms in the region. The KRG and Baghdad reached a tentative deal in May 2010 regarding oil revenue disputes, but it was not implemented. Most oil exports from the KRG area are still suspended. The signing of energy deals with foreign firms by the KRG raises concerns about resource usage. Many Kurds resent the control exerted by the main Kurdish factions over the regional economy. The Barzani and Talabani clans, who control the KDP and PUK, are accused of using their political power for financial gain. Some Kurds feel limited in their ability to benefit from entrepreneurship due to the dominance of the Barzanis and Talabanis in business and economics. Gorran's strong showing in the 2009 KRG elections was fueled by these allegations. Turkey closely monitors the presence of the PKK in KRG territory, particularly accusing the KDP. The PKK, also known as Kongra Gel, is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the US. Iraqi Kurds have supported the Turkish Kurdish struggle against Turkey, despite past conflicts with the PKK. In 2007, Turkey prepared for a major incursion into northern Iraq following warnings from Barzani about potential attacks. US diplomacy helped limit Turkey's intervention to air strikes and brief incursions. Since 2008, there have been few reported Turkish military incursions or clashes with the PKK in northern Iraq. Progress in reducing tensions was seen in talks between Turkey's envoy and Masoud Barzani in Baghdad in 2008. Progress in reducing Iraqi Kurd-Turkish tensions was made during a visit to Baghdad by Turkey's President Abdullah Gul on March 23, 2009. He met with Talabani and KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani, marking the first Turkish leader-KRG official meeting. Turkey is the largest investor in the KRG region, with concerns about Kurdish militant group PJAK in KRG territory shared by Turkey and Iran. PJAK was named a terrorism-supporting entity by the Treasury Department in February 2009. Iran blamed PJAK for a bomb attack in Mahabad in September 2010. Secretary of State Clinton condemned the bombing, while PJAK denied involvement. Iran claimed to have crossed the border into Iraq to retaliate against PJAK fighters, but Kurdish observers in Iraq were not aware of any Iranian incursion."
