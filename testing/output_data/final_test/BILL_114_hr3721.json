    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Affordable College Textbook Act\". The high cost of college textbooks is a barrier for many students in achieving higher education. The average student budget for college books and supplies at 4-year public institutions was $1,225 during the 2014-2015 academic year. New textbook prices increased 82 percent between 2002 and 2012, and more efforts are needed to address rising costs. The Internet has enabled the creation and sharing of digital content, including open educational resources. Using open educational resources in large college courses can reduce textbook costs by 80 to 100 percent. Federal investment in expanding open educational resources could significantly lower college textbook costs and reduce financial barriers to higher education. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
