    "content": "The American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009 (ACELA, S. 1462) aims to expand clean energy technologies, improve energy efficiency and security, encourage innovation and workforce development, and enhance monitoring functions over energy markets. The bill compares provisions with other relevant legislation such as the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (H.R. 2454) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5). The American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009 (ACELA, S. 1462) differs from the energy provisions in H.R. 2454, as it does not include a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade system. Separate climate legislation is to be developed in the Senate Committees, which may or may not be combined with the energy provisions in S. 1462. The American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009 (ACELA, S. 1462) focuses on clean energy technologies, energy efficiency, domestic energy resources, energy innovation, energy workforce development, and U.S. energy market stability. It includes provisions that build on previous energy acts and appropriations. Title I aims to promote the commercial deployment of clean energy technologies through modifications to the Loan Guarantee Program and the establishment of a Clean Energy Deployment Administration (CEDA). The Clean Energy Deployment Administration (CEDA) would operate a program to stimulate the deployment of clean energy technologies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) would have an expanded role in coordinating national transmission infrastructure policy. A federal Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency requirement would be established for electric utilities, starting at 3% in 2011 and rising to 15% by 2021. The provision in Title II of the bill aims to research the impact of energy production on U.S. water resources and promote the deployment of advanced technology vehicles to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. It also focuses on enhancing energy efficiency through policies targeting manufacturing, appliances, buildings, and the electric grid, with government-backed loans to accelerate the implementation of energy-efficient technologies. The bill aims to enhance energy efficiency in industrial and commercial applications, promote new energy-efficient manufacturing technologies, improve energy and water efficiency in consumer products and industrial equipment, and address energy efficiency in buildings through various programs and initiatives. Smart grid technologies would be used to enhance the efficiency of the electric grid. The bill aims to enhance energy efficiency in various sectors and promote new technologies. Smart grid technologies would be utilized to reduce peak demand and improve the efficiency of the electric grid. Additionally, measures are proposed to address critical electric infrastructure, nuclear waste disposal, renewable energy development, and cybersecurity threats. A National Commission on Nuclear Waste would be established to study alternative disposal methods for nuclear waste. Title III of the bill focuses on managing nuclear waste, establishing a strategic reserve of refined petroleum products, promoting renewable energy development on federal lands, and supporting large-scale demonstration projects for CO2 storage. Title III of the bill includes provisions for managing nuclear waste, establishing a strategic reserve of refined petroleum products, promoting renewable energy development on federal lands, and supporting large-scale demonstration projects for CO2 storage. Additionally, it establishes the Affiliated Island Energy Independence Team to assist certain territories in reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels through clean energy resources. Title IV focuses on advancing energy innovation and workforce development. Title V of the bill aims to stabilize oil, natural gas, and electricity markets, enhance energy security, and improve data collection by the Energy Information Administration. It also includes measures to support training programs for an energy workforce and subsurface geosciences education. Title VI of the bill establishes an office within the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to monitor oil and natural gas prices, recommend regulatory authority for energy markets, and authorize the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to issue emergency orders. It also includes provisions for studies on helium and potash resources, energy policy planning, climate change in China and India, and international carbon leakage risks. The American Clean Energy Leadership Act, drawn from multiple bills, addresses various energy-related issues such as assessing international carbon leakage risks, reviewing fuel subsidies, evaluating biofuel resources, and reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The legislation includes provisions for monitoring oil and gas prices, regulating energy markets, and studying energy policy planning and climate change in China and India. The American Clean Energy Leadership Act includes several energy-related bills introduced by Mr. Bingaman, addressing issues such as energy efficiency, manufacturing leadership, technology development, petroleum reserve modernization, and carbon capture programs. The Carbon Capture and Sequestration Program Amendments Act of 2009 was introduced by Mr. Bingaman and became subtitle F of title III. The Committee considered 219 filed amendments, adopted 100, rejected 33, and ordered the legislation favorably reported as an original bill on June 17. A Clean Energy Deployment Administration (CEDA) would be established under the Department of Energy to stimulate the deployment of clean energy technologies. CEDA would absorb the existing DOE Loan Guarantee Program over an 18-month transitional period. DOE issued two more solicitations funded by ARRA for fast track renewable energy projects. The first loan guarantee was issued to a solar panel manufacturer. Congress voted to use $2.0 billion of ARRA funds to extend the \"cash-for-clunkers\" program. S. 1462 would modify the Loan Guarantee Program to increase DOE's flexibility. One proposed change addresses a limitation set by the Federal Credit Reform Act. FCRA Sec. 504(b) requires new budget authority or funding limits to cover subsidy costs for project expansions. The Senate bill exempts CEDA from this requirement, allowing fund balances to support loan guarantees. Opponents fear circumvention of the appropriations process, underestimation of costs, and potential unlimited guarantees for risky technologies. Proponents argue that risk calculations remain unchanged, with full accounting of risks and costs for CEDA loans and guarantees still required. The current proposal aims to ensure full accounting of risks and costs for CEDA loans and loan guarantees, following the requirements of FCRA Sec. 503(d). An issue with the debt financing structure emerged in 2007, criticizing the prohibition of a shared priority collateral structure for project debt under DOE rules. This setup subordinates co-lenders of the unguaranteed portion of the project debt to the government-guaranteed debt. The Senate bill proposes \"pari passu\" financing for DOE loans, allowing equal lien position with other lenders. The Secretary of Energy must set clean energy deployment goals with numerical targets. CEDA would be operated independently within DOE to enhance private markets and create a self-sustaining investment portfolio. A \"direct support unit\" would issue various financial instruments, with a loan loss reserve for risk management. A new internal mechanism would be established by CEDA to balance risks and returns in the portfolio. An \"indirect support unit\" would create financial products to leverage private sector participation and aggregate private debt. Classifications and pricing structures would provide transparency and efficiency. CEDA could issue securities based on the debt it holds. A Clean Energy Investment Fund would be set up as a revolving fund in the Treasury to support the loan guarantee program long-term. Fund resources would be available without fiscal year limitation. Balances in the fund or borrower payments could cover the subsidy cost of a loan guarantee. CEDA could share collateral risk by spreading it out. The House bill proposes transferring functions and authorities of the DOE Loan Guarantee Program to CEDA, an independent corporation owned by the government. $10 billion would be appropriated to the Fund, with fees collected for administrative expenses deposited there. CEDA would reduce fees for breakthrough technologies while ensuring an appropriate rate of return. The key differences between the proposals are organizational structure, funding, and potential impact on technology development. The House bill proposes establishing CEDA as an independent corporation owned by the government, with $7.5 billion in new authority for issuing \"green\" bonds. In contrast, the Senate Energy Committee suggests CEDA be an agency within DOE, absorbing the DOE Loan Guarantee Program and receiving $10 billion from the Treasury. The funding structures differ, with the House focusing on bond sales and the Senate on transferring funds from the Treasury. The Senate Energy proposal would eliminate FCRA requirements for loan guarantees, allowing greater support for nuclear power projects without a cap on guarantees. Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill does not restrict any single energy technology from receiving more than 30% of financial support. This is expected to benefit nuclear power projects, which require large capital investments. ARRA provided $6.0 billion for a temporary program for rapid deployment. The Senate Energy bill allocated $6.0 billion from ARRA for rapid deployment of renewable energy and electric power projects, with a portion for biofuels. The funds were expected to leverage $60 billion in loan guarantees. DOE fast-tracked solicitations to support these projects by the end of FY2011. Additionally, $2.0 billion was used for loan guarantees to extend the \"cash-for-clunkers\" program. The House Speaker expressed concern over the $2.0 billion transfer from the loan guarantee program, representing one-third of the total ARRA funding. The bill focuses on national transmission policy, including support for renewable energy, cost savings, and emissions reduction. The bill focuses on national transmission policy, emphasizing renewable energy, cost savings, and emissions reduction. It directs FERC to coordinate regional transmission planning for high-priority national transmission projects, giving FERC authority to site and permit projects rejected by state regulators. FERC's authority extends to the Eastern and Western Interconnections, excluding the Texas Interconnection. The bill directs FERC to coordinate regional transmission planning for high-priority national projects, giving FERC authority to site and permit projects rejected by state regulators. FERC's authority extends to the Eastern and Western Interconnections, excluding the Texas Interconnection. The Department of the Interior would lead federal environmental reviews for projects involving federal land, marking a departure from historic state control of construction decisions. Planning would have a regional and national focus under FERC, with a requirement to consider alternatives to traditional power plant and transmission line construction. The House bill (ACES) includes policy, planning, and siting provisions for renewable energy projects, with a focus on facilitating the deployment of renewable and zero-carbon power sources. FERC's role in the planning process is more of a facilitator, with authority to supersede state authority over transmission siting only in the Western Interconnection for projects meeting certain criteria. Title IV of Division A of ARRA appropriates $80 million to support regional transmission planning for projects meeting specific criteria. A temporary loan guarantee program is created for rapid deployment of renewable energy and electric power transmission. A federal renewable electricity standard is proposed for electric utilities, starting at 3% in 2011 and increasing to 15% by 2021, with defined renewable sources. Renewable sources include wind, solar, geothermal, ocean energy, biomass, landfill gas, hydropower, marine energy, coal-bed methane, and waste-to-energy. Annual submission of federal renewable energy credits (RECs) is required to meet the renewable electricity standard, with up to 26.67% of the requirement allowed to be met by energy-efficiency credits (EECs). Alternative compliance payments (ACPs) of 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour can be made in lieu of meeting the standard. Trading and banking of RECs are permitted, with RECs being retired upon submission for compliance. The Renewable Electricity and Energy Efficiency provisions in H.R. 2454 and S. 1462 allow for up to three years of compliance with RECs being retired upon submission. EECs are awarded for electricity savings achieved by the electric utility. Guidelines for measurements and baseline definitions will be provided by the Secretary of Energy. Compliance with the renewable electricity standard must begin in 2011 according to S. 1462, with Hawaii being exempted from compliance. Incremental hydropower added after 1992 can be considered renewable energy under the Senate version. The Senate bill requires up to 15% renewable electricity with DOE as the implementing agency, while the House bill requires up to 20% renewable electricity with FERC implementing. Retail electric suppliers can receive RECs for compliance in the Senate bill, but not in the House bill. The Senate bill has a lower alternative compliance payment of 2.1 cents per kwh compared to 2.5 cents per kwh in the House bill. The House version allows ACP funds for non-renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency, while the Senate Energy bill includes nuclear, coal with carbon sequestration, and electric vehicle deployment. The Senate bill permits direct grants to customers to offset higher costs from the RES. The House does not allow for a waiver of RES requirements, while the Senate Energy bill allows for deferment under certain conditions. The House bill increases the federal renewable energy purchase requirement to 20% by 2020, while the Senate Energy version stays with the requirements in the Energy Policy Act 2005. The Senate Energy bill maintains the requirements from the Energy Policy Act 2005. Both the House and Senate bills allow for trading of renewable energy credits, with the House bill defining one credit as one megawatt-hour of renewable electricity. Triple credits are granted for distributed generation in both bills, with differing definitions of eligible systems. The Senate bill defines distributed generation as providing energy to customers at or near a site, while the House version focuses on facilities generating renewable electricity for consumers. The Senate and House bills differ in their definitions of distributed generation (DG) and the exclusions allowed from the calculation of a utility's total annual electricity supply. The Senate bill defines DG as providing energy to customers at or near a site, while the House version focuses on facilities generating renewable electricity for consumers. The House gives triple Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) to all eligible DG systems, while the Senate only gives triple RECs to DG systems less than 1 MW. The Senate Energy bill excludes existing hydro, nuclear capacity placed after enactment, CCS facility electricity proportional to GHGs sequestered, municipal solid waste facility capacity owned by electric utilities, and post-enactment nuclear power plant improvements. Subtitle D focuses on energy-water nexus research and analysis. The Energy bill addresses the energy-water \"nexus\" and the need for more integrated energy and water policies. It calls for a study on the impacts of energy production on water resources, including uses like cooling power plants, hydroelectric power generation, and water in fuel production. The Secretary of Energy would be required to identify water efficiency measures. Sec. 142 of the Energy bill requires the Secretary of Energy to identify water efficiency strategies in power generation, while Sec. 143 focuses on reducing energy consumption in delivering water at Bureau of Reclamation projects. Sec. 144 directs the Secretary of the Interior to operate a federally. Sec. 144 directs the Secretary of the Interior to operate a federally constructed brackish groundwater desalination research facility in New Mexico, focusing on developing cost-effective desalination technologies for inland states and integrating renewable energy technologies. Sec. 145 aims to address the lack of data on energy use in water procurement, delivery, and treatment to improve energy and water efficiency in the United States. Sec. 146 requires the Department of Energy to develop a baseline of water use and water-related energy use across the U.S. economy, leading to the creation of an energy-water roadmap for future research and development efforts. A report to Congress outlining the roadmap and recommended actions is mandated within 120 days of enactment. This builds on previous legislation addressing the energy-water nexus and the establishment of a DOE energy-water program. Sec. 147 requires the Secretary of Energy to provide technology demonstration grants for energy-saving water conservation projects in various developments. Sec. 148 offers technical assistance for energy and water efficiency to rural water utilities. Sec. 149 mandates a study on industrial water use and energy consumption in water treatment. The study aims to promote efficient water and energy use, focusing on the water-energy relationship. H.R. 2454 includes provisions for a WaterSense program at the EPA to promote water-efficient products. Additionally, the bill requires an update on expanding hydroelectric power generation at federal water facilities. The CRS identified uses of ARRA funds for activities that complement Subtitle D, such as constructing energy-efficient buildings. Secs. 151-155 establish grant programs for advanced technology vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. Sec. 152 requires the Secretary of Energy to provide grants for the demonstration of plug-in hybrid vehicles by state and local governments. The bill aims to support advanced technology vehicles through grant programs for vehicle purchases, recharging infrastructure, and electric grid upgrades. It includes a pilot program for pre-commercial plug-in vehicles in the federal fleet and mandates studies on energy use in light-duty vehicles and necessary infrastructure for electric vehicles. The bill authorizes necessary funding and provides more support for advanced vehicles compared to another bill. H.R. 2454 supports advanced technology vehicles through grants for manufacturing plug-in hybrid and other advanced vehicles, including battery manufacturers. It also expands the ATVM loan program and establishes new standards for flexible fuel vehicles. Additionally, it mandates greenhouse gas emissions standards for heavy-duty and non-road vehicles. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) established a program with $2.0 billion for facility funding grants to manufacturers of advanced battery components, including lithium ion batteries and hybrid electrical systems. It also allocated $400 million for transportation electrification grants and $300 million for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. The Department of Energy (DOE) would help manufacturers increase the use of new technology to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A proposed DOE grant program aims to support revolving loan programs for manufacturers to increase energy productivity, produce clean energy technologies, and enhance industrial competitiveness. $1.5 billion is authorized for fiscal years 2010 to 2012, with grants going to state partnerships for manufacturing plant upgrades. Industry would need to quickly assess costs and benefits of capital equipment decisions. Another DOE grant program would assist state-industry partnerships in developing and deploying clean energy technologies. The grant program aims to develop energy-efficient industrial technologies and processes to reduce energy use, pollution, and GHG emissions while improving cost competitiveness. Each grant would be capped at $500,000 with a matching non-federal contribution required. Additional Industrial Research and Assessment Centers (IACs) and Centers of Excellence would be established for coordination with other federal agency programs supporting manufacturing and building technology. Organizational changes at DOE and other federal agencies would be necessary to establish R&D partnerships between different programs. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and the Office of Science (OS) are partnering to promote technology development and manufacturing capabilities to industry. An industry-government R&D partnership will be established to support sustainable manufacturing processes. An advisory steering committee will provide recommendations for planning and implementing programs. DOE will conduct assessments on energy-efficient technologies and industry-specific technology roadmaps. The DOE would produce industry-specific technology roadmaps for a \"Future of Industry\" program to reduce energy intensity and GHG emissions. The National Academy of Sciences would study opportunities for developing new manufacturing capabilities for advanced energy technologies. The Senate Committee bill proposes state revolving loan programs with $1.5 billion over three years, supporting technology transfer and deployment through university centers. The Senate Committee bill aims to expand technology transfer and deployment through university centers, including the creation of \"Centers of Excellence\" to promote sustainable manufacturing practices, supply chain analysis, and coordination among federal technology centers and national laboratories. The House bill includes provisions for establishing \"energy innovation hubs\" to support clean energy technologies, \"centers for energy and environment\" to promote industry and clean energy applications, and \"building assessment centers\" to support technology deployment. The Senate Committee bill focuses on manufacturing and competitiveness, including technology transfer and deployment through university centers. It includes provisions for creating \"Centers of Excellence\" and innovation deployment grants. The House bill, on the other hand, aims for accelerated clean energy equipment deployment and regional economic development. It includes provisions for energy innovation hubs and expanding industrial standards programs. The industrial standards program would be expanded to include plant energy-efficiency certification standards. DOE would create a monetary award program to spur innovation in thermal energy recovery. The Department of Commerce would establish a clean energy manufacturing supply chain initiative to help manufacturers transition to clean energy and increase the use of innovative manufacturing technologies. ARRA provided $2.0 billion for facility funding grants to manufacturers of advanced battery components. The ARRA (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) provided funding for the production of advanced technology vehicles, renewable energy equipment, energy storage systems, and energy-efficient technologies. This included tax credits for manufacturing facilities and equipment related to solar, wind, geothermal, fuel cells, and electric vehicles. The total estimated cost of these initiatives was $1.6 billion over 10 years. Energy-efficiency standards for appliances and equipment would be legislated and strengthened, including portable light fixtures, lamps, and commercial furnaces. New procedures for revising test procedures and changing efficiency standards would be implemented. A rebate program for energy-efficient motors would be established. Studies would be conducted on DOE compliance with standards, the use of direct current in buildings, and an assessment of a proposed Energy Superstar category under the Energy Star program. Congress has legislated efficiency standards for various appliances over the past three decades, with opportunities continuously arising to establish standards for new equipment categories. The Senate bill addresses efficiency opportunities for new equipment categories, including the use of sensors and computer controls. Industry tensions between federal and state standards have historically influenced the establishment of uniform national standards. Court disputes have occasionally arisen between opponents and proponents of new federal standards. The Senate bill addresses efficiency opportunities for new equipment categories, resolving industry tensions through a collaborative process. Proposed standards for appliances and equipment include lighting efficiency, commercial furnaces, and motor efficiency rebates. Both bills aim to update the DOE-EPA Energy Star Program periodically. The Senate bill proposes updates to the DOE-EPA Energy Star Program, including periodic updates of product eligibility criteria and assessments of compliance. It also calls for an update of the cooperative agreement between the agencies and for DOE to implement an Energy Star program for solid state lighting equipment. Additionally, the bill includes provisions for a petition process to amend test procedures and efficiency standards, as well as studies to be conducted by DOE and EPA. The curr_chunk seeks a rulemaking to amend efficiency standards, proposing studies on establishing an \"Energy Superstar\" designation, compliance with energy-efficiency standards for appliances, and the costs and benefits of using high-quality direct current electricity in buildings. The House bill includes eleven provisions for appliance efficiency, such as revising criteria to include reduced emissions of greenhouse gases on EnergyGuide labels. The House bill proposes major changes in appliance efficiency standards, including adding carbon output information on EnergyGuide labels. It also introduces incentives for retailers and manufacturers to promote highly efficient products and recycle inefficient ones. The House bill proposes changes in appliance efficiency standards and introduces incentives for retailers and manufacturers to promote highly efficient products. Programs and standards would be set for outdoor lighting, water dispensers, portable electric spas, commercial hot food holding cabinets, and residential wood stoves. ARRA allocated $300 million to EPA for rebates on Energy Star products to lower energy bills. The curr_chunk discusses improving building energy efficiency through updates in national model building energy codes, grant and finance programs, and the establishment of a voluntary energy performance information program. It highlights the complexity of achieving energy-efficiency improvements in buildings due to critical barriers and regional differences in building codes. The DOE has utilized its analytic capacity to address these challenges. The Senate Energy Committee bill aims to revamp the model energy code processes for residential and commercial buildings, requiring regular updates and providing incentives for states to adopt them. It also authorizes grants and initiatives to promote building efficiency, with a focus on setting higher energy savings targets for future code updates. In future updates, nationwide energy savings targets would increase to 50% for updates after January 1, 2016. Model code updates would align with industry standards, and federal training and funding assistance would be available to states adopting advanced building efficiency codes. States must certify code updates and compliance with DOE. The Senate bill proposes $100 million per year for five years, while the House bill funds through a cap-and-trade program. The Senate Committee bill proposes a program for retrofitting existing buildings, similar to provisions in the House bill. Both bills direct EPA and DOE to establish criteria and financial support for residential and commercial buildings. Other policies in the Senate bill have identical counterparts in the House bill, including energy-efficiency goals, training centers, ESPCs for federal agencies, and strategies for energy-efficient technologies. The two bills also have identical provisions for manufactured housing. The Senate bill includes additional provisions for innovation in manufactured and multifamily housing, such as establishing a zero-net-energy initiative for residential buildings. Nearly $1 billion would be authorized over 11 years to support pilot programs and address market failures and technological challenges in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The Senate Energy Committee bill aims to improve monitoring of building energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness of programs. It reauthorizes the DOE Weatherization and State Energy programs for FY2011 through FY2015, with $1.7 billion and $250 million authorized per year respectively. The House bill includes provisions for energy-efficient neighborhoods, programs, projects, standards, and incentives, with no similar provisions in the Senate bill. The House bill includes provisions for a building energy performance labeling program to encourage energy reduction in residential and commercial buildings. Other provisions cover tree planting programs, energy efficiency in data centers, solar energy permits, residential solar installations, community energy-efficiency flexibility, small community joint participation, low-income community energy efficiency, and consumer behavior research. The ARRA bill provided significant funding for various energy efficiency programs, including the DOE Weatherization Program, State Energy Program, Energy Efficiency Block Grant program, and R&D on energy efficiency of information and communication technologies. Additionally, funds were allocated for high performance green buildings in federal agencies and building energy-efficiency measures in other agencies. Subtitle D of the bill focuses on peak demand management in the electric grid. It aims to reduce peak demand and improve the system load factor to achieve cost savings. Sec. 295 establishes a national policy for improving load factors through 2030, led by the Secretary of Energy in collaboration with government and industry. The plan will be updated every three years with progress reports to Congress. No new executive authority or legal requirements on utility systems are mandated, except for one discussed exception. Subtitle D of the bill focuses on peak demand management in the electric grid, aiming to reduce peak demand and improve the system load factor for cost savings. Sec. 296 would require state regulatory authorities to consider rules facilitating connection of small distributed generation sources to the power grid. Utilities must establish peak demand reduction goals for 2012 and 2015 without penalties for non-compliance. ARRA includes provisions for funding energy efficiency. Subtitle D of the bill focuses on peak demand management in the electric grid, aiming to reduce peak demand and improve the system load factor for cost savings. It would give executive agencies new emergency authority to direct critical electric infrastructure entities to block cyber security threats or vulnerabilities. The Secretary of Energy could issue emergency orders to block threats, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could issue orders to resolve vulnerabilities. This is in response to the rapid development of cyber-security attacks on the electric power system. The bill grants emergency authority to executive agencies to address cyber-security threats on the electric power system. The Secretary of Energy can issue emergency orders without prior notice, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can issue orders to resolve vulnerabilities. Consultation with other agencies or industry is encouraged, and emergency orders would terminate after 90 days unless affirmed by FERC. No open hearing is required, and the provision applies throughout the contiguous states. In Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam, the Secretary of Defense will prepare a comprehensive plan for protection measures. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a National Commission on Nuclear Waste to recommend alternative waste management strategies in response to the Obama Administration's decision to abandon the Yucca Mountain repository. The commission would consist of 11 members appointed by the President and would study deep geologic repositories and long-term waste storage at nuclear power plants. Federal or state employees would not be eligible for the commission. The National Commission on Nuclear Waste would study alternative waste management strategies, including deep geologic repositories, regional storage facilities, and waste reprocessing technologies. It would also recommend financial incentives to host states and study alternative approaches to program administration and financing. The commission's provisions provide congressional direction to the Administration's proposed nuclear waste advisory panel. The budget request eliminates further planning for the Yucca Mountain repository but continues funding for the license application before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The House included $5 million for the Administration's blue ribbon panel in the FY2010 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill. The Senate-passed version of the appropriations bill approves the full budget request but does not include any language on the proposed commission. This subtitle of S. 1462 also includes a \"sense of Congress\" finding on the importance of nuclear energy and additional requirements for research and development of spent nuclear fuel recycling or transmutation process. No provisions in this subtitle are similar to any provisions in H.R. 2454 or any spending provisions in ARRA. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in Texas and Louisiana is filled with crude oil near its capacity of 727 million barrels. It can release 4.4 million barrels initially in case of a severe energy supply interruption. Legislation may require the SPR to include 30 million barrels of refined product and transfer drawdown authority. The proposal aims to expand the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to include 30 million barrels of refined product and transfer drawdown authority to the Secretary of Energy. This change would allow for drawdown and sale in the event of a severe energy market supply interruption causing a significant price increase, which was prompted by the high gasoline prices in 2008 due to tight product supply despite abundant crude oil. The Senate bill proposes expanding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to include refined products and transferring drawdown authority to the Secretary of Energy. The reason for this change is unspecified, but it may be due to the Secretary's closer contact on energy-supply developments. The shift to basing drawdown on a \"severe energy market supply interruption\" instead of a \"severe energy supply interruption\" is a significant change in the bill affecting the SPR. The Senate Committee bill proposes expanding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to include refined products and allowing a drawdown of SPR oil in response to high prices caused by a \"market supply interruption.\" The legislation would require a report to Congress within 180 days detailing the acquisition of refined products for the Reserve and assessing storage options. The Senate Committee bill proposes expanding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to include refined products and allowing a drawdown of SPR oil in response to high prices caused by a \"market supply interruption.\" Congress is debating the opening of the outer continental shelf (OCS) for oil and gas development, with differing views on the risks and benefits. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 placed a leasing and drilling moratorium in the eastern Gulf of Mexico until 2022. The Senate Committee bill proposes expanding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to include refined products and allowing a drawdown of SPR oil in response to high prices caused by a \"market supply interruption.\" The bill also amends GOMESA to open the eastern Gulf of Mexico (EGoM) beyond 45 miles of Florida's coastline, including the Destin Dome area with existing leases. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) conducts assessments of undiscovered technically recoverable resources (UTRR) on the U.S. OCS, with varying statistical certainty due to differences in geologic data availability. The Senate Committee bill proposes expanding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to include refined products and allowing a drawdown of SPR oil in response to high prices caused by a \"market supply interruption.\" To address resource inventory uncertainty, a seismic inventory of oil and gas resources in the Atlantic, eastern Gulf of Mexico, and Alaska regions of the OCS would be required, with funding authorized at $100 million each year for fiscal years 2010-2015 and $50 million each year for years 2016-2020. The curr_chunk discusses the repeal of royalty relief for shallow water deep gas and deepwater oil and gas, confirmation of the MMS Director by the Senate, permitting of high-pressure natural gas pipelines in specified non-wilderness areas within Denali National Park, exemptions for the trans-Alaska pipeline from certain requirements, establishment of an Alaskan Office for OCS permit processing, and the production of geothermal energy on oil and gas leases. The curr_chunk discusses the exemption of federal purchases of oil-sand-derived fuel from the EISA requirement, establishment of Pilot Project Field Offices for renewable energy projects, and creation of a special Treasury fund for royalties from wind or solar energy production. The legislation proposes the creation of the \"BLM Wind and Solar Energy Permit Processing Improvement Fund\" and requires a programmatic environmental impact statement for solar and wind power projects on public lands. It also mandates a study by the National Academy of Sciences on the siting and development of wind and solar energy projects, as well as the establishment of a wind and solar leasing pilot program by the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary would decide within 30 months on a wind and solar leasing program for public land, addressing concerns about current regulations for large-scale renewable energy projects and their environmental impacts. The BLM has issued policies for wind and solar energy development on public lands, including completing a final PEIS for wind energy facilities in 2006 and updating their policies in 2008 and 2007 respectively. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar issued a decision on a wind and solar leasing program for public land within 30 months to address concerns about regulations for renewable energy projects. In October 2008, a report was completed. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar issued a Secretarial Order (3285) on March 11, 2009, prioritizing renewable energy at DOI. A Departmental Task Force on Energy and Climate Change was established to identify suitable zones for renewable energy development on public land. The public comment period on solar energy was extended to September 14, 2009, with new solar permitting offices opened and solar energy study area maps made available. There are 158 active solar project applications covering 1.8 million acres of federal land. Geothermal leasing on federal lands is authorized by the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, with much of the nation's geothermal energy potential located on federal lands. Efforts are being made to increase geothermal production on federal lands while minimizing environmental impacts. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 authorizes geothermal leasing on federal lands to increase production while minimizing environmental impacts. The BLM administers over 500 geothermal leases with 29 operating power plants generating 1,275 megawatts. A proposed subtitle would extend funding for the Act through FY2020 and authorize demonstration projects for carbon capture and sequestration from industrial sources. The proposed subtitle aims to foster the commercial application of long-term geologic storage of CO2 by setting requirements for applicants in a competitive process, including providing geological site information, possessing necessary land interests, obtaining permits, and complying with terms and conditions for project construction and operation. The proposed subtitle sets requirements for operators in the long-term geologic storage of CO2, focusing on financial assurances during injection, closure, and post-closure activities. Operators must maintain financial protection acceptable to relevant authorities until site closure requirements are met. The legislation sets requirements for operators in long-term geologic storage of CO2, including post-closure activities to ensure the stability of the CO2 plume and underground reservoir. Financial assurances must be maintained until the project complies with site closure requirements for at least 10 consecutive years. The legislation sets requirements for operators in long-term geologic storage of CO2, including post-closure activities to ensure stability. The federal government may take title to the land for monitoring or remediation. The Secretary of Energy can indemnify operators for liability exceeding financial assurances, up to $10 billion per project. Operators are not indemnified for gross negligence or intentional misconduct. A fee may be collected for the indemnification agreement. The legislation allows for indemnification of operators in long-term geologic storage of CO2, with the fee determined based on regulations.
