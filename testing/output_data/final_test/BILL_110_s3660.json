    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Residential Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act\" and includes findings related to carbon monoxide poisoning. The Congress finds that carbon monoxide, a deadly gas produced by burning fuel, can lead to poisoning and death. Carbon monoxide poisoning from fuel-burning appliances kills 2,000 people annually and sends 15,000 to emergency rooms. Installing carbon monoxide alarms in residential homes can prevent fatalities, and Congress should promote their purchase nationwide. To promote public health and safety, units nationwide are being established. SEC. 3. ADOPTION OF ANSI/UL 2034 AS CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY RULE. The Consumer Product Safety Act is amended to include regulations for residential carbon monoxide detectors. Within 90 days of the Residential Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act's enactment, the Consumer Product Safety Commission must publish the American National Standard for Carbon Monoxide Alarms as a mandatory safety standard. It will be unlawful to import or distribute non-compliant residential carbon monoxide detectors after the standard takes effect. Beginning 1 year after the enactment of the Residential Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act, manufacturers must label residential carbon monoxide detectors to show compliance with the safety standard. Non-compliant detectors will be subject to penalties under the Act. Manufacturers must label residential carbon monoxide detectors to show compliance with safety standards. If the ANSI/UL 34-2005 standard is revised, the Commission will amend the product safety standard accordingly. The Commission will update the product safety standard for residential carbon monoxide detectors to include any necessary revisions within 180 days of publishing the notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register. Additionally, the Commission may add extra safety requirements as deemed essential for the detectors' effectiveness and safety. The Consumer Product Safety Act will not apply to amendments of product safety standards under certain provisions. Judicial review of these amendments will follow chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. A conforming amendment will be made to the table of contents of the Act. SEC. 4. REDUCING DEATHS AND INJURIES FROM CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING. Residential carbon monoxide detectors. The Consumer Product Safety Commission must require portable generators to have carbon monoxide interlock safety devices that detect and automatically shut off the generator to prevent serious harm. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will mandate warning labels on portable generators to alert consumers about the carbon monoxide hazard. The labels must be prominently displayed in English and Spanish, with the word \"DANGER\" in at least 1-inch tall font. Portable generators should only be used outdoors to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, as the gas is invisible and odorless. Each generator must have a pictogram stating \"OUTDOOR USE ONLY: EMITS POISONOUS GAS\" and include clear warnings in the instruction manual. Portable generators emit carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas that is odorless and deadly. It is crucial to operate generators outdoors, away from enclosed spaces, and to seek fresh air if feeling unwell. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will review the effectiveness of labeling requirements for charcoal briquettes after a windstorm in the Pacific Northwest. They will also identify challenges faced by non-English speaking populations and make recommendations for improving the labels. State grant program for carbon monoxide alarms. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a grant program to assist eligible States in implementing a carbon monoxide alarm program. States must show they have a law or regulation requiring approved carbon monoxide alarms in residential units. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a grant program to assist States in implementing carbon monoxide alarm programs. States must have laws mandating approved carbon monoxide alarms in residential units. The Commission will determine grant amounts and prioritize multi-state applications. States receiving grants must train fire code enforcement officials on carbon monoxide alarm laws and installation. Funds can also be used for developing training materials and instructors. The grant funds can be used for training fire code enforcement officials on carbon monoxide alarm laws and installation, as well as educating the public on the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning and proper alarm use. There are limitations on the use of funds, with a maximum of 10% for administrative costs and 25% for public outreach activities. A carbon monoxide alarm is a device that detects the presence of carbon monoxide and sounds an alarm if levels are dangerous. The Consumer Product Safety Commission sets standards for these alarms. The term \"NFPA 720\" refers to the standard for installing carbon monoxide alarms in dwelling units issued by the National Fire Protection Association. Fire code enforcement officials are officials of the Fire Safety Code Enforcement Agency of a State. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Commission for fiscal years 2009 through. The Commission is appropriated $2,000,000 for fiscal years 2009-2013 for a grant program. Any unspent funds will be retained by the Commission. A report evaluating the grant program must be submitted to Congress annually."
