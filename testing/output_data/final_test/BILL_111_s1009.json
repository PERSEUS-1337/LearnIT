    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Care Transitions Program Act of 2009\" introduces a new section in Title XVIII of the Social Security Act for a care transitions program. The \"Medicare Care Transitions Program Act of 2009\" establishes a Care Transitions Program under which outcomes-based payments are made to community-based transitional care suppliers for providing care transition services to individuals discharged from inpatient care. Care transition services include self-management goal-setting, medication self-management support, and arranging timely follow-up care. The Care Transitions Program includes services such as individualized training, establishment of personal health records, preparation for clinical encounters, monitoring service effectiveness, and other appropriate services determined by the Secretary. Targeting and timing of care transition services are also specified. The Care Transitions Program provides services to individuals entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled in part B, within 90 days of hospital discharge. The Secretary establishes contracts with entities meeting specific requirements for care transition services. The Secretary establishes an application process for entities to serve as Care Transition Contractors (CTCs). Requirements include professional expertise, privacy safeguards, and authority to review medical records. Entities must not receive payments for services provided to eligible individuals. The Secretary establishes an application process for entities to serve as Care Transition Contractors (CTCs). Entities must demonstrate capability to form cooperative processes with medical service providers, receive appropriate training, and submit a proposed plan targeting beneficiaries at risk for rehospitalizations and identifying wasteful services. The Care Transition Contractors (CTCs) aim to reduce rehospitalizations and improve quality outcomes through community-based interventions, partnering with local entities and developing intervention plans. The Care Transition Contractors (CTCs) are responsible for project management, facilitating interventions, assisting providers and the community in creating resources for effective transitions, reviewing cases of rehospitalization within 30 days, engaging providers in interventions to prevent rehospitalizations, and collaborating with partners to implement care transitions. The Care Transition Contractors (CTCs) engage partners to implement care transition services targeting individuals with complex conditions based on local community needs and hospital readmissions patterns. They may provide deidentified patient data to providers for measuring and improving transitions between providers. Under the Program, the Secretary establishes payment amounts for organizations awarded a contract under this section, directly linked to the CTC's ability to achieve quality and cost targets, including shared savings for reducing rehospitalization rates. The CTC demonstrated reductions in rehospitalization rates, with adjustments made to payments to account for adverse selection and health status variation. Payments are payable from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The Secretary will create regulations within 18 months to implement the section on equitable considerations for quality improvements and cost savings by entities."
