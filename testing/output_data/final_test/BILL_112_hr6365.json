Congress finds that the sequester, set to take effect on January 2, 2013, will result in significant cuts to non-military personnel programs of the Department of Defense and certain domestic programs like the NIH and border security. There is bipartisan agreement that the sequester would undermine key responsibilities of the Federal Government, as stated in the Administration's fiscal year 2013 budget request. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 5652, the Sequestration Replacement Reconciliation Act of 2012, to replace the $98 billion sequestration in fiscal year 2013. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 5652, the Sequestration Replacement Reconciliation Act of 2012, to replace the $98 billion sequestration in fiscal year 2013 with changes in law to reduce direct spending by $310 billion through fiscal year 2022. An analysis found that sequestration would significantly reduce military size, leading to the separation of 200,000 soldiers and Marines. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 5652, the Sequestration Replacement Reconciliation Act of 2012, to replace the $98 billion sequestration in fiscal year 2013 with changes in law to reduce direct spending by $310 billion through fiscal year 2022. This would lead to significant reductions in military size, jeopardizing the ability to respond to contingencies in North Korea or Iran, resulting in the smallest ground force since 1940, a fleet of fewer than 230 ships (the smallest level since 1915), and the smallest tactical fighter force in the history of the Air Force. Additionally, the nuclear triad that has kept the U.S. and allies safe for decades would be at risk, along with reductions in defense civilian personnel and two rounds of base closings. (House Armed Services Committee memo entitled ``Assessment of Impacts of Budget Cuts'', September 22, 2011) If sequestration is triggered, the Department of Defense would face devastating cuts, leading to the smallest military size since 1940, the fewest ships since 1915, and the smallest Air Force in history. General Dempsey highlighted the limited options available in response to sequestration. Sequestration would force cuts in operations, maintenance, and training, leading to a hollow force according to military staff. Service chiefs warn of catastrophic impact on military readiness and future capabilities. Sequestration will have a significant impact on non-defense discretionary programs, including reducing Head Start by $650 million and the National Institutes of Health by $2.4 billion. General James F. Amos and General Norton A. Schwartz express concerns about the dire consequences of budget cuts on military readiness and capabilities. Sequestration will also negatively impact the industrial base necessary for equipping the armed forces, potentially affecting 1.1 million workers in the supply chain, including workers in aerospace, shipbuilding, and navigation equipment industries. SEC. 3. CONDITIONAL REPLACEMENT FOR FY 2013 SEQUESTER. The section and amendments will take effect upon the enactment of legislation that achieves deficit reduction or outlay reductions within five years after enactment. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 was amended to revise the 2013 discretionary spending limit to $1,047,000,000,000 in new budget authority. Additionally, for fiscal year 2013, there was a decrease of $19,104,000,000 in budget authority for the discretionary category. These changes will take effect upon the enactment of legislation that achieves deficit reduction or outlay reductions within five years after enactment. The OMB will issue a report on discretionary spending caps for fiscal year 2013 to eliminate any breach of the spending limit. The President will issue an order to address any identified breach. Additionally, any sequestration order for direct spending in fiscal year 2013 will be eliminated. The President will eliminate any sequestration order for direct spending in fiscal year 2013 under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Legislation may reduce required direct spending reductions for the nonsecurity category if outlay reductions exceed budget authority reductions. Congress may reduce direct spending reductions for the nonsecurity category if outlay reductions exceed budget authority reductions. The President must submit a legislative proposal to Congress by October 15, 2012, meeting the requirements of the Act."
