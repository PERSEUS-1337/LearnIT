    "content": "The Bush Administration's FY2006 budget request was released in February 2005. The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill acquired Department of Energy programs previously in the Interior appropriations bill. The requested amount for FY2006 was $29.75 billion, slightly lower than FY2005's $30.17 billion. The House passed H.R. 2419 on May 24, 2005. The House passed H.R. 2419 on May 24, 2005, appropriating $29.75 billion for energy and water development programs. The Senate approved a version of the bill totaling $31.245 billion on June 30. A final bill funding these programs at $30.49 billion was signed into law by President Bush on November 19 (P.L. 109-103). The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation, DOE, NRC, and ARC were part of the reorganization of appropriations subcommittees. The Bush Administration requested $29.747 billion for Energy and Water Development programs in FY2006. The House bill allocated $29.746 billion, while the Senate version proposed $31.245 billion. The final bill signed into law by President Bush funded these programs at $30.49 billion. The conference report on H.R. 2419 funded FY2006 programs at $30.488 billion, with increased funding for the Corps of Engineers by $749 million. The conference also reduced funding for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste disposal project. Table 2 shows budget totals for energy and water development appropriations from FY1999 to FY2006. Table 3 lists totals for each of the four titles, including adjustments of accounts within the titles. The Administration requested decreased funding for the Corps of Engineers and Department of the Interior programs in FY2006. The House and Senate bills proposed different funding levels for these programs. The FY2006 budget allocated $5.383 billion for the Corps and $1.065 billion for DOI programs. The DOE budget request was $24.213 billion, slightly lower than the previous year. The House proposed $24.318 billion, while the Senate suggested $25.077 billion. DOE's major activities include energy research, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The conference bill funded all DOE programs at $24.290 billion. Funding for independent agencies in Title IV was $234 million, down from $289 million in FY2005. The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill for FY2006 allocated $5.383 billion for the Corps of Engineers, $1.065 billion for DOI programs, and $24.290 billion for DOE programs. Funding for independent agencies in Title IV was $234 million. The House, Senate, and conference bills differed in their appropriations for these programs. The conference report on the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill for FY2006 included compromise language addressing dissatisfaction with the Corps of Engineers' financial management. Changes in H.R. 2419 would affect the Corps' ability to reprogram funds, use continuing contracts, and allocate project funds quarterly. The Corps civil works program has been criticized for lacking focus, with estimates of a backlog ranging from $11 billion to over $50 billion. The conference report on the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill for FY2006 addressed concerns about the Corps of Engineers' financial management. The Corps' backlog is a point of contention, with concerns about construction delays and cost overruns due to limited appropriations. The agency's inability to prioritize projects has led to budget allocations for individual water resources projects. The President's FY2006 budget proposed policy changes to reduce the backlog and advance projects within fiscal constraints and national priorities. The House Appropriations Committee expressed a need for the Civil Works program to be managed as a whole program rather than individual projects, emphasizing the importance of a systematic approach to the Nation's water and coastal infrastructure. They highlighted the value of a five-year plan and strategic vision to guide budget requests. The Senate Appropriations Committee took a different perspective on the Corps' budget compared to the House. The Senate report criticized the \"lack of leadership\" at the agency and emphasized the benefits of a performance-based budgeting approach for addressing the Corps construction backlog in the FY2006 request. The budget request focused on funding projects with high economic and environmental returns. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees had differing views on the Administration's performance-based budgeting approach for environmental projects. The Senate report criticized the lack of leadership at the agency and suggested a reexamination of the budget model. The House supported focusing resources on high-value projects already under construction. The Senate report included funds for projects not in the House bill or Administration's requests. The conference report acknowledged the Administration's efforts but recognized the limitations of the Administration's metrics. It directs the Corps to contract with the National Academy of Public Administration to recommend metrics for allocating Corps construction appropriations. The Administration's request limited new activities to one construction project and three planning activities to address the budget backlog. The President's request would fund construction projects to be completed in FY2006, including national priority projects like the New York and New Jersey Harbor Deepening project and restoration projects in the Florida Everglades. The FY2006 budget includes projects in the Florida Everglades and Upper Mississippi River system, as well as environmental projects in the Columbia River Basin and Missouri River basin. The House and Senate reports differ on funding priorities, with the Senate proposing more projects than the Administration's request. The Administration is considering suspending 35 active construction projects. The FY2006 budget includes projects in the Florida Everglades and Upper Mississippi River system, as well as environmental projects in the Columbia River Basin and Missouri River basin. The Administration is considering suspending 35 active construction projects, with the House and Senate differing on funding priorities. The FY2006 request includes an $80 million fund to cancel contracts for projects, with concerns raised about potential displacement of funding for traditional water resources activities due to large environmental restoration programs. The FY2006 budget includes projects in various ecosystems, with some awaiting authorization for construction. The request allocates $510 million for aquatic ecosystem restoration, including $10 million for coastal Louisiana studies and $8 million for a hurricane protection study. Funding for hurricane damage protection in coastal Louisiana is being pursued through reallocating $1.6 billion. The FY2006 budget includes $1.6 billion reallocated for hurricane damage protection, with $250 million for Gulf coastal ecosystem projects. The Corps plays a key role in restoring the Central and Southern Florida ecosystem, with $137 million allocated for construction projects in the region. The House Appropriations Committee has allocated $137 million for the South Florida Ecosystem Everglades Restoration program, which includes funding for various projects. The budget request supports the state of Florida's efforts to accelerate work on these projects, with the addition of the Modified Water Deliveries Project being funded by the Corps and the Department of the Interior. The Administration proposes that the Corps should cover $124 million of the $191 million needed to finish the project from FY2006 to FY2009. There is a debate on whether the Corps is authorized to receive appropriations for the project. The House supports funding for various Everglades projects, while the Senate questions the authorization for the Corps to fund the work. The Senate bill allocates funds separately for different Everglades projects. The conference report provides $105 million for various Florida projects, including $77 million for the Central and Southern Florida project, $13 million for the Kissimmee River project, and $12 million for the Everglades and South Florida project. Additionally, $35 million is allocated for the Modified Water Deliveries Projects, totaling $139 million. Funding for Everglades projects is also included in Department of the Interior appropriations bills. The Energy and Water Development bill provides funding for the Central Utah Project Completion Account and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). The Administration requested $34.4 million for the Central Utah Project (CUP) Completion Account for FY2006, a decrease of $13.6 million from the previous year. The FY2006 request for the Bureau of Reclamation totals $946.7 million, with offsets for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund and Hydropower Direct Financing. The Energy and Water Development bill provides funding for the Central Utah Project Completion Account and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). The FY2006 budget for BOR is $872.8 million, $51.2 million less than FY2005. The House and Senate bills allocated $34.4 million for the CUP Completion Account. The House bill provided $977.14 million in gross current budget authority for BOR, while the Senate bill provided $1,046.7 million. The final bill provided $1,030.6 million for BOR in FY2006. The Administration requested $801.6 million for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2006, which is $51 million less than enacted for FY2005. The House, Senate, and conference bills provided varying amounts of funding for water projects, with the Senate bill allocating more funds for certain projects in southwestern states. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) plays a significant role in building dams and water diversion structures in the West. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) in the West develops water supplies for irrigation, managing dams and reservoirs in 17 states. BOR supplies water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people, also generating hydroelectric power. Operations are controversial due to impacts on wildlife and water users. The Administration requested $35 million for the California Bay-Delta. The Administration requested $35 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account (Bay-Delta, or CALFED) for FY2006. The House approved $35 million for the CALFED Account, while the Senate bill included $37 million. The final bill also included $37 million for CALFED. The Administration requested $50 million for site security for FY2006, an increase of $18 million from FY2005. The funding covers activities such as surveillance, law enforcement, anti-terrorism, and security upgrades. BOR planned to assign a portion of security costs to water users for repayment based on project cost allocations. The House Appropriations Committee for FY2006 estimated the collection of $10 million from project beneficiaries for O&M costs. The Administration requested $50 million for site security for FY2006, with $40 million allocated for security and $10 million expected in reimbursement payments. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $50 million for site security but directed BOR to report on planned costs. The final bill included $10 million in security reimbursements and authorized BOR to enter into agreements for water conservation projects. The General Provisions in the Energy and Water Development bill authorize grants and agreements for water conservation projects, including improvements for water efficiency and management. It also allocates $95 million for water flow and restoration in the Walker River Basin and authorizes a study for updating information on the Auburn Dam. The bill historically funds DOE activities such as research on renewable energy and nuclear power. The Energy and Water bill includes research and development on renewable energy, nuclear power, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The appropriations committees transferred DOE's programs for fossil fuels, energy efficiency, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and energy statistics to the Energy and Water Development bill. The total request for FY2006 was $24.213 billion, with the House recommending $24.318 billion and the Senate proposing $25.077 billion. The final conference bill, P.L. 109-103, appropriated $24.290 billion. The House Appropriations Committee transferred programs in Title III of H.R. 2419, integrating them with existing programs. Energy efficiency programs were combined with renewable energy programs into a single account. DOE houses various programs with different functions and missions. The FY2006 budget request highlighted the potential benefits of the Administration's energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The FY2006 budget request aimed to accelerate the development of hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles and improve energy efficiency and performance in various technologies. The request sought $1,200.4 million for DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs, with increases for Fuel Cells, Hydrogen, and Facilities, but cuts for Industrial programs and Biomass. In FY2006, funding cuts were proposed for various EERE programs, including Industrial, Biomass, Advanced Combustion Vehicles, Buildings, Small Hydro, Clean Cities, International Renewables, State Energy Program, and Tribal Energy. Congressional earmarks totaling $75.9 million were to be reprogrammed or eliminated, with significant reductions for Hydrogen, Biomass, and Intergovernmental programs. The House approved $1,236.8 million for EERE programs, while the Senate bill included $1,253.8 million, with increases for Vehicle Technologies, Biomass, and Weatherization, but decreases for Program Direction, Wind, and Industrial programs. The Senate approved $4.9 million more for EERE programs in FY2006, with decreases in various areas such as Program Direction, Wind, Industrial Technologies, and International Renewables. The conference committee approved $1,185.7 million for EERE programs, which is $63.2 million less than the FY2005 appropriation. R&D funding saw reductions, with Distributed Energy Resources transferring to the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability accounting for a significant portion of the decrease. The EERE programs in FY2006 saw changes in funding, with increases for Facilities and Buildings, and decreases for Industrial Programs, Hydrogen, and Small Hydro. Weatherization grants increased, while State Energy Grants and Gateway Deployment funding decreased. Earmarks for EERE programs nearly doubled from $85.9 million in FY2005 to $165.6 million in FY2006. The Senate approved $4.9 million more for EERE programs, with reductions in Program Direction, Wind, Industrial Technologies, and International Renewables. The total EERE budget approved was $1,185.7 million, $63.2 million less than the previous year. In FY2006, DOE appropriated $178.1 million, with $60.6 million for the Distributed Energy Program. The House Appropriations Committee urged the Secretary to expedite appliance efficiency standards issuance and report by December 1, 2005, on plans to accelerate standards rulemakings. The FY2006 Senate Appropriations Committee's report provided four administrative directions, including support for National Academy of Science's recommendations for hydrogen programs and a recommendation to hold off on offshore wind energy research funding until legislation is in place. The committee also directed the Energy Secretary to consider transferring certain demand-side management activities to the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability. The committee directs the consolidation of six Regional Offices into two locations by June 1, 2006. The report contains key policy directives regarding congressionally directed projects and concerns about staffing at national laboratories. The report directs the consolidation of DOE's six regional offices into two locations by September 30, 2006. It also calls for a report on appliance efficiency standards and mentions GPRA performance targets for R&D programs. For more information, refer to CRS Issue Briefs IB10020 and IB10041. For nuclear energy research and development, P.L. 109-103 provides $557.6 million, $57.6 million above the FY2005 appropriation. The funding includes $137.4 million from Other Defense Activities and Naval Reactors accounts, reducing the net appropriation to $420.2 million. The Administration requested $513.8 million for FY2006, with the House slightly increasing it to $515.1 million. Additional reimbursement from the Naval Reactors account would result in a net appropriation of $377.7 million under Energy Supply and Conservation. The defense and naval reactors reimbursement covers management and security at the Idaho National Laboratory, now under the nuclear energy program. The House shifted a uranium disposal program to the National Nuclear Security Administration. An amendment transferred funds from the \"Nuclear Power 2010\" program to the \"weatherization\" assistance program. The Senate bill included a $60 million increase, totaling $573.8 million for Nuclear Energy. The final appropriation was $557.6 million. The final appropriation for Nuclear Energy was $557.6 million, including $10 million for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative. The Department of Energy supports nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy source, but critics argue it provides wasteful subsidies. President Bush mentioned \"safe, clean nuclear energy\" in 2005, showing interest in new commercial reactors. The DOE's efforts to restart the nuclear construction pipeline are focused on the Nuclear Power 2010 Program, which provides assistance for advanced versions of existing commercial nuclear plants. The program is helping utilities seek NRC approval for potential nuclear reactor sites in Illinois, Mississippi, and Virginia. Additionally, industry consortia have applied for funding to design and license new nuclear power plants. The FY2006 budget request included a 12.9% boost for the program. The FY2006 budget request for the Nuclear Power 2010 program included a $56.0 million budget, with the House approving $46.0 million and the Senate bill proposing $76.0 million. The conference agreement settled on $66.0 million. The program aims to test the \"one step\" licensing process for nuclear license applications. The DOE's Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative focuses on advanced commercial reactor technologies not yet ready for deployment. Loan guarantees and tax credits to encourage new reactor construction are included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The DOE's Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative focuses on advanced reactor designs for potential commercial use by 2020-2030, with a budget of $55 million allocated in FY2006. The program includes six advanced designs, some of which may use plutonium recovered from spent nuclear fuel. Plutonium recovery is seen as a way to reduce environmental impact and increase domestic energy supplies, although there are concerns about the separation process. The Generation IV program focuses on advanced reactor designs for commercial use by 2020-2030, with a budget of $55 million in FY2006. Plutonium recovery from spent fuel is considered to reduce environmental impact and increase energy supplies. However, opponents raise concerns about environmental risks and nuclear weapons proliferation. The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative aims to develop technologies for reusing plutonium, uranium, and other radioactive materials from spent fuel in nuclear reactors or particle accelerators. The House and Senate added funding to accelerate the development of separations technology for spent nuclear fuel recycling. The AFCI budget received $80 million, including $10 million for an engineering-scale demonstration project. DOE is required to submit a spent nuclear fuel recycling technology plan by March 1. The DOE requested $20.0 million in FY2006 for the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative to develop hydrogen-fueled vehicles. The House approved the same amount, while the Senate recommended $30.0 million. The conferees approved $25.0 million. An advanced reactor, the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP), received $25.0 million for co-production of hydrogen and electricity. The Senate bill allocated $40 million from the FY2006 Generation IV program for the NGNP program, with a design competition urged to be completed by the end of FY2006. DOE did not request new funding for the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) or the Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization program (NEPO) in FY2006. The Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) and Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization program (NEPO) received $2.5 million in FY2005 for cost-shared research to improve productivity of existing nuclear plants. The House agreed to eliminate funding for both programs, while the Senate bill did not provide separate funding but allocated specific funding for NERI projects within other nuclear energy programs. The Bush Administration's FY2006 budget request for fossil energy research was 14.1% less than FY2005 and 25.4% less than FY2004, with major funding categories including Coal and Other Power Systems, Natural Gas Technologies, Oil Technology, and Program Direction and Management Support. The conference agreement supported funding Fossil Energy programs at $598 million, 4.5% greater than FY2005 and 22% more than the Administration's request. Funding was higher in all major categories: Coal and Other Power systems, Natural Gas Technologies, Oil Technology, and Program Direction and Management Support. DOE proposed to terminate the Natural Gas and Oil Technology programs based on a review rating them ineffective. Congressional support for these programs has been higher than the Administration's request in previous years. The House directed the Administration to report on a strategic plan for natural gas and petroleum technology programs, supporting continued funding for Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) at $68 million. CCPI is a cost-shared program to demonstrate emerging coal-based power generation technologies. Over $400 million has been appropriated since FY2002 for CCPI, similar to the Clean Coal Technology Program (CCTP) from the late 1980s. The Clean Coal Technology Program (CCTP) began in the late 1980s and has faced rescissions and deferrals since the mid-1990s. The program is to be phased out, with the Administration requesting to rescind $257 million from the unused balance for FutureGen activities. The conference agreement supports deferring the funds for FutureGen program in fiscal years 2007 and beyond, while acknowledging the shortfall in funding for CCPI. The Senate version proposed $100 million for CCPI Programs in FY2006, falling short of the $200 million annual commitment. The Administration aimed to increase Coal R&D by 5.9% to $218 million, with a focus on gasification research. The conference funded Coal R&D at $250 million, showing a commitment to IGCC technology for emissions reduction and plant efficiency improvements. Funding for DOE's Carbon Sequestration program is set to increase significantly, with the Senate bill supporting it at $74 million in FY2006. The House proposed $50 million, while the Administration requested $67 million. The Senate bill also included funding for Plant and Equipment and Congressionally Directed Projects, with the conference agreement supporting $20 million for Plant and Equipment. The House Appropriations Committee expressed disappointment with the Administration's funding emphasis in its report on the FY2005 bill. The Committee criticized the Administration's focus on funding new energy research like FutureGen over ongoing programs that could provide energy savings. They recommended restoring proposed reductions for fossil energy technology research, arguing it would be fiscally irresponsible to halt research prematurely. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, established in 1975, stores roughly 685 million barrels of crude oil in caverns in Louisiana and Texas for emergency use. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) was established during the Clinton Administration to house 2 million barrels of home heating oil. President Bush ordered the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to be filled to capacity using royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil, which began in 2002 and ended in 2005 when the SPR reached 700 million barrels. The oil filling program for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) began in 2002 and ended in 2005 when the SPR reached 700 million barrels. Some policymakers objected to the use of RIK oil, arguing it should have been released to tight markets. The program costs are mainly for maintaining SPR facilities. Congress approved $174.6 million for the program in FY2005, with a reduction to $166.0 million requested for FY2006. The House and Senate bills funded the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) at the requested level of $5.3 million, adopted by the conferees in their final bill. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas, with DOE being a significant federal funder of basic research. For FY2006, DOE requested $3.463 billion for Science, with the final bill providing $3.633 billion, an increase of 1% from the previous year. The final funding for the DOE Office of Science for FY2006 was $3.633 billion, which was $170 million more than the request and a 1% increase from FY2005. The largest program, basic energy sciences, received $1.146 billion, a 4% increase from the previous year. Construction of the Spallation Neutron Source was nearing completion, with operations funding included for the first time. Concerns were raised about reduced grant funding for other research due to operations funding for new facilities. The House and Senate provided increases above the request, but the final bill matched the requested amount. The FY2006 budget for fusion energy sciences included $50 million for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), with the total U.S. share estimated to be $1.1 billion through FY2013. The international partners were split on ITER's location, but a site in France was agreed upon in June 2005. The House provided a $6 million increase in funding. The House increased funding for fusion energy sciences by $6 million and directed $29 million towards U.S.-based fusion research. They insisted on funding ITER without reducing the domestic program and threatened to cut U.S. funding if not done. The Senate reduced ITER funding by $28 million for increased facility operating time. The conference agreement provided the requested amount for fusion energy sciences. The House increased funding for fusion energy sciences by $6 million and directed $29 million towards U.S.-based fusion research. The requested amount included language similar to that of the House report regarding funding ITER out of additional resources and called for a study of the program by the Government Accountability Office. Representative Boehlert threatened to kill the ITER project if the domestic fusion program was not scaled back to pay for ITER. Other Office of Science programs were reduced in the FY2006 request, with decreases in high-energy physics, biological and environmental research, nuclear physics, and advanced scientific computing research. The House and Senate increased funding for various science research projects in FY2006, including high-energy physics, biological and environmental research, nuclear physics, and advanced scientific computing research. The House restored funding levels for high-energy physics and nuclear physics, while the Senate increased funding for facility operating time and the Genomes to Life program. The conference agreement supported the requested amount for advanced scientific computing research. The FY2006 appropriations provided $724 million for high-energy physics, $586 million for biological and environmental research, $371 million for nuclear physics, and $237 million for advanced scientific computing research. The budget request included a reduction in operating hours for some facilities due to funding limitations, with only 28,800 hours scheduled out of 32,200 available for basic energy sciences program facilities. The budget request for FY2006 included reduced operating hours for various science programs. The Tevatron complex and nuclear physics facilities had fewer scheduled hours than their optimal capacity. The House increased funding for basic energy sciences, fusion energy sciences, and nuclear physics to maintain operating time at FY2005 levels. The Senate bill allocated $100 million to restore operating time to optimal levels. The Senate bill allocated $100 million to restore operating time to optimal levels in various science programs, including basic energy sciences, fusion energy sciences, nuclear physics, and high-energy physics. The Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management is responsible for developing a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. OCRWM's total budget request for FY2006 was $651.4 million, with funding coming from the Nuclear Waste Fund and Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal account. The FY2006 budget request for the Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) was $651.4 million, which was 14% higher than FY2005. However, the opening of the Yucca Mountain repository was delayed by at least two years, leading to a $10 million increase in funding for waste program activities. The House Appropriations Committee identified potential interim storage sites for nuclear waste, including Hanford, WA; Idaho National Laboratory; and Savannah River, SC. Members from these states raised concerns about the report language. The House Appropriations Committee identified potential interim storage sites for nuclear waste, including Hanford, WA; Idaho National Laboratory; and Savannah River, SC. Representative Hobson assured that the report language would not affect a DOE agreement with Idaho. The Senate bill provided $577 million for Nuclear Waste Disposal and Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal. The Senate panel's report did not mention interim storage of spent fuel, and Senators criticized the House report language during committee markup. The conference agreement provides $500 million for nuclear waste disposal, with $150 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund and $350 million from the Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal Account. $50 million is allocated for DOE to develop a spent nuclear fuel recycling plan. A detailed program plan is due by March 31, 2006, and a site selection competition for a reprocessing facility is to start by June 30, 2006. The competition is open to various federal and nonfederal sites on a voluntary basis. Construction of the reprocessing site is set to begin in FY2010. The conference report allows applicants for a reprocessing facility to receive up to $5 million per site, totaling $20 million for detailed proposals. The Administration's budget request for FY2005 assumed funding offset by waste fees, but Congress did not approve, leading to a lower net appropriation request of $131 million. For FY2006, the Administration proposed offsetting nuclear waste funding with fees again, but the budget request included full funding through appropriations. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 designated Yucca Mountain as the national geologic repository site. Despite delays, the Department of Energy (DOE) failed to meet the 1998 disposal deadline, leading to court decisions in favor of utilities seeking compensation for damages. Exelon Corporation, the largest nuclear utility, was involved in legal battles over the missed deadline. Exelon Corporation, the nation's largest nuclear utility, settled a breach-of-contract with the federal government in August 2004 for a potential $600 million if DOE doesn't take spent fuel by 2015. Yucca Mountain program delays were caused by a court decision in July 2004, challenging EPA's regulations. Controversy arose in March 2005 over potential data fabrication by Yucca Mountain scientists, leading to calls for a DOE interim storage program. The Stockpile Stewardship Program was established by Congress to maintain the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. It is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration and consists of Directed Stockpile Work, Campaigns, and Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities. The National Nuclear Security Administration manages programs related to nuclear weapons stewardship, including Directed Stockpile Work, Campaigns, and Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities. The agency oversees activities at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes laboratories and production sites. The FY2006 budget request includes data from the Future Years Nuclear Security Program, projecting budget components through FY2010. The FY2006 Directed Stockpile Work (DSW) program involves direct work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including monitoring, maintenance, R&D, and dismantlement. The program supports life extension programs for three nuclear warheads and funds surveillance and maintenance for nine warhead types. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act reduced DSW funding and eliminated requests for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator and the Advanced Concepts Initiative. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RNEP) is a program that aims to modify existing nuclear bombs to penetrate the ground before detonating, enhancing their impact on buried targets. Supporters argue it is necessary to target deeply buried facilities in hostile countries, while critics fear it could lower the threshold for nuclear weapon use. The FY2005 NNSA request projected $484.7 million for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RNEP) program for FY2005-FY2009, causing congressional concern. The cost projection was based on experience with other programs, and moving beyond the study stage would require an Administration decision and congressional approval. For FY2006, NNSA requests $4.0 million for the RNEP study, with another $14.0 million projected for FY2007. The NNSA requested $4.0 million for the RNEP study, with an additional $14.0 million projected for FY2007. The Department of Defense budget included $4.5 million for RNEP in FY2006. The Energy and Water bill did not address DOD's RNEP request. H.R. 2419 passed by the House deleted all NNSA funds for RNEP. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $4.0 million for RNEP. The Senate rejected an amendment to delete all RNEP funds from the Energy and Water bill. NNSA dropped its request for RNEP funding in late October, resulting in no funds provided for the program in the conference report. The Administration requested funds for the ACI program in FY2005, but it was not provided in the omnibus bill. Instead, funds were allocated for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program. The Administration did not request funds for ACI in FY2006, focusing on the RRW program to improve existing weapons. The FY2007-FY2010 budget projections for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program were $14.8 million, $14.4 million, $29.6 million, and $29.0 million respectively. The House and Senate passed bills allocating $25.0 million and $25.4 million for RRW, with the final conference bill providing $25.0 million. Despite being a small part of the NNSA budget, RRW is seen as enabling significant advancements according to the House Appropriations Committee. The House Appropriations Committee views the NNSA budget as enabling significant advancements in transitioning the nuclear weapons complex to a more efficient modern complex, phasing out redundant Cold War warhead designs, increasing warhead reliability, and supporting other budget decisions. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends funding increase for RRW to accelerate planning and design for a comprehensive strategy. The conference report emphasizes the development and design of a comprehensive RRW strategy to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons and components. Goals include staying within military requirements and design parameters, improving manufacturing practices, reducing costs, and increasing performance margins to support a reduction in stockpile size. Additionally, the bill includes a Sustainable Stockpile Initiative with an RRW implementation plan, nuclear weapons complex reconfiguration, consolidation of fissile material, and increased funding for warhead dismantlement. The Senate bill provides $15.0 million for dismantlement, while the conference bill provides $60.0 million for dismantlement under DSW. The FY2006 budget includes six campaigns with various components, such as Science, Engineering, Inertial Confinement Fusion, Advanced Simulation and Computing, Pit Manufacturing, and Readiness. Conferees expressed concern over a delay in achieving ignition with the National Ignition Facility by 2014 and directed studies on this issue. They also focused on the Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign. The Pit Manufacturing and Certification Campaign received $130.9 million from Congress for W88 pit manufacturing, with funds reduced for the Modern Pit Facility. NNSA requested $2,080.4 million for Campaigns in FY2006, with goals including improving warhead performance assessment and maintaining nuclear weapons laboratories' scientific infrastructure. The conference bill contains $2,144.6 million for nuclear weapons laboratories. H.R. 2419 eliminates MPF funds until capacity requirements and long-term strategy are determined. Conferees directed NNSA to focus on improving manufacturing capability at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The test readiness posture has been controversial. The controversial issue of test readiness posture was addressed in FY2004 and FY2006 budget requests, with differing opinions on the timeframe for achieving an 18-month readiness posture. The House reduced Test Readiness funding from $25.0 million to $15.0 million, while the Senate provided $25.0 million. The committee opposes the 18-month readiness posture and added RRW to its rationale for that position. The Senate provided $25.0 million for test readiness, while the conference bill reduced it to $20.0 million and increased funds for subcritical experiments by $5.0 million. The Engineering Campaign includes the Enhanced Surveillance Program seeking predictive capabilities for stockpile aging concerns. Congress is interested in experiments to determine the service life of pits based on plutonium aging characteristics. The House and Senate bills differ in funding for the Enhanced Surveillance Program (ESP), with the House allocating $76.0 million and the Senate providing $111.2 million. The conference bill settles at $100.2 million for ESP. The Inertial Confinement Fusion and High Yield Campaign aims to create extreme conditions for weapons-related research, with a focus on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. NNSA requests $141.9 million for NIF construction in FY2006. The NNSA requests $141.9 million for NIF construction in FY2006. The Senate Appropriations Committee directs no funds be spent on NIF construction to focus on a comprehensive stewardship program. The FY2005 omnibus bill provided $1,657.1 million for RTBF, with $1,474.5 million requested. RTBF has six subprograms, including Operations of Facilities and Program Readiness. The FY2005 omnibus bill provided $1,657.1 million for RTBF, with $1,474.5 million requested. RTBF includes activities at multiple sites and Material Recycle and Recovery. Construction funding for RTBF was $275.1 million in FY2005, with a request of $243.0 million for FY2006. H.R. 2419 reduced RTBF to $1,610.9 million and increased Operations of Facilities by $44.0 million. $55.0 million for a Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement at Los Alamos was eliminated. Alamos to delay construction until DOE determines long-term plan for developing infrastructure to maintain nuclear stockpile and support RRW initiative. Senate bill provides $1,696.3 million for RTBF, with $39.7 million increase in Operations of Facilities. $65.0 million for CMRR. Conference bill provides $1,647.9 million for RTBF, including $55.0 million for CMRR. Weapons Activities include DSW, Campaigns, and RTBF. Secure Transportation Asset for safe transport of nuclear weapons, components, and materials. FY2005 appropriation was $199.7 million, FY2006 request is $212.1 million. House bill H.R. 2419 also addresses these funding allocations. The FY2005 appropriation for Nuclear Weapons Incident Response was $98.4 million, with a FY2006 request of $118.8 million. H.R. 2419 provides the requested amount. Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program addresses deferred maintenance and infrastructure improvements for the nuclear weapons complex. The FY2005 appropriation was $313.7 million, with a FY2006 request of $283.5 million. H.R. 2419 provides $250.5 million for this program. The conference bill provides $150.9 million for Safeguards and Security, which includes funds for physical and cyber security to protect NNSA personnel and assets from terrorist threats. Administrator Linton Brooks highlighted the increased security concerns, stating the need for denying access to warheads to prevent terrorist attacks. The FY2005 appropriation for security costs at nuclear weapons sites was $751.6 million, with the FY2006 request at $740.5 million. The House passed bill provided $825.5 million, the Senate bill matched the request, and the conference bill allocated $805.5 million. DOE's nonproliferation and national security programs under NNSA aim to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons globally. Funding for these programs was $1.422 billion in FY2005, with a request of $1.637 billion for FY2006. The House bill allocated $1.501 billion, the Senate version proposed $1.729 billion, and the final appropriation was $1.631 billion under P.L. 109-103. In May 2004, DOE consolidated programs aimed at repatriating fresh and spent fuel containing highly enriched uranium (HEU) into the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI). Funding for GTRI in FY2005 was $93.8 million, with a request of $98.0 million for FY2006. The program was targeted for completion by 2010 and funded at about $450 million. Funding for GTRI in P.L. 109-103 was $98.0 million. The Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program received varying levels of funding in different bills, with the final appropriation at $327.0 million. Nonproliferation and International Security programs also received funding, with the final bill appropriating $75.0 million. Funding for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) came from these programs. The President's request for Protection, Control and Accounting (MPC&A) was $343.4 million, compared to $294.7 million in FY2005. H.R. 2419 included $428.4 million, while the Senate bill allocated $343.4 million. P.L. 109-103 funded MPC&A at $422.0 million. The Russian Transition Initiative aimed to provide nonweapons employment for nuclear scientists from the former Soviet Union, with $40.7 million in FY2005 and $37.9 million requested for FY2006 under the renamed program \"Global Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention.\" The House Appropriations Committee disagreed with renaming the program \"Global Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention\" and reduced funding to $30.3 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the name change, increased funding to $50.9 million, and encouraged expanding the program beyond the former Soviet Union. The conference bill allocated $40.0 million for the program. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aimed to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors, with requested funding for FY2006 at $653.1 million. The House Appropriations Committee cut funding for the Savannah River facility for converting plutonium to reactor fuel, citing delays in agreement with Russia. Total funding for fissile materials disposition in H.R. 2419 was $301.7 million, while the Senate version would have funded it at $653.1 million. P.L. 109-103 appropriated $473.5 million for the program. The Environmental Management program, the largest function within DOE, manages radioactive and hazardous wastes at former nuclear weapons sites and sites of civilian nuclear energy research. The DOE's Environmental Management program is the largest waste management and cleanup program in the federal government, with an annual budget of around $7 billion. Funding for cleanup at Department of Defense sites is less than $2 billion, and for the EPA's Superfund program is around $1.25 billion. The conference agreement on H.R. 2419 provides $6.66 billion in FY2006 for the program, which is $627 million less than FY2005 but $151 million more than the Administration's request. The conference agreement provides $6.66 billion in FY2006 for the DOE's Environmental Management program, with funding allocated to Defense and Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup accounts, as well as the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. The total appropriation is $7.11 billion, offset by $451 million, resulting in a net program appropriation of $6.66 billion. The agreement merges certain accounts to form new defense and non-defense accounts. The conference agreement merges accounts for Defense Site Acceleration Completion and Defense Environmental Services into one Defense Environmental Cleanup account, and Non-Defense Site Acceleration Completion and Non-Defense Environmental Services into one Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup account. This consolidation provides a single source of funding for cleanup at former nuclear weapons sites and civilian nuclear energy research sites. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund continues to support cleanup of uranium enrichment plants and processing sites. The Administration's funding request for FY2006 did not propose accounting changes. A $627 million reduction in funding for cleanup at major sites, including Savannah River, Idaho National Laboratory, and Hanford. Funding decline for sites closing in 2006 due to completion of cleanup at Rocky Flats. Reduction at Savannah River site attributed to unresolved seismic issues delaying construction of a waste processing facility. The conference report addresses construction delays at the Hanford site for the Waste Treatment Plant, which is meant to vitrify high-level radioactive waste for permanent storage. The report notes a $20 million reduction in project balances due to these delays and emphasizes the need for better control and oversight of the project by the Department of Energy. The conferees expressed concern about DOE's management failures in the Hanford project and directed them to report on actions taken to rectify the issues. They also highlighted the contamination of groundwater at Hanford exceeding federal drinking water standards, posing a risk to human health and the environment. The conferees allocated $10 million to assess groundwater contamination into the Columbia River and implement new technologies for water quality protection. They rejected DOE's proposal to transfer sites to NNSA but increased funding to support existing responsibilities. Funding for waste disposal at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Y-12 site was not included in the agreement. The disposal of waste at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Y-12 site is funded separately by the NNSA. There are ongoing issues with DOE's Environmental Management program, including cleaning up environmental contamination and managing radioactive and hazardous wastes at 114 sites. Congress has appropriated funds for these efforts. DOE has completed actions at 76 sites by FY2003, with approximately $70 billion allocated for cleanup since FY1989. Cleanup is expected at 10 more sites by FY2006, totaling 86 sites. The most contaminated sites are projected for cleanup by 2035, with an estimated cost of $95 billion through 2035, reduced due to cleanup reform initiatives launched in FY2003. DOE launched a cleanup reform initiative in FY2003 to accelerate cleanup at major sites. Performance Management Plans were prepared to reduce costs and establish baselines for waste disposal and remedial actions. Goals of faster and less costly cleanup are being achieved through competitive contracts, innovative technologies, and coordination with stakeholders and regulators. DOE's planned acceleration of cleanup aims to reduce costs and time frames, but actual outcomes may vary due to factors like regulatory approval and long-term environmental protection concerns. Questions have been raised about achieving faster and cheaper cleanup without compromising environmental safeguards, with concerns that leaving more contamination on site could lead to unforeseen migration and exposure risks over time. The conferees are interested in DOE's cleanup acceleration efforts and whether they are meeting cleanup goals at sites scheduled for completion by 2006, 2012, and 2035. They requested DOE to submit a \"milestone\" report twice a year to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees by March 1 and September 1 of each year. Milestones are individual cleanup actions to be completed by a specific date to fulfill regulatory requirements. The conferees requested a new report to track accelerated cleanup milestones at sites, estimate funding needs, and total costs. Members expressed concerns about cleanup progress and encouraged DOE to keep sites on track. The conferees requested a new report to track accelerated cleanup milestones at sites, estimate funding needs, and total costs. While DOE has made efforts to accelerate cleanup at sites like Rocky Flats, improvements are needed to increase the pace and lower costs at sites like Hanford. One controversial issue is how to dispose of radioactive and chemical wastes stored in underground tanks at Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Laboratory. DOE requested $350 million for a \"High-Level Waste Proposal\" account in FY2005 to prepare for the classification and treatment of tank wastes. The Department of Energy proposed leaving some waste in storage tanks and disposing of it as low-level waste by mixing it with a cement-like \"grout.\" This proposal faced opposition from various groups concerned about the safety and environmental risks of leaving waste in place. Some argued that removing all waste would be technically difficult and provide limited environmental benefits. The 108th Congress authorized the Department of Energy to classify some tank wastes at certain sites as non-high-level waste and dispose of them by grouting in place. However, this authority did not extend to Washington State's Hanford site, where most of the tank waste is located. Congress did not allocate a separate account for DOE's High-Level Waste Proposal in FY2005. In FY2005, Congress appropriated $292 million for reclassifying and treating tank wastes at Savannah River and Idaho National Laboratory. No funding was allocated for tank waste reclassification at Hanford. The Administration's FY2006 request did not include a line-item for a High-Level Waste Proposal account. DOE planned to close one tank at Idaho National Laboratory in FY2006, but the funding amount was unspecified. The FY2006 request did not specify funding for closing a tank or reclassifying waste. $45 million was provided for construction projects at Idaho National Laboratory and Savannah River site, including $9.2 million for project engineering and design for the Sodium Bearing Waste Treatment Facility. The conference agreement provides funding for various projects, including $35.3 million for project engineering and design for the Salt Waste Processing Facility at the Savannah River site. The funding for the DOE's Office of Legacy Management is almost $79 million, with $45 million allocated to former defense sites and $34 million to nondefense sites. The reduction in funding for construction of the Salt Waste Processing Facility is due to unresolved seismic issues. The Office of Legacy Management, funded by Congress in FY2004, monitors and maintains remedial actions post-cleanup, ensures environmental protection, and manages pensions for former contractor personnel. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations were established in response to dam construction projects. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to market excess power generated by federal water projects. PMAs prioritize \"preference customers\" such as municipal utilities and co-ops, selling power at low rates to cover expenses and repay debt. There was a proposal in FY2006 to raise PMA rates to market rates, but it was rejected by the House. The FY2006 Administration requested a sharp reduction in funding for the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs), with significant cuts for WAPA and Southwestern. Southeastern's budget would be eliminated altogether. The proposal to allow PMAs to credit a portion of their revenues to offset expenses was rejected by both the House and Senate. The House and Senate rejected the FY2006 Administration's proposal to reduce funding for Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs). The House-passed bill included $265.5 million for PMAs, while the Senate bill included $279.2 million. P.L. 109-103 appropriated $272.5 million for PMAs, with specific allocations for SEPA, SWPA, WAPA, Falcon, and Amisted. BPA does not receive an annual appropriation but funds some activities through permanent borrowing. BPA's borrowing authority was increased to $4.45 billion in FY2003, with $487 million intended for use in FY2006. The conference report prohibits further funding for the Fish Passage Center, transferring its functions to other entities. Other agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Appalachian Regional Commission. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $701.7 million for FY2006, including $8.3 million for the inspector general's office. The enacted bill provides $742.7 million, 11.7% above FY2005. Activities include safety regulation, licensing of nuclear reactors and waste facilities. The House approved a $21 million increase for spent fuel security at reactor sites due to risks identified by the National Academy of Sciences. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed to provide an additional $20 million for licensing new nuclear power plants, bringing the total budget for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to $742.7 million. NRC's FY2006 budget request included $61.0 million for homeland security activities, a 2% increase over FY2005, with a focus on enhancing security measures at nuclear plants in response to increased threats. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $69.1 million to review a DOE license application for a national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The budget also included safety testing of full-scale casks for transporting nuclear waste. Due to funding cuts for the DOE repository program, NRC's licensing request was reduced to $46.1 million. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended a requirement that 90% of NRC's budget be offset by fees on licensees, with exceptions for specific funding purposes. The FY2006 budget included $2 million for DOE defense waste oversight and a net appropriation of $118.0 million. Funding for the Denali Commission was sharply reduced, with the House bill not funding it at all. The Senate bill would have appropriated $67 million, but P.L. 109-103 allocated $50 million.
