The unwinding of yen carry trade positions and turmoil in the subprime mortgage market have contributed to the yen's rise. The Bank for International Settlements warned against betting against the yen, citing similarities to 1998 when it soared suddenly. The dollar's rapid depreciation is causing changes in trading relationships between the United States and other nations. Japan's currency has appreciated by 20% relative to the dollar, leading to concerns that Japan may intervene in currency markets to support the dollar's value. Japan holds $979 billion in foreign currency reserves, earning $12 billion per month in interest. Past interventions to prevent yen revaluation have raised accusations of exchange rate manipulation for trade advantage. Japan has been accused of manipulating its exchange rate to gain an unfair advantage in world trade, similar to charges against China. This report analyzes Japan's official intervention in currency markets, reviews studies on the effects of intervention, and examines allegations of exchange rate manipulation as defined by the IMF. Foreign governments intervene by buying or selling foreign exchange to support their currency value. Japan frequently buys dollars from its exporters. In Japan's case, it frequently buys dollars from its exporters in exchange for yen and uses them to purchase U.S. Treasury securities or other liquid dollar assets. Legislation such as H.R. 2886/S. 1021 (Japan Currency Manipulation Act) and H.R. 782/S. 796 (Fair Currency Act of 2007) address concerns about Japan's exchange rate providing unfair advantages to its exporters. S. 1607 (Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2007) aims to identify fundamentally misaligned currencies and address currency manipulation. The Currency Reform and Financial Markets Access Act of 2007 requires the Treasury Department to identify countries manipulating their currencies and take action to end the manipulation. Concerns over currency manipulation stem from the impact on the U.S. trade deficit, dependency on foreign investors, interest rates, and competitiveness of U.S. businesses. The Bank of Japan frequently buys dollars to purchase U.S. Treasury securities, raising concerns addressed by legislation like the Japan Currency Manipulation Act and Fair Currency Act of 2007. The Bank of Japan has bought U.S. Treasury securities and other liquid dollar assets to prevent the yen from appreciating too quickly, maintaining the competitiveness of Japanese exports. Concerns over an undervalued yen giving Japanese manufacturers a price advantage over U.S. competitors, particularly in the automobile industry, have been raised. The yen's value reached a 20-year low in May 2007 but has since appreciated. Currency intervention by the Japanese government has had little long-term effect on exchange rates. In recent years, there is debate over whether Japan has manipulated its exchange rate, with some claiming manipulation has occurred despite Japan's denial of intervention since March 2004. Pressure from Japanese industries, like Toyota Motors, is increasing as every 1 yen appreciation against the dollar results in a $350 million drop in operating profit. Japanese carmakers believe the ideal exchange rate is 90 to 100 yen per dollar, with yen appreciation leading to a decline in Japanese stocks. The government of Japan is hesitant to intervene unless the rate falls below 85 to 90 yen per dollar. Despite concerns, government officials are closely monitoring foreign exchange movements. Intervening in today's markets is challenging due to the significant increase in daily trading volume, reaching $5.6 trillion in both traditional and over-the-counter foreign exchange markets. The foreign exchange derivatives market trades $5.6 trillion per day, with 86% in dollars. Japan, the US, EU, and possibly China would need to coordinate any intervention. The yen appreciated after the US dollar link to gold was severed in 1971. The yen/dollar exchange rate was 360 yen per dollar for 22 years, but fluctuated to around 105 yen per dollar in 2005, then to 120 yen per dollar in late 2005, and around 119 yen per dollar in March 2007. Japan's government intervenes in currency markets by buying dollars or other foreign exchange. Japan has intervened in currency markets by buying or selling dollars to counter rapid appreciation or depreciation of the yen. This intervention has increased Japan's foreign exchange reserves to $902 billion by July 31, 2007. Significant interventions occurred in 1976-1978, 1985-1988, 1992-1996, and 1998-2004. Since March 2004, Japan has not significantly intervened to support the dollar's value. Despite heavy buying or selling of dollars, interventions have had little lasting effect on the yen's value. Japan's intervention in currency markets to counter rapid appreciation or depreciation of the yen has had little lasting effect. Referred to as \"leaning against the wind,\" the interventions aimed to oppose short-term trends rather than reverse the direction of change. Despite significant interventions, Japan's efforts only resulted in smoothing fluctuations in exchange rates rather than changing the movement's direction. Observers note that Japan's investments in buying dollar assets as foreign exchange reserves are small compared to the daily turnover in traditional foreign exchange and derivatives markets. Central government interventions in currency markets have a significant impact on global demand and supply. Government purchases and sales can influence market participants to adjust their speculative buying. Central banks often coordinate interventions to amplify their effects, increasing exchange rate volatility. Academic studies generally conclude that interventions do move the market and serve as a good indicator of market direction. Central government interventions in currency markets have a significant impact on global demand and supply, influencing market participants to adjust their speculative buying. Academic studies confirm that interventions increase exchange rate volatility and serve as a good indicator of market direction. Studies also show that large, infrequent interventions have a higher likelihood of success than small, frequent interventions. Studies have shown that central government interventions in currency markets impact global demand and supply, increasing exchange rate volatility. Large-scale coordinated interventions between the Bank of Japan and the U.S. Federal Reserve have been successful in moving the yen in line with policy goals, although the effects are short-lived. U.S. automakers emphasize that the yen was undervalued by 10% to 20%. In 2003, General Motors claimed that the yen should be trading at about 100, rather than at 110 yen per dollar, emphasizing that it was undervalued by 10% to 20%. The relatively weak yen (111 per dollar at the time) was providing a significant cost advantage to Japanese automakers, with GM estimating it to be about $3,000 per vehicle. General Motors also raised concerns about verbal currency intervention by high-ranking Japanese officials and indicated a gap between the auto industry and President Bush on foreign exchange issues. Japanese competitors have a $3,000 to $9,000 cost advantage per vehicle over U.S. auto makers due to an unfair currency advantage. The Automotive Trade Policy Council claimed Japan's weak yen policy forced U.S. automakers to deal with a $4,000 subsidy on vehicles exported to the U.S. Proponent Ernest Preeg believes Japan manipulated its exchange rate, estimating the yen was 20% undervalued in 2002. The International Monetary Fund also conducts similar analyses. The International Monetary Fund conducts surveillance over member countries' exchange rates. In a report on Japan, the IMF noted Japan's active use of foreign exchange market intervention. The Bank of Japan intervened on 340 days since 1991, compared to the European Central Bank on four days and the U.S. Federal Reserve on 22 days. There is evidence that intervention impacted yen movements, with an average intervention of \u00a52.5 trillion moving the exchange rate by \u00a51 per dollar. The IMF's 2006 report on Japan did not discuss exchange rate intervention. The effectiveness of official intervention in foreign exchange markets is difficult to estimate due to the complexity of exchange rate dynamics. A 2007 U.S. Treasury paper reviewed exchange rate models and concluded that determining currency misalignments requires estimating the ideal exchange rate. Various models produce divergent results, making it challenging to assess the impact of intervention on exchange rates. The study discusses the challenges in estimating currency misalignments due to the complexity of exchange rate dynamics. Different models show varying results in determining the ideal exchange rate for Japan's currency, with estimates ranging from overvalued to undervalued by different percentages. Private sector estimates also differ widely, with HSBC and Goldman Sachs providing contrasting views on the yen's valuation. At the end of 2005, estimates varied on the valuation of the yen, with different institutions reporting overvaluation or undervaluation. In 2007, Morgan Stanley's models suggested the yen was between 18% overvalued and 29% undervalued. Japan's trade surplus has prevented market forces from appreciating the yen, potentially eliminating the surplus. Japan's cumulative surplus on the current account totaled $2,077 billion, offset by a deficit in capital flows of $1,314 billion from 1977 to 2004. Official currency intervention accounted for a net buying of $763 billion in dollars, which helped offset the country's surplus in trade. Japan's intervention in currency markets helped offset the country's trade surplus. Estimates suggest that the intervention moved the exchange rate by \u00a53 to \u00a520 per dollar, with the likelihood leaning towards the lower end. The impact of the intervention on the yen-dollar exchange rate and its effect on imports and exports are subjects of debate. Japan's intervention in currency markets involves buying dollars and selling yen to lower the yen's value, benefiting exporters by allowing them to lower export prices or increase profits. This can lead to a trade surplus and higher growth rate. The Bank of Japan may sterilize the operation by selling Japanese bonds to keep the money supply constant. However, actual market operations often deviate from economic theory. The long-term link between intervention and foreign exchange rates is difficult to show empirically. Short-term effects are evident, but long-term effects on exchange rates and trade flows are less apparent. Japan's exporters do not typically adjust prices in response to exchange rate fluctuations, as they sell brand-named products with control over prices in the U.S. market. Japanese exporters tend to absorb exchange rate changes into their costs, rather than adjusting prices for their products. For example, despite a 34% appreciation of the Japanese yen against the dollar, the prices of exported products to the United States did not rise significantly. This strategy allows companies like Toyota Motors to increase profits when the currency depreciates. In the United States, exchange rate changes have a moderate impact on prices, with a currency depreciation not necessarily reducing a nation's trade deficit significantly. However, in the long run, a real depreciation is likely to improve a nation's current account balance. In the short run, the J-curve effect occurs, where a rise in the value of the yen leads to higher prices for Japanese exporters, worsening the balance of trade temporarily. In the long run, a large appreciation of the yen can somewhat improve Japan's balance of trade. Studies have shown that a 1% yen appreciation could decrease Japan's current account surplus by about $2.4 billion. This decrease in surplus is due to Japanese exporters having to raise prices or reduce production costs, leading to a decrease in exports and an increase in imports. A 10% sustained appreciation of the yen would reduce Japan's trade surplus by 0.7% of GNP. From 2002 to 2004, the yen appreciated by 13%, but Japan's current account surplus increased from $113 billion to $172 billion. Yen appreciation may have slowed the rise in the surplus, but other factors like market growth, savings rates, and product competitiveness also played a role. Japan's economic growth is influenced by various factors such as market competitiveness, petroleum prices, and competition from China. Currency intervention in foreign exchange markets did not necessarily lead to faster growth rates, with periods of yen appreciation and intervention often resulting in slower growth. Despite some arguments that intervention may have prevented worse economic conditions, growth tended to be higher during periods without intervention. The U.S. policy questions whether Japan's currency intervention constitutes manipulation of exchange rates. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to analyze foreign countries' exchange rate policies annually and take action if manipulation is occurring with countries with global current account and bilateral trade surpluses with the U.S. The Secretary of the Treasury is mandated to negotiate with foreign countries to adjust their currency exchange rates to balance payments and eliminate unfair advantages. Reports on exchange rate policy are required, with findings of currency manipulation by China, Taiwan, and South Korea in the past. In Treasury reports, no currency manipulation was found, including by Japan, despite concerns about economic activities by China and Japan. Japanese deflation since 1998 led to a significant yen depreciation in real terms, with the yen at its weakest level in over 20 years. Bank of Japan data showed this trend, even though Japanese authorities had not intervened in the foreign exchange market since March 2004. The Treasury did not find Japan guilty of currency manipulation in 2003 and 2004. Japan's exchange rate interventions were seen as part of a macro-economic policy to combat deflation. Japan supported the G-7 position on exchange rates and worked with the US to promote greater exchange rate flexibility in China and East Asia. The IMF monitors exchange rates of member countries. The IMF monitors exchange rates of member countries and has guidelines to prevent manipulation for unfair advantage. Japan's active use of foreign exchange market intervention stands out compared to the US and Euro Area. The Treasury did not find Japan guilty of currency manipulation in 2003 and 2004, viewing interventions as part of macro-economic policy. The movement of exchange rates between the German mark, yen, and dollar is shown in Figure 5. From 1972 to 2005, the yen appreciated more than the mark, with a correlation coefficient of 0.82. The Euro replaced country currencies in 1993, and its index value replaced that of the German mark. The Euro index moved similarly to the yen, except during the U.S. recession in 2001. Most of the time, these currencies responded to the same outside influences. Japan's currency policies are a U.S. policy concern due to past interventions and the potential for future intervention. Japan may use methods like \"jawboning\" to influence currency traders and could be influenced by China's currency policies. While currently abstaining from active intervention, Japan may eventually decrease its dollar holdings, which would strengthen the yen. Japan's potential divestiture of dollar holdings could weaken the dollar and strengthen the yen, leading to possible intervention in foreign exchange markets. The threshold exchange rate for intervention by Japan is around 85 to 90 yen per dollar. This intervention may align with U.S. economic policy goals, raising questions about whether the U.S. should take measures to counter past Japanese interventions. The issue at hand is whether past interventions affected the exchange rate and if U.S. industries suffered negative impacts. Possible actions include letting the market adjust, defining currency manipulation, requiring reports and negotiations, certifying countries manipulating currencies, and convening with the IMF to address yen misalignment. Most economists argue that currency markets are too large for intervention to have lasting effects. Countries that do intervene often find it costly and ineffective. Allowing market forces to determine exchange rates is the preferred policy for major currencies. Japan's foreign exchange intervention policy differs from China in key aspects. Japan does not peg its exchange rate to a currency basket and allows free capital flows. This makes currency manipulation more difficult as speculators can offset official buying and selling of foreign assets. Maintaining a currency peg without capital controls is expensive and challenging during financial crises, as seen in the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. The Asian financial crisis in 1997 led Hong Kong to raise interest rates drastically to prevent capital flight, causing a collapse in real estate markets. China still maintains capital controls post-crisis, while Japan and other Asian nations have currency swap agreements to avoid relying solely on interest rates to attract foreign capital. Some intervention may be necessary to calm excessive volatility in markets or counter trends caused by herd mentality. Currency bills in Congress aim to clarify currency manipulation definitions, primarily targeting China but also mentioning Japan and South Korea. The Department of the Treasury, with the IMF, assesses if countries manipulate exchange rates for unfair trade advantages. The bills in Congress aim to define exchange-rate misalignment as undervaluation of a foreign currency due to large-scale intervention. Factors considered include bilateral trade surplus with the US, trade balance with other partners, foreign direct investment, and currency specifics. S. 1607 (Baucus) aims to define a currency for priority action based on factors like large-scale intervention, excessive reserve accumulation, and inconsistent capital flow restrictions. Trade data are also considered. The bills specify that trade data should be from the United States and other trading partners, with exceptions for China and Japan due to data accuracy issues. In 2004, Japan's reported trade surplus differed significantly between Japanese data and partner country data. The bills on currency manipulation focused on large-scale intervention in currency markets, with accumulations of foreign exchange not necessarily indicating manipulation. Japan's interventions were seen as part of a macroeconomic policy to combat deflation, leading to the conclusion that it did not meet the criteria for currency manipulation. The issue of sterilization in currency intervention was not addressed in the bills. The United States and Japan engage in regular meetings to discuss exchange rates and currency policies, including at G-7 summits and APEC meetings. In 2000, a G-7 meeting addressed developments in exchange and financial markets. The communique stated that the group discussed developments in exchange and financial markets, welcoming Japan's reaffirmation of appropriate exchange rate policies. Bills in the 110th Congress require reports on Japan's currency intervention and propose a joint US-EU plan to address yen misalignment. Consultations with Japan aim to reduce foreign exchange. In the 110th Congress, bills like H.R. 782 and S. 796 aim to address currency misalignment by making it actionable under U.S. countervailing duty laws. S. 1677 would require the Treasury Department to identify currency manipulators and submit action plans, with the authority to file cases in the WTO. These bills also require the Treasury Secretary to oppose changes in governance arrangements in International Financial Institutions. In the 110th Congress, bills like H.R. 782 and S. 796 aim to address currency misalignment by making it actionable under U.S. countervailing duty laws. S. 1677 (Dodd) and S. 1607 (Baucus) propose governance arrangements in International Financial Institutions to address currency manipulation cases through the World Trade Organization or the International Monetary Fund. The bills also involve informing the IMF of countries failing to adopt appropriate policies and restricting new financing by the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation and multilateral banks. The U.S. Trade Representative would request dispute settlement consultations at the WTO if a country fails to correct currency misalignment. An agreement between the IMF and WTO requires the WTO to refer exchange rate disputes to the IMF. If currency manipulation is found, it is unclear how a WTO panel would rule. The U.S. could inform the IMF of non-compliance triggering action. The IMF may believe Japan is not complying with Article IV, potentially leading to consultations and a report to the IMF's executive board. Legislation in the 110th Congress addresses Japan's currency manipulation, including bills like the Fair Currency Act of 2007 and the Japan Currency Manipulation Act. These bills aim to address exchange-rate misalignment of the Japanese yen with the US dollar. The Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2007 and the Currency Reform and Financial Markets Access Act of 2007 aim to address currency manipulation by requiring the Treasury Department to identify misaligned currencies and take corrective action, including factoring currency undervaluation in anti-dumping cases and filing cases in the WTO."
