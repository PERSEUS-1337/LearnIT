    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 87207 of the Government Code is amended to require reporting of income sources over $500 or $50 if a gift, with details on the amount ranges. The statement shall include details on consideration received, gift amount and date, travel destination for gifts, loan details, and pro rata share of income to a business entity. If a payment for travel must be reported, it can be done on a separate travel reimbursement schedule in the filer's economic interest statement. If not using the travel schedule, payments for travel should be disclosed as gifts unless the services provided were equal to or greater in value than the payments, in which case it can be reported as income. Section 87207 of the Government Code is amended to require reporting of income, including consideration received, gift details, travel destinations, loan information, and income share in a business entity. The economic interest statement requires disclosure of sources of income over $1,000 or gifts over $50, with a description of the business activity. Income amounts are categorized into different ranges, starting from $1,000 to over $500,000. The economic interest statement requires disclosure of income over $500,000, consideration received, details of gifts including amount and date received, and information on loans including interest rate and security provided. If reporting income from a business entity, details such as name, address, and business activity description must be included. The economic interest statement requires disclosure of income over $500,000, consideration received, details of gifts, and information on loans. A filer is not required to provide a detailed business activity description if the business entity is publicly traded. Payments received over $10,000 from individuals must be disclosed. Travel payments can be reported separately or as a gift unless services provided were of greater value. Payments, advances, or reimbursements for travel related to a legislative or governmental purpose are not limited by this chapter if certain conditions are met. Gifts of travel provided by government entities, educational institutions, nonprofits, or individuals outside the US meeting tax-exempt criteria are exempt from limits. Travel must be reported on the recipient's economic interests statement and excludes campaign-funded or contributed travel. Travel provided by certain officials or for business purposes is exempt from gift limits. This does not apply to travel permitted or limited by another law. Nonprofit organizations hosting travel for elected officials must disclose donors who contributed $1,000 or more and accompanied officials on trips exceeding $10,000 in a calendar year. Nonprofit organizations must disclose donors who contribute $1,000 or more for travel expenses of elected officials. If the organization regularly organizes and hosts travel for officials, expenses related to travel, study tours, conferences, and meetings must exceed one-third of total expenses. Nonprofits acting as intermediaries must identify donors as financial interests and report gifts as required by law. Nonprofit organizations must disclose donors contributing $1,000 or more for travel expenses of elected officials, subject to limitations on gifts. A nonprofit organization includes those exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) or Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 1.5 of the bill incorporates amendments to Section 87207 of the Government Code, contingent on the enactment of Assembly Bill 10. The bill creates new crimes or infractions, changes penalties, and aligns with the Political Reform Act of 1974."
