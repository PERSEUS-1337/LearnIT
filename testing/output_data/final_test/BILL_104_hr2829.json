The Congress findings include Chinese President Jiang Zemin's concern about religion as a threat to Communist Party rule, restrictions on worship and religious activities imposed by Premier Li Ping, and the Chinese Government's control over religious organizations to supplant independent religious associations. In July 1995, atheist Ye Xiaowen was appointed to head the Bureau of Religious Affairs in China, which controls all religious worship and activities through registration. The Chinese Government is concerned about the growth of Christianity, including Roman Catholic Church and evangelical \"house churches\". Imprisonment of Christians began after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. The Chinese Government imprisoned Christians who refused to give up their faith after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. They were charged as \"counter-revolutionaries\" and sentenced to 20 years or more in labor camps. Hundreds of Chinese Protestants and Catholics are currently imprisoned in \"reeducation through labor\" camps for their religious beliefs, run by the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Justice. The Chinese Communist Government also controls the appointment of Catholic Bishops and ordination of priests, refusing Vatican involvement. The Dalai Lama recognized a 6-year-old boy as the Eleventh Panchen Lama, but the boy and his family were taken by Chinese authorities to Beijing. The abbot of Tashi Lhunpo Monastery and his assistant were also detained by Chinese authorities. The Chinese Government detained Tibetan Buddhists involved in selecting the Eleventh Panchen Lama, including Gyatrol Rimpoche and others. They convened a conference in Beijing to choose a rival candidate. Luo Gan and Ye Xiaowen orchestrated a ceremony designating a 6-year-old boy chosen by the Chinese Government as the Eleventh Panchen Lama. State Councilor Li Tieying presided over a ceremony in Shigatze, Tibet for the boy. The Chinese Government imposed its own candidate as the Eleventh Panchen Lama, detaining the 6-year-old boy recognized by Tibetan tradition. This violates the fundamental human rights of the Tibetan people. The Department of State should prioritize releasing individuals imprisoned on religious grounds in China and raise the issue in all relevant forums. Additionally, certain Chinese officials are prohibited from receiving funding for international programs and activities by US agencies. No funds can be used for Chinese Government-approved organizations' participation in education or cultural activities until the President certifies it. This includes the Chinese Buddhist Association, Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, Chinese Catholic Religious Affairs Committee, Chinese Catholic Bishops' Conference, and Chinese Protestant \"Three-Self\" Patriotic Movement. The Chinese Protestant \"Three-Self\" Patriotic Movement, China Christian Council, Chinese Taoist Association, Chinese Islamic Association, officials from various Chinese government departments, and military or civilian officials from specific ministries are subject to certification before funds can be used for their participation in education or cultural activities. The certification required by the President to Congress involves the unconditional release of specific individuals by the Chinese Government, including Pei Zhongxun, Dai Guillang, Geng Minuan, and others. The individuals to be unconditionally released by the Chinese Government include Chatrel Rimpoche, Champa Chung, Gyatrol Rimpoche, Shepa Kelsang, Lhakpa Tsering, and Ringkar Ngawang."
