    "content": "The \"Veterans to Work Pilot Program Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The Act establishes the Veterans to Work Pilot Program. The Veterans to Work Pilot Program, established under the \"Veterans to Work Pilot Program Act of 2009,\" aims to determine the extent to which veterans can be employed as apprentices on military construction projects and explore the feasibility of expanding their employment beyond designated projects. The program will run from fiscal years 2011 through 2015. The Secretary of Defense will designate at least 20 military construction projects annually from 2011 to 2015 for the Veterans to Work Pilot Program. Projects will prioritize locations with veterans in apprenticeship programs, ensure geographic diversity, and focus on projects in the continental US. The pilot program for military construction projects will prioritize locations with veterans in apprenticeship programs across the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the United States Virgin Islands. Unspecified minor projects are limited to 40 percent of designated projects per fiscal year. Contractors must ensure the employment of apprentices, with a preference for veterans, on these projects. Contractors and subcontractors bidding for construction projects designated by the Secretary must assure participation in qualified apprenticeship or training programs for each worker classification. Qualified programs are those that meet the criteria of an employee welfare benefit plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 requires contractors to participate in qualified apprenticeship or training programs for workers. If a program is not available locally, an alternative program can be certified by the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Defense must report on the progress of military construction projects involving apprentices, challenges in recruiting apprentices and veterans, and cost differences compared to non-pilot projects. The Secretary of Defense must report on the progress of military construction projects involving apprentices, challenges in recruiting apprentices and veterans, cost differences compared to non-pilot projects, evaluation of benefits derived from employing apprentices, recommendations for more effective employment of apprentices in subsequent fiscal years, and any other relevant information. The pilot program is analyzed for its impact on workforce sustainability for military construction needs, improvements in veteran employment in sustainable wage fields, and recommendations for the program's continuation, modification, or expansion based on factors like workforce sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and community development. Definitions include an apprentice as an individual employed in a qualified apprenticeship or training program. The term 'pilot program' refers to the Veterans to Work pilot program established under subsection (a), and the term 'State' includes any of the States, the District of Columbia, or territories. The term 'veteran' is defined under section 101(2) of title 38. The Veterans to Work Pilot Program, established under subsection (a), is defined as 2857."
