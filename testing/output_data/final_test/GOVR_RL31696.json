    "content": "The United States imposes economic sanctions on North Korea for five primary reasons: threat to U.S. national security, state sponsor of terrorism, Marxist-Leninist state, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and nuclear explosive device detonation. The U.S. imposes economic sanctions on North Korea due to its threat to national security, state sponsorship of terrorism, Marxist-Leninist ideology, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and recent nuclear detonation. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury has identified Banco Delta Asia as a primary money laundering concern and took action under the USA PATRIOT ACT to curtail international counterfeiting and money laundering activities. This led to Macau seizing the bank and closing North Korea's accounts. North Korea could also face economic sanctions under various laws addressing human rights conditions. The U.S. has identified North Korea as a \"country of particular concern\" and a Tier 3 offender for trafficking of persons. North Korea pursued nuclear weapons capability in 2002, conducted missile tests in 2006, and detonated a nuclear device in the same year. The international community responded to these actions. The international community responded to North Korea's nuclear weapon crisis with U.N. Security Council Resolutions imposing economic sanctions. The crisis may have started with the President's 2002 State of the Union speech labeling North Korea as part of an \"axis of evil.\" North Korea's vulnerability to attack increased after escalating threats against Iraq. In October 2002, North Korea acknowledged renewing its nuclear weapons program, violating international agreements. North Korea's nuclear crisis began with its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003, challenging international agreements. The IAEA declared North Korea in violation, leading to economic sanctions. The IAEA declared North Korea in noncompliance with nuclear safeguard obligations in 2003, leading to referral to the U.N. Security Council. The Security Council discussed the issue but did not pass a resolution due to opposition from Russia and China. The U.S. participated in six-party talks with North Korea and other countries to address the nuclear crisis. In 2004, July/August 2005, September 2005, and December 2006, six-party talks were held to address North Korea's nuclear crisis. The September 2005 talks resulted in a preliminary agreement where North Korea agreed to end its pursuit of nuclear weapons and rejoin the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Other signatory states would provide security commitments and aid, including electricity from South Korea. The agreement did not specify a timeline or sequence of events, with subsequent meetings intended to negotiate implementation. The September 2005 preliminary agreement with North Korea was quickly undermined by disputes over verification and the provision of a light-water reactor. Subsequent talks in December 2006 ended in a stalemate, with North Korea threatening to test its nuclear weapons capability. The United States also took steps to address North Korea's illicit financial activities and proliferation pursuits. In June and September 2005, the President implemented financial sanctions targeting entities involved in weapons proliferation, including Banco Delta Asia. North Korea was found to be involved in money laundering, counterfeiting, and narcotics trafficking, with potential earnings of up to $500 million annually. North Korean officials cited the Banco Delta Asia sanctions as a reason for not attending six-party talks. North Korea used the Banco Delta Asia action as a justification for not attending six-party talks, citing U.S. financial sanctions as a primary obstacle. In response to North Korea's missile launches, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1695 condemning the launches and demanding a recommitment to a moratorium. North Korea recommit to a moratorium on missile activities and the transfer of related materials. In 2006, they tested a nuclear explosive device, leading to the adoption of Resolution 1718 by the UN Security Council to condemn the test and urge North Korea to return to six-party talks. The resolution invoked Chapter VII of the UN Charter to prevent the supply of weapons to North Korea. The UN Security Council established measures to prevent the supply of weapons to North Korea, including prohibiting the sale of conventional weapons, spare parts, and luxury goods. They also froze the assets of individuals supporting North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. The UN Security Council established measures to prevent the supply of weapons to North Korea, including prohibiting the sale of conventional weapons, spare parts, and luxury goods. They also froze the assets of individuals supporting North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, with exceptions and cooperative actions to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. Diplomatic efforts are intensified to facilitate the early resumption of the Six-Party Talks. The UN Security Council, in UNSCR 1718, demanded that North Korea comply with various measures, including not conducting nuclear or missile tests, returning to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and ceasing the export of weapons. Member states are responsible for implementing UNSCR 1718. Secretary of State Rice traveled to Asia in 2006 to meet with senior officials. In 2006, Secretary of State Rice traveled to Asia to meet with North Korea's major trading partners. North Korea stated that it would view UN sanctions as an act of war. The country declared itself a nuclear weapons state and expressed a desire for peace but readiness for war. The United States maintained economic sanctions against North Korea since the 1950-53 conflict. North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons was aimed at increasing pressure to lift U.S. sanctions, including those related to terrorism. Economic assistance, diplomatic normalization, and a nonaggression pact with the U.S. were also motivations. In response to North Korea's nuclear program in 2002, trading partners imposed unilateral sanctions, such as Japan suspending rice shipments and requiring costly insurance for ships using its ports. Relations between Japan and North Korea remained strained. In 2002, Japan, South Korea, and the United States suspended oil shipments to North Korea. Australia delayed opening an embassy in Pyongyang until the nuclear weapons issue is resolved. China briefly shut off oil deliveries to pressure North Korea to join talks. The new UN economic sanctions minimally impact the US economy due to limited engagement with North Korea. North Korea's neighbors conduct significant trade with North Korea, accounting for 78.7% of its exports. Trade between North Korea and its neighbors, including South Korea, China, Thailand, Japan, and Russia, has seen significant growth in recent years. Efforts to isolate North Korea would impact all trading partners economically. North Korea relies on these countries for food and energy, as well as aid during crises. Severe economic restrictions could have enormous consequences for North Korea and its neighbors. North Korea's economic restrictions push the country towards collapse. South Korean companies invest in an industrial zone in Kaesong, subsidized by the South Korean government. North Korea enacted laws to encourage cross-border development with South Korea. North Korea benefits from South Korea's Sunshine Policy due to its low GDP compared to South Korea. South Korea debates the wisdom of continuing inter-Korean ties despite UN sanctions. Choo Kyu-ho from the Foreign Ministry confirms economic cooperation programs with North Korea will proceed in line with the resolution. The Kaesong Industrial Complex generates $0.6 million monthly in wages for North Korea. The United States imposed a total embargo on exports to North Korea three days after North Korea's Armed Forces invaded South Korea in June 1950. U.S. law allows the President to restrict trade, aid, arms sales, and arms transfers to North Korea due to threats to national security, support of terrorism, a communist economy, weapons proliferation, and illicit currency use. The Department of Commerce has imposed strict export controls on North Korea over the years. In response to North Korea's actions, the United States imposed export controls, known as the Export Administration Regulations (EARs). North Korea was initially classified under the most restricted category, but over time, restrictions were lifted in stages, particularly in 1995 and 1999, following agreements and concessions made by North Korea. By June 2000, North Korea's export status had significantly improved, with many items no longer requiring a license for export. The export controls on North Korea have been eased over time, allowing many items to be exported without a license. However, certain restrictions still remain in place, particularly related to national security concerns. North Korea is on the most restrictive list, limiting its access to certain items like computers and software. North Korea's access to computers, software, and national security-controlled items is severely limited. The President has the authority to ease export restrictions, and licensing exceptions may be considered by the Commerce Department. To lift all export controls, North Korea would need to be removed from the list of countries supporting international terrorism. Following the 1987 bombing of Korean Air Lines 858 by North Korean agents, North Korea was placed on the list of countries supporting international terrorism. This resulted in restrictions on trade, foreign aid, and support in international financial institutions. Being on this list also led to denial of beneficial trade designation, unfavorable tax status for investors, limits on diplomatic relations, and stricter licensing requirements for trade. Following the easing of sanctions in 2000, there was speculation that North Korea would be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism to apply for membership in international financial institutions. The United States discussed this with South Korea and Japan, with South Korea supporting North Korea's bid for normalization and Japan opposing until the issue of kidnapped Japanese citizens was resolved. North Korea remains on the US list of state sponsors of terrorism. North Korea remains on the United States' sec. 6(j) list and is listed as violating section 40A of the Arms Export Control Act. The Trade Agreement Extension Act of 1951 led to the denial of Most-Favored-Nation trade status for North Korea. North Korea is still listed in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States as a Rate of Duty Column 2 country. North Korea, listed in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States as a Rate of Duty Column 2 country, faces high tariffs on imports due to being denied Most-Favored-Nation trade status. Violations of U.S. missile nonproliferation laws result in mandatory sanctions, with the severity and duration depending on the material or technology involved. Sanctions imposed on entities in North Korea for engaging in proliferation under U.S. law can include denial of contracts with U.S. government agencies and licenses for items on the U.S. Munitions List. The President has authority to cut off foreign aid, deny defense transfers, and withhold financial support in response to nuclear weapons tests. The United States imposes sanctions on North Korea, including withholding support in international financial institutions and denying export licenses for dual-use items. North Korea is denied most aid under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 due to being identified as a state sponsor of international terrorism. Access to U.S. foreign assistance is limited for North Korea, with exceptions in certain areas like nonproliferation and demining programs. Under the current Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, North Korea is denied direct foreign aid and loans, credits, insurance, and guarantees. Supporters of international terrorism, including North Korea, are also denied bilateral assistance and participation in debt relief programs. North Korea is denied assistance under the Department of Defense Appropriations Act unless specifically appropriated for that purpose. The President may impose economic sanctions on North Korea as well. North Korea is subject to economic sanctions under various laws addressing human rights conditions, including the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. Sanctions imposed would be redundant due to existing penalties. The Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 also denies funding to Marxist-Leninist countries, including North Korea. North Korea is denied benefits or aid under various laws due to its Marxist-Leninist classification. The President may determine North Korea's status under specific laws, but overall improvement in U.S.-North Korea relations would require Congressional action to remove these restrictions. To improve U.S.-North Korea relations, Congress may need to remove North Korea from certain lists in the Export-Import Bank Act and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, or the President may need to use waiver authority. The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) denies licenses for defense exports to countries like North Korea, Iran, and Syria, as well as countries under arms embargoes. The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) prohibits the export of defense items to countries supporting terrorism, including North Korea. The Arms Export Control Act also restricts financial assistance to terrorist countries. Importing defense articles and services is similarly restricted by the Department of the Treasury. The ITAR prohibits the export of defense items to countries supporting terrorism, including North Korea. The Arms Export Control Act restricts financial assistance to terrorist countries. Importing defense articles and services is also restricted by the Department of the Treasury. The policy denies licenses and approvals for defense articles and services from certain countries, including Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and others. The President has the authority to change these regulations, such as removing North Korea from the list of restricted countries. The President used his authority under the Trading With the Enemy Act to declare a national emergency due to events in Korea. The Department of the Treasury then issued regulations to prohibit financial transactions involving North Korea and China. These regulations have been modified over time to account for new circumstances or ease restrictions in response to changing conditions. The regulations regarding financial transactions involving North Korea have been modified over time to ease restrictions in certain instances, such as unblocking assets of North Koreans who emigrated to the U.S., allowing freer flow of informational materials, establishing telecommunications between the two countries, authorizing travel-related transactions, and permitting donations targeting basic human needs after natural disasters. The President has the authority to change regulations related to aviation fees, exporting computer hardware and software, North Korean property investments, imports from North Korea, and transactions with the government of North Korea, as long as they comply with relevant laws. President has the authority to change regulations related to aviation fees, exporting computer hardware and software, North Korean property investments, imports from North Korea, and transactions with the government of North Korea, as long as they comply with relevant laws. He annually renews the state of national emergency against North Korea since 1950, which can be terminated by Congress through a joint resolution under the National Emergencies Act. President Bush expanded his authority in 2005 to address the threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation by freezing assets and property of those involved. In 1990, steps were taken to control exports of certain goods and services and authorize a ban on foreign aid, credit, procurement contracts, imports, exports, support in international financial institutions, and landing rights. The 43rd President's order aimed to block property and assets of individuals engaged in activities contributing to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Executive Order prohibits support for activities described above, including entities from North Korea and Iran. Treasury added more North Korean entities to the restricted list and designated Bank Sepah as contributing to Iran's proliferation activities. Bank Sepah transferred funds for a Korean company cited in December 2006. The Korean Mining Development Corporation was cited for exporting missile technology to Iran. Banco Delta Asia, a Macau-based bank with North Korean holdings, was found to be a primary money laundering concern. North Korea profits from counterfeiting and narcotics trafficking, potentially earning $500 million and $100-$200 million annually. The Treasury Department may impose special measures on U.S. financial institutions regarding Banco Delta Asia's transactions. The Department of the Treasury has issued a proposed rulemaking to impose the most stringent fifth special measure, affecting Banco Delta Asia's international business relations. Financial institutions globally have voluntarily cut back or terminated business with North Korea, making it difficult for the regime to benefit from criminal conduct. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports related to North Korea, covering topics such as events, economic leverage, nuclear tests, weapons development, and possible military options. The reports are authored by various individuals. The curr_chunk lists CRS reports on North Korea, including topics like ballistic missile threats, weapons of mass destruction trade, drug trafficking, counterfeiting, foreign aid, economic sanctions, and proliferation activities."
