    "content": "Sea-level rise is expected to have economic, social, and environmental impacts on U.S. coasts due to various factors such as warming oceans and melting ice sheets. Global sea levels rose 187 mm from 1901 to 2010, with an average annual rise of 1.7 mm, increasing to 3.2 mm annually from 1992 to 2010. Rates of relative sea-level rise vary by location, with rates between 9-12 mm per year near New Orleans and 1-2 mm per year in some coastal areas of Oregon and Washington. Sea-level rise has led to population growth and development along coastal areas in Oregon and Washington. Congress is concerned about the impacts on coastal communities and ecosystems, as well as the risks for the federal government. The report is divided into three parts: describing sea-level rise phenomenon, its effects on U.S. coasts, and federal actions to address it. In 2010, approximately 100 million people lived in U.S. coastal shoreline counties, with 2.9 million residing in U.S. territories. While not all are directly exposed to sea-level rise, they may still experience indirect effects on their communities. Sea-level rise increases coastal flood and erosion hazards, affecting nearly 8 million people living in the 1% coastal flood zone in the U.S. Higher sea levels lead to more damage from coastal storms, land inundation, shoreline changes, saltwater intrusion, and habitat shifts. These impacts result in nuisance flooding, loss of lands, habitat changes, and less freshwater supply. Sea-level rise impacts federal government facilities, infrastructure, and coastal real estate through flooding and damages, leading to potential involvement in disaster assistance and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Federal agencies like NOAA and USGS are involved in understanding sea-level rise through research and surveys. FEMA works on flood mitigation and recovery efforts, including the NFIP. Federal agencies like the Department of Defense, U.S. Coast Guard, NASA, Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Transportation, and Department of Housing and Urban Development have projects and programs relevant to coastal areas affected by sea-level rise. Additionally, Department of the Interior agencies, NOAA, and EPA are involved in coastal ecosystem restoration. The Army Corps, EPA, and coastal states manage coastal construction permits under the CZMA. Coastal development's growth depends on risk mitigation policies and investments. Rising sea levels and storms have not halted coastal growth. Federal contributions to vulnerable coastal development are a concern. The federal government's role in vulnerable coastal development is a concern, with debates on the impact of federal disaster assistance and infrastructure programs. Scientists use global sea level (GSL) and relative sea level (RSL) to measure sea level trends, with GSL being the average height of the Earth's oceans measured by satellite altimetry. Since 1992, satellites have measured an average GSL rise of about 3.2 mm per year, with contributions from thermal expansion of the oceans, melting glaciers, and ice sheets. Water impounded behind dams reduces GSL rise, while groundwater pumped from wells contributes to it. Since the early 1990s, satellites have directly measured the global sea level rise (GSL), showing an average increase of about 3.2 mm per year. However, tide gauge records dating back to the 18th century in Europe and 19th century in the United States have been used to estimate GSL trends. The IPCC reported that GSL likely rose by 1.7 mm per year from 1901 to 2010, with an overall increase of approximately 7.4 inches. It is also likely that the rate of GSL rise has accelerated since the 19th century. The IPCC reported an increase in the rate of global sea level rise (GSL) from the 19th to the 20th century. The average rate since 1901 is 1.7 mm per year, lower than satellite altimeter measurements since 1992. GSL rise has not been constant, with trends varying over different periods. Factors like volcanic eruptions, such as Mt. Pinatubo in 1991, have influenced sea-level rise measurements. The Mt. Pinatubo eruption may have masked an acceleration of global sea level rise (GSL), but satellites may detect an acceleration in the coming decade. GSL represents the average ocean surface elevation, influenced by factors like location and ocean density. For example, sea-surface heights off Bermuda are higher than off Charleston due to the Gulf Stream. Sea-surface heights are also higher on the Pacific Ocean side of the United States compared to the Atlantic due to water density differences. Global sea level (GSL) is rising, with regional variations in trends due to factors like natural climate variability. Research suggests that sea-surface height changes in the Pacific Ocean may have reversed since 2012. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is causing higher sea levels in the eastern Pacific and lower sea levels in the western Pacific since 2012. Relative sea level (RSL) is the elevation of sea level relative to the land surface, which is changing in many parts of the U.S. coastline. Regional variations in GSL and land surface elevation changes contribute to differences in RSL trends along the coastline. The trend of Relative Sea Level (RSL) varies dramatically in the United States, with RSL rising in Louisiana's Mississippi Delta region and dropping along parts of the Pacific Northwest coastline and southern Alaska. The National Water Level Observation Network, operated by NOAA, provides sea-level data from 210 stations primarily using tide gauges. The National Water Level Observation Network, operated by NOAA, ensures accurate referencing of nautical maps, shoreline maps, and coastal infrastructure elevations to sea level. Trends in tide gauge network data provide the long-term record of Relative Sea Level (RSL) for U.S. coastlines, influenced by factors such as thermal expansion of oceans, melting glaciers, and greenhouse gas emissions. Global factors driving RSL change include those affecting Global Sea Level (GSL). The factors driving Relative Sea Level (RSL) change include global influences like Global Sea Level (GSL) and regional or local factors such as natural land rebounding or human activities like groundwater pumping. Understanding these drivers is crucial for coastal communities to predict, mitigate, and adapt to sea-level rise risks. Studies show an increase in the Earth's energy budget since 1970, with the oceans storing over 90% of the net energy inflow to the climate system. The oceans have stored more than 90% of the increased net energy inflow to the climate system in recent decades. Seawater expansion and melting glaciers explain about 75% of the rise in Global Sea Level (GSL) since 1971. Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have significantly increased since the late 19th century, leading to a discernible warming influence on air and ocean temperatures. The contribution to GSL rise from Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has increased since the early 1990s. Global Sea Level (GSL) has risen at an average of 1.7 mm per year since about 1880, with uncertainties in attributing the rise to human activities or natural influences. Satellite measurements since the early 1990s show an increase to about 3.2 mm per year, indicating a faster rise compared to the long-term average. The current average rate of GSL rise is not unprecedented, with studies suggesting a similar rate occurred from 1920 to 1950. Policymakers and coastal communities face the challenge of anticipating, planning for, and mitigating the effects of a longer-term overall rise in sea levels. Significant variations in sea-level rise regionally and at the decadal time scale, influenced by factors like El Ni\u00f1o or the PDO, may temporarily mask long-term trends. The IPCC predicts that the rate of GSL rise in the 21st century will likely exceed that of the 20th century, with sea levels continuing to rise for centuries. The IPCC predicts that sea levels will continue to rise for centuries, with future global sea-level rise uncertain due to factors like Greenland's behavior and GHG emissions. The U.S. National Climate Assessment projects a rise of at least 0.2 meters but no more than 2.0 meters by 2100, impacting coastal communities' planning and response strategies. The uncertainty in future global sea-level rise is mainly due to the behavior of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. While estimates vary for Antarctic ice sheet contributions to sea-level rise by 2100, continued warming could destabilize the ice sheets, leading to collapse. Greenland's ice sheet has been melting more than accumulating snow, contributing to sea-level rise, a trend expected to continue. Unlike Antarctica, Greenland is not at risk of sudden collapse. The future behavior of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is uncertain, leading to a possible additional rise in global sea levels. Greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver for this rise, requiring long-term policies to reduce emissions. Even if greenhouse gas concentrations stabilize, sea levels will continue to rise for centuries, necessitating other measures to address the consequences. Land elevation changes along the U.S. coastline impact the rate of sea-level rise. Land elevation changes influence the rate of sea-level rise. Factors like post-glacial rebound affect land elevation, with some areas sinking while others rise. Regional and local policies can help mitigate risks to communities and ecosystems. The land elevation changes due to factors like post-glacial rebound and plate tectonics are causing vertical movement in different regions. Coastal communities need to consider these natural processes in their planning for sea-level rise mitigation. Land subsidence in southern Louisiana, including New Orleans, is mainly caused by natural forces like sediment loading, compaction, and faulting. However, human activities, such as excessive groundwater withdrawals, account for about 80% of land subsidence in the United States. Groundwater pumping decreases aquifer pressure, leading to land subsidence. For instance, groundwater withdrawals in the southern Chesapeake Bay region contribute to the highest rate of relative sea-level rise on the U.S. East Coast. Land subsidence on the U.S. East Coast is mainly caused by excessive groundwater withdrawals, leading to the highest rate of relative sea-level rise in the region. On the West Coast, land subsidence in California's Santa Clara Valley is attributed to groundwater pumping, resulting in significant elevation drops. Oil and gas extraction also contributes to land subsidence, with the Houston-Galveston area in Texas experiencing rates exceeding 25 mm per year at different times in the 20th century. Land subsidence in the Houston-Galveston area and the high rates of relative sea-level rise have increased flooding frequency. Organic rich soils drained for agricultural purposes can lead to subsidence, with up to 25 mm-75 mm per year in some areas. Groundwater withdrawal, oil and gas extraction, and draining of organic soils are recognized factors in subsidence. Land subsidence, exacerbated by factors such as groundwater withdrawal and draining of organic soils, contributes to sea-level rise along coastlines. Policies can be enacted to mitigate land subsidence and potentially alter the rate of relative sea-level rise. Examples include the creation of the Harris-Galveston Subsidence District in the Houston-Galveston region and local management of groundwater resources in the Santa Clara Valley. Part II of the report discusses the effects of sea-level rise on U.S. coasts. The effects of sea-level rise on U.S. coasts include permanent or episodic inundation of low-lying lands, increased erosion, impacts from coastal storms, and saltwater intrusion. These physical effects have environmental and societal consequences. Actions addressing the impacts of sea-level rise are discussed in Part II of the report. The rising sea level influences coastal processes, resources, and societal implications. Policy responses vary for different coastlines, with tradeoffs between short- and long-term costs, environmental benefits, and development losses. Uncertainty in future sea-level rise rates complicates decision-making. The effects of sea-level rise vary depending on shoreline topography and hydrodynamics, with different coastal forms being affected differently. Some shorelines may adapt to rising sea levels naturally, while others are more vulnerable to erosion. Research suggests that 70% of the northeastern coastal landscape may not necessarily be inundated by sea-level rise. Recent research suggests that 70% of the coastal landscape of the northeastern United States may have some capacity to adapt to sea-level rise. Low-lying areas may be able to adjust rather than be inundated, with marshes building vertically in response. Sandy coasts can adjust if nearby sand sources are available, while developed and rocky areas are more likely to be directly impacted by sea-level rise. The U.S. Geological Survey is assessing vulnerability along the U.S. Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico coasts, showing a diversity in susceptibility. Small islands and their populations have limited options for adjusting to higher sea levels. Understanding how coasts may evolve due to higher sea levels is crucial for determining effective policies and investments. Factors like coastal slope, tidal range, wave height, and sediment availability shape how shorelines are affected. Short-term events like storms can lead to rapid coastal land loss or growth. Anticipating the evolution of U.S. coasts involves discerning whether coastal processes are dominated by short-term events or long-term sea-level rise. Assessing the effects of sea-level rise on U.S. coasts relies on accurate coastal data and mapping, including elevation information. Research advancements and data analysis improvements are expected to enhance understanding of coastal dynamics and sea-level rise planning. Predicting the impact of sea-level rise on coastal lagoons, tidal exchange, and fisheries is challenging due to complex interactions and other influencing factors. Fisheries changes are influenced by factors like water temperatures, coastal development, and fishing activities, not just sea-level rise. Wetlands' ability to adapt to higher sea levels depends on vertical adjustment and inland migration, influenced by topography, human settlements, and flood defenses. Habitat and species in wetlands, bays, and estuaries may change with higher sea levels, affecting inundation frequency, salinity, and shoreline dynamics. For example, the Florida Everglades may transition to salt-tolerant species with rising sea levels. The study focused on the impact of a 1-meter sea-level rise on coastal estuaries in Florida. Coastal forest and undeveloped dry land habitats are likely to be lost, while mangroves, transitional saltmarsh, and saltmarsh habitats may become more common. Changes in estuaries are important due to their productivity and value, affecting estuarine fish and shellfish species. The rate of sea-level rise will determine if coastal ecosystems can adapt and persist. Sea-level rise may lead to the conversion of coastal ecosystems into open water, especially in low-lying areas like Louisiana. The impact on coastal erosion depends on land forms and nearshore dynamics, with erosion expected to be influenced by sea-level rise and storms in the mid-Atlantic region. Distinguishing erosion caused by sea-level rise versus other human activities is challenging. Sea-level rise may lead to significant changes in shoreline position, including segmentation and rapid island migration on barrier islands. Research in Hawaii showed varying shoreline change rates, with projected average recession in 2050 nearly double historical rates. Higher sea levels can increase nuisance flooding frequency in developed coastal areas and pose risks from coastal storms. Saltwater intrusion may impact freshwater availability in estuaries and aquifers. Saltwater intrusion from sea-level rise can affect freshwater availability for coastal communities, posing challenges for islands and coastal areas with economic and cultural significance. Coastal activities like ports, fishing operations, and military installations are often located at the coast out of necessity or cultural reasons. Some choose to live on the coast for recreational and lifestyle amenities, leading to varying property values and incomes. Socially vulnerable populations may be at risk in certain coastal areas. Coastal development varies among U.S. states, with some areas more vulnerable to sea-level rise due to limited resources. Factors influencing development include state and local land use restrictions, demand, and financing. For example, the District of Columbia, Connecticut, and New York have the highest percentage of developed lands within 1 meter of sea level, while Maryland, North Carolina, and Georgia have more undeveloped or conserved land in the same proximity. Coastal development in the United States is influenced by state and local land use regulations, demand, and financing. Some states, like Florida, have more assets at risk from sea-level rise, including vulnerable infrastructure and population centers. Rising sea levels exacerbate the risks of flooding from coastal storms and precipitation. Sea-level rise increases flooding risk from coastal storms, affecting developed areas depending on storm specifics and local coast characteristics. Higher seas allow storm surge to penetrate further inland, hindering drainage in low-lying areas. Potential economic impacts on U.S. coastal areas due to combined storm surge and sea-level rise raise financial concerns for disaster response and recovery. The report estimated that adaptation to and damages from combined storm surge and sea-level rise on U.S. coastal property could cost $0.8 trillion during this century. Sea-level rise increases flood risk by making more coastal areas vulnerable to storms and precipitation. Flood risk is determined by hazard, vulnerability, and consequences. Sea-level rise increases flood risk by making more coastal areas vulnerable to storms and precipitation. Stakeholders promote policies to reduce the hazard through climate change mitigation and reduced groundwater withdrawal, reduce vulnerability with shore-protection measures and storm-surge gates, and reduce consequences with hazard-mitigation measures like development restrictions and improved evacuation routes. Nuisance flooding from sea-level rise contributes to regular flooding during high tides, causing public inconvenience. Nuisance flooding, also known as \"sunny day\" flooding, has increased dramatically in many U.S. coastal regions since the mid-20th century. It often involves shallow flooding of infrastructure and buildings, with potential environmental impacts. The cumulative costs of regular nuisance flooding may exceed those of larger storm-related flood damages. Decisionmakers in developed areas subject to nuisance flooding and other persistent sea-level rise impacts are implementing various engineering solutions to address the near-term impacts. These solutions include adding pumping capacity, armoring sewer systems, raising roadways, draining neighborhoods using gravity and injection wells, and employing salinity control structures. Adjusting to sea-level rise presents policy challenges and federalism questions. The federal response is complicated due to regulations on coastal land use and building requirements. Key opportunities for preparation include preserving public access along the shore, land-use planning for wetland preservation, and retrofitting buildings. The federal government faces challenges in responding to sea-level rise, including regulations on coastal land use and building requirements. Local and state governments play a significant role in land-use decisions and setting requirements for coastal developments and buildings. The federal government shares the financial burden of coastal flooding consequences through disaster assistance and the National Flood Insurance Program. The challenge with disaster assistance and the National Flood Insurance Program is that local stakeholders may pursue options that are not affordable or sustainable in the long run. This can lead to a \"moral hazard\" problem where decisions are made based on the expectation of federal assistance in the event of a disaster, shifting the burden to federal taxpayers. The public policy challenge related to sea-level rise is the intergenerational transfer of risk, with coastal communities facing increased risk in the future. Some view not developing in light of future risks as an unnecessary sacrifice, while others see it as altering current practices to reduce future consequences. Congress must consider the extent to which federal programs address these challenges. Federal programs, regulations, and funding play a significant role in influencing how coasts develop, especially in response to coastal erosion and sea-level rise. Various federal agencies are directly or indirectly involved in sea-level rise science, research, and coastal regulatory activities, as well as in projects and programs addressing or affected by sea-level rise. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 and the Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 are key federal statutes addressing coastal development pressures. CBRA designates undeveloped coastal barriers and restricts federal spending in those areas. The CZMA encourages planning to protect natural resources and promote wise development in the coastal zone, with states having the lead responsibility. NOAA approves coastal zone management programs and provides limited funding for planning and management. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) recognizes states' lead responsibility for managing coastal zones and authorizes grants for coastal management programs. Most states and territories participate in CZMA, using grants for various coastal enhancement objectives. State programs aim to discourage unwise development in flood-prone areas and protect natural coastal features. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) designates undeveloped coastal barriers and adjacent areas where federal spending for additional development is prohibited. There are 585 system units encompassing 1.3 million acres along the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic Coast, Great Lakes, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands. Congress can modify unit boundaries, and the program does not regulate activities, only federal spending. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) prohibits federal support for development within designated units, but development has still occurred in some areas. The CBRA system also includes 272 \"otherwise protected areas\" covering 1.9 million acres, with spending restrictions limited to federal flood insurance. The response to coastal hazards in the United States varies widely, with landowners and communities using hard coastal defenses like seawalls or nonstructural approaches like dune construction. Approximately 14% of the contiguous U.S. shoreline on the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico has hardened infrastructure. NOAA warns that if shoreline hardening continues at the current rate, it could have significant consequences. NOAA warns that if shoreline hardening continues at the current rate of 200 kilometers per year, nearly one-third of the U.S. shoreline may be hardened by 2100. Hardened shorelines support fewer species than natural habitats and require additional financial investments. Alternative methods to manage erosion and storm-surge impacts, such as protecting natural dunes and investing in oyster-reef restoration, are being pursued. Researchers have identified that 50% of tidal wetlands in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico are threatened by potential future hardening. Advocates for nature-based approaches argue that current regulatory programs favor hard solutions over nature-based ones for shoreline stabilization. The Army Corps of Engineers proposed a general permit for \"living shorelines\" in 2016 to facilitate the adoption of nature-based approaches. Sea-level rise raises questions about its impact on future economic development and coastal safety. Sea-level rise raises questions about its impact on future economic development and coastal safety. Policy options related to sea-level rise include maintaining the status quo, reducing the global rise in sea level through GHG-mitigation efforts, and reducing the relative rise in sea level by addressing local or regional drivers. These choices will significantly shape the future of U.S. coastal development. Policies to address sea-level rise focus on reducing vulnerabilities and consequences. This includes activities to reduce land subsidence, coastal flood risk reduction projects, environmental and social resilience measures, hazard-mitigation actions, and development restrictions. The costs of these policies are a key consideration. Future rates and levels of sea-level rise are uncertain and influenced by a mix of natural and human factors, complicating decision-making on coastal development policies. Considerations for Congress include understanding the causes of sea-level rise, responsibilities for managing activities exacerbating sea-level rise, and the costs and benefits of policy options. Global sea levels may rise significantly in the 21st century, with projections ranging from 0.2 meters to potentially much higher due to the behavior of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Understanding how these ice sheets contribute to sea-level rise is crucial for coastal communities to plan for and mitigate potential impacts. Recognizing the factors that contribute to relative sea-level rise, such as local activities exacerbating land subsidence, is also important for effective planning and response efforts. The report from the Academy of Sciences emphasizes the need for a progressive response to chronic sea-level rise. Coastal armoring strategies will lead to escalating costs and consequences of failure. While protective actions may be cost-effective in developed areas, they come with significant costs and risks. Some responses may be effective for a few decades but could become ineffective as sea levels continue to rise. Communities and nature have adapted to shoreline dynamics and coastal hazards for centuries. The current question is how to respond efficiently and effectively to sea-level rise. Considerations for Congress include the risk of sea-level rise to the nation, federal facilities, critical infrastructure, and the national economy. The federal role in coastal projects and activities, federal funding for adjusting to sea-level rise, and the influence of federal regulations on managing coastal development are key issues to address. The federal government's regulations, programs, and funding impact the management of coastal sea-level rise. Balancing federal efforts with state and local roles in coastal development is a challenge for policymakers. States and local governments have significant discretion in decision-making. The federal government's regulations, programs, and funding impact coastal sea-level rise management. States and local governments have discretion in land use decisions, influenced by minimum floodplain standards for NFIP participation. Policy questions include federal responsibilities for adjusting to sea-level rise and the allocation of costs. The federal government's regulations, programs, and funding impact coastal sea-level rise management. Various federal agencies provide guidance and data for state, local, and private efforts to prepare for sea-level rise. Stakeholders are concerned about insufficient attention to the risks posed by sea-level rise. Stakeholders are concerned about the risk posed by sea-level rise and coastal hazards. Decisionmakers may invest in coastal protections to mitigate these risks, which can impact the future of U.S. coastal communities and habitats. Overestimating the risk could lead to unnecessary investments in protections. Decisions on land use, development, infrastructure, and building codes will shape the financial impacts of sea-level rise for the nation. Private investments can influence the financial impacts of sea-level rise for the nation by shaping future growth in coastal areas based on perceived risks from coastal hazards and the effectiveness of responses to mitigate those risks."
