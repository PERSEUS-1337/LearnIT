Urban University Business Initiative Grants are authorized by the Administrator of the Small Business Administration for eligible institutions. Applications must be submitted with required information and assurances as per regulations. The Urban University Business Initiative Grants require applicants to provide a description of activities, evidence of coordination with small business development centers, and documentation of a consortium formation with eligible institutions and other entities. The Administrator may waive certain requirements for applicants who can demonstrate alternative strategies. The Administrator will develop selection procedures for applications under this section within 120 days of the Act's enactment. Funds provided will assist businesses in lower income urban communities to enhance productivity and global competitiveness through specific authorized activities. Activities funded under this section may include research, technology transfer, training, services, and assistance in business development, creation, expansion, and human resource management. A peer review panel will be appointed within 90 days to oversee the process. The Administrator consults with federal agencies and non-Federal organizations to ensure geographic balance and diverse representation on the panel. The panel reviews grant applications and makes recommendations for grant recipients. The Administrator is limited in the disbursement of funds. The Administrator is limited to providing assistance not exceeding $400,000 per year. Grants must be distributed equitably across different geographic areas. Definitions include \"lower income urban community\" and \"urban area.\" The Administrator designates urban areas in states without one.
