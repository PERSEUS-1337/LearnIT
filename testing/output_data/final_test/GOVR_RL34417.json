    "content": "The Bush Administration's request for funding Energy and Water Development programs for FY2009 totaled $31.209 billion, compared to $30.998 billion appropriated for FY2008. The House and Senate approved bills that would have appropriated around $33.8 billion for these programs. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 continued appropriations for Energy and Water Development at the FY2008 level until March 6, 2009. The House and Senate passed an Omnibus Appropriations Act for FY2009, including funding for Energy and Water Development. The President signed the bill on March 11, 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 also included FY2009 appropriations for programs funded in the Energy and Water Development bill. The House Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY2009 funding bill in June 2008. The House and Senate passed an Omnibus Appropriations Act for FY2009, including funding for Energy and Water Development. The bill was signed on March 11, 2009. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported out S. 3258 (110 th ) on July 14. The continuing resolution (Division A of P.L. 110-329) funds programs at the FY2008 rate with special provisions for pay rate increases and additional funding for DOE's weatherization program. The Omnibus Appropriations Act for FY2009 included funding for Energy and Water Development. The bill provided $25 billion in direct loans for automakers and parts suppliers to produce fuel-efficient vehicles. Additionally, $2,776.8 million was allocated for the Army Corps of Engineers for emergencies and projects in southeast Louisiana. The Energy and Water Development funding for FY2009 was part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009. The Energy and Water Development bill (H.R. 1105) was passed by the House and Senate in February and March 2009, respectively. President Obama signed the bill into law (P.L. 111-8) on March 11, 2009. It included additional funding for energy and water development programs, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This funding was to remain available for obligation through FY2010. The bill also allocated funding for civil works projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Central Utah Project, and the Bureau of Reclamation. The Energy and Water Development bill (H.R. 1105) was signed into law in March 2009, providing additional funding for energy and water development programs. The bill also allocated funding for civil works projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Central Utah Project, and the Bureau of Reclamation. Tables provide budget details for various agencies and programs for FY2008-FY2009. Since Hurricane Katrina, the Corps' civil works activities have received increased funding through supplemental appropriations and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In 2008, over $9 billion was allocated for post-Katrina repair, coastal Louisiana improvements, and emergency flood response. The agency also received an additional $4.6 billion in 2009. The FY2009 budget is $5.402 billion, higher than the Bush Administration's request but lower than the FY2008 enacted amount. The FY2010 preliminary budget request is $5.1 billion. Unlike other infrastructure programs, federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula. The Corps' funding is not distributed based on a formula or through a competitive program. Around 85% of appropriations for civil works activities go to specific projects, some identified in the budget request and others added during congressional deliberations. Funding debates often involve earmarks, with appropriations typically going to authorized projects. Estimates of the backlog of authorized projects range from $11 billion to over $80 billion, raising policy questions about project prioritization. The Bush Administration limited new starts and focused on completing activities to address the backlog of authorized projects. Congress distributes Corps appropriations across various projects and initiates a limited number of new starts. P.L. 111-8 continues restrictions on new starts and oversight. The Corps is responsible for repairing and fortifying the hurricane protection system in coastal Louisiana, funded through $14.3 billion. The Corps' work on the region's hurricane protection system is funded through $14.3 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations. The funds are used for construction of levees, floodwalls, storm surge barriers, and pump improvements to reduce hurricane flooding risk in the New Orleans area. The goal is to provide a 100-year level of protection and restore hurricane protection in surrounding areas to previously authorized levels by 2011. The Bush Administration requested $5.8 billion in emergency supplemental funds in FY2009 to complete construction activities. The request for additional funds to complete construction activities for hurricane protection in the New Orleans area was approved. The State of Louisiana would contribute $1.3 billion as its nonfederal cost-share, with Congress providing $1.5 billion to cover the state's share. The Bush Administration proposed consolidating authorities for Corps hurricane protection projects into a single project. The Bush Administration proposed consolidating authorities for Corps hurricane protection projects in the New Orleans area to manage funding systematically. The Corps plays a coordination role in the restoration of the Central and Southern Florida ecosystem, with concerns about appropriations and progress in the restoration effort. The Bush Administration requested $185 million for FY2009 for the Everglades restoration effort, but P.L. 111-8 only provides $123 million. The primary difference is the lack of Corps funding for the Modified Waters Deliveries Project, which is instead funded through Department of Interior appropriations. Other components of the restoration effort also receive lower appropriations than requested, but may receive stimulus funds in FY2009. Total FY2009 appropriations for the Everglades remain uncertain. P.L. 111-8 provides funding for various Florida restoration projects, with a deficit in the Inland Waterway Trust Fund due to ongoing work. The fund is supported by a fuel tax on commercial vessels, but collections are lower than outlays. The Bush Administration proposed replacing the fuel tax. The Bush Administration proposed replacing the fuel tax with a lockage fee for each barge, but P.L. 111-8 did not adopt this proposal. Instead, it funds some projects with Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) funds and others with general revenue funds, raising fiscal equity issues. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) has a $4.7 billion balance, leading to concerns about equity among navigation stakeholders. The Department of the Interior requested Congress to reduce funding for the Central Utah Project (CUP) Completion Account and the Bureau of Reclamation. The Bush Administration proposed changes to funding for the Central Utah Project (CUP) Completion Account and Bureau of Reclamation in FY2009. The total request for Title II funding was reduced to $786.3 million, 32% below FY2008 levels. P.L. 111-8 provided $1.1 billion for Title II, $331.5 million more than requested. The amended FY2009 request for Reclamation totaled $744.3 million, $363.6 million less than FY2008. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $42 million for Central Utah Project (CUP) funding for FY2009, with a total amended budget request of $786.3 million for Title II funding. The Committee also recommended $915.5 million for Reclamation programs, which is $171.2 million more than the President's amended FY2009 request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations also recommended $42 million for FY2009 CUP funding, with a total recommendation of $1,084.8 million for the remaining Title II programs. The Senate recommended $1,084.8 million for Title II programs, including $42 million for CUP funding. Reclamation's Water and Related Resources account covers various programs like construction, operations, dam safety, and wildlife management. The Bush Administration requested $779.3 million for this account in FY2009, $170.6 million less than FY2008. The House Committee recommended $888.0 million, $108.7 million above the FY2009 request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $927.3 million for Water and Related Resources, $39.3 million more than the House recommendation. P.L. 111-8 provides $920.3 million for the Water and Related Resources Account; $29.6 million less than enacted in FY2008. The largest funding difference is for the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin's Garrison Diversion Unit, with the Senate recommending $64.4 million and the House recommending $18.5 million. P.L. 111-8 provides $64.4 million, the same as the Senate recommendation. Reclamation played a significant role in building large dams and water diversion structures in the West. The Bureau of Reclamation manages numerous dams and water projects in 17 western states, providing water for irrigation, farmland, and millions of people. They are the largest wholesale water supplier in the region and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Reclamation's facilities also offer flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but their operations can be controversial due to impacts on fish and wildlife species and conflicts among water users. The Bush Administration requested $32.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account for FY2009. The Bush Administration requested $32.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account (Bay-Delta, or CALFED) for FY2009. This request is similar to Reclamation's FY2008 request of $31.8 million, with the bulk of the funds targeted at environmental water, storage, water quality, and conveyance programs. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $37.0 million for CALFED in FY2009, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $42.0 million. The President's request includes a $5.0 million increase over the House recommendation for the CALFED program, with $40.0 million provided in P.L. 111-8. Reclamation proposed allocating $17.3 million to the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund in FY2009, authorized by the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act. Funding would come from a reallocation of $7.5 million in receipts from the Friant Division water users and other sources. Reclamation planned to redirect $7.5 million in receipts from Friant Division water users to the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund in FY2009. However, authorizing legislation was not enacted, and the funds were reallocated to other Central Valley Project Restoration Fund programs. Congress directed Reclamation to use the $7.5 million in its anadromous fish screening program under existing authorities since legislation for the fund transfer was not passed. Reclamation redirected $7.5 million from Friant Division water users to the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund in FY2009. However, without legislative authorization, the funds were reallocated to other programs. Congress instructed Reclamation to use the funds for anadromous fish screening under existing authorities. The FY2009 budget includes funding for security program activities, antiterrorism measures, and emergency security upgrades. The requested amount for guard and patrol activities is $20.1 million, with $12.2 million from power customers and $7.9 million from appropriated funds. Both House and Senate Committees recommended $29.0 million for site security, with $28 million included in P.L. 111-8. Reclamation proposed a new program for FY2009. Reclamation proposed a new program called the Water for America Initiative in FY2009, with a funding request of $31.9 million. This initiative aims to address increased demand, aging infrastructure, and water availability issues in the West. It would incorporate existing programs like Water 2025 and the Water Conservation Field Services program. The funding would be used for strategic planning and endangered species programs. Reclamation's Water for America Initiative in FY2009 requested $31.9 million to address water issues in the West. $8.0 million would go towards planning for the nation's water future, with funds split between basin studies and water supply investigations. The remaining $23.9 million would be allocated to expanding, protecting, and conserving water resources, including challenge grants, water conservation programs, and endangered species efforts. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommend $19.0 million for the Water for America Initiative in FY2009. The total request was $31.9 million, with $12.9 million potentially unfunded. $22.0 million was funded for Endangered Species Recovery Implementation, which may include the endangered species component of Water for America. P.L. 111-8 provides $15.1 million for the Water for America Initiative and $20.1 million for Endangered Species Recovery Implementation in FY2009. In FY2009, the Energy and Water Development bill funded DOE programs, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons. The Bush Administration requested $25.9179 billion for DOE programs, with the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommending $27.2174 billion and $27.0417 billion respectively. P.L. 111-8 funds various programs including fossil fuels, energy efficiency, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. President Bush's 2008 State of the Union address set goals to strengthen energy security and confront global climate change. The Advanced Energy Initiative aimed to reduce America's dependence on imported energy sources through hydrogen, biofuels, and solar energy initiatives. The DOE administers various programs with different functions and missions, funded at $26.9670 billion in FY2009. The AEI focused on hydrogen, biofuels, and solar energy initiatives supported by EERE programs. The Hydrogen Initiative aimed to develop hydrogen technology for commercialization by 2020. The Biofuels Initiative aimed to make cellulosic ethanol cost competitive by 2012. The Solar America Initiative aimed to lower the cost of solar energy and make it competitive with conventional electricity by 2015. The FY2009 budget allocated $1,255.4 million for EERE programs. The FY2009 budget allocated $1,255.4 million for EERE programs. The request proposed significant cuts, including the elimination of congressionally directed assistance, reduction in Facilities construction spending, and cutting funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program. In contrast, the House Appropriations Committee recommended $2,531.1 million for DOE's EERE programs, representing a substantial increase over the FY2008 appropriation and the DOE request. The Committee recommended a $381.5 million increase for R&D programs and $259.2 million more for energy assistance programs, with $250.0 million allocated to the Weatherization Program. Additionally, $500.0 million was recommended for new assistance programs authorized by the Energy Independence and Security Act. The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program would receive $295.0 million in start-up funding, the Renewable Fuel Infrastructure Program would receive $25.0 million, and the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Program would receive $30.0 million for grants. The Manufacturing Program under EISA would receive $30.0 million for factory conversion grants and $1 billion in loan authority for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program. Additional EISA-related funding includes $25 million for advanced biofuels production and $33 million for zero net energy commercial buildings. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $134.7 million for Congressionally Directed Assistance and included policy directives for DOE to report annually on the return on investment for EERE program funding accounts. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,928.3 million for EERE, which is $205.9 million (12.0%) more than the FY2008 appropriation and $672.9 million (53.6%) more than the request. DOE would make up to $20 million of EERE funds available for local projects to reduce electricity demand, prioritize projects with local cost-share, water use reduction, or greenhouse gas emissions reduction. DOE would also implement a minority outreach program at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions to support the renewable energy marketplace. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,928.3 million for EERE, which is $205.9 million more than the FY2008 appropriation and $672.9 million more than the request. The main difference with the House Appropriations Committee report was the proposed funding for new programs, with the Senate recommending less funding for EERE programs overall. The Senate report suggested decreases for various technology programs compared to the House report, including reductions in renewable energy R&D and energy efficiency programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended higher funding levels for various programs, including Weatherization, Industrial Technologies, and Vehicle Technologies. Both committees disagreed with funding the Asia Pacific Partnership and called for the Biomass program to focus on non-food sources for biofuels development. The Senate Committee report emphasized R&D efforts on algae as a biofuels source. The continuing resolution funded programs at the FY2008 rate with additional funding for the weatherization program and to leverage a one-time $25 billion. The FY2009 budget included $250 million for DOE's weatherization program and $7.5 billion to help U.S. automakers produce energy-efficient vehicles. The House recommended $149.3 million for the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, while the Senate recommended $166.9 million. The law allocated $16.8 billion for EERE program accounts, with $2.5 billion for R&D programs, including $800 million for the Biomass Program. The FY2009 budget allocated $2.5 billion for R&D programs, including $800 million for the Biomass Program and $400 million for the Geothermal Program. Additionally, $5.0 billion was provided for the Weatherization Grants Program, $3.1 billion for the State Energy Program, and $3.2 billion for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program. $4.5 billion was allocated to the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability for grid modernization and related technologies. The law also appropriated $1.93 billion for EERE programs. The FY2009 budget allocated $1.93 billion for EERE programs, with $228.8 million for congressionally directed projects. $33 million was provided for the Commercial High Performance Buildings Program, and $137.0 million for OE programs. $870.8 million was allocated for nuclear energy research and development, including advanced reactors and fuel cycle technology. The total nuclear energy funding was $61.6 million below the Bush Administration's request. The FY2009 budget allocated $1.419 billion for DOE's mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication facility, representing a significant increase in funding for various nuclear energy projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee fully funded the MOX project at $487.0 million but placed it under the National Nuclear Security Administration's Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation. This resulted in a total funding of $803.0 million for the Office of Nuclear Energy, slightly below the requested amount. The Office of Nuclear Energy received $803.0 million in funding for FY2009, $50.6 million below the request. The nuclear energy R&D program aims to develop new technologies for energy and climate goals. Critics argue that the program provides wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out. The increased funding for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) was intended to support the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) to develop technologies for recycling uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) as rushed, poorly-defined, and expensive, eliminating all funding for the program. However, they increased funding for advanced nuclear reactors. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $50.3 million for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) out of the proposed $122.1 million increase. President Bush's administration faced challenges with nuclear energy funding. President Bush's Administration faced challenges with nuclear energy funding, with the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) being \"zeroed out\" but funding for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) continued. Efforts to restart the nuclear construction pipeline focused on the Nuclear Power 2010 Program, which aims to encourage new commercial reactor construction. The program will cover up to half of the industry's costs for seeking regulatory approval, applying for licenses, and preparing plant designs. The Standby Support Program, authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, is included to pay for regulatory delays and encourage orders for advanced versions of existing commercial nuclear plants. Two industry consortia are receiving DOE assistance for designing and licensing new reactors. Industry consortia are receiving DOE assistance to design and license new nuclear power plants. DOE awarded the first funding in 2004 and requested $241.6 million for Nuclear Power 2010 for FY2009. The funding increase would accelerate design activities for the Westinghouse AP1000 reactor and the General Electric ESBWR. The House Appropriations Committee recommended holding the program's funding level at $157.3 million, while the Senate recommended the full request. P.L. 111-8 provided $177.5 million, $84.1 million below the request but $43.7 million above the FY2008 level. The Nuclear Power 2010 program aims to test the \"one-step\" licensing process for nuclear power plants. Industry consortia, funded by DOE, are working on licensing applications for new reactors. Dominion Resources is leading a consortium preparing a COL for the GE ESBWR at the North Anna plant in Virginia. Dominion Energy submitted a COL application for a new unit at North Anna in 2007. Energy submitted a COL application for a new unit at North Anna in 2007. NuStart Energy Development, including Exelon, announced plans for reactors at Bellefonte and Grand Gulf. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program funds the Bellefonte COL review. DOE's Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative requested $70.0 million for FY2009, $44.9 million less than FY2008. The FY2009 budget request for nuclear energy was $36.1 million, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending an increase to $200.0 million. The Senate panel recommended the requested level, and P.L. 111-8 provided $177.5 million. Most of the request was for Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) research and development, focusing on Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) technology. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $196.0 million for NGNP, with plans to accelerate work on Phase I research until 2011. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes $1.25 billion through FY2015 for NGNP development and construction, based on research conducted by the Generation IV program. AFCI aims to develop nuclear fuel cycles to reduce spent nuclear fuel hazards and recover additional energy. Research will focus on UREX+ separations technology for uranium and other elements. The FY2009 AFCI funding request for technology called UREX+ was $301.5 million, above the FY2008 appropriation. AFCI includes R&D on reprocessing technology and fast reactors for reprocessed plutonium. The House Appropriations Committee recommended cutting AFCI to $90.0 million in FY2009, eliminating GNEP funding. The remaining funds would be used for advanced fuel cycle technology research, not for new facility construction. The Committee urged DOE to coordinate fuel cycle research with countries with spent fuel recycling capability. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $229.7 million for AFCI, focusing on advanced fuel separation and fabrication. P.L. 111-8 provides $145.0 million for the program and eliminates GNEP funding. FY2009 funding of $10.4 million was requested for conceptual design work on an Advanced Fuel Cycle Facility (AFCF) to demonstrate AFCI technologies. Removing uranium from spent fuel would reduce the volume of nuclear waste for disposal in a repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The UREX+ process could also decrease the heat generated by nuclear waste. The potential solution to reduce the heat generated by nuclear waste involves removing cesium and strontium for separate storage and decay over several hundred years. Plutonium and other long-lived elements would be fissioned in accelerators or fast reactors to decrease the long-term hazard of nuclear waste. The economic viability of this waste processing method is still undetermined, and it faces opposition on nuclear nonproliferation grounds. However, proponents believe it is proliferation-resistant due to the need for further purification to make plutonium usable for weapons and the high radioactivity of the plutonium mixtures making it difficult to divert or work with. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) aims to recycle spent fuel from nuclear reactors to expand the future nuclear fuel supply and reduce radioactive waste. The concept involves leasing fuel to nations that agree to forgo uranium enrichment and spent fuel recycling facilities. The leased fuel would be returned to supplier nations for reprocessing, with high-level waste sent back to the user nation. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty guarantees the right to develop fuel cycle facilities, as outlined in the GNEP Statement of Principles signed by the United States and 15 other countries in 2007. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) signed by the United States and 15 other countries in 2007 aims to recycle spent fuel to expand the nuclear fuel supply and reduce waste. The program includes research and development on an Advanced Burner Reactor (ABR) to destroy recycled plutonium and other radioactive elements. DOE requested $18.0 million for the ABR program for FY2009, focusing on developing a sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR). The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the ABR in FY2009. DOE requested $16.6 million for the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative in FY2009 to support President Bush's program for hydrogen-fueled vehicles. The House Appropriations Committee provided the full request, while the Senate panel recommended $10.0 million. P.L. 111-8 allocated $7.5 million for the program. DOE also requested $487.0 million for the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, a 75% increase from the FY2008 funding level. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations act shifted funding for the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina to the DOE nuclear energy program. DOE proposed to shift the program's funding to the Other Defense Activities account for FY2009. The House Appropriations Committee recommended that the funding remain under the nuclear energy account, while the Senate Appropriations Committee transferred the project back to the nuclear nonproliferation program. The Committee recommended establishing an Integrated University Program to support nuclear research and provide grants to maintain university programs. $45.0 million would be appropriated to various offices, with $15.0 million going to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Bush Administration requested $765.3 million for Fossil Energy Research in FY2009. The FY2009 budget request for Fossil Energy Research included a 33% increase over the previous year. Programs in Natural Gas Technology, Petroleum-Oil Technology, and Cooperative R&D were left unfunded, with the termination of some programs rated as ineffective. The FutureGen project aimed to demonstrate clean coal-based power generation with CO2 capture and sequestration. In early 2008, the DOE announced a restructuring of the FutureGen project to focus on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies for clean coal-based power generation. The \"Restructured FutureGen\" program proposed collaboration with industry and anticipated awards ranging from $100 million-$600 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $853.6 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development Programs, a 13.8% increase over the request. The Fossil Energy Research and Development Programs received a 13.8% increase in funding, with major categories including Carbon Capture Demonstration Initiative, Carbon Sequestration, Fuels and Power Systems, and others. The Senate Committee recommended increasing the President's budget request. The Senate Committee recommended increasing the President's budget request by $122.7 billion for Carbon Sequestration development, totaling $876.7 billion. Funding allocations include $232.3 million for Clean Coal Power Initiative, $412.1 million for Fuels and Power Systems, and $32.7 million for congressionally directed programs. Additionally, $876.3 million is appropriated for fossil energy research and development under P.L. 111-8, with $288.2 million available for Clean Coal Power Initiative Round III solicitation. In FY2009, $3.4 billion was allocated for DOE fossil energy programs through the American Recovery and Investment Act of 2009. This funding included $1.0 billion for research and development, $800.0 million for Clean Coal Power Initiative Round III, $1.52 billion for industrial carbon capture projects, $50.0 million for site characterization activities, $20.0 million for geologic sequestration training, and $10.0 million for program direction. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to store nearly 700 million barrels of crude oil in caverns in Louisiana and Texas. Its current capacity is 727 million barrels, authorized at 1 billion barrels, to provide an emergency oil source. A Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) was established during the Clinton Administration with 2 million barrels of home heating oil. Appropriations for SPR ceased in the mid-1990s, and fillings since FY1999 have been with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil deliveries. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was filled with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil deliveries instead of cash royalties, totaling 140 million barrels by FY2007. Deliveries for FY2008 were estimated at 19.1 million barrels, but were suspended by H.R. 6022 in May 2008. The Bush Administration requested $346.9 million for the SPR in FY2009. The Administration sought funding in FY2008 to expand the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) capacity to 1 billion barrels by adding capacity at existing sites and establishing a new site in Mississippi. Congress approved $186.8 million for FY2008, less than the requested $331.6 million. The House Committee on Appropriations estimated it would cost $10 billion to create additional capacity and $105 billion to fill it by 2027. Doubling the size of the Reserve was deemed not worth the cost. For FY2009, the Committee recommended funding at $172.6 million, $171.4 million less than the Administration request. The Senate Committee recommended $205 million, including funds for new site expansion activities. The Bush Administration requested $9.8 million for the NHOR in FY2009. The Bush Administration requested $9.8 million for the NHOR in FY2009, a reduction of $2.5 million from the FY2008 enactment. Both House and Senate committees agreed to the Administration request. P.L. 111-8 sets spending for the SPR at the levels recommended by the Senate, as well as providing $9.8 million for the NHOR. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas. The America COMPETES Act authorized the establishment of a new Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014Energy. The America COMPETES Act authorized the establishment of a new Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014Energy (ARPA-E) separate from the Office of Science to support energy technology research projects. Funding for the Office of Science in FY2009 saw a significant increase due to the American Competitiveness Initiative, with the House recommending $4.862 billion and the Senate recommending $4.640 billion. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $1.6 billion for the Office of Science and $400 million for ARPA-E. In FY2009, funding for the Office of Science saw a significant increase due to the American Competitiveness Initiative, with the House recommending $4.862 billion and the Senate recommending $4.640 billion. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $1.6 billion for the Office of Science and $400 million for ARPA-E. The requested funding for basic energy sciences was $1.568 billion, up 23% from FY2008, with increases for Energy Frontier Research Centers, National Synchrotron Light Source II construction, and facility operating time expansion. In the 110th Congress, the House committee recommended $1.600 billion for the Office of Science, including increases for facility operating time at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and NSLS-II. The Senate committee recommended $1.415 billion, with transfers and reductions. P.L. 111-8 provided $1.572 billion, including an increase for EPSCoR. The request for high-energy physics was $805 million, up 17% from FY2008, with increases for programs previously reduced in FY2008. The request for high-energy physics in the 110th Congress included $805 million, up 17% from FY2008, with increases for programs previously reduced in FY2008. Additionally, the request for biological and environmental research was $569 million, up 4%, with the bulk of the increase allocated for climate change modeling. The House and Senate committees recommended the requested amounts for high-energy physics, and P.L. 111-8 provided $796 million in funding. The Senate committee recommended $599 million for research, with increases for climate change research and nuclear medicine. P.L. 111-8 provided $602 million, including increases for climate change research and nuclear medicine. The request for nuclear physics was $510 million, with funding for isotope production and construction of an upgrade at CEBAF. Fusion energy sciences received a request of $493 million, up 72%. The request for fusion energy sciences was $493 million, up 72%, with the majority of the increase allocated to the U.S. share of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France. Despite the final appropriation only providing $10 million for related R&D in FY2008, the project's planned start was not immediately impacted. The ITER partners are China, the European Union, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the United States, with the U.S. share of construction costs estimated to be between $1.45 billion and $2.2 billion. In FY2014-FY2017, the House committee recommended $499 million for fusion energy sciences, with a $6 million increase to revitalize the program. The Senate committee recommended the requested amount. P.L. 111-8 provided $403 million, $90 million less for ITER, and no funding for NCSX project. The request for advanced scientific computing research was $369 million, with a majority funding a new Applied Mathematics-Computer Science Institute. In the 110th Congress, the House committee recommended $379 million, an increase of $10 million. In the 110th Congress, the House committee recommended $379 million for laboratory infrastructure, including an increase for excess facilities disposition, modernization, and construction. The Senate committee recommended the requested amount. P.L. 111-8 provided $145 million. Additionally, $15 million was recommended for ARPA-E in the Science appropriation, with $400 million provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $400 million for a separate appropriations account. P.L. 111-8 provided $15 million for the Science appropriation. DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management is responsible for developing a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The FY2009 OCRWM budget was cut to $288.4 million, significantly below the Bush Administration request and FY2008 levels. The FY2008 funding reductions led to a reduction in OCRWM's workforce by about 900 employees. Despite the funding cuts, OCRWM submitted a license application for the Yucca Mountain repository in 2008. The deep funding cut in FY2009 reflected the Obama Administration's budget outline for FY2010, scaling back nuclear waste funding to necessary costs for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's consideration of the license application. Funding for the nuclear waste program comes from the Nuclear Waste Fund, with an additional allocation requested by the Administration. The Nuclear Waste Fund received $145.4 million, and the Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal account received $143 million under P.L. 111-8. Yucca Mountain is designated as the sole candidate site for a national geologic repository according to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. Congress approved the Yucca Mountain project in 2002 to proceed to the licensing phase. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act required DOE to start accepting waste by January 31, 1998. Utilities have won court cases against DOE for missing deadlines and may receive $11 billion in liability payments if waste is received by Yucca Mountain in 2020. Congress established the DOE Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program in 2005 for energy projects using new technologies to reduce emissions. The DOE used new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and guaranteed repayment of up to $38.5 billion in loans for energy projects. Funds were allocated for nuclear power plants, coal projects with carbon capture, renewable energy, and uranium enrichment facilities. DOE requested an extension of the loan guarantee authority in FY2009. The DOE allocated $38.5 billion in loan guarantee authority for energy projects through FY2010 and FY2011. An additional $4 billion in loan guarantee authority with no expiration date was provided in the FY2007 DOE appropriation. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increasing the loan guarantee authority to $47 billion, with allocations for nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, carbon capture, and sequestration projects. The House panel allocated $19.9 million for administrative funding, with $2 billion for coal, $2 billion for carbon capture and sequestration, and $2 billion for uranium enrichment. The Senate Appropriations Committee maintained the $38.5 billion loan guarantee authority from FY2008 but recommended removing time limits. P.L. 111-8 adopted a $47 billion funding level with $4 billion previously approved. Time limits on loan guarantee authority were eliminated, and $19.9 million was allocated for administrative funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee included $355 million in appropriations for possible future government costs from loan guarantees. An additional $60 billion in loan guarantees for renewable energy projects was provided by the economic stimulus legislation. Project sponsors under this legislation do not have to pay up-front fees for potential loan defaults. $6 billion was appropriated to cover these costs. $10 million was provided for administrative expenses for DOE loans to the U.S. auto industry. Congress established the Stockpile Stewardship Program in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration, aims to preserve the core competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons by ensuring the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile through various activities. This program is funded through the Weapons Activities account and includes Directed Stockpile Work, Campaigns, and Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities. NNSA also manages programs outside of Weapons Activities such as Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation and Naval Reactors. Most stewardship activities occur at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories. The nuclear weapons complex managed by the National Nuclear Security Administration consists of three laboratories and four production sites, along with the Nevada Test Site. The Complex has undergone reductions since the Cold War, with Congress pushing for further changes to reduce personnel, costs, increase efficiency, security, and decrease the footprint at each site. The National Nuclear Security Administration's Complex has been undergoing reductions since the Cold War, with Congress pushing for changes to reduce costs, increase efficiency, security, and decrease the footprint at each site. In response, NNSA submitted a report to Congress in January 2007 on its plan for transforming the Complex, \"Complex 2030.\" The House Appropriations Committee expressed displeasure with the plan and demanded a comprehensive nuclear defense and nonproliferation strategy before considering further funding for Complex 2030 and the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The Senate Appropriations Committee and Congress expressed concerns about NNSA's plans for the Complex, rejecting premature deployment of the consolidation effort. NNSA announced Complex Transformation in December 2007, aiming to reduce the weapons program footprint by one-third and close or transfer 600 activities. The Complex Transformation plan aims to reduce the weapons program footprint by one-third, close or transfer 600 structures, reduce weapons workers by 20-30%, dismantle weapons more rapidly, and build new facilities. This plan is detailed in a Draft Complex Transformation Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement from January 2008. The House Appropriations Committee requires completion of certain steps before considering funding for new programs or changes to the nuclear weapons complex. The committee recommended focusing on a 21st Century nuclear deterrent strategy, determining the size and nature of the nuclear stockpile and weapons complex needed for future security needs. Funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program was eliminated, and the Senate Appropriations Committee also recommended cutting funds for RRW and making changes to individual programs. The Complex Transformation program involves direct work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile. The Defense Stockpile Work (DSW) involves monitoring, maintaining, and modifying existing warheads, including Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs and W76 warheads. The budget for these programs in FY2008 and FY2009 was specified, with plans for production and extension of the W76 warhead. The NNSA plans to ramp up production in FY2009, with the first life-extended W76 entering the stockpile in February 2009. The budget for Stockpile Systems in FY2008 was $340.1 million, with the FY2009 request at $338.7 million. The two largest programs under stockpile systems are for the B61 and W76 warheads. The Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition program aims to reduce the stockpile to the lowest level consistent with national security. The Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition program (WDD) aims to modernize programs without signaling a return to the Cold War arms race. It involves interim storage, dismantlement, and disposition of warheads. The budget for FY2008 was $134.7 million, FY2009 request was $183.7 million, and P.L. 111-8 provided $190.2 million. The major activity within WDD is the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF), which converts plutonium in pits to plutonium oxide for use in nuclear reactors. The project also includes a Waste Solidification Building (WSB) for waste disposal. In FY2009, NNSA plans to begin construction of Waste Solidification Building (WSB) to convert liquid wastes from PDCF and MFFF into solids for disposal off-site. NNSA also plans to manufacture stockpile-quality pits for the W88 warhead at Los Alamos National Laboratory, with a goal of increasing production capacity to 50 to 80 pits per year. The budget for Stockpile Services was $692.4 million. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program aims to develop a new warhead to replace W76 warheads, focusing on ease of manufacture, cost reduction, and certification without nuclear testing. Supporters believe RRW can achieve these goals, while critics raise concerns about technical issues and nuclear proliferation. Congress eliminated FY2008 funds for RRW development, and for FY2009, NNSA requested $10.0 million for certifying RRW. P.L. 111-8 did not provide any funds for this purpose. The House Appropriations Committee recommended providing funds for Life Extension Programs and Stockpile Systems in its report on FY2009 energy-water appropriations. It also suggested increasing Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition funds by $6.0 million and reducing Stockpile Services by $273.1 million to the FY2008 level. RRW funds were recommended to be eliminated. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended full funding for Life Extension Programs and Stockpile Systems in FY2009, eliminating funds for RRW and increasing Weapons Dismantlement by $22.0 million. They also reduced funds for Stockpile Services by $43.6 million. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2009, P.L. 110-329, does not provide NNSA funds for RRW. Section 104 prohibits the use of funds for projects not available in fiscal year 2008. Section 101 appropriates necessary amounts for continuing projects from fiscal year 2008. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 and subsequent appropriations Acts did not provide funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program. These efforts support scientific knowledge and technical work on the nuclear weapons stockpile, including improving warhead performance assessment and maintaining nuclear weapons laboratories. Campaigns also fund experimental facilities like the National Ignition Facility. The FY2009 request included five Campaigns, including the Science Campaign which aims to maintain confidence in the U.S. nuclear stockpile by pursuing the science underlying nuclear weapons performance and aging. NNSA seeks a predictive capability for the entire nuclear explosive package by 2020 through this campaign, which includes components like Advanced Certification to certify warheads without testing. The Science Campaign within the FY2009 budget aimed to maintain confidence in the U.S. nuclear stockpile by pursuing nuclear weapons science. NNSA had the ability to conduct a nuclear test within 24-36 months due to budgetary pressures. The FY2008 budget was $287.6 million, with a request for $323.1 million in FY2009. The House Appropriations Committee praised NNSA's Stockpile Stewardship program as a technically superior alternative to nuclear testing, deeming nuclear testing a non-executable mission. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $331.1 million for the nuclear testing campaign, with an increase of $8.0 million for subcritical and other experiments. They supported the Advanced Certification program to enhance warhead design changes for safety and reliability without underground testing. The committee suggested reducing nuclear test readiness funding to $5.4 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $331.1 million for the nuclear testing campaign, with an increase of $8.0 million for subcritical and other experiments. They supported the Advanced Certification program to enhance warhead design changes for safety and reliability without underground testing. The committee suggested reducing nuclear test readiness funding to $5.4 million. Additionally, the committee allocated $150.0 million for the weapons surety campaign, with a focus on developing means to assess weapons design, manufacturing, and certification, as well as detecting and assessing stockpile aging. The committee provided $70.0 million for advanced surety and barred the use of funds for RRW, while recommending an increase of $20.0 million for the campaign. The committee supported weapons surveillance sensors for broad applications and the Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign, including the National Ignition Facility (NIF). NIF completion is expected in 2009 with a budget of $421.2 million in FY2009. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $453.2 million for the Advanced Simulation and Computing Campaign, which develops computation-based models of nuclear weapons. The FY2009 request was $561.7 million, and P.L. 111-8 provided $556.1 million. The report on the bill expressed concerns about the lack of detail in NNSA's computing strategy. The NNSA's computing strategy is a concern due to potential budget constraints. The Senate Appropriations Committee requested a report on the shared computing strategy and expressed frustration over the lack of information. There are worries about declining investment in computing platforms for national security labs. The Readiness Campaign focuses on improving manufacturing safety and efficiency, with subprograms for high explosives and weapons components. The Tritium Readiness program focuses on producing tritium for nuclear weapons. The budget for FY2008 was $158.1 million, with a request of $183.0 million for FY2009. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction of $25.0 million, mainly from unobligated balances. The program funds infrastructure and operations at nuclear weapons complex sites, with a budget of $1,637.4 million for FY2008 and a request of $1,720.5 million for FY2009. Operations of Facilities is the largest subprogram, with a budget of $1,154.5 million for FY2008 and a request of $1,212.9 million for FY2009. The FY2008 budget for the Tritium Readiness program was $158.1 million, with a FY2009 request of $183.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $25.0 million reduction. The program funds infrastructure and operations at nuclear weapons complex sites, with a FY2008 budget of $1,637.4 million and a FY2009 request of $1,720.5 million. The largest subprogram is Operations of Facilities, with a FY2008 budget of $1,154.5 million and a FY2009 request of $1,212.9 million. Other programs include Program Readiness, Material Recycle and Recovery, and Construction, with the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building Replacement (CMRR) Project being the most costly and controversial. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the CMRR project in the FY2008 budget, stating it could hinder nuclear complex transformation without a clear mission. The Senate Appropriations Committee highlighted safety issues with the existing CMR facility and potential delays due to spending cuts. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding reductions for various nuclear facility projects, including the Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility and the Uranium Processing Facility at the Y-12 Plant, citing inadequate justification and lack of clear requirements. They also recommended no funds for two other projects due to a lack of defined strategy. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding reductions for various nuclear facility projects, including the Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility and the Uranium Processing Facility at the Y-12 Plant, citing inadequate justification. They also recommended an increase of $24.8 million for the CMRR program to make up for previous funding shortfalls. Additionally, the Committee supported the Nuclear Weapons Incident Response program with a budget of $221.9 million for FY2009. The Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program focuses on addressing repair and infrastructure projects to enhance the operational efficiency of the NNSA nuclear weapons complex. The NNSA aims to increase operational efficiency and effectiveness in the nuclear weapons complex. The FY2008 budget was $180.0 million, with a reduction to $147.4 million in P.L. 111-8. Environmental Projects and Operations focus on reducing risks at NNSA facilities, with a budget of $8.6 million in FY2008 and $38.6 million in P.L. 111-8. Transformation Disposition aims to eliminate excess facilities, with no funds in FY2008 and a request for FY2009. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $77.4 million for a new program aimed at reducing costs in NNSA facilities, despite the lack of an overall strategy. The Senate Appropriations Committee, however, recommended eliminating the entire request, expressing frustration with DOE and OMB's funding priorities. P.L. 111-8 provided no funds for this program. The Safeguards and Security program consists of two elements: Secure Transportation Asset for nuclear weapons transport and Defense Nuclear Security for protective forces and security systems. The FY2008 budget was $211.5 million, with a request of $221.1 million for FY2009. P.L. 111-8 provided $214.4 million for Secure Transportation Asset and $735.2 million for Defense Nuclear Security. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding amounts for Cyber Security in FY2008 and FY2009. P.L. 111-8 provided $121.3 million for FY2009. Concerns about Safeguards and Security increased after 9/11, with a shift towards denying access to warheads. Ambassador Linton Brooks highlighted the threat of terrorist suicide teams seeking to detonate warheads. The shift in security measures for nuclear weapons sites has increased costs, leading to proposed changes to reduce expenses. The DOE's nonproliferation and national security programs support efforts to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation. Funding for these programs in FY2008 was reduced compared to FY2007 levels. The Administration proposed moving the MOX and Pit Disassembly plants from the Fissile Materials Disposition program to other parts of DOE in FY2009. The House bill recommended $1.530 billion, while the Senate bill allocated $1.422 billion and added $487 million for the Mixed Oxide plant project. Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program funding decreased from $387.2 million in FY2008 to $275.1 million in FY2009. Nonproliferation and International Security programs received a request of $140.5 million for FY2009. The FY2009 budget for nonproliferation and international security programs was $140.5 million, with the House recommending $165.3 million and the Senate proposing $175.5 million. The International Materials Protection, Control and Accounting program received $624.5 million in FY2008, with a request of $429.7 million for FY2009. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aimed to dispose of U.S. surplus materials. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. Funding for the program has been controversial due to lack of progress on disposing of Russian plutonium. The Administration requested $609.5 million for the program in FY2008, including $393.8 million for construction. The House Appropriations Committee declared the bilateral agreement a failure, as Russia decided to pursue fast breeder reactors instead of using light water MOX reactors for plutonium disposition. The committee recommended transferring the MOX plant and PDCF to different programs, reducing the net appropriation for the NNSA's Fissile Materials Disposition program. The FY2008 omnibus funding act adopted the House position, reducing funding to $66.2 million. For FY2009, the Bush Administration requested $41.8 million, which was appropriated in P.L. 111-8. The DOE established the Office of Environmental Management in 1989 to oversee the cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites and facilities. This cleanup effort involves disposing of radioactive and hazardous wastes, managing surplus nuclear materials, remedying soil and groundwater contamination, and decommissioning excess buildings. Over 100 federal facilities in the US were involved in nuclear weapons production and energy research, covering a total land area of over 2 million acres. The DOE oversees cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites and facilities, covering over 2 million acres. Cleanup is ongoing at some facilities for many years, with estimated costs between $205.43 billion and $260.53 billion. The last facility, Hanford, may not be cleaned up until 2062. Additional funds will be needed for long-term operation and maintenance to protect human health and the environment. The Office of Environmental Management is responsible for cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites and facilities, with estimated costs between $205.43 billion and $260.53 billion. Some facilities have been transferred to other offices within DOE and the Army Corps of Engineers. Cleanup of smaller, less contaminated facilities under FUSRAP is transferred to the Corps, with long-term activities managed by DOE's Office of Legacy Management. The Office of Legacy Management oversees long-term activities at facilities cleaned up under the Office of Environmental Management. FY2009 appropriations for DOE offices and the FUSRAP program are discussed, including emergency supplemental appropriations in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. P.L. 111-8 provides $5.99 billion for the Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup, and Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund accounts. The $5.99 billion payment to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund from the Defense Environmental Cleanup account is a $297 million increase above the FY2008 enacted amount. The FY2009 budget request proposed $5.53 billion, but P.L. 111-5 provided $6.00 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations. This funding doubles the Office of Environmental Management's annual appropriations and aims to stimulate the economy through cleanup projects. DOE is responsible for allocating $6.00 billion in supplemental funds among cleanup projects, with a deadline of September 30, 2010. Obligating such a large sum in less than two years poses administrative challenges and raises concerns about contract competitiveness and meeting cleanup deadlines. In FY2009, meeting cleanup milestones was a key issue in the funding debate. The Bush Administration acknowledged a $900 million shortfall for the Office of Environmental Management, risking missed milestones. Cleanup milestones are crucial for addressing risks at facilities, set in agreements with DOE, EPA, and state agencies. Meeting deadlines depends on funding availability, technical feasibility, and regulatory issues. The availability of funds is not the sole factor determining DOE's ability to meet cleanup deadlines. Hanford, the largest and most complex facility under the Office of Environmental Management, receives significant funding. The controversy surrounding Hanford's funding includes potential risks from radionuclides migrating through the area. The delayed construction of the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant at Hanford is a key issue due to potential risks of radionuclides migrating into the Columbia River. This plant is crucial for treating high-level radioactive waste from underground tanks at Hanford. Similar waste treatment challenges exist at the Idaho National Laboratory and the Savannah River facility. The FY2009 emergency supplemental funds are primarily allocated for addressing these cleanup challenges. The FY2009 emergency supplemental funds for the Office of Environmental Management were mainly for defense facilities like Hanford. DOE could allocate a large portion of these funds to defense cleanup projects at Hanford, increasing the total amount available for FY2009. Table 13 compares appropriations for FY2008, President Bush's FY2009 budget request, FY2009 emergency supplemental appropriations, and FY2009 omnibus appropriations for the Office of Environmental Management. It provides a breakdown of funds for selected facilities and activities with broad congressional interest. The FUSRAP program addresses cleanup of sites contaminated with low-level radiation from uranium and thorium processing during the early U.S. nuclear weapons program. Private companies operated these facilities from the 1940s to the 1960s under DOE's predecessors. The Federal Facility Cleanup Program (FUSRAP) was established in 1974 under the Atomic Energy Act and later incorporated into the Office of Environmental Management in 1989. Congress directed DOE to transfer FUSRAP to the Army Corps of Engineers in 1997 for cleanup, with funding provided through a dedicated account within the Corps' civil works budget. Funding for FUSRAP in FY2009 was $140 million, with an additional $100 million in emergency supplemental appropriations. The $100 million in supplemental funds for FUSRAP is intended to stimulate the economy by hiring workers for cleanup projects funded by the Corps. The Corps must allocate the funds based on specific conditions and timing limitations, with quarterly reports required to be submitted to Congress. The $6.00 billion in supplemental funds for the Office of Environmental Management does not require quarterly reports to Congress. Once a facility is cleaned up under DOE's Office of Environmental Management or the FUSRAP program, responsibility for long-term activities is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management. This office also manages pensions and benefits for former contractor personnel. In FY2009, the Office of Legacy Management received $186.0 million in funding, which is $2.9 million less than the previous year. All facilities under the office are now funded under the \"Other Defense Activities\" account of DOE, including those involved in the U.S. nuclear weapons program. Prior to FY2009, funding for non-defense facilities was separate but now combined into one account. Despite a slight decrease in funding from FY2008, the needs are still being met. The Office of Legacy Management received slightly less funding in FY2009 compared to FY2008. However, funding needs are expected to increase as more sites are transferred for long-term operation and maintenance activities. The Power Marketing Administrations were established to sell power generated by dams for various water resource management purposes. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) prioritize selling power to \"preference customers\" like municipal utilities and cooperatives at low rates. The Bush Administration's FY2009 request for PMAs was $232.1 million, a 3.5% reduction from FY2008. Individual requests for SEPA, SWPA, and WAPA were $7.4 million, $28.4 million, and $193.3 million respectively. Additionally, $3.0 million was requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance. In FY2008, WAPA, SEPA, and SWPA proposed assigning \"Agency Rates\" to new obligations. In FY2008, WAPA, SEPA, and SWPA proposed assigning \"Agency Rates\" to new obligations, but this proposal was not enacted. BPA, a self-funded agency, has increased its borrowing authority to $4.45 billion in FY2003. BPA expects to use $269 million of borrowing authority in FY2008 and $301 million in FY2009. Any third-party funding agreements may restrict BPA's use of borrowing authority. In FY2008, BPA proposed using secondary net revenues over $500 million for advance amortization payments to the Treasury on bond obligations. The House and Senate Committees recommended funding levels for PMAs in FY2009, with no new borrowing authority for BPA. The Senate panel allocated $218.3 million for WAPA, an increase from the President's request and House recommendation. The Senate Committee on Appropriations allocated $25 million more than the President's request and House recommendation for WAPA. Concerns were raised about WAPA relying too heavily on alternative financing methods, which could impact transmission system reliability. Drought and increased power prices may lead to higher funding requirements for Purchase Power and Wheeling. Other agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. The NRC requested $1.017 billion for FY2009, a $90.9 million increase from FY2008. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested a total funding level of $1.046 billion for FY2009, including $10.0 million for the inspector general. The budget included $237.5 million for new reactor activities to handle anticipated new nuclear power plant license applications. Higher fossil fuel prices and incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 led to electric utilities announcing plans for over 30 reactor license applications in the coming years. Utilities plan to submit over 30 reactor license applications in the next few years, with the first application submitted in September 2007. The NRC budget for FY2009 includes funding for licensing the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, with the application submitted in June 2008. Additional funding was allocated for scholarships, the NRC inspector general, and an Integrated University Program coordinated with the DOE. The total funding for Yucca Mountain licensing in P.L. 111-8 is $49.0 million. The NRC's FY2009 budget request included $279.0 million for reactor oversight and incident response activities, such as safety inspections and security oversight. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees, with exceptions for certain expenditures. The FY2009 request had offsets resulting in a net appropriation of $161.5 million, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending $199.2 million and the Senate panel proposing $163.1 million. The NRC's FY2009 budget request included $279.0 million for reactor oversight and incident response activities. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a net appropriation of $199.2 million, while the Senate panel proposed $163.1 million. Net appropriations for NRC in P.L. 111-8 total $174.9 million, including the inspector general's office. Various CRS reports provide detailed information on water resources development and projects. The CRS reports cover a range of topics including water use conflicts in the Klamath River Basin, phosphorus mitigation in the Everglades, hydrogen and fuel cell vehicle R&D, nuclear energy policy, nuclear power plant security, civilian nuclear waste disposal, radioactive waste classification, and advanced nuclear power technologies. The CRS reports cover various topics such as water use conflicts, phosphorus mitigation, hydrogen and fuel cell vehicle research, nuclear energy policy, power plant security, nuclear waste disposal alternatives, radioactive waste classification, and advanced nuclear technologies."
