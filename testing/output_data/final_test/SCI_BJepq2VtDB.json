    "content": "NovoGrad is an adaptive stochastic gradient descent method with layer-wise gradient normalization and decoupled weight decay. It outperforms well-tuned SGD with momentum and Adam/AdamW in experiments on various neural network tasks. NovoGrad is robust to learning rate and weight initialization, works well in large batch settings, and has a smaller memory footprint than Adam. Adam is commonly used for NLP and speech problems but can have drawbacks such as vanishing or exploding second moments. NovoGrad is an algorithm proposed to improve Adam regularization by replacing the element-wise second moment with the layer-wise moment, computing the first moment using normalized gradients, and decoupling weight decay from normalized gradients. It combines the strengths of SGD and Adam and has been applied successfully to image classification, neural machine translation, language modeling, and speech recognition tasks. NovoGrad, a Stochastic Normalized Gradient Descent optimizer, outperforms Adam/AdamW and SGD with momentum in neural machine translation, language modeling, and speech recognition tasks. It updates weights based on the direction of the stochastic gradient, making it robust to vanishing and exploding gradients. SNGD with layer-wise gradient normalization scales up small gradients while keeping large gradients unchanged. Adaptive methods like Adam generalize worse than SGD with momentum. Adam's weak regularization is addressed by various techniques such as limiting the factor 1 \u221a vt, proposing AdamW to decouple weight decay, and introducing AdaFactor algorithm to replace the full 2nd moment. These methods aim to improve generalization and memory efficiency compared to traditional optimization algorithms like SGD with momentum. NovoGrad is a memory-efficient optimization algorithm proposed by Shazeer & Stern (2018) that uses layer-wise 2nd moments for gradient normalization and decoupled weight decay. It reduces memory usage compared to traditional methods like SGD with momentum. NovoGrad is an optimization algorithm that uses layer-wise 2nd moments for gradient normalization and decoupled weight decay. It reduces memory usage compared to traditional methods like SGD with momentum. The algorithm involves adding the weight decay term to the normalized gradient before computing the moment. The parameters include the initial learning rate, moments, weight decay, and number of steps. The weights are updated similarly to SGD with momentum. The algorithm can be improved by applying the \"AMS-Grad\" fix for Adam to guarantee convergence. NovoGrad is used to train a linear model with two linear layers without non-linearity. The model output should be 1 when x = 1. The loss function is not convex and has minima on the hyperbola w1w2 = 1. Different optimization algorithms were used to train the model for 500 steps, showing training trajectory and minima locations. NovoGrad is the most stable algorithm out of four tested. It closely follows the minima curve and exhibits better generalization. Adam and AdamW show oscillations, while SGD slightly deviates from the optimal solution. NovoGrad is also more robust to variations in learning rate, weight decay, and weight initialization. In experiments using ResNet-50 v2 for ImageNet classification, NovoGrad outperformed other algorithms like SGD with momentum and AdamW. The models were trained with a batch size of 1024 for 100 epochs using standard data augmentation methods. The best accuracy achieved after hyper-parameter search was reported for AdamW. NovoGrad outperformed other algorithms like SGD with momentum and AdamW in experiments using ResNet-50 v2 for ImageNet classification. The models were trained with batch sizes of 8K and 32K for 90 epochs using cosine LR decay. Results showed that increasing both the learning rate \u03bb and weight decay d improved regularization, leading to better performance. NovoGrad outperformed other algorithms like SGD with momentum and AdamW in experiments using ResNet-50 v2 for ImageNet classification. Increasing both the learning rate \u03bb and weight decay d improved regularization, leading to better performance. NovoGrad achieved top1 accuracy of 75.99% and top5 accuracy of 92.72% using warm-up (500 steps) with Jasper-10x5, a deep convolutional neural acoustic model. NovoGrad outperformed SGD and Adam in training Jasper-10x5 on LibriSpeech. Batch sizes of 512 to 8K were used with linear LR scaling and LR warmup. Batch sizes of 16K and 32K required increased weight decay. Batch 16K had comparable WER to the baseline, while batch 32K had higher WER due to fewer training steps. NovoGrad outperformed Adam in training Transformer-XL on word-level WikiText-103. The model was trained for 12 billion tokens, showing improved performance on the test set with longer training. NovoGrad exhibited a smaller gap between training and validation perplexity compared to Adam. The study used a 12-layer Transformer-big model with 185M parameters for experiments on WMT 2014 English-to-German benchmark. Different optimization algorithms were tested with dropout rates, mixed-precision training, and gradient accumulation. Checkpoint averaging was not used, and results were reported for the last checkpoint in each run. The model is a linear function of inputs but non-linear in weights due to factorization. The weights of the model are factorized into the product of layers' weights. Training involves minimizing the non-convex loss function, with good \"flat\" minima near points (\u22121, \u22121) and (1, 1) and bad \"sharp\" minima near axes. The 2D-contour plot of the loss function illustrates this behavior. The study will analyze how different optimization algorithms perform based on learning rate, weight decay, and initialization, with training conducted for 500 steps using the same parameters. NovoGrad, Adam, AdamW, and SGD with momentum were compared using the same learning rate, weight decay, and weights initialization. NovoGrad showed the most stability, better generalization, and converged closely to the minima curve. Adam oscillated wildly, while AdamW behaved better with reduced oscillations. SGD was slightly off from the optimal solution. Training trajectories for the baseline parameters were analyzed, showing different behaviors for each optimizer. NovoGrad is more robust than other algorithms in terms of learning rate, weight decay, and weight initialization choices. It converges closely to the minima curve and demonstrates high stability and generalization compared to Adam, AdamW, and SGD with momentum."
