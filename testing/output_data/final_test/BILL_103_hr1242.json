    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Small Property and Casualty Insurance Company Equity Act of 1993\" and refers to amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It includes a provision for a small company deduction. The Small Property and Casualty Insurance Company Equity Act of 1993 includes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, specifically regarding a small insurance company deduction. This deduction allows for 60 percent of tentative taxable income up to $3,000,000 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1992. The small insurance company deduction is reduced by 15 percent of taxable income exceeding $3,000,000. The deduction is not allowed for insurance companies with assets equal to or greater than $500,000,000. Assets refer to all company assets, and their valuation is considered for this purpose. For small insurance companies, the deduction is reduced by 15% of taxable income over $3,000,000. The deduction is not available for companies with assets of $500,000,000 or more. Assets include real property, stock, and other assets based on fair market value or adjusted basis. Interests in partnerships or trusts are not considered assets, but the company is deemed to own its share of assets held by them. The term 'tentative taxable income' is defined as taxable income without considering the small insurance company deduction. This excludes items related to noninsurance businesses, which are activities not classified as insurance businesses. Noninsurance activities can be treated as insurance business if they are traditionally carried out by insurance companies for investment purposes or involve administrative services for property or casualty insurance plans. There is a limitation on the amount of loss from noninsurance business that can offset income from insurance business. In computing taxable income for insurance companies subject to tax, any loss from a noninsurance business is limited. Controlled groups of insurance companies are treated as one entity for small insurance company deductions, allocated based on their respective incomes. In computing taxable income for insurance companies, controlled groups are treated as one entity for small insurance company deductions. Adjustments are made to prevent excess detriment or benefit arising from the application of this rule. The amendments made by this Act will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 1992."
