    "content": "The United States has a history of importing foreign temporary workers, known as guest workers, to fill low-skilled or uneducated jobs. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for temporary admission of workers through the H-2A and H-2B visa programs. These programs aim to meet employers' labor needs while protecting both U.S. and foreign workers. Balancing the needs of employers and workers in guest worker programs remains a challenge. The ongoing debates about guest worker programs reflect the challenge of balancing the needs of employers and workers. Some advocate for reform and expansion, while others see the current programs as abusive and in need of overhaul. This report covers the H-2A and H-2B guest worker programs, exploring their statutory and regulatory provisions, including the labor certification process. It also discusses legislative efforts to reform these programs and create new guest worker visas, highlighting key policy considerations for future congressional action. The INA enumerates nonimmigrant visa categories, including the \"H\" category for temporary workers like H-2A and H-2B visas. The H-2 program was subdivided by the IRCA into H-2A for agricultural workers and H-2B for nonagricultural workers. The H-2A and H-2B programs are administered by USCIS and ETA. Employers must apply for labor certification from DOL, then submit a petition to DHS. Approved applicants can apply for a nonimmigrant visa from DOS. The H-2A and H-2B programs are administered by USCIS and ETA. Employers must apply for labor certification from DOL, then submit a petition to DHS. If the visa application is approved, the worker is issued a visa to apply for admission to the United States. DOL's ETA administers the labor certification process under the programs, where employers request certification for a specific number of positions. INA provisions state that an H-2A petition cannot be approved unless certain conditions are met. The H-2A and H-2B programs require labor certification to protect U.S. workers' job, wage, and working conditions. The H-2B visa does not have a statutory labor certification requirement, but DHS regulations mandate it. The certification process involves applying to the Secretary of Labor and obtaining a favorable determination. The H-2A visa program allows temporary admission of foreign workers for agricultural labor in the U.S. It is governed by provisions in the INA and regulations issued by DHS and DOL. The program has grown significantly over the last 25 years without a statutory numerical limit. The H-2A program has grown significantly in the last 25 years, with a sharp increase in the number of visas issued annually. Employers must apply for labor certification from DOL before obtaining H-2A visas, subject to conditions outlined in INA \u00a7218. The H-2A program requires employers to recruit U.S. workers before hiring foreign workers. Employers must follow INA provisions, including the fifty percent rule, and cannot apply for labor certification more than 45 days before the need for workers. The H-2A program requires compliance with recruitment and certification requirements, including providing housing for workers. DOL must issue labor certification 30 days before the employer's date of need if eligible U.S. workers are not available. Regulations by DHS and DOL govern the H-2A visa program to ensure employer compliance. The DHS rule on the H-2A visa aims to provide agricultural employers with legal workers while reducing reliance on unauthorized workers. Employers must show that the work is temporary or seasonal. H-2A workers can enter the US one week before the job starts and stay 30 days after it ends. Employers can apply to extend a worker's stay in one-year increments. The H-2A visa allows for a worker's stay in increments of up to one year, with a maximum of three consecutive years. After three years, the worker must leave the country for three months before seeking readmission. Participation in the program is limited to nationals of designated countries, and payments to employers for H-2A employment are prohibited. DOL regulations include requirements for labor certification before petitioning for H-2A workers. Before petitioning for H-2A workers, employers must certify that U.S. workers are unavailable and that hiring foreign workers won't harm U.S. workers' wages or conditions. ETA regulations outline the process for H-2A employers to recruit U.S. workers, starting with submitting a job order to the state workforce agency. Once the labor certification application and job order are approved by ETA, the job order is posted on the interstate clearance system for U.S. workers to apply. The agency authorizes access to the interstate clearance system and posts the job order on its electronic job registry. Employers must conduct recruitment through newspaper ads and contacting former U.S. workers. H-2A employers must offer required wages and benefits, pay the highest wage rate, provide a three-fourths guarantee, housing, transportation, and workers' compensation insurance. ETA enforces compliance with labor certification obligations and may conduct audits of approved applications. The Department of Labor (DOL) enforces H-2A visa regulations, including revoking certifications or debarring employers. The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) ensures H-2A employer compliance with obligations to workers, conducting investigations and imposing penalties. ETA issued separate regulations in 2015 for herding and range livestock production, establishing special standards for hiring H-2A workers. The H-2B visa allows for the temporary admission of foreign workers to the US for nonagricultural work when local workers are unavailable. The program is not limited to workers of a specific skill level, with landscaping and groundskeeping being the top certified occupation in recent years. The H-2B visa program allows for the temporary admission of foreign workers to the US for nonagricultural work. Top certified occupations include landscaping and groundskeeping, forest and conservation work, amusement and recreation attendance, and maid and housekeeping cleaning. The H-2B visa has a statutory annual numerical limit of 66,000, with exemptions in certain years. Visa issuances have fluctuated over the years, peaking in FY2007 and reaching a recent low in FY2009 before trending upward. The H-2B visa program has specific requirements for employers, including providing return transportation for dismissed workers and paying a fraud prevention fee. DHS can delegate enforcement authority to DOL, and there is a statutory numerical limit on H-2B visas. The H-2B visa program has a cap of 66,000 visas per fiscal year, with 33,000 allocated in the first half. Certain returning H-2B workers were exempt from the cap in FY2005, FY2006, FY2007, and FY2016. In FY2017, visas can be issued beyond the cap under certain conditions. DHS and DOL regulations implement the H-2B visa provisions. The H-2B visa program allows for the temporary entry of foreign workers to the United States based on specific criteria. Employers must demonstrate that the need for the worker will end in the near future and falls under categories like seasonal, peakload, or intermittent needs. Workers can stay for up to three years, with extensions possible in one-year increments. Total stay for an H-2B worker cannot exceed three consecutive years. The H-2B visa program allows for the temporary entry of foreign workers to the United States based on specific criteria. Workers can stay for up to three years, with extensions possible in one-year increments. An H-2B alien must be outside the country for three months before seeking an extension or readmission. DHS regulations limit participation to designated countries and prohibit payments for H-2B employment. Enforcement authority has been transferred to DOL for compliance with petition conditions. The H-2B visa program requires a two-part labor certification process for employers to hire temporary foreign workers. Employers must submit an H-2B registration 120-150 days before the initial date of need and receive approval before filing a labor certification application. Registration approval can be valid for up to three years. (As of now, the registration process is not operational). Labor certification applications with a period of employer need of more than nine months require additional scrutiny. The H-2B visa program requires a two-part labor certification process for employers to hire temporary foreign workers. Employers must submit an H-2B registration 120-150 days before the initial date of need and receive approval before filing a labor certification application. Labor certification applications with a period of employer need of more than nine months will generally be denied as they are considered permanent positions. The regulations also limit job contractors' participation in the program to cases where they can demonstrate their own temporary need for workers. Employers must submit a labor certification application to ETA and a job order to the SWA for the H-2B visa program. ETA will review the submissions and direct the SWA to post the job order for recruitment of U.S. workers. Employers must conduct recruitment efforts, offer required wages and benefits, and pay workers the prevailing wage rate or minimum wage. They must also provide a three-fourths guarantee similar to the H-2A program. Employers in the H-2B visa program must offer a three-fourths guarantee for payment of wages, reimburse transportation and visa costs, and provide workers' compensation insurance. ETA and WHD enforce employer compliance with labor certification and worker rights. Since the 1990s, legislative proposals have been introduced to reform guest worker programs for both agricultural and nonagricultural workers. The 113th Congress last considered major guest worker reform legislation, with the Senate passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included provisions for new temporary agricultural workers. WHD is responsible for investigating and enforcing employer obligations to H-2B and U.S. workers, including penalties and debarment. In recent years, legislative action has focused on reforming guest worker programs, particularly the H-2A and H-2B visas. Proposed bills aim to establish new worker visas, reform existing visa programs, and address issues such as temporary need, U.S. worker recruitment, wages, and housing. Legislation in the 115th Congress included changes to the H-2B visa, such as a permanent exemption from the numerical limit for returning workers. Legislative focus on worker programs has centered on the H-2B visa, with provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 exempting returning H-2B workers from the cap and providing additional time for seafood industry employers to bring in workers. The Act also specified prevailing wage determinations and temporary need definitions for H-2B admission. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) includes provisions related to H-2B visas, such as exemptions for returning workers from the cap, prevailing wage determinations, and definitions for temporary need. It also allows for an increase in the number of H-2B visas in FY2017 if American businesses cannot find enough U.S. workers. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 includes provisions related to H-2B visas, such as exemptions for returning workers from the cap and prevailing wage determinations. Guest worker programs aim to balance employer needs for temporary labor with protections for U.S. and foreign workers. The Department of Labor seeks to strike a balance between reducing processing times and protecting U.S. worker access to job opportunities. The H-2A and H-2B programs involve DOL making determinations on labor certification applications and DHS adjudicating nonimmigrant visa petitions. While prospective H-2A employers must apply to DOL for labor certification, the requirement for H-2B labor certification by DOL is established by regulation. The 2015 DHS/DOL interim final rule on H-2B employment explains DOL's role in labor certification for the program. DOL is the expert agency for labor issues related to H-2B, ensuring that unemployed U.S. workers are not available before approving H-2B petitions. Previous proposals aimed to remove DOL's role for efficiency, but were withdrawn due to opposition. Legislation has proposed changes to the H-2A visa program, shifting labor certification applications from the Secretary of Labor to the Secretary of Agriculture. Guest worker programs may also reduce the Department of Labor's role, with key administrative responsibilities going to the Secretary of Agriculture. The process of labor certification is required for employers interested in hiring foreign workers under the H-2A and H-2B programs, aiming to protect job opportunities for U.S. workers. Labor certification is a process by the Department of Labor (DOL) to determine if qualified U.S. workers are available for a job and if hiring foreign workers will impact U.S. workers. Recruitment is used to assess U.S. worker availability. The process has been criticized for being slow, expensive, and ineffective. Changes in the rules under the Obama Administration in 2010 and 2015 shifted the labor market test for H-2A and H-2B programs. The Department of Labor (DOL) shifted from a labor certification process to an attestation-based certification process to simplify the process for employers while ensuring protections for U.S. and foreign workers. This change aimed to address criticisms of the previous complicated and resource-intensive process. The 2011 DOL proposed H-2B rule highlighted concerns about insufficient worker protections in the current attestation-based model used by employers. Legislative guest worker proposals often include labor attestation requirements, either replacing or modifying existing labor certification processes. Some proposals suggest eliminating the current labor certification application step in favor of incorporating labor attestation requirements into the process. The H-2A and H-2B programs require employers to offer wages at or above specified levels to prevent adverse effects on U.S. workers. Wage requirements have been a key area of controversy, with the 2015 DHS/DOL interim final rule on H-2B wages issued after years of challenges. Policy differences about H-2A wage requirements center on the AEWR. Policy differences regarding H-2A wage requirements focus on the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR), which is unique to the H-2A visa program. Advocates argue that the AEWR is necessary to protect U.S. agricultural workers from wage depression caused by hiring foreign workers, while employers claim it results in inflated wage rates. Proposals to reform the H-2A program often include provisions to eliminate or redefine the AEWR. The H-2A and H-2B programs are designed for temporary or seasonal work to meet employers' short-term labor needs when U.S. workers are unavailable. Legislative proposals seek to expand the H-2A program to include year-round agricultural activities and amend the definition of the H-2A visa. The H-2B program requires the employer's need for workers to be temporary, seasonal, peakload, or intermittent. Some past proposals aimed to broaden the H-2B visa. The H-2B visa program is statutorily capped at 66,000 annually, with certain exemptions. Numerical limitations are implemented by DHS at the petition stage. When calculating numerical limitations for the H-2B visa program, USCIS will prioritize petitions in the order they are filed and make projections based on historical data. USCIS will notify the public of the final receipt date when the necessary number of petitions is received to meet the numerical limit. This process aims to ensure the appropriate number of foreign workers receive visas or status under the program, despite challenges in estimation. Challenges arise in estimating the demand for H-2B visas, leading to fluctuations in petition acceptance. In some years, USCIS has accepted too many petitions, exceeding the cap, while in others, they accepted too few and had to reopen the window briefly. To address demand exceeding supply, a temporary provision exempts certain H-2B returning workers from the cap, allowing for increased admissions while maintaining the 66,000 annual limit. The H-2B visa program faces challenges with estimating demand, leading to fluctuations in petition acceptance. A temporary provision exempts certain H-2B returning workers from the cap, allowing increased admissions while maintaining the 66,000 annual limit. The INA allows for the admission of spouses and minor children of foreign workers on H-2A, H-2B, and other \"H\" visas, issued H-4 visas that do not count against the numerical cap. This provision enables families to stay together but has been criticized for reducing incentives for guest workers to return home. Some legislative proposals have considered prohibiting family members from accompanying or joining principal aliens. The INA authorizes enforcement actions for guest worker programs, such as imposing penalties and seeking compliance with employment terms. The Secretary of Labor has authority over the H-2A program, while the Secretary of Homeland Security oversees the H-2B program. Enforcement measures include administrative remedies and denial of petitions for non-compliance or misrepresentation. The Secretary of Labor delegated enforcement authority to WHD for H-2B employment compliance. Regulatory provisions require H-2A and H-2B employers to notify DHS of worker issues within two days. The H-2A and H-2B visa programs require employers to notify DHS of worker issues promptly. Suggestions to ensure workers depart on time include involving their home countries and creating incentives for timely departure. These programs account for a small portion of foreign nationals in the US. Unauthorized workers make up a significant percentage of workers in certain industries like farming and construction. There are debates about shifting unauthorized workers into legal channels for economic benefits, but concerns exist about competition with U.S. workers. Discussions about legalizing unauthorized workers often intersect with guest worker programs, particularly in the agricultural sector. Guest worker reform provisions have been paired with agricultural worker legalization provisions in legislative proposals, such as the comprehensive immigration reform bill passed by the Senate in 2013. This bill proposed a two-stage agricultural worker legalization program for farm workers to obtain legal temporary resident status and eventually apply for lawful permanent resident status. Policymakers argue that the H-2A and H-2B visa programs are not meeting employers' labor needs or adequately protecting workers. Proposed solutions have varied over the years. In the current climate, policymakers are likely to pursue reforms to existing visa programs like H-2A and H-2B visas. In FY2015, DOL approved 5,112 H-2B labor certification applications for a total of 101,765 positions, with a majority in landscaping & groundskeeping worker occupation. The H-2A visa program is governed by DHS and DOL final rules issued in 2008 and 2010. In 2015, a separate DOL rule applied to H-2A employment in livestock production. The rules were implemented to streamline the program after unsuccessful attempts at immigration reform legislation. The DOL rule was controversial as it changed the labor certification process. The 2008 rule replaced a supervised process with an attestation-based process for H-2A program compliance. Under the Obama Administration, the 2008 DHS rule was retained, but the 2008 DOL rule was replaced in 2010 due to concerns about employer noncompliance. The new rule aimed to defer determinations of program compliance until after an application has been submitted. The 2010 DOL H-2B final rule reversed changes made by the 2008 rule to the H-2A labor certification process and reestablished the compliance-demonstration process. The H-2B visa program is governed by a DHS rule issued in 2008 and a DHS/DOL rule issued in 2015, which revised prevailing wage rate calculations. Under the Bush Administration, final rules were published in 2008 to amend H-2B regulations, streamlining the labor certification process. Compliance determinations for the H-2B program were deferred until after an application was submitted. In 2012, DOL issued a replacement H-2B final rule requiring employers to demonstrate compliance with recruitment and other program requirements due to concerns about noncompliance and lack of worker protections. In 2012, DOL issued a rule requiring employers to demonstrate compliance with recruitment and program requirements. This rule was never implemented due to court action. In April 2015, DOL and DHS issued a new interim final rule on H-2B employment to clarify the authority for regulations in this area."
