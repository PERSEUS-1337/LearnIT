    "content": "Immigrant eligibility for major public assistance programs has been a contentious issue in Congress. The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act significantly restricted noncitizen eligibility for public assistance, affecting legal permanent residents, refugees, and asylees. Unauthorized aliens, or \"illegal aliens,\" remained ineligible for federal public assistance. The 1996 welfare reform act allowed states to set welfare policies for noncitizens, giving them options to restrict or expand benefits. As Congress considers reauthorization, the issue of state restrictions or expansions for noncitizen assistance arises. This report examines state options for covering noncitizens under TANF, funding for noncitizen assistance, and TANF receipt by state. Noncitizens' eligibility for TANF depends on their immigration status and arrival date. LPRs entering after August 22, 1996, are barred for five years, with exceptions for those with a substantial work history or military connection. Refugees and asylees are eligible for TANF for five years upon entering the United States. Noncitizens' eligibility for TANF depends on their immigration status and arrival date. LPRs entering after August 22, 1996, are barred for five years, with exceptions for those with a substantial work history or military connection. Refugees and asylees may be eligible for TANF after a five-year term. Nonimmigrants and unauthorized aliens are not eligible for TANF. LPRs can become citizens through naturalization after living in the US for five years. Estimates show that the naturalization rate for immigrants ranges from 30% to 49%, with a median of 8 to 10 years between becoming an LPR and naturalizing as a U.S. citizen. California, New York, and Texas are the top states where new LPRs intend to live, with California having the highest number of new LPRs at 31.5% during the period. The percentage of new LPRs in California and New York slightly decreased from 1988-1996 to 1997-2002, indicating a wider dispersion of new LPRs to other states. The data on Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) admitted from FY1988-FY2002 by state of intended residence shows that California, New York, Texas, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Virginia, Washington, and Maryland are the top states where new LPRs intend to live. Other states with more than 1% of new LPRs include Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, Connecticut, and Ohio. The data has limitations as it does not account for people who subsequently move or LPRs who arrived before 1988 or have become U.S. citizens. States may have different policies regarding LPRs' eligibility for benefits like TANF. LPRs entering the United States after August 22, 1996, are barred for five years from TANF, food stamps, Medicaid, and the Social Services block grant. After five years, states decide if LPRs can receive benefits. Refugees and asylees are eligible for TANF benefits for five years, with the option for state benefits afterward. As of December 2002, 34 states and Washington, D.C. reported providing TANF to LPRs after the five-year bar ends. Thirty-five states and Washington, D.C. have also provided TANF to LPRs present in the United States before. In 2000 and 2002, states maintained consistent policies on LPR eligibility for TANF. 34 states and Washington, D.C. provided TANF to asylees and refugees present in the U.S. before 1996, while only 27 states and Washington, D.C. extended TANF to those who exceeded the five-year limit. Some states did not respond to this question. In 2000 and 2002, states had consistent policies on LPR eligibility for TANF. West Virginia was the only state to change its policy, providing TANF to asylees and refugees in 2000 but not in 2002. 27 states and Washington, D.C. used both state and federal funds to cover TANF costs for LPRs present before 1996. 26 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands did the same for LPRs excluded or with expired eligibility.

State assistance to noncitizens is funded through the \"maintenance of effort\" (MOE) requirement. State assistance to noncitizens is funded through the \"maintenance of effort\" (MOE) requirement, with $10.4 billion in MOE funds nationally compared to $16.5 billion in TANF grants. Some states use their state MOE money to provide public assistance to newly arriving LPRs who are barred from federal TANF, while others use it to provide TANF to LPRs who had exhausted their eligibility. In 2002, eight states used their state MOE funds to assist noncitizens who were excluded or had expired eligibility. The percentage of noncitizens receiving TANF dropped from 12.3% in 1996 to 8.0% in 2001. Many states have extended coverage to certain classes of LPRs. Many states have extended coverage to certain classes of LPRs, mitigating the effects of federal bars enacted in 1996. California had the highest percentage of noncitizen TANF recipients in 2001, followed by New York, Texas, and Minnesota. In 2001, California had the highest percentage of noncitizen TANF recipients, followed by New York, Texas, and Minnesota. States with larger shares of LPRs were more likely to have expanded state-level TANF policies for noncitizens. Confusion persists among the public regarding the eligibility of noncitizens for various programs due to the term \"qualified alien\" used in the 1996 welfare law. Despite specific regulations on \"public charge,\" there is a belief that receiving public benefits could impact a noncitizen's immigration status or ability to sponsor family members for immigration. This uncertainty may be discouraging eligible immigrants from participating in these programs."
