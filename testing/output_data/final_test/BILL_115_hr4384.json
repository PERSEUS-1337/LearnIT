    "content": "The Act to Sustain the Protection of Immigrant Residents Earned through TPS Act of 2017, also known as the ASPIRE-TPS Act of 2017, introduces protected status for certain aliens present in the United States under section 244A of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The ASPIRE-TPS Act of 2017 grants protected status to eligible aliens who meet specific criteria, including continuous residence in the US for five years prior to January 1, 2017, and admissibility as an immigrant. The ASPIRE-TPS Act of 2017 provides protected status to eligible aliens who meet certain criteria, including continuous US residence for five years before January 1, 2017. Protected status lasts for 6 years and can be renewed for additional 6-year periods. Aliens must register during a one-year registration period and re-register with the Secretary for renewal. The Secretary will inform aliens granted temporary protected status or Deferred Enforced Departure about their eligibility under the ASPIRE-TPS Act of 2017. If removal proceedings are initiated against an alien from a designated country, the Secretary will notify them about the availability of protected status under this section. The Secretary will notify aliens in removal proceedings from designated countries about the availability of protected status under the ASPIRE-TPS Act of 2017 in a form and language they can understand. Eligible aliens can receive temporary treatment under this section. The Secretary will provide work authorization to eligible aliens who establish a prima facie case of protected status under the ASPIRE-TPS Act of 2017 until a final determination is made, and will not initiate removal proceedings during this time. The Secretary will authorize eligible aliens for work under protected status, with work authorization effective throughout the status period. A reasonable fee, not exceeding $50, may be required for registration, with an additional fee for work authorization documentation. The Secretary may withdraw protected status from an alien if they are found ineligible or fail to register every 36 months. Brief, casual, and innocent absences from the US will not be considered a break in continuous residence. For renewal of protected status, absences from the US of one year or less do not break residency requirement, but longer absences do unless the applicant proves they did not abandon their US residence. The Secretary is prohibited from disclosing or using information provided for enforcing immigration laws. Aliens granted protected status cannot be referred to immigration enforcement agencies, except for cases involving Federal security and law enforcement assistance. During a period of protected status under this section, aliens are considered qualified for certain benefits, can travel abroad without prior consent, and are subject to penalties for unauthorized disclosure or use of information. During a period of protected status under this section, aliens are considered qualified for certain benefits, can travel abroad without prior consent, and are subject to penalties for unauthorized disclosure or use of information. For adjustment of status under section 245 and change of classification under section 248, the alien is considered as having been inspected and admitted into the United States, and as maintaining lawful status as a nonimmigrant. The Secretary cannot deny protected status based on immigration status or require an alien to relinquish nonimmigrant status or execute any waiver of rights. Granting protected status is not inconsistent with granting nonimmigrant status. The Secretary of Homeland Security can adjust the status of an alien to that of a lawful permanent resident if the alien meets eligibility requirements, proves extreme hardship, and submits an application. Numerical limitations do not apply to this adjustment. The Secretary of Homeland Security can adjust an alien's status to that of a lawful permanent resident under certain conditions. Protected status granted to an alien under this section does not prevent them from seeking review of a denial or asserting eligibility for status in removal proceedings. SEC. 3. TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS CLARIFICATIONS. Amends definitions of \"conviction\" and considers aliens as inspected and admitted into the United States. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to submit a report every 90 days to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate regarding the number of aliens applying for protected status, approval rates, demographics of aliens with protected status, and any additional relevant information."
