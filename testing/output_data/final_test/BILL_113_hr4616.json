    "content": "The \"Express Appeals Act\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. It includes a pilot program on express appeals. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will implement a pilot program for an alternative appeals process to expedite appeal determinations. Claimants can choose to file an express appeal by submitting necessary documents and a statement of argument. Under the pilot program, claimants can elect to make an appeal at any time during the traditional appeal process or within 90 days of receiving notice of the determination of the claim. Under the pilot program, claimants can elect to change a traditional appeal to an express appeal. The Secretary will inform the claimant of any time savings and process the express appeal if chosen. Claimants can revert to the traditional appeals process at any time without penalty, except for losing the docket number. Under the pilot program, claimants can choose to switch to an express appeal for disability compensation. The Secretary will provide information on the pilot program, how to make the election, required documents, and the option to seek advice during the appeals process. Under the pilot program, claimants can opt for an express appeal for disability compensation. The Secretary will provide information on the process, including the ability to seek advice from veterans service organizations and attorneys. Upon choosing the express appeal, the claimant will not receive a statement of the case or need to file a substantive appeal, with jurisdiction transferred directly to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. The Board will maintain express appeals separately from traditional appeals. Under the pilot program, claimants can opt for an express appeal for disability compensation. The Board of Veterans' Appeals will hear express appeals in the order received and decide not more than one express appeal for every four traditional appeals. If new evidence is submitted after filing an express appeal, the claimant can either revert to the traditional appeals process or withdraw the new evidence and continue with the express appeal. If a claimant withdraws new evidence, the Secretary will inform them of the option to use it for a petition to reopen the claim or for an increased rating. The Board of Veterans' Appeals will handle additional information needed for an express appeal without remanding to the regional office. The Board of Veterans' Appeals may not provide hearings for express appeals, but claimants can request a hearing if they revert to the traditional appeals process. The Secretary will ensure claimants receive necessary information and a 45-day period to provide additional evidence. The Secretary will conduct a five-year pilot program for express appeals, starting one year after the Act's enactment. Reports on the program must be submitted annually to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs. Definitions for \"claimant\" and \"compensation\" are provided in the section. The term \"express appeal\" refers to an appeal of a claim for disability compensation filed by a claimant in accordance with specific guidelines. The term \"traditional appeal\" is used for appeals that do not meet the criteria for an express appeal."
