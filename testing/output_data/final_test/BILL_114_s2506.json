    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Restoring Statutory Rights and Interests of the States Act of 2016\". Congress finds that the Federal Arbitration Act was necessary to enforce private arbitration agreements for commercial disputes, without infringing on rights granted by Congress for resolving disputes in courts. Recent court decisions, such as AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion and American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant, have broadly preempted rights and remedies established under State and Federal law. This has allowed business entities to avoid legal duties created by congressional enactment, preventing millions of people from vindicating their rights in courts. States have a strong interest in enacting protections for their citizens, and the Federal Arbitration Act should not preempt State legislation. In enacting the Act, Congress aims to reaffirm the authority of congressional and State legislative bodies in creating rights and remedies for all citizens. It clarifies that these rights cannot be waived before a dispute arises and reinstates existing rights regarding access to courts that may have been diminished. The Act reaffirms the authority of legislative bodies in creating rights and remedies for citizens, clarifying that these rights cannot be waived before a dispute arises. SEC. 3 addresses the arbitration of federal statutory causes of action. The Act reaffirms legislative authority in creating rights and remedies that cannot be waived before a dispute arises. Section 2 of title 9, United States Code, is amended to exclude arbitration requirements for claims related to alleged violations of federal or state statutes, the US Constitution, or state constitutions unless agreed upon after the claim arises. The Act reaffirms legislative authority by excluding arbitration requirements for claims related to violations of federal or state statutes, the US Constitution, or state constitutions. The phrase 'grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract' includes statutes or court findings that deem arbitration agreements unconscionable or unenforceable. A court, not an arbitrator, determines the validity of an agreement to arbitrate under this chapter. The Act amends Section 10(a) of title 9, United States Code to vacate an arbitration award made in violation of section 2. The Act and its amendments will be effective upon enactment and apply to disputes arising thereafter."
