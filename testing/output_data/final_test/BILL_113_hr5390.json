    "content": "The Act titled \"Donbass People's Militia Terrorist Designation Act of 2014\" designates the Donbass People's Militia as a foreign terrorist organization. The Donbass People's Militia (DPM) is an armed militia aligned with the Donetsk People's Republic in Eastern Europe. They are pro-Russian separatists who have engaged in armed conflict against the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The DPM was implicated in the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 in 2014, resulting in the deaths of 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The United Nations report highlighted the suppression of freedom of expression in eastern Ukraine. According to reports, armed groups in eastern Ukraine are illegally seizing public buildings and committing human rights abuses, including abductions and harassment of journalists. This has led to a breakdown in law and order, creating a climate of intimidation and harassment. Human Rights Watch found that anti-Kiev forces in eastern Ukraine are abducting, attacking, and harassing people suspected of supporting the Ukrainian government. Militants in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic have taken hostages, causing over 100,000 Ukrainians to flee as refugees. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that approximately 54,000 citizens have been internally displaced. The organization must be foreign and engage in terrorist activity that threatens the security of United States nationals or national security. The Donbass People's Militia is considered to meet the criteria for designation as a foreign terrorist organization. The Donbass People's Militia should be designated as a foreign terrorist organization under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. If not done within 60 days, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the reasons. Sanctions will be imposed on individuals who provide support to the Donbass People's Militia or its affiliates. The President will impose sanctions on individuals in the US who support the Donbass People's Militia or its affiliates. The Secretary of State and Homeland Security will deny visas and entry to members or representatives of the militia or its associated groups. Any alien who is a member or representative of the Donbass People's Militia or its affiliates may be removed from the United States. US financial institutions holding funds related to the militia must report to the Office of Foreign Assets Control."
