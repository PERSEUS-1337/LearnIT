    "content": "The \"Sexually Violent Predators Act\" acknowledges the existence of a dangerous group of sexually violent individuals with antisocial personality features that make them likely to engage in predatory sexual behavior. The Act recognizes the high likelihood of repeat offenses and poor prognosis for curing these predators, necessitating long-term treatment. The \"Sexually Violent Predators Act\" defines key terms related to dangerous sexually violent individuals with antisocial personality features. The \"Sexually Violent Predators Act\" defines terms like mental abnormality, predatory behavior, and sexually violent offenses. The term \"sexually violent predator\" refers to a person convicted of a sexually violent offense and deemed likely to engage in predatory sexually violent offenses due to a mental abnormality or personality disorder. Establishment of program for sexually violent predators. The Attorney General establishes guidelines for State programs to require sexually violent predators to register their current address with law enforcement upon release. States must comply within 3 years of enactment or lose funding. States must implement a program for sexually violent predators to register their address upon release or face a 10 percent funding cut under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Funds not received will be reallocated to compliant states. Upon release, parole, or supervised release, a State program must require registration for individuals deemed sexually violent predators by a court. A board of experts on sexual offenses will make this determination, and notification must be given 90 days before release. Upon release, parole, or supervised release, the officer must inform the individual of their duty to register, provide information on changing residence address requirements, gather personal details and offense history, and have the individual sign a form acknowledging their duty to register under this section. Upon release, parole, or supervised release, the officer must inform the individual of their duty to register and provide information to the state and FBI within 3 days. The state law enforcement agency enters the information into their system and notifies the appropriate jurisdiction. The agency also transmits the information to the FBI's Identification Division. Quarterly verification is required. Quarterly verification requires the designated State law enforcement agency to mail a nonforwardable form to registered individuals every 90 days after release or parole. The individual must return the signed form within 10 days, confirming their current address. Any change of address by a registered individual must be reported to the designated State law enforcement agency and local law enforcement agencies promptly. Failure to return a verification form within 10 days may result in a violation of the law. A person required to register under a State program who knowingly fails to register shall be subject to criminal penalties, including imprisonment for not less than 180 days. The obligation to register terminates when it is determined that the person no longer poses a risk of engaging in predatory sexually violent offenses due to a mental abnormality or personality disorder. The designated State law enforcement agency must release relevant information to protect the public about specific sexually violent predators required to register. Law enforcement agencies, employees, and State officials are immune from liability for good faith conduct under this section."
