    "content": "Restitution in a federal criminal context is the court's order for a defendant to compensate victims of their crimes. Federal courts can only award restitution based on specific statutory sources, such as 18 U.S.C. 3663A for certain offenses. Restitution in federal criminal cases involves ordering a defendant to compensate victims based on specific statutory sources. Federal courts can make restitution a condition of probation or supervised release, with procedures outlined in various statutes. Restitution is determined by the losses suffered by victims, without considering the defendant's financial situation or future prospects. Restitution legislation in the 110th Congress falls into three categories: creating new federal crimes with specific restitution provisions, addressing the consequences of abatement, and providing general revisions to existing law in the area. Restitution is a required consequence of a conviction for property offenses under title 18 of the United States Code. Conviction for intellectual property offenses also results in mandatory restitution orders, following the same procedures as other property offenses. The crimes covered include copyright infringement, trafficking in counterfeit labels, trafficking in sound records, and unauthorized motion pictures. The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act authorizes federal courts to order restitution for victims of identity theft and aggravated identity theft. The Act also covers crimes such as economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, rape, sexual assaults, and violations of civilian court protective orders under the United States Code of Military Justice. Section 234 of the Military Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Act proposed adding a mandatory restitution provision for victims of such offenses. Several proposed bills aimed to address organized retail crime and street gang offenses by making them federal offenses and allowing for mandatory restitution orders under existing federal law. These bills included H.R. 6491, H.R. 880, H.R. 1582, H.R. 1692, S. 456, and S. 990. The proposals sought to amend or augment existing federal laws to permit courts to order restitution as part of the sentence for these offenses. Chapter 109A, 110, and 117 of the United States Code prohibit sexual misconduct. Chapter 109A condemns rape and sexual abuse, Chapter 110 outlaws child exploitation and abuse, and Chapter 117 prohibits interstate travel for illicit sexual purposes. Mandatory restitution provisions exist in Chapter 109A and 110, but not in Chapter 117. Proposed bill H.R. 3148 aimed to add a mandatory restitution provision to Chapter 117. Existing federal law also addresses failures to pay child support and requires restitution upon conviction. H.R. 871 proposed to outlaw failure to pay court-ordered spousal property distribution and require restitution upon conviction. A federal court vacated the conviction of former Enron executive Kenneth Lay but refused to order restitution for the victims due to his death. The court cited the doctrine of abatement recognized by the Fifth Circuit. The Durham Court dismissed a petition for certiorari of a man who died while it was pending, overruling Durham v. United States. Lower federal courts have interpreted this to mean that abatement does not apply to certiorari petitions, but still adhere to the general rule that a defendant's indictment and conviction are treated as if they never occurred upon their death pending appeal. The case is returned to the lower federal court with instructions to vacate the conviction and dismiss the indictment. The circuit courts are divided on whether a restitution order abates upon the death of the defendant pending appeal. Legislation was introduced in Congress to bar abatement of a restitution order, but no further action was taken. S. 149 / H.R. 4111 would have replicated common law abatement for sentencing purposes, where fines, special assessments, and conditions of probation or supervised release would die with the defendant. S. 149 / H.R. 4111 would have allowed for substitution of the defendant's representative in restitution cases and permitted proceedings to continue after the defendant's death. It did not require the government to return funds paid by the defendant, and eased statute of limitations for civil forfeitures while denying abatement doctrine. If the defendant died before sentencing, the bill authorized a sentencing hearing and restitution order, with unclear procedures outlined. S. 149 / H.R. 4111 addressed restitution-related matters in cases where the defendant died after sentencing. It allowed for the continuation of protective orders to prevent asset dissipation for restitution purposes. The bill also established a method for collecting unpaid restitution from the defendant's property after their death. The bill S. 149 / H.R. 4111 addressed restitution-related matters in cases where the defendant died after sentencing. It allowed for the continuation of protective orders to prevent asset dissipation for restitution purposes and established a method for collecting unpaid restitution from the defendant's property after their death, regardless of whether it is included in the defendant's estate. The provision also discusses the prohibition of punishing treason with corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate, as explained by Story in his Commentaries. The attainted person loses all inheritable qualities, preventing them from inheriting or retaining any property. They also forfeit all their lands, tenements, and rights of entry or profits in land. This severe disability extends to their descendants, who are unable to inherit from remote ancestors if the title passes through the attainted person. The curr_chunk discusses the unsatisfactory nature of posthumous punishment on innocent descendants due to the forfeiture of estate and corruption of blood. Some courts suggest that the due process clause prohibits such punishments for crimes. This view is supported by historical legislation and the potential implications of S. 149 / H.R. 4111. The amendments in S. 149 / H.R. 4111 aimed to be effective for criminal cases pending on or after July 1, 2007, potentially impacting crimes prior to that date. The Constitution's ex post facto clause generally prohibits retroactive criminal laws, leading to divided opinions in lower federal courts on restitution amendments. Bills like H.R. 845 and S. 973 / H.R. 4110 proposed significant changes to federal restitution law. The Justice Department proposed bills for modifications to restitution law in the 109th Congress, including expanding offenses for restitution orders, changing procedures for enforcement, and allowing preconviction protective measures. S. 973 / H.R. 4110 closely resembled the proposals. S. 973 / H.R. 4110 closely resembled Justice Department proposals for modifying restitution law in the 109th Congress. H.R. 845 and S. 973 / H.R. 4110 differed in their approach to mandatory and discretionary restitution provisions. H.R. 845 aimed to replace existing statutes, while S. 973 / H.R. 4110 took a more selective approach by integrating changes into current law. H.R. 845 proposed changes to restitution laws by requiring restitution for all federal offenses, expanding the class of victims, crimes, and types of injuries eligible for restitution orders. The court shall order restitution for all federal offenses, including pecuniary loss to identifiable victims resulting from the offense. H.R. 845 did not further define the offenses requiring mandatory restitution but likely intended to cover any criminal offense proscribed by Congress and triable before an Article III court. It may also encompass tribal, military, and territorial offenses or relevant conduct related to qualifying offenses. H.R. 845 proposed redefining the classes of victims entitled to mandatory restitution for federal offenses, expanding it to include identifiable individuals and entities who suffer pecuniary losses caused by the offense. H.R. 845 proposed expanding mandatory restitution for federal offenses to include a wider range of victims, including those who suffer losses as a proximate cause of a qualifying offense. It also allowed for restitution in plea bargains and acknowledged that full restitution for all victims may not always be possible. H.R. 845 proposed expanding mandatory restitution for federal offenses to include a wider range of victims, including those harmed by misconduct collateral to the crime of conviction. This differed from Section 3663A, which allows restitution for individuals directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern, even if not strictly victims of the crime of conviction. H.R. 845 proposed expanding mandatory restitution for federal offenses to include a wider range of victims, including those not considered primary victims under existing law. It aimed to provide restitution to successors and those who suffer losses due to physical injuries caused by the defendant's crime. H.R. 845 aimed to expand mandatory restitution for federal offenses to include a wider range of victims, including successors and those who suffer losses due to physical injuries caused by the defendant's crime. Some courts interpreted the bill as potentially allowing restitution for related costs incurred by the victim's parents or estates. H.R. 845 aimed to expand mandatory restitution for federal offenses to include a wider range of victims, including successors and those who suffer losses due to physical injuries caused by the defendant's crime. The bill would have repealed some existing individual restitution statutes but kept provisions for probation, supervised release, and animal enterprise restitution. Victims defined in survivors statutes and other similar laws were considered victims as otherwise provided by law. H.R. 845 aimed to expand mandatory restitution for federal offenses to include a wider range of victims, merging two existing restitution laws and eliminating distinctions. It called for restitution regardless of the nature of the crime and included coverage for vindication expenses, attorneys' costs, funeral expenses, lost income, medical expenses, and rehabilitation costs. H.R. 845 aimed to expand mandatory restitution for federal offenses to include a wider range of victims, merging two existing restitution laws and eliminating distinctions. It would have extended mandatory restitution to all federal offenses, covering various expenses such as transportation, housing, child care, and attorney fees. H.R. 845 aimed to expand mandatory restitution for federal offenses to include a wider range of victims, merging two existing restitution laws and eliminating distinctions. It would have covered expenses incurred during participation in the investigation and prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings relating to the offense, including income loss calculations. The bill would have left individual features of 18 U.S.C. 43(c) intact, authorizing restitution orders for economic damages beyond the bill's reach. Additionally, H.R. 845 would have repealed subsection 3663(c) and merged sections 3663 and 3663A into a revised section 3663, potentially bringing individual restitution laws such as 18 U.S.C. 228(d) within the coverage of the new law. The bill aimed to expand mandatory restitution for federal offenses, merging two existing laws and eliminating distinctions. It would cover expenses related to the investigation and prosecution of the offense, including income loss calculations. The bill would have repealed subsection 3663(c) and merged sections 3663 and 3663A into a revised section 3663, potentially including other statutes like 18 U.S.C. 228(d) within its coverage. The bill aimed to expand mandatory restitution for federal offenses, merging two existing laws and eliminating distinctions. S. 973 / H.R. 4110 would have allowed federal courts to order restitution for various environmental crimes under specific statutes, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Marine Protection Act, and Clean Air Act. The Justice Department's Analysis highlighted the need for restitution in cases of environmental felonies that result in economic loss, physical injury, or death. The bill S. 973 / H.R. 4110 aimed to expand mandatory restitution for federal offenses, including environmental crimes. It proposed allowing victims to recover related attorney fees and outlined the procedure for issuing a restitution order under 18 U.S.C. 3664. The court conducts hearings to determine victim eligibility for restitution, qualifying losses, and the defendant's ability to pay. Restitution orders can be paid in lump sums, installments, or in-kind. The Justice Department suggests amendments to improve restitution collection, citing issues with the current legislative scheme. The Justice Department proposes amending 18 U.S.C. 3664(f)(2) to clarify immediate payment of restitution upon sentencing, not just as a minimum obligation. This change aims to enhance enforcement by allowing flexibility in payment plans and utilizing civil and administrative methods for collection. The Justice Department proposes amending 18 U.S.C. 3664(f)(2) to allow immediate payment of restitution upon sentencing, enhancing enforcement by providing flexibility in payment plans and utilizing civil and administrative methods for collection. Appellate decisions have emphasized that the sentencing court must set any installment payment schedule, rather than making restitution due immediately when the defendant cannot comply. Proposed bills aimed to address these issues by amending section 3664 to meet objections raised by the Justice Department. H.R. 845 proposes immediate payment of restitution upon sentencing, allowing for flexible payment plans and alternative collection methods. The amendments aim to give the court the authority to establish a payment schedule, with the government able to supplement collection efforts if needed. H.R. 845 proposes changes to restitution procedures, including immediate payment upon sentencing, flexible payment plans, and alternative collection methods. The bill would allow the government to supplement collection efforts without court approval, relax time deadlines for providing victim information, and require sharing of reports with victims upon request. It also eliminates redundant provisions in existing law. The proposed changes in H.R. 845 aim to streamline restitution procedures, including immediate payment upon sentencing, flexible payment plans, and alternative collection methods. Rule 32(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure may no longer require the probation officer to invite the defendant's attorney to interviews for restitution information. The bill would still mandate attorney invitation for all presentence investigation interviews, regardless of the issue being discussed. H.R. 845 aims to streamline restitution procedures, including immediate payment upon sentencing, flexible payment plans, and alternative collection methods. The bill would remove the requirement for the court to ignore the defendant's ability to pay when crafting the restitution order. It would also limit the court's authority to apportion restitution among multiple defendants and base the timing of payments on the defendant's obligations and resources. H.R. 845 aims to streamline restitution procedures, including immediate payment upon sentencing, flexible payment plans, and alternative collection methods. It would also extend a defendant's probationary period and term of supervised release as long as restitution is still owed, with the obligation to pay restitution being the only condition during the extension. The bill would maintain existing mechanisms for enforcing restitution orders, such as liens on the defendant's property. H.R. 845 aims to streamline restitution procedures, including immediate payment upon sentencing, flexible payment plans, and alternative collection methods. It would empower the court to order the defendant to facilitate restitution, including reparation of assets overseas. S. 973 / H.R. 4110 also includes amendments for restitution enforcement alternatives. S. 973 / H.R. 4110 proposes changes to restitution enforcement, including immediate full payment upon imposition and flexible installment payment scheduling. It also allows for alternative collection methods, such as the Bureau of Prisons Inmate Financial Responsibility Programs. The Bureau of Prisons Inmate Financial Responsibility Program requires federal inmates to make partial payments towards their financial obligations at specified intervals, prioritizing court-ordered restitution payments. Failure to comply can lead to loss of benefits. Some courts view the program as a suitable way to enforce restitution obligations, despite challenges from the Justice Department. S. 973 / H.R. 4110 proposed amending section 3664 to allow courts to delegate payment scheduling to prison officials, with prison authorities having the final say. The bill also aimed to update the nominal installment payment feature to include a $100 per year minimum and prioritize special assessments. The Justice Department Analysis anticipated that this change would revive the dormant nominal installment provision, providing prosecutors with more options for enforcing restitution orders. The court can stay execution of a restitution order pending appeal and issue necessary orders for compliance, such as posting a bond or deposit. S. 973 / H.R. 4110 aimed to limit stays that hinder prosecutors from enforcing restitution orders and restrict court discretion over protective orders during a stay. S. 973 / H.R. 4110 aimed to limit court discretion over protective orders during a stay and require mandatory protective measures unless exceptional circumstances exist. It intended to supplant Rule 38(e) without expressly repealing it, emphasizing the importance of securing restitution for victims promptly. The proposal for restitution pending appeal aims to secure restitution for victims quickly and prevent asset loss. It differs from fines pending appeal as the government may not have to return restitution amounts if the defendant is vindicated. Courts can waive fines in cases of hardship, but restitution is not subject to the same treatment. The Sentencing Guidelines allow for waivers of fines in cases of hardship, but restitution obligations do not have the same provisions. Denial of stay pending appeal or asset freeze may impose greater hardships in restitution cases. The Justice Department materials do not specify the type of order that may limit enforcement of restitution obligations without interfering with the prosecutor's authority. The curr_chunk discusses limitations on the sentencing court's authority regarding enforcement of restitution orders, including restrictions on disclosing certain information in the probation officer's report and statutes prohibiting disclosure of financial information. There are no statutory provisions addressing these specific limitations. The curr_chunk discusses the need for S. 973 / H.R. 4110 to grant United States Attorneys access to financial information on defendants held by the grand jury, Probation Office, or Bureau of Prisons to enforce restitution orders. The Justice Department believes this change is necessary due to some district courts requiring court approval for prosecutors to access probation officer reports on a defendant's financial condition. S. 973 / H.R. 4110 aimed to improve restitution procedures by ensuring victims receive copies of orders, requiring notification of address changes, and preventing asset dissipation. It also allowed courts to order defendants to bring back crime-related property and enter protective orders to preserve assets for restitution. S. 973 / H.R. 4110 aimed to improve restitution procedures by expanding the requirement for defendants to apply windfalls to restitution obligations, regardless of incarceration status. It also provided a more explicit list of factors for assessing a defendant's ability to pay restitution and amended the Federal Debt Collection Procedure Act for enforcing restitution orders. The bills S. 973 / H.R. 4110 and H.R. 845 proposed amendments to the Debt Act to address restitution or debts from criminal cases. Section 3004 was amended to allow debtors to transfer enforcement proceedings to their district. The bills aimed to add asset preservation measures to the restitution process, including asset freeze orders and protective measures before and after indictment. The model for protective orders in criminal forfeiture, based on the Controlled Substances Act, may not be a perfect fit for restitution. Restitution requires a conviction, while civil forfeiture does not. Property freeze orders based on probable cause can be issued pending a criminal trial if the property is believed to be proceeds of a crime. Restitution requires conviction of the property owner, while civil forfeiture does not. The Controlled Substances Act allows for protective orders before charges are filed, unlike restitution. H.R. 845 and S. 973 / H.R. 4110 would have permitted restraint of \"innocent\" assets, which the Controlled Substances Act does not typically allow. Proponents argue for greater protective tools in the case of restitution. The government benefits from confiscation, while victims benefit from restitution. Victims feel the loss of restitution more than the government feels the loss of forfeited property. Proposed protective orders in H.R. 845 and S. 973 / H.R. 4110 would involve property linked to a specific offense and require a judicial hearing to contest their issuance. The proposed section 3664A in H.R. 845 and S. 973 / H.R. 4110 would authorize protective orders for traceable property in cases where a defendant is expected to pay restitution upon conviction. Despite occasional clarity issues, the bills anticipate protective measures both before and after indictment, with the court required to take necessary actions upon the government's application and probable cause finding. The proposed section 3664A in H.R. 845 and S. 973 / H.R. 4110 would authorize protective orders for traceable property in cases where a defendant is expected to pay restitution upon conviction. The Justice Department's analysis indicates that the paragraphs represent two distinct grants of authority, with measures applying to traceable property. The court may issue orders to preserve assets traceable to the crime charged and nonexempt assets of the defendant if it is in the interests of justice to do so. The proposed section 3664A in H.R. 845 and S. 973 / H.R. 4110 authorizes protective orders for traceable property in cases where restitution is expected. The court can issue orders to preserve assets linked to the crime charged and nonexempt assets of the defendant if it serves the interests of justice. The analysis highlights that the paragraphs grant authority for protective measures on traceable property, distinguishing between (A) traceable property and (B) any property. The court is required to issue protective measures for traceable property (A) and may do so for any property (B) based on an \"interest of justice\" determination. The reasoning behind the distinction may be to provide the government with options, potentially applying (A) in pre-indictment cases and (B) in post-indictment cases. The text discusses the ambiguity in the interpretation of proposed legislation regarding protective measures for traceable property in cases of expected restitution. It raises questions about the application of pre- and post-indictment measures and the procedure for issuing protective orders. The defendant may be entitled to a hearing if the value of restrained property greatly exceeds potential restitution amounts, or if restitution is not authorized for the offense or victims in question. The legislation aims to address issues related to protective measures for traceable property in cases involving expected restitution. The defendant may be entitled to a hearing to challenge a protective order if the restrained property is not traceable to the offense charged. The defendant must show that the order would deprive him of defense counsel or necessities of life. If successful, a hearing will be granted for the government to contest the challenge. The court may modify the protective order if there is a lack of probable cause for the property to satisfy restitution or if the property is not traceable. The court may modify a protective order if there is a lack of probable cause for the property to satisfy restitution or if the property is not traceable to the offense charged. This aligns with the provisions of S. 973 / H.R. 4110 and H.R. 845, which focus on the defendant's ability to challenge the order if it would deprive them of defense counsel or necessities of life. The proposed change in H.R. 845 regarding the issuance of protective orders did not seem necessary as it did not specify a relationship between the \"approximate amount\" of restitution and the value of restrained property. Both H.R. 845 and S. 973 / H.R. 4110 allowed for a protective order on traceable property once probable cause standards were met, without specifying the level of certainty needed to trace property to the offense. Additionally, both bills stated that a defendant could request a hearing to modify the order if they could prove by a preponderance of evidence that they had or would be deprived of necessities or defense counsel. The proposed change in H.R. 845 regarding protective orders did not seem necessary as it did not specify the relationship between the amount of restitution and restrained property. Both H.R. 845 and S. 973 / H.R. 4110 allowed for a protective order on traceable property once probable cause standards were met. The defendant could request a hearing to modify the order by showing hardship or lost defense counsel and proving errors in the court's probable cause finding. The proposed change in H.R. 845 regarding protective orders did not specify the relationship between restitution and restrained property. The defendant had to show hardship or errors in the court's probable cause finding to modify the order. The unresolved question of what due process requires complicated the issue. The Court left open the constitutional issue of post-indictment asset restraint for legal representation, with lower courts divided on the need for a probable cause hearing. Orders may be modified if more property than necessary is seized. The court may modify orders for asset restraint if more property than necessary is seized to satisfy a restitution order. A hearing is conducted to determine probable cause for the defendant to be ordered restitution and if the seized property may be needed for that purpose. The value of frozen assets and restitution owed must be analyzed, and innocent assets may not be restrained if needed for basic necessities. The bills proposed pre-indictment protective orders governed by 21 U.S.C. 853(e) and section 3664A. Section 853(e) requires notice and a hearing before property restraint, unless probable cause shows property will be unavailable. The bills suggested ex parte restraining orders lasting ten days, extendable for cause, and ninety days without indictment, extendable for cause. Section 3664A also plays a role in asset restraint modifications for restitution orders. Section 3664A does not describe the post-restraint hearing in pre-indictment cases. Section 853(e)(1)(B) allows the court to enter protective orders to preserve property subject to criminal forfeiture before indictment if there is a substantial probability of forfeiture and the need to preserve the property outweighs any hardship. The bills proposed a hearing for \"restitution\" instead of \"forfeiture,\" following case law that protective orders freezing assets before conviction may not be issued. Indicted defendants couldn't plead innocence to lift the order, but third parties could request modifications based on hardship. However, they couldn't argue ownership of the restrained property until after the criminal case. Federal courts typically don't enjoin crimes unless authorized by statute. Congress authorized federal courts to enjoin specific crimes under 18 U.S.C. 1345, including mail, bank, or wire fraud, false claims against the United States, and more. Bills like H.R. 845 and S. 973 aimed to expand this authority to include injunctions and freeze orders for federal offenses with potential restitution. The proposed bills, H.R. 845 and S. 973 / H.R. 4110, aimed to expand federal courts' authority to order restitution for a wider range of federal offenses, including crimes of violence, fraud, property damage, product tampering, aircraft safety, drug offenses, and environmental crimes. The Justice Department did not provide a clear reason for the expansion, but it was suggested that expanding the authority to issue restraining orders could have restitution implications. Expanding the authority to issue restraining orders could have restitution consequences, but it is unclear how amending section 1345 would differ from proposed section 3664A. S. 973 / H.R. 4110 aimed to align fine collection language with restitution collection amendments, unlike H.R. 845. Current law requires immediate fine payment unless a payment schedule is authorized by the court in the interest of justice. Defendants must report financial changes for possible payment order modifications. S. 973 / H.R. 4110 aimed to align fine collection language with restitution collection amendments. It would have instructed courts to order immediate payment of fines and assessments, allowed installment payment scheduling, and required defendants to pay as quickly as possible, report financial changes, and avoid concealment of assets. Prosecutors would have had access to fine and special assessment collection without court involvement. S. 973 / H.R. 4110 would have allowed prosecutors access to financial information of defendants without court approval. The court could impose nominal payment schedules and adjust them as needed. It could also issue restraining orders to prevent asset scattering for fine payment. The court could order the defendant to return crime-generated assets and non-exempt assets, and enforce fines pending appeal with restrictions. The government's authority to investigate the defendant's financial circumstances would not be restricted."
