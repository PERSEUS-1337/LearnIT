    "content": "The U.S. government utilizes federal credit, including direct loans and loan guarantees, to fund various sectors such as home ownership, education, small business, farming, energy, infrastructure, and exports. By the end of fiscal year 2013, outstanding federal credit totaled $3,154 billion, with direct loans at $947 billion and guaranteed loans at $2,207 billion. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 changed the budgetary treatment of federal credit. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) changed the budgetary treatment of federal credit from cash-flow accounting to accrual accounting. FCRA measures the cost of new federal credit as the net present value of cash flows over the life of the loan or loan guarantee at the time the credit is extended. The purpose of this report is to explain the provisions of FCRA, examine the implementation of credit reform, discuss proposed modifications, and describe proposed legislation in the 113th Congress. Before the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA), the budgetary cost of federal credit was inaccurately reported as net cash flow for the fiscal year, making it difficult for policymakers to monitor and make informed decisions. Agencies could understate costs by using budgetary techniques, leading to problems in accurately assessing the economic and budgetary effects of federal credit. Congress included provisions in FCRA to address these issues. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) was signed into law to address inaccuracies in reporting the budgetary cost of federal credit. FCRA changed the methodology for measuring and reporting the cost of federal direct loans and loan guarantees, aiming to improve the functioning of federal credit programs for equity and efficiency reasons. Economists cannot determine the superiority of one income distribution over another, as it involves value judgments. Some Members of Congress support redistributive programs, such as credit assistance for students from lower-income families to reduce income inequality. Critics argue that direct subsidies are more effective in targeting assistance to the needy. Productive efficiency in an economy means it cannot produce more of one good without reducing the production of others. Private financial intermediaries should allocate capital efficiently for an economy to be productive. Private financial intermediaries should allocate capital efficiently for an economy to be productive. Market imperfections may cause inadequate credit availability in certain sectors. Federal intervention may be justified for issues like information failures, monitoring problems, and externalities. Credit assistance for higher education could improve economic efficiency. Terms in financial economics have specific meanings for federal budget practices. The federal budget practices involve terms like federal credit, federal credit subsidies, and the unified budget. Federal credit includes direct loans and loan guarantees, with specific definitions outlined in the FCRA. A direct loan is a disbursement of funds requiring repayment, while a loan guarantee is a pledge for debt obligation payment. The federal government determines future credit flows through direct loans and loan guarantee commitments. These commitments are binding agreements to provide credit when specified conditions are met, but there may be a time lag between contract signing and actual disbursement. The federal government provides credit through direct loans and loan guarantee commitments, with subsidies including lower interest rates, longer maturities, and other favorable terms compared to private lenders. Loan guarantee recipients receive subsidies as well. The federal government provides credit through direct loans and loan guarantee commitments, offering subsidies such as lower interest rates and favorable terms. Recipients of federal loan guarantees receive subsidies through lower interest payments and reduced fees compared to private insurers. Additionally, the government may cover part of the interest due on guaranteed loans. The adoption of a unified budget in 1967 was an important budget reform that preceded credit reform. The federal government used multiple budgets with different coverage and accounting methods, causing confusion. In 1967, the President's Commission on Budget Concepts recommended implementing a unified budget for resource allocation and macroeconomic stabilization. The President's Commission on Budget Concepts recommended a unified budget for resource allocation and macroeconomic stabilization. This unified budget would include all federal activities, trust funds, and federal credit programs, with detailed and accurate information for evaluating the effects of federal fiscal activities and undertaking discretionary countercyclical fiscal policy. The commission recommended measuring federal credit programs by cash flows, despite its limitations. The Johnson Administration adopted the unified budget concept in FY1969 with some differences from the commission's proposal. Critics argued that the cash flow method did not accurately measure the cost of federal credit. Proposals for using accrual accounting for federal credit were debated and led to the Federal Credit Reform Act in 1983. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 established the basis for federal credit accounting, aiming to accurately measure costs, align credit program costs with other federal spending, tailor benefits to beneficiaries' needs, and enhance resource allocation. The Act defines subsidy cost as the long-term cost to the government of a direct loan or loan guarantee, excluding administrative costs and incidental effects on government finances. The subsidy cost of a federal credit program is determined by the amount of credit provided and the discount rate used to calculate the net present value. Any government action that changes the estimated present value of a credit program is counted in the budget as a change in the subsidy cost. The director of the Office of Management and Budget is responsible for coordinating the estimation of subsidy costs. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget coordinates the estimation of subsidy costs for federal credit programs. Agencies must follow written guidelines from the Director, developed in consultation with the Congressional Budget Office. The President's budget includes planned levels of new direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments. Starting in FY1992, the subsidy cost of credit programs is placed in a budget account called a credit program account. The federal credit is scored as an outlay in the fiscal year it is disbursed, with discretionary programs requiring appropriations for subsidy costs. Mandatory credit programs have indefinite budget authority and receive automatic funding based on demand. The federal credit programs have different funding mechanisms based on whether they are discretionary or mandatory. Mandatory credit programs have permanent indefinite budget authority and cover any additional costs from reestimates of subsidies. Each credit program has a non-budget financing account that receives payments equal to the subsidy cost when new loans are provided. The financing accounts also handle cash flows between the public and the government for each credit program. The cash flows associated with credit programs include direct loan disbursements, repayments, default payments, fees, recoveries, and subsidy cost payments. These non-budget accounts do not impact total outlays, receipts, or surplus/deficit. Budget authority allows credit program accounts to pay estimated subsidy costs to the financing account. Off-budget borrowing for unsubsidized loans adds to the national debt. Liquidating accounts manage ongoing cash flows for each credit program. The liquidating account manages cash flows from credit programs prior to October 1, 1991. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 applies budgetary procedures to credit terms modifications by the U.S. government. It does not apply to certain credit activities of federal agencies. The Act was concise, covering only five and a half pages, with many operational details missing. Since the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, federal agencies have improved financial systems for credit reform. OMB issued revised circulars in 1992, 2000, and 2005 to provide instructions for credit budget formulation and subsidy estimation. Agencies have been updating subsidy estimates annually since FY1994, with assistance from OMB. Circular A-11 outlines federal credit reform procedures and how agencies should prepare budget requests. Agencies have adjusted subsidy estimates annually since FY1994 with assistance from OMB. The Government Accountability Office and CBO examined subsidy estimates and reestimates, finding issues with documentation and reliability but noting improvements in estimating practices. CBO concluded that reestimates are too disorganized for analysis, but do not show bias patterns. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) was established in October 1990 to recommend accounting principles for the federal government. The board issued an exposure draft in September 1992 recommending accounting standards. On September 15, 1992, the board issued an exposure draft recommending accounting standards for federal credit programs consistent with credit reform. The revised report titled Accounting for Direct Loans and Loan Guarantees provided detailed guidance and required federal agencies to use present value accounting in line with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 amended the Act to make technical changes and codify OMB guidelines. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 made important changes governing federal credit, requiring agencies to use the same discount rate and forecast assumptions for calculating subsidies. This ensures transparency in loan program funding decisions. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 mandates agencies to transfer unobligated balances to the general fund, use the same interest rate for financing account debt, and modify the definition of \"cost\" based on cash flow timing for budget calculations. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 changed the discount rate calculation method for subsidy costs of credit programs. Instead of using the interest rate of a 10-year Treasury note, costs are now discounted using the interest rate on Treasury bills or notes corresponding to the year. This new approach better aligns with the flow of interest payments and principal repayment. Additionally, credit recipients may now bear some subsidy costs under certain credit programs, as seen in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 changed the discount rate calculation method for subsidy costs of credit programs to align with interest payments and principal repayment. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allows credit recipients to bear some subsidy costs. The law does not specify an appropriations ceiling for loan guarantees, leading to debates on the need for a cap to control the size of credit programs. The FY2015 budget presents loan characteristic variables for each credit program. For FY2015, OMB estimates a negative subsidy budget authority of new direct loans, mainly for the Department of Education's Federal Direct Student Loan Program, due to the use of Treasury interest rates. For FY2015, OMB estimates a negative subsidy budget authority of new loan guarantees, primarily for the FHA-Mutual Mortgage Insurance Program Account. Credit reform principles could be applied to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), which are privately owned financial intermediaries with implied federal guarantees. The federal government has provided financial assistance to GSEs like the Farm Credit System and Fannie Mae to prevent defaults on their debt. This assistance was necessary due to economic downturns and financial troubles faced by these entities. Legislation is proposed to reform financially troubled housing GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Proponents argue for credit reform covering subsidy costs to taxpayers of all GSEs, while opponents claim these costs are hard to quantify and the government is not obligated to bail out GSEs. They also argue that current low Treasury rates and exclusions may lead to negative subsidy costs. Credit reform principles could extend to federal insurance, improving budgetary information and incentives for federal programs like deposit and pension insurance. The GAO maintains that credit reform could enhance budgetary information and incentives for federal insurance programs. However, accurately estimating future claims for losses poses challenges due to unavailable historical data, frequent program modifications, and coverage of risks the private sector avoids. The complexity of these issues suggests that integrating accrual-based costs directly into the budget is currently not feasible. The GAO recommends including accrual-based cost measures as supplemental information in budget documents before full inclusion under credit reform. The GAO recommends including accrual-based cost measures as supplemental information in budget documents to improve budgetary information and incentives for federal insurance programs. Accrual-based budgeting has the potential to provide more accurate recognition of government costs and better manage insurance costs. The inclusion of insurance programs in federal budgets is complex due to the exclusion of administrative costs and risk premiums, leading to difficulties in calculating a definitive budgetary figure. Recommendations from various government bodies suggest measuring federal credit subsidies using net present value or a market-valuation oriented approach. The CBO and OMB support a market-valuation oriented measurement approach for federal credit subsidies, which includes the market price for risk using the risk-adjusted discount rate method. This method results in higher discount rates for costs and revenues, increasing the net cost of credit programs. The inclusion of options in measuring federal credit subsidies is also discussed. Options are contracts that give the buyer the right to buy or sell an instrument at a specific price within a set time. Options-pricing methods ensure assets with the same payoffs have the same price to prevent risk-free profits. These methods are more accurate than the ADR method when data and models are available. They are preferred for valuing credit for commercial enterprises, while the ADR method is suitable for individuals. Different methods are used for credit programs like loan assistance for sovereign states and municipalities. The CBO used options pricing methods to calculate the risk-adjusted cost of federal loan guarantees to Chrysler and America West Airlines. The market-value loss for the Chrysler loan guarantee was $239.0 million, and for AWA, it was $26.3 million. The President's budget includes a section on \"Fair Value Budgeting for Credit Programs,\" comparing costs to fair value budgeting. CBO supports fair value accounting for federal credit programs. CBO supports fair value accounting for federal credit programs, acknowledging implementation issues. The use of Treasury interest rates resulted in negative costs for federal credit from FY2009-FY2011, reducing federal deficits. The negative aggregate costs of federal credit have sparked debate about fair value budgeting. Proponents argue that excluding administrative costs understates the true costs of credit programs and distorts cost comparisons. Opponents claim it's challenging to separate administrative costs from general expenses. CBO supports fair value accounting for credit programs but acknowledges implementation challenges. Comprehensive fair-value estimates of subsidies for credit programs would include essential preservation expenses, making cost comparisons easier. However, this could reduce Congressional control over program expenditures and switching to accrual accounting may be complex. Two bills in the 113th Congress addressed these concerns. Two bills in the 113th Congress proposed reforms to federal credit budgeting, including the Honest Budget Act of 2013 introduced by Representative Martha Roby. The legislation aimed to measure the costs of federal credit programs more accurately by accounting for them on a fair value basis. It defined \"cost\" as the sum of the Treasury discounting component and the risk component of a loan or financial investment. The bill also sought to expand the Federal Credit Reform Act to include financial investment commitments. The Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014, introduced by Representative Scott Garrett, aims to replace FCRA with fair value measures for federal credit programs. It defines \"cost\" as the sum of the Treasury discounting and risk components of loans. Directors of the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget are required to prepare a study and recommendations within a year of the Act's enactment. The Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 aims to replace FCRA with fair value measures for federal credit programs. It requires studies and recommendations from the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget on applying fair value concepts to budgeting for Federal insurance programs. The Act's provisions would take effect in 2017. The concepts of present value and future value are explained using simple examples, highlighting the importance of interest in determining the value of money over time. The future value of an investment can be calculated using the formula Fn = P(1 + r)^n, where Fn is the balance at the end of period n, P is the amount invested, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods. For example, if $100 is deposited in a bank account for one year at 5% interest, the future value at the end of year 1 would be $105. If the $105 is left for a second year, the future value at the end of year 2 would be $110.25. The present value of a future amount can be calculated using the formula P = Fn / (1 + r)^n. Before the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, federal credit was treated differently in the unified budget, measuring credit by cash flows. After 1980, a separate credit budget was introduced to control gross credit flows. Unified budget used cash-basis accounting before FY1992. Before FY1992, federal direct loans were treated as budget outlays in the current fiscal year, with repayments and interest payments considered as offsetting collections in future years. Loan fees and defaults also impacted collections. Administrative expenses were reported as outlays, and the budgetary cost of a loan program was based on net cash flow. Loan guarantees were not included in the federal budget. The federal budget did not include contingent liabilities from loan guarantees if no cash flow occurred. Administrative costs of guarantee programs were considered outlays in the fiscal year they occurred. Fees charged to recipients were offsetting collections. Federal outlays for default losses covered by guarantees were not shown until paid. The credit budget was introduced in 1980 to monitor federal credit growth, with nonbinding targets initially. Limits in the credit budget were included before FY1992. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 decreased the importance of the credit budget as control of credit subsidies replaced limits on gross credit flows. Estimated limitations on credit loan levels are proposed in each presidential budget, but are set too high to realistically affect the amount of credit extended. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 shifted control of credit subsidies and set limitations on credit loan levels. If a new loan program is enacted, OMB estimates the subsidy cost. Agency A establishes credit program and non-budget financing accounts for the program. Appropriations bill includes funding for subsidy budget authority of the program. The appropriations bill must include an estimate of the dollar amount of new direct loan obligations supported by the subsidy budget authority for program L. Agency A signs a contract to loan $10 million to a borrower under program L, with a subsidy cost of $2 million. The borrower meets the loan terms, and Agency A transfers $2 million from its credit program account to its financing account for program L. The loan of $10 million is disbursed from agency A's financing account for program L to the borrower. A $2 million subsidy payment is scored as an outlay for agency A and the federal budget. The $8 million borrowed from the Treasury is a non-budget means of financing, increasing the national debt if the budget is in deficit. Agency A services the loan, with cash flows between the public and the non-budget financing account not affecting the budget deficit. Repayments of principal and interest are paid by the borrower into the financing account for program L. The CBO estimates the subsidy cost for a proposed loan guarantee program, while OMB estimates the cost of credit subsidies for loans guaranteed under program G. If program G is discretionary, Congress passes an appropriations bill including an appropriation of $60. The appropriations bill includes $60 million for program G, with an estimated subsidy rate of 10%. Agency A guarantees a $15 million loan with a subsidy cost of $1.5 million. Loan guarantee fees are paid by the borrower to the financing account. After meeting the terms of the loan guarantee contract, the borrower receives a $1.5 million subsidy from Agency A to obtain a loan from a private lender. The subsidy payment is recorded as an outlay for Agency A and the federal budget. The borrower is responsible for paying interest and repaying the principal to the lender. Agency A services the loan guarantee, and the cash flows between public and non-budget financing accounts do not impact the budget deficit or revenues. However, the net cash flow from the financing account affects the national debt. The financing account affects the national debt by covering costs if the borrower defaults on a guaranteed loan. Interest earned on subsidy amount and loan guarantee fee is paid by the Treasury."
