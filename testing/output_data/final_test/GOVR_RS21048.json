    "content": "Special operations are unique military operations conducted in hostile environments, characterized by elements like time sensitivity, clandestine nature, and high risk. Special Operations Forces (SOF) are specifically trained and equipped for these operations. The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is responsible for training and equipping all U.S. SOF units. Congress passed legislation in 1986 to address concerns about the status of SOF within U.S. defense planning. The legislation (P.L. 99-661) strengthened special operations' position within the defense community by establishing USSOCOM as a new unified command. USSOCOM headquarters consists of approximately 2,500 military and Department of Defense civilians. The USSOCOM Commander, currently U.S. Army General Raymond A. Thomas III, reports directly to the Secretary of Defense. Army Lieutenant General Richard Clarke is set to replace General Thomas in March 2019. ASD SOLIC oversees USSOCOM activities and is the chain of supervision between the Secretary of Defense and USSOCOM Commander. USSOCOM consists of over 70,000 personnel, including its headquarters, four components (USASOC, NSWC, AFSOC, MARSOC), and JSOC as a sub-unified command. Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs) handle theater-level command and control responsibilities. In February 2013, combatant command of Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs) was transferred from Geographic Combatant Commanders to USSOCOM, enabling USSOCOM to organize, train, and equip TSOCs. This change aims to standardize TSOC capabilities and manpower requirements. USSOCOM is responsible for organizing, training, and equipping TSOCs, while GCCs maintain operational control over them. TSOC commanders serve as senior SOF advisors to GCCs and can lead joint task force headquarters for short-term operations. Each TSOC has CCSA responsibilities for manpower, equipment, and logistic support. Current TSOCs include SOCSOUTH supporting U.S. Southern Command with Army as CCSA, and SOCAFRICA supporting U.S. Africa Command with Army as CCSA. USSOCOM oversees TSOCs with GCCs maintaining operational control. TSOCs like SOCAFRICA, SOCEUR, SOCCENT, SOCPAC, SOCKOR, SOCNORTH support various commands with different CCSAs. USSOCOM was tasked with synchronizing DOD planning against global terrorist networks in the 2004 UCP. USSOCOM is responsible for synchronizing DOD planning against global terrorist networks and conducting global operations. It also serves as the DOD proponent for Security Force Assistance (SFA) and has been assigned the mission to field a transregional Military Information Support Operations (MISO) capability. A Joint MISO WebOps Center (JMWC) is planned to operate with Interagency and Combatant Command teams to provide joint messaging capabilities. U.S. Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF) consist of approximately 33,000 soldiers from active Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve, organized into Special Forces, Ranger, and special operations aviation units, along with civil affairs and military information units. Special Forces soldiers, also known as Green Berets, are trained in various skills, including foreign languages, to operate independently worldwide. The Army National Guard Special Forces groups are headquartered in Utah and Alabama, while the elite 75th Ranger Regiment is based at Fort Benning, GA. The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) is headquartered at Fort Campbell, KY and features pilots trained to fly sophisticated Army rotary-wing aircraft in harsh environments. Civil Affairs units are frequently deployed and provide experts in various areas. The most frequently deployed SOF assets are Civil Affairs (CA) units, with the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne) exclusively supporting USSOCOM. The 85th Civil Affairs Brigade was activated in 2011 to support U.S. Army General Purpose Forces (GPFs). Military Information Support Operations units disseminate information to foreign audiences through mass media, with two active duty MISGs stationed at Fort Bragg. The Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) is also a key component. The Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) is one of the Air Force's 10 major commands, with approximately 19,500 personnel operating out of various locations. The AFSOC headquarters, 1st Special Operations Wing, 24th Special Operations Wing, and Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center (AFSOAWC) are located at Hurlburt Field, FL. AFSOAWC is responsible for training, education, irregular warfare programs, and non-standard aviation missions in support of special operations forces. The Air Warfare Center at Hurlburt Field, FL provides mission qualification training in SOF aviation platforms including AC-130U, AC-130W, U-28, MQ-1, MQ-9, C-145, C-146, and small unmanned aerial systems. It also trains Combat Aviation Advisors, medical personnel, and AFSOC Security Forces. Additionally, it includes units from Duke Field, Cannon Air Force Base, Gulfport, and Dothan. The Air Warfare Center at Hurlburt Field, FL provides mission qualification training in SOF aviation platforms and trains Combat Aviation Advisors, medical personnel, and AFSOC Security Forces. AFSOAWC is responsible for educating and training other USSOCOM components and partners. The 27th SOW is at Cannon AFB, NM, while the 352nd and 353rd Special Operations Wings are in Europe and the Pacific. The 6th SOS assesses, trains, and advises partner nation aviation units to enhance their capabilities. The Air National Guard's 193rd SOW at Harrisburg, PA, and the Air Force Reserve Command's 919th SOW at Duke Field, FL, complete AFSOC's major flying units. The 24th Special Operations Wing is one of three Air Force active duty special operations wings assigned to Air Force Special Operations Command. The 24th Special Operations Wing (SOW) is based at Hurlburt Field, Fla and is the only Special Tactics wing in the Air Force. Its primary mission is to provide Special Tactics forces for rapid global deployment to enable airpower success. The 24th SOW is U.S. Special Operations Command's tactical air and ground integration force, specializing in global access, precision strike, and personnel recovery operations. Special Tactics personnel include Special Tactics Officers, Combat Controllers, Combat Rescue Officers, Pararescuemen, Special Operations Weather Officers, Air Liaison Officers, and Tactical Air Control Party operators. Special Tactics operators, known as \"Battlefield Airmen,\" provide a full-spectrum, air-focused special operations capability to ensure airpower success. They have unique skills and often embed with other special operations forces to provide combat air support, medical aid, and personnel recovery. Special Tactics experts include Combat Controllers, Pararescuemen, Special Operations Weather Teams, Combat Aviation Advisors, and Tactical Air Control Party operators. Special Tactics operators, known as \"Battlefield Airmen,\" work closely with Army, Navy, or Marine SOF units to provide air fire support, medical aid, and weather support. AFSOC's flying units operate various aircraft, while NSWC consists of SEAL Teams, SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams, and Special Boat Teams. Naval Special Warfare Command (NSWC) consists of SEAL Teams, SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams, and Special Boat Teams. NSWC forces are experts in special reconnaissance and direct action missions, making them well-equipped to fight a globally dispersed enemy. They can operate in small groups and deploy quickly from various platforms. The Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) was created in 2005 as part of USSOCOM. It consists of the Marine Raider Regiment with multiple battalions and support groups stationed at Camp Lejeune, NC and Camp Pendleton, CA. MARSOC forces conduct various special operations missions globally, including direct action, reconnaissance, counterterrorism, and information operations. The Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) consists of approximately 3,000 personnel and is part of USSOCOM. USSOCOM's FY2020 budget request is $13.8 billion, with a $381 million increase from FY2019. The Joint Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg is responsible for studying special operations requirements, ensuring interoperability, and developing tactics. The FY2020 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) request for USSOCOM totals $4.2 billion, with a 2.2% manpower increase. There are concerns about the future role of USSOCOM and U.S. SOF, highlighted by legislative provisions in the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act. SEC. 1066 mandates a comprehensive review of professionalism and ethics programs for Special Operations Forces. The Secretary of Defense is required to conduct a comprehensive review of ethics and professionalism programs for Special Operations Forces, including standards, programs, and roles of the military departments and USSOCOM. The Secretary of Defense is mandated to review ethics and professionalism programs for Special Operations Forces, including identifying gaps, providing additional guidance for compliance, and assessing the adequacy of the existing management framework. Tools and metrics for evaluating individual and organizational adherence to standards will also be examined. The Secretary of Defense is required to review ethics and professionalism programs for Special Operations Forces, including identifying gaps, providing guidance for compliance, and assessing the effectiveness of existing programs. This includes tools and metrics for evaluating adherence to standards and any additional actions needed to address ethics and professionalism issues. The Secretary of Defense must review ethics and professionalism programs for Special Operations Forces, identifying gaps, providing compliance guidance, and assessing effectiveness. The review must be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services by March 1, 2019. The term \"ethics program\" includes compliance-based and values-based training to uphold ethical principles and foster an ethical culture. The Secretary of Defense must ensure full implementation of requirements for managing Special Operations Forces within 90 days. This includes reviewing ethics and professionalism programs, providing compliance guidance, and assessing effectiveness. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, in coordination with the Commander of the United States Special Operations Command, will conduct a comprehensive review of the United States Special Operations Command to ensure capabilities are suitable for future threats. The review will assess doctrine, organization, training, personnel, and facilities to align with the 2018 National Defense Strategy. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, along with the Commander of the United States Special Operations Command, will conduct a review to assess roles, responsibilities, processes, and any other relevant matters within the command. The review must be completed within 270 days. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, along with the Commander of the United States Special Operations Command, will conduct a review to assess roles, responsibilities, processes, and any other relevant matters within the command. The review must be completed within 270 days, followed by a report to be submitted to the congressional defense committees within 30 days. This review aims to evaluate U.S. Special Operations Forces' culture, resources, organizational structure, and training, potentially leading to changes in focus from fighting terrorists to addressing nation-states. Some question if U.S. Special Operations Forces were involved in direct combat in Niger, raising concerns about civilian oversight. Calls for increased oversight and control of SOF by ASD SOLIC are being made to address the expanding scope of missions. Policymakers are expected to utilize forthcoming reviews to find a balance between combating terrorist organizations and addressing irregular warfare threats posed by nation-states. The future of USSOCOM and U.S. SOF may undergo changes as a result of upcoming policy debates and reviews."
