    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Joint Antitrust Consultative Commission Act\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that antitrust laws are crucial for promoting international competition and easing trade tensions. It is important for all nations to enact and enforce strong competition laws to benefit consumers and stimulate growth. While Japanese antimonopoly law is similar to US antitrust law, there are differences in enforcement practices. In Japan, the lenient interpretation and enforcement of antimonopoly law are inadequate to prevent violations. The antimonopoly law in Japan is insufficient to prevent significant barriers to foreign entry into the market. Private antitrust lawsuits are difficult to file and win due to strict requirements. Criminal prosecution of antitrust violations is rare, and many cartels are legal under the law, contributing to a lack of scrutiny. The Japan Fair Trade Commission's capacity is also limited. In Japan, the Fair Trade Commission faces limitations in enforcing antimonopoly law due to a small staff and its position in the bureaucracy. In the United States, corporations may hesitate to engage in certain business activities due to antitrust law uncertainties and the high cost of litigation. The purpose of this section is to outline the objectives or goals of the following content. The Act aims to review and improve antitrust policies in Japan and the US, promote competition, align enforcement activities, ensure Japan enforces antimonopoly laws, end unfair business practices, and increase awareness of criminal antitrust enforcement. The Act aims to address anticompetitive behavior in Japan by increasing the investigative power of the Japan Fair Trade Commission and reducing the number of cartels exempted from the antimonopoly law. The Act defines key terms related to competition law, such as antimonopoly law, antitrust policy, and antitrust law. It also establishes the United States-Japan Joint Antitrust Consultative Commission. The United States-Japan Joint Antitrust Consultative Commission is established, with an American delegation composed of specific members of Congress. The United States-Japan Joint Antitrust Consultative Commission includes specific members of Congress such as the ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means, the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, and their respective designees from both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The United States-Japan Joint Antitrust Consultative Commission includes members of Congress from specific committees such as the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and their respective designees from both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives includes executive officers such as the Attorney General, Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative. The Attorney General or their designee is the lead representative for the American delegation in the Commission. They are responsible for coordinating meetings and setting annual meeting dates with the Japanese lead representative. Additionally, they oversee the establishment and structure of the Commission, allowing industry representatives to present their views. The American delegation's responsibilities include maintaining reports and records for public use and conducting comprehensive reviews. The Japanese delegation's creation is contingent on the American delegation's activities, with a recommended equal number of members. The Japanese delegation should have the same number of members as the American delegation and include representatives from various organizations involved in antitrust activities in Japan, including members of the Diet. The Japanese delegation for antitrust activities should include members from the Diet, such as the chairman or ranking members of various committees in the House of Representatives and House of Councillors. The Japanese delegation for antitrust activities should include members from the Diet, such as the chairman or ranking members of various committees in the House of Representatives and House of Councillors, as well as their designated representatives from specific committees. The Japanese delegation for antitrust activities should include members from the Diet, such as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Councillors, executive officers like the chairman of the Japan Fair Trade Commission, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of Justice or their designees. The Commission shall convene annually, with the first meeting in Washington, D.C., in 1994 and alternating between the United States and Japan thereafter.

The Commission in Japan is not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Commission functions include discussing and making recommendations on antitrust policy differences and disputes, as well as promoting coherent enforcement of antitrust law in Japan and the United States. The Commission's recommendations and findings will be made public through a report within 90 days after its annual meeting, with a Japanese language version to be issued simultaneously with the English report.
