    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Statutes at Large Modernization Act\". The United States operates under a government of laws, not men. The rule of law requires laws to be accessible to the public. The United States Code contains active laws, while the United States Statutes at Large includes repealed or amended laws. Attorneys must consult both resources for accurate legal information. The Statutes at Large collection, published by the National Archives and Records Administration, is a legal record of all laws enacted by Congress since 1789. It also includes amendments to the Constitution and presidential proclamations. The Law Library of Congress is digitizing the collection for easier access. More resources are needed for further refinement. The Government Publishing Office should lead the online digitization of the Statutes at Large in collaboration with other entities to enhance search functions and make www.Congress.gov a more comprehensive research resource. SEC. 3. PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. The Director shall make the Statutes at Large available to the public at no cost on a website in a searchable, non-proprietary format. The Director must ensure that the searchable online edition of the United States Statutes at Large is prepared in consultation with various entities. The Librarian of Congress is required to incorporate the searchable Statutes at Large into the Legislative Information Retrieval System. The Director of the Government Publishing Office will incorporate relevant electronic information into the legislative information service. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2018 to 2022 to implement this Act."
