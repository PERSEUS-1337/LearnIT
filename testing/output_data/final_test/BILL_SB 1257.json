    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 6060.1.5 of the Business and Professions Code in California requires applicants for admission to complete 50 hours of pro bono legal service before being licensed to practice law. This practical experience aims to enhance the applicant's legal education and emphasize the importance of pro bono work for the public good. For the purposes of Section 6060.1.5 of the Business and Professions Code in California, a person representing a client must be an active licensed attorney in good standing. Pro bono legal service is defined as work without compensation that benefits the public interest or individuals in need, including securing access to justice and addressing economic, health, and social needs. Pro bono legal service is defined as work without compensation that benefits the public interest or individuals in need. It can be performed for charitable, civic, community, governmental, or educational organizations where payment of legal fees would significantly deplete resources. \"Modest means\" refers to low income individuals. An attorney incubator program teaches attorneys how to form, develop, and sustain law firms. Pro bono legal service can be done for legal aid organizations, nonprofit organizations, or other qualified entities. Pro bono legal service can be provided by a nonprofit organization, law school clinic, law firm, State Bar-certified panel, attorney incubator program, or nonprofit law corporation affiliated with a law school or bar association. Applicants can receive compensation for pro bono legal service from sources other than the client. The 50 hours of pro bono legal service can be completed in various locations and must be done after starting legal studies but before admission. Upon completion of the pro bono legal service requirement, applicants must submit a form detailing the service nature, dates, and hours to the State Bar. The form must be signed by both the applicant and supervising attorney or judge. The State Bar will establish rules for retaining certification forms. No partisan political activities can count towards the 50-hour requirement. Exceptions include applicants already admitted to practice in another jurisdiction or those with a foreign J.D. equivalent allowing practice without separate admission. Law schools must disclose information on their website regarding the Pro Bono Legal Service Requirement for Law Students, including requirements, links to available programs for pro bono service, and information on program availability. Applicants can qualify for admission by completing an LL.M. degree program. Each law school must provide updated links to qualifying school and community programs annually to the State Bar by January 1, 2018. The State Bar will publicly disclose information on its website regarding the Pro Bono Legal Service Requirement for Law Students, including requirements and links to information from law schools. The State Bar will randomly audit compliance documentation submitted by applicants to ensure consistency with criteria. This requirement applies to all applicants entering law school on or after January 1, 2018."
