The \"Central Intelligence Agency Voluntary Separation Pay Act\" defines key terms like Director and employee, excluding certain individuals, to establish a program aimed at preventing involuntary separations due to downsizing or reorganization. The Director may establish a program offering separation pay for voluntary separations due to downsizing or reorganization. Employees receiving separation pay cannot be reemployed by the CIA for 12 months. Employees must agree not to represent others before the agency after separation. Employees who receive separation pay from the CIA due to downsizing or reorganization are prohibited from making any communication on behalf of others to the CIA or participating in contracts with the agency for 12 months after separation. Violation of this agreement will result in the employee owing the amount of separation pay received multiplied by the proportion of time in violation. Separation pay can only be offered with the Director's approval and to specific employee groups or locations. Separation pay offered by the CIA is subject to limitations set by the Director, paid in a lump sum, capped at $25,000, not considered for other government benefits, and not factored into severance pay calculations under different circumstances. The Director of the CIA sets limitations on separation pay, with regulations and reporting requirements in place. No separation after September 30, 1997, is eligible for payment. Reporting to congressional committees is mandatory before offering voluntary separation pay. The Director of the CIA must report on the effectiveness and costs of implementing a retirement option for employees with at least 25 years of service, allowing them to retire at any age with consent and receive benefits. This retirement option is subject to regulations and reporting requirements, with limitations on separation pay set by the Director.
