    "content": "The Act titled \"Product Safety Notification and Recall Effectiveness Act of 2002\" is cited as the short title. The findings and purposes of the Act are outlined in section 2. The Consumer Product Safety Commission conducts around 300 recalls of hazardous consumer products annually. Manufacturers lack contact information for most consumers, hindering effective communication about product dangers. The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff has found that maintaining consumer product purchase data is crucial for effective consumer product recalls. Consumer contact is a key motivator for consumer response to recalls, and companies can notify consumers effectively through product registration cards and similar methods. The purpose of this Act is to improve recall effectiveness for consumer products by requiring simplified product registration cards without marketing questions or personal information requests. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has already implemented similar cards for child safety seats. The Act aims to enhance consumer product recall effectiveness by implementing simplified product safety owner cards or electronic registration for products, creating a customer database for recall notifications, and promoting innovative ways to notify consumers about recalls. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms from the Consumer Product Safety Act, including \"covered consumer product\" which includes juvenile products, small household appliances, and other products deemed appropriate by the Commission. \"Juvenile product\" refers to items intended for children under 5 years old, such as cribs. The Act defines terms from the Consumer Product Safety Act, including various juvenile products such as cribs, toddler beds, high chairs, bath seats, gates, playpens, strollers, walkers, swings, child carriers, and bassinets. The term \"product safety owner card\" refers to a standardized product identification card supplied with a consumer product by the manufacturer. The curr_chunk defines a small household appliance as a consumer product that requires minimal personal information for recall purposes. The curr_chunk introduces a rule requiring systems to provide notice of recalls for certain consumer products, while the prev_chunk defines small household appliances as consumer products that require minimal personal information for recall purposes. The Commission will promulgate a rule requiring manufacturers of covered consumer products to establish a system for notifying consumers of recalls. This system must include product safety owner cards, Internet registration, or alternative methods to create a database for recall notifications. Alternative methods may involve online product registration and consumer information databases. The Commission will require manufacturers of covered consumer products to implement electronic tagging, bar codes, and embedded computer chips to notify consumers of product recalls, with consideration of a staff proposal for a Purchaser Owner Card Program. Low-cost items may be excluded from the rule, and the Commission must issue a proposed rule within 90 days of enactment. The Commission must implement electronic tagging for consumer product recalls within 270 days of the Act's enactment, with a possible extension if timely notice is given to relevant committees."
