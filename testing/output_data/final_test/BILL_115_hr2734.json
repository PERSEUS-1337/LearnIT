    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Trade Enforcement and Trade Deficit Reduction Act\". Congress acknowledges that the US market is open with low tariff rates, but nontariff barriers pose challenges for exports. Negotiating tariffs is often the only leverage to address nontariff barriers imposed by foreign countries. The United States has been the world's largest net debtor nation since the mid-1970s, running trade deficits every year since 1976. In 2015, the US had a trade deficit of $939.8 billion in goods and services, weakening its global leadership position. Persistent deficits in the United States weaken the economy, defense industrial base, and innovation system, increasing the likelihood of foreign ownership of large segments of the economy. SEC. 3. WITHDRAWAL OF TARIFF CONCESSIONS. If the Department of Commerce finds that a foreign country has not reduced trade barriers as agreed upon in a trade agreement, the United States Trade Representative must withdraw any duty modifications until Commerce certifies to Congress. The Department of Commerce must investigate if an interested party files a petition alleging the need for withdrawal or modification of duty. An interested party is defined as a US manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler of a similar domestic product. Interested parties eligible to file a petition for duty modification include US manufacturers, producers, wholesalers of similar domestic products, certified unions, recognized worker groups, trade associations with majority US members, and members of the Committee on Ways and Means. The Department of Commerce must determine if a petition meets the requirements for modifying existing duty within 45 days of filing. They will notify the petitioner of their decision and provide reasons for it. SEC. 4. TRADE DEFICIT REDUCTION. The Department of Commerce must identify countries with a trade deficit exceeding twice the value of goods and services exported from the United States to that country, using data from the US International Trade Commission. The Department of Commerce identifies countries with a trade deficit exceeding twice the value of US exports. Countries on the List of Least Developed Countries are excluded. US Customs and Border Protection can ban imports from identified countries for six months if criteria are met. The Department of Commerce can grant a waiver for the importation of products from countries identified under subsection (a) if the product is not available in sufficient quantities from other sources, for a period not exceeding one year."
