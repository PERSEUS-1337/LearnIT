    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Congressional Accountability and Oversight in Syria Act\". Congress finds that no security assistance can be provided to countries with consistent human rights violations. Funds cannot be used to assist certain countries unless certified by the President. The UN Security Council established Resolution 2043 in April 2012. The United Nations Security Council established UNSMIS in Syria for 90 days, with 300 unarmed military observers to monitor and support the six-point plan. UNSMIS suspended activities on June 15, 2012, due to increased violence. The Security Council extended UNSMIS for 30 days on July 20, 2012, with further extensions subject to the Secretary-General's report. The UNSMIS mission ended on August 19, 2012, as the Security Council's conditions were not met. The al-Nusrah Front is designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the Department of State. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that Syria should cease the use of heavy weapons, bring about a cessation of armed violence, be listed as a state sponsor of terrorism, stop using chemical weapons, and any military action by the President should adhere to the Constitution. The President's powers to declare war are limited to specific statutory authorization or a national emergency, as outlined in the War Powers Resolution. It is important for the President to adhere to this resolution and obtain specific statutory authorization before introducing armed forces into hostilities. The President must adhere to the War Powers Resolution and obtain specific statutory authorization for the use of the United States Armed Forces in response to the war in Syria. Authorization is required from Congress for any US government assistance that could enhance military or paramilitary operations in Syria, except for humanitarian aid."
