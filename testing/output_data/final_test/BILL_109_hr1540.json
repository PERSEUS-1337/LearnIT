    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Drinking Water Standards Preservation Act of 2005\". It includes findings related to drinking water standards. The Congress finds that the safety of drinking water is a national concern, with established national standards for over 100 contaminants. States can enforce these standards and set stricter ones. It is not feasible for water to be completely free of contaminants, as setting standards requires careful analysis. The setting of drinking water standards involves analyzing safe contaminant levels, technological capabilities, and affordability. This is a scientific issue to be resolved by Federal and State agencies, not individual juries. Claims for monetary damages against public entities are not appropriate in this context. Claims for monetary damages against public water providers for alleged contamination of drinking water could undermine the national water quality regulation system. States should have the flexibility to handle such claims, deciding whether they go to court or an administrative agency. Defending against multiple legal claims can be financially burdensome, especially for small water systems, even if they comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act. Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act are being proposed. Amendments to Section 1449 of the Safe Drinking Water Act include clarifications on liability and defense provisions. Subsection (f) does not create a new cause of action and does not expand liability or limit any defense. Amendments to Section 1449 of the Safe Drinking Water Act clarify liability and defense provisions. Public water systems are not liable in civil suits for damages from contaminated water delivery unless specific criteria are met. The Safe Drinking Water Act amendments outline criteria for liability in civil suits related to contaminated water delivery. To establish liability, the plaintiff must prove that the delivered water contained a substance likely to cause the claimed injury, the public water system violated regulations, the violation was negligent, and it directly caused the injury. For unregulated contaminants, additional criteria must be met to hold the water system accountable. The plaintiff must prove that the substance in the delivered water caused the injury, was likely to cause the injury, and that the public water system knew or should have known about the substance in the water. Feasibility for the supplier to prevent the injury is also a factor. The court will determine if the plaintiff has met the criteria for establishing injury caused by a contaminant in the water supply. State agencies can also make findings on whether the supplier could have feasibly prevented the injury. State agencies have the authority to determine if drinking water quality requirements adequately protect the public, if additional regulations for contaminants are needed, and if public water systems are in compliance with these requirements."
