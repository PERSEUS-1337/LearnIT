The \"Pathways to Independence Act of 2003\" allows states to consider individuals with disabilities, including substance abuse problems, participating in rehabilitation services as being engaged in work for up to 3 months in a 24-month period. The \"Pathways to Independence Act of 2003\" permits states to extend the 3-month work period for individuals with disabilities participating in rehabilitation services for an additional 3 months if they engage in work activities as determined by the State. The \"Pathways to Independence Act of 2003\" allows states to extend the 3-month work period for individuals with disabilities by an additional 3 months if they are unable to meet the work requirement due to their disability or substance abuse problem. The State will receive credit towards the monthly participation rate for the individual.

The term 'disability' is defined as a physical or mental impairment that hinders employment or limits major life activities. The effective date for this amendment is October 1, 2003. State has the option to count caring for a child or adult dependent with a physical or mental impairment as meeting work requirements. The Social Security Act allows states to consider caring for a child or adult dependent with a physical or mental impairment as fulfilling work participation requirements. The Social Security Act allows states to consider caring for a child or adult dependent with a physical or mental impairment as fulfilling work participation requirements if the State determines that the individual requires substantial ongoing care. The Social Security Act allows states to consider caring for a child or adult dependent with a physical or mental impairment as fulfilling work participation requirements if the State determines that the individual requires substantial ongoing care and is unable to fully participate in work activities. The Social Security Act allows states to count caring for a dependent with a physical or mental impairment as work participation if the individual needs ongoing care and cannot fully participate in work activities. Families with such recipients cannot be counted as more than one family for participation rate purposes, and states must conduct regular evaluations of the recipient's family. The Social Security Act allows states to consider caring for a dependent with a physical or mental impairment as work participation. Recipients must provide updates on the special needs of the dependent that could be accommodated by others or outside the home. In 2-parent families, if one parent is caring for a dependent with an impairment, the state may adjust its treatment. The State can consider a family as a 1-parent family for determining monthly participation rates and cannot count hours of care for dependents in a 2-parent family for the same purpose. The State may count hours of care for an adult dependent if one parent is involved and the State meets certain requirements. This does not prevent the State from including work activities in a recipient's self-sufficiency plan. The effective date of the amendment is October 1, 2003."
