    "content": "The \"Clean, Renewable Jet Fuel Act\" allows for loans to qualifying jet fuel production projects. The \"Clean, Renewable Jet Fuel Act\" defines terms like direct loan, lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, market price, and qualifying jet fuel project. The \"fuel project\" is a project in the United States producing at least 25,000,000 gallons per year of aviation turbine fuel with 50% less greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum, made from renewable biomass, and meeting ASTM standards. \"Sales\" refer to the volume of jet fuel sold to the market from such a project. The Secretary of Agriculture defines the term \"strike price\" as the price at which the US will provide loans to qualified jet fuel projects. The Secretary can enter into standby loan agreements with up to 10 qualifying projects, specifying repayment terms. The Secretary will make direct loans for projects with defined primary and full agreement terms. The strike price will be determined through 3 auctions over 2 years to ensure fairness in project awards. Loan disbursements will be made when the market price falls below the strike price, with the amount based on the difference between the two prices and the project's sales. Loan repayments will be subject to terms set by the Secretary, including interest rates and amortization schedules. During the primary term of the agreement, the loan recipient can defer repayment obligations in a calendar quarter if new loan disbursements are made. If the market price exceeds the strike price in a quarter, the recipient must meet scheduled repayments plus deferred obligations, capped at the market price minus the strike price multiplied by the project's output. The Secretary's approval is required for any deviations from these terms. Loans under this section shall be subject to the requirements of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. Repayment obligations at the end of the primary term of the agreement, along with accrued interest, will be amortized over the full term of the agreement unless the Secretary determines otherwise."
