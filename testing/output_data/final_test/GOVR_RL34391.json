    "content": "The report provides background information on the Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program, which is the Coast Guard's initiative to acquire new polar icebreakers. The program has received over $1 billion in funding through FY2019, with a proposed $35 million for FY2020. Congress must decide whether to approve, reject, or modify the funding request for the PSC program, which could impact Coast Guard missions and the U.S. shipbuilding industry. The Coast Guard's primary duties include developing, maintaining, and operating icebreaking facilities for maritime navigation and rescue purposes. This is outlined in 14 U.S.C. 102, with additional responsibilities for international agreements regarding icebreaking facilities. The Coast Guard's polar icebreakers have multiple missions, including conducting scientific research in the Arctic and Antarctic, defending U.S. sovereignty, and supporting 9 of the Coast Guard's 11 statutory missions. The Coast Guard's polar icebreakers support scientific research in the Arctic and Antarctic, defend U.S. sovereignty in the region, monitor sea traffic, and conduct typical Coast Guard missions in Arctic waters. They are also involved in supporting National Science Foundation research activities in both polar regions. The Coast Guard's polar icebreakers support NSF research in the Antarctic by conducting Operation Deep Freeze to resupply McMurdo Station. The Polar Star breaks ice near Antarctica during the southern hemisphere summer and returns to dry dock in Seattle for maintenance before repeating the mission. The annual McMurdo resupply mission is a significant icebreaking challenge for U.S. polar icebreakers, especially the Coast Guard's medium polar icebreaker, Healy, which operates in the Arctic supporting NSF research activities. Despite diminishing polar ice due to climate change, the need for U.S. polar icebreakers is expected to persist and may even increase due to potential growth in commercial, cruise, and naval operations in the Arctic. The U.S. polar icebreakers face challenges in the Arctic due to changing ice conditions, requiring increased support for exploration activities. The Coast Guard emphasizes the need for adequate icebreaking capability to advance research in the region and make a strategic investment for long-term access to high latitudes. The current U.S. polar icebreaking fleet consists of one heavy polar icebreaker, Polar Star, and one medium polar icebreaker, Healy. The Coast Guard's heavy polar icebreaker, Polar Sea, has been nonoperational since 2010 due to an engine casualty. The Coast Guard plans to acquire three new heavy polar icebreakers through the Polar Security Cutter program, with construction of the first one expected to begin in 2021. The Coast Guard plans to begin construction of the first new heavy polar icebreaker in 2021 under the Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program. The program, managed by a Coast Guard-Navy Integrated Program Office, aims to incorporate Navy ship-procurement best practices to reduce design and procurement time and cost. The PSC will be based on an existing icebreaker design. The Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program aims to reduce cost, schedule, and technical risk by using an existing icebreaker design. The program plans to deliver three PSCs at 12-month intervals by FY2026, with an estimated total procurement cost of about $2.95 billion. The first PSC is estimated to cost $925 million to $940 million, including shipbuilder's cost, government-furnished equipment, and program-management costs. The shipbuilder's contract-award cost for the first ship is $745.9 million. The Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program received a total of $1,034.6 million in procurement funding through FY2019, including $675 million from the FY2019 DHS Appropriations Act. The cost for the first ship is $745.9 million, with options for the second and third ships that could increase the total contract value to $1,942.8 million. The Coast Guard's FY2020 budget requests $35 million in procurement funding for the PSC program, covering government program-management costs. A $745.9 million contract was awarded for the detail design and construction of the first PSC to VT Halter Marine. The DD&C contract for the first PSC was awarded to VT Halter Marine for $745.9 million, with options for building the second and third PSCs, increasing the total contract value to $1.9 billion. The contract includes incentives for early delivery and does not cover government-furnished equipment or program-management costs. VT Halter Marine's design for the new Polar Security Cutter (PSC) has been praised by the Coast Guard and Navy for meeting or exceeding all threshold requirements. The design, developed in collaboration with Technology Associates, Inc., is based on the mature \"Polar Stern II\" German icebreaker and has undergone rigorous testing and adjustments to optimize its performance. The vessels are 460 feet in length with a beam. The new Polar Security Cutter design by VT Halter Marine includes a diesel electric propulsion system with over 45,204 horsepower, capable of breaking ice up to eight feet thick. The vessel can accommodate 186 personnel for 90 days and has partnered with various companies for different components. The program will bring 900 skilled craftsmen to the Mississippi-based shipyard. Polarstern II, the replacement for Germany's current polar research icebreaker, is being built by German shipbuilder HDW. The design includes modifications for enhanced icebreaking capabilities, habitability improvements, and easier access to different areas of the ship. Raytheon is also involved in the project. The Polarstern II, being built by German shipbuilder HDW, includes enhancements for icebreaking capabilities, habitability improvements, and easier access to different areas of the ship. Raytheon is the integrator for C5I capabilities, Caterpillar supplies the main engines, ABB and Trident provide the Azipod propulsion system, Jamestown Metal Marine supplies the joiner package, and Bronswerk supplies the heating, ventilation, and cooling system. The concept design for Polarstern II has a length of 133 meters, a beam of 27 meters, and a draft of 10.5 meters. The concept design for Polarstern II by German shipbuilder HDW includes enhancements for icebreaking capabilities, with a length of 133 meters, a beam of 27 meters, and a draft of 10.5 meters. Comparatively, VT Halter's design for the PSC is larger, with a 460-foot length and a 33,000-ton displacement, surpassing the Coast Guard's current polar icebreakers in size. VT Halter's design for the PSC is about the same size as new nuclear-powered Arctic icebreakers being built by Russia and China. The propulsion plant generates over 45,200 horsepower, slightly less than the Coast Guard's Polar Star. The design includes modern features for icebreaking capabilities comparable to Polar Star. The design was modified from a modern icebreaker on the market to meet Coast Guard requirements. The design of the cutter by VT Halter was modified to meet Coast Guard requirements, with a contoured hull shape that slices ice instead of mass breaking it. The design is optimized for seakeeping during long voyages from Washington state to the Antarctic, balancing icebreaking and stability characteristics. Congress is considering whether to approve the Coast Guard's FY2020 procurement. The Coast Guard's FY2020 procurement funding request for the PSC program is under consideration by Congress. The $35 million requested is enough to cover government program-management costs for FY2020. The Coast Guard had initially projected requesting a total of $125 million for the program, indicating potential additional costs for long leadtime materials for the second PSC. The Coast Guard's FY2020 budget request of $35 million for its new heavy icebreaker is insufficient for purchasing long-lead time materials for the second Polar Security Cutter (PSC). Rep. Lou Correa stated that an additional $100 million is needed for these materials to avoid risking the ship's schedule. The Coast Guard's FY2020 budget request of $35 million for its new heavy icebreaker may not be enough to purchase long-lead time materials for the second Polar Security Cutter (PSC). Additional funding of $100 million is needed to avoid risking the ship's schedule. Congress is also considering whether to use a contract with options or a block buy contract to acquire the ships. The Coast Guard's FY2020 budget request may not be sufficient for the second Polar Security Cutter. Additional funding of $100 million is needed to avoid schedule risks. Congress is considering using a block buy contract for ship acquisition to reduce costs. The Coast Guard's FY2020 budget may not be enough for the second Polar Security Cutter. Additional funding of $100 million is required to avoid schedule risks. Congress is exploring a block buy contract to reduce costs for acquiring three heavy polar icebreakers, potentially saving $150 million. A report recommends using a block buy contracting strategy with fixed price incentive fee contracts for best value. The use of a fixed price incentive fee construction contract is recommended for controlling costs in a complex program like acquiring heavy polar icebreakers. Incorporating lifecycle cost metrics in shipyard proposals evaluation criteria is essential for ensuring long-term value. A block buy authority with specific language for economic order quantity purchases can enable series construction, competitive bidding, and timely acquisition of materials, leading to cost savings and efficiency in production. Taking advantage of learning and quantity benefits can further reduce labor hours on subsequent vessels. By utilizing block buy contracting acquisition strategy, the average cost per heavy icebreaker is approximately $791 million for four ships. Congress may need to decide on funding the PSC program through the Navy's shipbuilding account. Agreements allow funding from either USCG or Navy appropriations for contracting actions. The procurement funding for the PSC program, totaling $300 million, was provided through the SCN account in FY2017 and FY2018. This funding complexity in tracking and executing Coast Guard ship acquisition, with past examples of funding Coast Guard ships through the SCN account. For instance, Healy was funded mostly through the SCN account, and 33 of the Coast Guard's 49 Island-class 110-foot patrol boats were procured under a Navy contract. The Navy used FY1990 SCN funding to construct 12 additional boats under a contract. The FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act authorizes the procurement of a polar-class heavy icebreaker vessel for the Coast Guard, with funding subject to availability in out-years. Funds for procurement of icebreaker vessels are restricted to one polar-class heavy icebreaker vessel. Contracting authority lies with the Coast Guard or Navy depending on the source of appropriated funds. The contracting authority for icebreaker vessels lies with the Coast Guard or Navy, with restrictions on procurement to one polar-class heavy icebreaker vessel. The head of contracting activity for the Coast Guard or Navy may authorize interagency acquisitions. The House bill authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to act as a general agent for the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard operates for icebreaker vessel contracts. The conferees support the authorization of one polar-class heavy icebreaker vessel, prohibit funds for other icebreaker vessels, clarify contracting authorities, and require a Comptroller General report. The conferees support the authorization of one polar-class heavy icebreaker vessel and emphasize the importance of clear lines of authority and resources for the Polar Icebreaker Program. They believe the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and the Undersecretary of Management should have the necessary authorities and resources for the program. The conferees support authorizing one polar-class heavy icebreaker and stress the need for clear authority and resources for the Polar Icebreaker Program. Congress may face concerns regarding technical, schedule, and cost risks in the program, as highlighted in a September 2018 GAO report. The Coast Guard's lack of a solid business case in March 2018 poses risks in design, cost, and schedule baselines for the heavy polar icebreaker acquisition program. DHS is reevaluating its acquisition policy to align with best practices. The Coast Guard plans to use proven technologies for the icebreaker program but did not assess their readiness, leading to underrepresented technical risks. The program's $9.8 billion cost estimate met best practices but lacked a comprehensive assessment. The $9.8 billion cost estimate for the icebreaker program met best practices for being comprehensive and accurate but only partially met credibility standards. The estimate did not account for the full range of possible costs over the program's lifespan, making it unreliable and potentially underestimating total funding needs. The Coast Guard's delivery schedule for new icebreakers was not based on realistic shipbuilding timelines, posing a risk of not meeting promised deadlines and creating a gap in icebreaking capabilities. The Coast Guard's icebreaker program faces issues with delivery schedules and potential gaps in icebreaking capabilities. Congress must decide whether to procure heavy and medium polar icebreakers to a common design. The DHS polar icebreaker mission statement indicates a need for up to six icebreakers. The Coast Guard plans to acquire three new medium icebreakers after three heavy polar icebreakers. The question is whether to use a separate design for the medium icebreakers or stick to the same design as the heavy icebreakers. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommended building a single medium polar icebreaker to the same common design as three new heavy polar icebreakers to reduce costs. The Coast Guard's current medium polar icebreaker, Healy, is larger than the heavy polar icebreaker, Polar Star. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommended constructing four polar icebreakers of common design owned by the USCG for cost savings. They suggest a single class of polar icebreaker with heavy icebreaking capability to reduce costs compared to multiple designs. The DHS Mission Need Statement proposed a fleet of up to six icebreakers, with three heavy and three medium icebreakers required to fulfill USCG's statutory missions. The committee found that four heavy icebreakers would meet the mission needs at the lowest cost, but believed that the costs for medium icebreakers were significantly underestimated in the High Latitude Mission Analysis Report. The committee estimates that a first-of-class medium icebreaker will cost approximately $786 million, while the fourth ship of the heavy icebreaker series is estimated to cost $692 million. Designing a medium-class polar icebreaker in a second shipyard would incur additional costs of $126 million. The recommendation is for the USCG to ensure that the common polar icebreaker design is science-ready. Recommendation: USCG should ensure that the common polar icebreaker design is science-ready and that one of the ships has full science capability. The incremental costs for a science-ready design for each ship and full science capability for one ship are more cost-effective than building a dedicated research medium icebreaker. The committee recommends that the National Science Foundation and other agencies include science capability in the acquisition costs for icebreakers. This science-ready design should have critical elements like structural supports, flexible accommodation spaces for up to 50 science personnel, and machinery arrangements to support sonar transducers. The recommended design for icebreakers includes structural supports, flexible accommodation spaces for science personnel, and machinery arrangements for sonar transducers. The United States will need a science-capable polar icebreaker to replace the Healy. One heavy polar icebreaker will be procured with full science capability, outfitted with oceanographic equipment and facilities for modern research. Basic scientific capability like hydrographic mapping sonar will be acquired during the build of each ship. The USCG is considering building additional medium polar icebreakers to complement the heavy icebreakers. The Coast Guard is reviewing industry bids for a new heavy polar icebreaker and keeping options open for the number and mix of icebreakers needed in the future. Adm. Paul Zukunft mentioned that the program of record is for three heavy and three medium polar icebreakers, but the final decision is still pending. The USCG is considering building additional medium polar icebreakers to complement the heavy icebreakers. Adm. Paul Zukunft mentioned that the program of record is for three heavy and three medium polar icebreakers, but the final decision is still pending. Zukunft is leaning towards building only heavy icebreakers for cost efficiency and maintenance advantages. The USCG is considering building additional medium polar icebreakers to complement the heavy icebreakers. Adm. Paul Zukunft mentioned that the program of record is for three heavy and three medium polar icebreakers, but the final decision is still pending. A new heavy polar icebreaker might enter service in 2023, while Polar Star was refurbished and reentered service in December 2012 for a period ending between December 2019 and December 2022. Congress may need to address bridging the gap between the end of Polar Star's service life and the entry into service of new icebreakers. Options include extending Polar Star's service life or chartering other icebreakers. The Coast Guard plans to extend the service life of Polar Star until fiscal year 2025 at an estimated cost of $75 million. They are considering options to bridge the gap in polar icebreaking capacity, including chartering foreign-owned icebreakers. The Coast Guard plans to extend the service life of Polar Star until fiscal year 2025 at an estimated cost of $75 million. However, the Coast Guard has not completed a formal cost estimate for this effort, and the $75 million estimate may be unrealistic based on previous maintenance events. The Coast Guard plans to extend the service life of the Polar Star until 2025 at a cost of $75 million. A July 2018 GAO report states that the Coast Guard is planning a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) on the Polar Star to bridge a potential operational gap until new icebreakers are delivered in 2023 and 2025. The SLEP would allow the Coast Guard to operate a minimum of two heavy icebreakers and provide a self-rescue capability. However, conducting the SLEP during existing maintenance periods may not be feasible due to the amount of maintenance required on the cutter. The Polar Star's mission capable rating has been decreasing, reaching a low of 29 percent from October 2016 to September 2017. This is mainly due to increased time in depot-level maintenance, with dry dock periods requiring extensions, causing stress on the crew and risking work quality. The Polar Star crew faced stress and reduced rest due to delays in maintenance, risking work quality. The cutter's aging will likely lead to continued delays in future. The SLEP work will add 1-2 months to dry docks, with potential consequences for the annual Antarctica mission. Maintenance costs and time will increase until SLEP is completed, estimated at $75 million. Monitoring of the Polar Star's SLEP will continue through annual DHS program reviews. The Polar Star SLEP effort, with a cost estimate of $75 million, may be unrealistic due to assumptions made by the Coast Guard. The recent material assessment revealed that many parts from the inactive Polar Sea have already been used on the Polar Star, potentially requiring the acquisition of new parts that could increase the cost estimate. The Coast Guard's Polar Star may face challenges in reaching the end of its useful service life by 2020-2023, potentially impacting the $75 million SLEP estimate. The feasibility of chartering other icebreakers depends on their availability for missions in the Arctic or Antarctic. Foreign icebreakers are primarily used by their own countries for icebreaking operations. The United States may face challenges in using polar icebreakers for missions due to their availability for charter. The potential cost effectiveness of chartering icebreakers depends on various factors compared to extending the service life of Polar Star. The Coast Guard has previously leased icebreakers from Russia and Sweden for missions in Antarctica. As a contingency measure, they obtained assurances of assistance from other vessels in the area. NSF acquired icebreakers through a competitive process, facing risks of availability and price uncertainties. The Swedish government terminated a contract in 2011, leading NSF to lease the Russian icebreaker VLADIMIR IGNATYUK. Subsequently, NSF utilized CGC POLAR STAR for support. NSF utilized CGC POLAR STAR to support the McMurdo mission since 2013. Aiviq, an Arctic oil-exploration support ship, is being offered for lease as an interim polar icebreaker. It was chartered by Royal Dutch Shell for Arctic oil exploration but has been modified for icebreaking purposes. Discussions about leasing Aiviq as an interim icebreaker have taken place at recent Coast Guard hearings. At recent Coast Guard hearings, discussions have taken place about the possibility of leasing the Aiviq, an Arctic oil-exploration support ship, as an interim polar icebreaker. Representative Don Young questioned Admiral Paul Zukunft about the feasibility of leasing an icebreaker instead of constructing one. Admiral Paul Zukunft, Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, has had multiple interactions with a potential vendor regarding leasing a platform for icebreaking operations. The platform has yet to complete ice trials, and Zukunft emphasized the importance of ensuring it can operate effectively in icy conditions. The issue of ice trials is still pending, with the goal of finding a platform that meets the Coast Guard's requirements. Admiral Zukunft discusses the cost of ice trials for a potential icebreaker platform, highlighting the differences in propulsion systems between U.S. and foreign-made icebreakers. Admiral Zukunft discusses the potential hidden costs of ice trials for an icebreaker platform, emphasizing the impact on reduction gears and the need to negotiate risk protection with vendors. In a recent exchange during a House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee subcommittee meeting, Representative Hunter questioned Admiral Michel about filling the capability gap until a heavy icebreaker is available. Admiral Michel mentioned the options of either a rolling recapitalization of the Polar Star or bringing back the Polar Sea to bridge the gap until a new icebreaker is ready. He also noted that there are no vessels available for lease with heavy icebreaking capabilities. Admiral Michel traveled to Sweden and Finland to discuss heavy icebreaking capabilities. The Coast Guard's technical package outlines requirements for a new icebreaker, including a minimum six-foot icebreaking capability at three knots. The Coast Guard's technical package outlines requirements for a new icebreaker, including a minimum six-foot icebreaking capability at three knots and 21 feet backing and ramming. Shipbuilders mentioned the need to build a new vessel to meet these requirements. The proposed FY2020 budget includes $35 million for the Polar Security Cutter program. Congressional appropriation actions on the FY2019 funding request are summarized in Table 1. Appendix A provides background information on current U.S. polar icebreakers and research ships. The U.S. icebreakers, built in the early 1970s by Lockheed Shipbuilding, are among the world's most powerful nonnuclear-powered icebreakers. They are 399 feet long, displace about 13,200 tons, and can break through ice up to 6 feet thick at a speed of 3 knots. Each ship can carry a crew of 134 and a scientific research staff of 32 people. Polar Star, commissioned in 1976, is now more than 10 years beyond its intended 30-year service life due to worn-out electric motors and other issues. The Coast Guard placed the icebreaker Polar Star in caretaker status in 2006 due to worn-out electric motors. Congress funded a $57 million repair in FY2009 and FY2010, reactivating the ship in 2012 for 7 to 10 more years of service. The icebreaker Polar Sea, commissioned in 1978, had a rehabilitation project in 2006 to extend its service life to 2014. However, in 2010, an engine casualty rendered it inoperable, leading to its inactive status in 2011. Certain equipment was transferred from Polar Sea to Polar Star. The Coast Guard transferred major equipment from Polar Sea to Polar Star in 2011 to facilitate Polar Star's return to service. Healy, a medium polar icebreaker, was commissioned in 2000 and is larger than Polar Star and Polar Sea, built by Avondale Industries near New Orleans. Healy, a medium polar icebreaker commissioned in 2000, has less icebreaking capability than Polar Star and Polar Sea but is better equipped for scientific research. It can break through 4\u00bd feet thick ice at 3 knots, accommodating a scientific staff of 35. Operated primarily for scientific research in the Arctic, it also supports other operations. Palmer is a 308-foot ship with a crew of 22 and can carry 27 to 37 scientific staff. It was built for scientific research in the Antarctic, capable of breaking 3 feet thick ice at 3 knots. It resupplies Palmer Station but is not suitable for the McMurdo mission. Laurence M. Gould, also built for NSF, is 230 feet long and operated by ECO for NSF on a long-term charter. Sikuliaq, a 261-foot ship operated for NSF by the University of Alaska Fairbanks, was built in 2015 for scientific research in polar areas. It has a crew of 22 and can accommodate 26 scientists and students. The Sikuliaq is a 261-foot ship operated by the University of Alaska Fairbanks for scientific research in polar regions. It has a crew of 22 and can carry 26 scientists and students. The ship is capable of breaking ice up to 2\u00bd or 3 feet thick at speeds of 2 knots. Additionally, the Arctic oil-exploration support ship Aiviq, owned by ECO and chartered by Royal Dutch Shell, was used for oil exploration and drilling in Arctic waters off Alaska. In June 2013, DHS approved a Mission Need Statement for polar icebreaker capabilities to meet current and future mission requirements in the polar regions. The analysis suggests a fleet of up to six icebreakers (3 heavy and 3 medium) may be needed to adequately meet mission demands in the high latitudes. The Mission Need Statement (MNS) in 2013 outlined requirements for year-round presence in both polar regions and evaluated single and multi-crewing concepts. Strategic home porting analysis determined icebreaker capacity demand, with the MNS suggesting a fleet of up to six icebreakers may be needed. The terms \"potentially\" and \"up to\" in the key sentence make the requirement less definitive. The Mission Need Statement (MNS) in 2013 suggested a fleet of up to six icebreakers may be needed for year-round presence in both polar regions. The use of terms \"potentially\" and \"up to\" in the MNS raises questions about the required numbers of U.S. polar icebreakers. The Mission Need Statement in 2013 suggested a fleet of up to six icebreakers may be needed for year-round presence in both polar regions. The required numbers of U.S. polar icebreakers might be less than three heavy and three medium icebreakers, but recent Coast Guard statements indicate a need for three heavy and three medium polar icebreakers. The Coast Guard has a priority for Heavy Polar Icebreakers, with a requirement for at least two such ships for year-round access in polar regions. This falls short of the 3+3 requirement for three heavy and three medium icebreakers as suggested in the Mission Need Statement of 2013. The Coast Guard has a priority for Heavy Polar Icebreakers, with a requirement for at least two ships for year-round access in polar regions. A Government Accountability Office report highlighted the Coast Guard's inability to meet all polar icebreaking requests since 2010 due to the unavailability of heavy icebreakers. The Coast Guard has a priority for Heavy Polar Icebreakers, with a requirement for at least two ships for year-round access in polar regions. A July 2018 GAO report stated that the Coast Guard operates one medium icebreaker, the Healy, which has an expected end of service life in 2029. Despite the requirement for three medium icebreakers, Coast Guard officials said they are not currently assessing acquisition of the medium polar icebreakers because they are focusing on the heavy icebreaker acquisition. In addition to the HILMAR, a number of other studies have been conducted in recent years to assess U.S. requirements for polar icebreakers and options for sustaining and modernizing the Coast Guard's polar icebreaker fleet. Observers sometimes note the size of the polar icebreaking fleets operated by other countries. The Coast Guard has a priority for Heavy Polar Icebreakers, with a requirement for at least two ships for year-round access in polar regions. Observers highlight the difference between the number of U.S. polar icebreakers and the much larger number of Russian polar icebreakers. Russia's Arctic coastline is much longer than the U.S. Arctic coastline, with many more people living in Russia's Arctic. Countries with interests in the polar regions have differing requirements for polar icebreakers. The July 2017 National Academies (NASEM) report highlighted the strategic national interests of the United States in the polar regions, emphasizing the need for polar icebreakers to protect citizens, resources, sovereignty, defense readiness, and engage in research. The report was directed by Congress and aimed to advise on the assessment of costs related to acquiring and operating polar icebreakers. The National Academies report in July 2017 emphasized the strategic national interests of the United States in the polar regions, stressing the need for polar icebreakers to protect citizens, resources, sovereignty, defense readiness, and engage in research. The report aimed to advise Congress on the assessment of costs related to acquiring and operating polar icebreakers. The committee's consensus findings and recommendations highlighted the insufficient icebreaking capability of the United States in the Arctic and Antarctic, despite numerous studies over 30 years emphasizing the need for adequate icebreakers. The United States has failed to respond to the critical environmental changes in the Arctic and Antarctic, leading to a lack of national presence in these regions. Other Arctic nations have mobilized to expand their access to ice-covered regions, leaving the US behind. The recommendation is for the United States Congress to fund the construction of four polar icebreakers to address this issue. The United States Congress should fund the construction of four polar icebreakers of a single class with heavy icebreaking capability, owned and operated by the United States Coast Guard. This recommendation aims to address the lack of national presence in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, where other Arctic nations have already expanded their access to ice-covered areas. The current Department of Homeland Security Mission Need Statement suggests a fleet of up to six ships, but the committee suggests a cost-saving approach with a single class of icebreakers. The Mission Need Statement identified the need for three heavy and three medium icebreakers for USCG's statutory missions, with four heavy icebreakers deemed sufficient for the lowest cost. Three heavy icebreakers in the Arctic would provide continuous presence, while one would service the Antarctic. Operating three ships with four crews could offer greater capacity, with the potential for 740 days away from home port. The use of multiple crews in the Arctic could reduce the number of ships needed while maintaining a comparable level of operational days. Operating two ships with multiple crews instead of three could be cost-effective, but may limit simultaneous operations in both polar regions and increase maintenance costs. Ice-strengthening the ninth national security cutter could enhance military presence in the Arctic, while homeporting in the Southern Hemisphere could extend the availability of a vessel dedicated to the Antarctic. The committee believes it is not necessary to have a standby vessel for the Antarctic mission, as the USCG can redirect an icebreaker from the Arctic or rely on support from other nations. The total acquisition and lifetime operating costs of a single icebreaker are projected to exceed $1.6 billion. Once the four new icebreakers are operational, USCG can assess their performance and determine if additional capacity is needed for future missions. USCG is the only agency in the U.S. government that serves as a military service, law enforcement agency, marine safety and rescue agency, and environmental protection agency, all of which are essential for polar missions. The USCG is the only agency with the authorities, mandates, and competencies needed for polar icebreaker missions. It is more efficient to have one agency with a multimission capability rather than splitting operations among other agencies. Government ownership of new polar icebreakers would be less costly than lease financing. The government's direct purchase of new polar icebreakers would be 19 percent less costly than leasing, as shown by the committee's analysis. This option avoids the risk of lessor bankruptcy and ensures availability to the USCG. The committee's analysis considered various factors, including borrowing costs, equity use, and expert consultation. Chartering is not a feasible alternative. The committee recognizes the limited availability of polar icebreakers on the market and the challenges with chartering for short-term, mission-specific needs. An enlarged icebreaker fleet would enhance the USCG's icebreaking program and mission by increasing the pool of experienced personnel. The committee recommends expanding the icebreaker fleet to increase the pool of experienced personnel, making icebreaking a more attractive career path. Common design of recommended icebreakers will reduce operating costs and improve operational effectiveness. USCG should use block buy contracting with fixed price contracts for best value. The use of block buy contracting with fixed price contracts is recommended for the icebreaker program to control costs and ensure long-term value. Specific language for economic order quantity purchases should be included to enable series construction, competitive bidding, and timely acquisition of materials. This approach would lead to continuous production, maximize learning curve benefits, and reduce labor hours on subsequent vessels. The acquisition strategy for the icebreaker program includes technology transfer, maximizing the use of commercial off-the-shelf equipment, applying Polar Codes and international standards, and reducing \"buy American\" provisions. This approach aims to optimize design, reduce construction costs, and enhance reliability and maintainability. The committee found that USCG's cost estimates for the heavy icebreaker are reasonable, but the costs for medium icebreakers are significantly underestimated. The estimated cost for the first heavy icebreaker is $983 million, with 75-80% covering shipyard design and construction costs. By utilizing learning and quantity discounts through block buy contracting, the average cost per heavy icebreaker could be around $791 million for four ships. The committee's analysis suggests an overall length of 132 meters and a beam of 27 meters for the acquisition of four ships, with potential cost savings of up to $100 million per ship by reducing MIL-SPEC requirements. Other recommended strategies will control costs and provide savings in overall life-cycle costs for the program. The committee estimates the cost of a medium icebreaker based on the known characteristics of the USCG Cutter Healy. The committee estimates the cost of a first-of-class medium icebreaker at $786 million and the fourth heavy icebreaker at $692 million. Designing a medium icebreaker in a second shipyard would cost $126 million in engineering, design, and planning costs. The committee developed cost estimating models independently to establish the primary cost estimate. The committee's primary cost estimate for new polar icebreakers indicates that operating costs are expected to be lower than those of the vessels they replace. This is due to more efficient hull forms, modern engines, and well-designed automation plants that reduce fuel consumption and require fewer personnel for operation and maintenance. The use of commercially available modern technology is projected to result in lower operating costs for the new ships. The use of COTS technology and minimizing MIL-SPEC requirements will reduce long-term maintenance costs and free up manpower for other tasks. New icebreakers have lower major repair and overhaul costs compared to older vessels like the Polar Star. However, new ships may have higher operating costs if they are more complex to provide additional capabilities. USCG should ensure that the common polar icebreaker design is science-ready and that one of the ships has full science capability. Including science readiness in the design is the most cost-effective way to fulfill both USCG's polar missions and the nation's scientific research needs. The incremental costs for a science-ready design for each ship are estimated at $10 million. The incremental costs of a science-ready design for each of the four ships ($10 million to $20 million per ship) and of full science capability for one of the ships at the initial build (an additional $20 million to $30 million) are less than the independent design and build cost of a dedicated research medium icebreaker. The National Science Foundation and other agencies do not have budgets to support full-time heavy icebreaker access or the incremental cost of design, even though their science programs may require this capability. The committee believes that the science capability should be included in the acquisition costs, as science-ready design includes critical elements that cannot be retrofitted cost-effectively into an existing ship. The design and build of a science-capable polar icebreaker include structural supports, flexible accommodation spaces for up to 50 science personnel, machinery arrangements for sonar transducers, and weight and stability latitudes for scientific equipment installation. The United States will need a science-capable icebreaker to replace the Healy, with one heavy polar icebreaker being procured initially with full science capability while retaining the ability to fulfill other USCG missions. The nation is at risk of losing its heavy polar icebreaking capability as the Polar Star nears the end of its service life. The Polar Star, built in 1976, is well past its 30-year design life, with declining reliability and escalating maintenance costs. It is crucial to acquire a science-capable icebreaker to collect essential environmental data for USCG polar missions. The Polar Star, built in 1976, underwent a life-extending refit in 2011\u20132012, but its useful life is estimated to end between 2020 and 2024. To maintain polar icebreaking capacity, USCG should implement an enhanced maintenance program until at least two new icebreakers are commissioned. The proposed EMP includes planned upgrades to ensure the Polar Star can continue its Antarctic missions within existing annual expenditures. The EMP for the Polar Star would require improvements in various systems within existing annual expenditures estimated at $5 million. The Coast Guard provided a High Latitude Study to Congress in July 2011, identifying capability gaps in Arctic missions. The gap in polar icebreaking capability is a significant issue affecting mission performance in the Arctic. This gap has led to a lack of at-sea time for crews and senior personnel, resulting in training and leadership gaps. A helicopter-capable surface unit could provide multi-mission capability and mobility without the need for expensive shore-based infrastructure. The Coast Guard's polar icebreakers are essential for various missions in challenging ice conditions. They have the capability to carry passengers, cargo, boats, and helicopters, along with command and communication capabilities. These icebreakers play a crucial role in closing performance gaps and are vital for Defense Readiness and Ice Operations in the Antarctic region. The deterioration of the Coast Guard's icebreaker fleet is impacting mission readiness in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The need for military capabilities in these areas is urgent, as outlined in the Naval Operations Concept 2010. Acquiring material solutions is necessary to close the capability gaps and meet future functional requirements. The Coast Guard icebreaking fleet must support missions in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, including Arctic North Patrol, Arctic West Science, Antarctic McMurdo Station resupply, Thule Air Base resupply, and Polar Region Freedom of Navigation Transits. This is essential to meet the Coast Guard's mission requirements and the joint Naval Operations Concept. The Coast Guard requires three heavy and three medium icebreakers to fulfill its statutory missions in the Polar Regions. Single-crewed icebreakers are sufficient for current and expected missions, but future use of multiple crews could provide additional capacity for mission growth. The Coast Guard ultimately needs six heavy and four medium icebreakers to meet its mission requirements. The Coast Guard needs six heavy and four medium icebreakers for its missions. Crewing and homeporting alternatives could reduce this to four heavy and two medium icebreakers. Leasing options are also being considered. The decision on how to acquire new icebreakers must provide the best value to taxpayers. The Coast Guard needs to resolve the lease of suitable vessels to provide the best value to taxpayers. While some missions can be conducted with non-government vessels, inherently governmental missions require government-owned vessels. An interpretation of national policy is needed to determine the resource level supporting the nation's interests. The current icebreaker capacity is insufficient, with a bridging strategy expiring around 2020. The Coast Guard requires three heavy icebreakers and three medium icebreakers for missions in the Arctic to serve U.S. economic interests. The Coast Guard needs three heavy icebreakers and three medium icebreakers for Arctic missions to support U.S. economic interests. Admiral Titley mentioned conducting a capabilities assessment, with the Coast Guard playing a key role in the Navy's task force on climate change. The Coast Guard is working closely with the Department of Homeland Security and Admiral Papp on the high latitude study. A January 2011 report highlighted the Coast Guard's lack of budgetary control and insufficient number of icebreakers for Polar Region missions, requiring the U.S. to contract with foreign nations for support. The Coast Guard lacks budgetary control and sufficient icebreaking assets, which may lead to the inability to perform all missions and reliance on foreign nations. Improving strategic approach is necessary for long-term icebreaker capabilities in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Current icebreaking resources are inadequate for future demands, resulting in missions that cannot be fulfilled in the Arctic. Funding for new icebreakers or service life extensions is crucial for the Coast Guard's capabilities. Without funding for new icebreakers or service life extensions, the United States will lose its heavy icebreaking capability by 2020 and all polar icebreaking capability by 2029. This will result in a diminished presence in the Polar Regions, decreased expertise in ice operations, and unmet missions. The Coast Guard requires additional icebreakers for Antarctic missions, as the current heavy-duty icebreakers are at the end of their service lives and becoming less reliable. The Polar Star and Polar Sea icebreakers are at the end of their service lives, making them unreliable and costly to maintain. The Coast Guard needs two icebreakers for Antarctic missions, but without operational icebreakers, missions will go unmet. The Coast Guard is facing a critical crossroads with its aging fleet of icebreakers, with two out of three beyond their intended service life. Recommendations include requesting budgetary authority for operation and maintenance, as well as seeking clarification from Congress on Arctic mission requirements. The Coast Guard is urged to request clarification from Congress on whether Arctic and Antarctic missions should be carried out by Coast Guard assets or contracted vessels. Additionally, they should analyze whether to replace or extend the service life of their two existing icebreaking ships and request necessary appropriations for mission requirements in the Arctic and Antarctic. The Coast Guard has agreed to these recommendations and is taking corrective actions, with ongoing projects addressing program needs identified in the report. The 2010 U.S. Arctic Research Commission Report emphasized the need for investment in human capital, research platforms, and infrastructure, including new polar class icebreakers. The Commission urged the President and Congress to commit to replacing the nation's two polar class icebreakers. The 2007 National Research Council Report assessed roles and future needs for Coast Guard polar icebreakers. The 2007 National Research Council Report concluded that the nation needs a polar icebreaking fleet with three multimission ships and one single-mission research ship to meet future needs through technology advancements and efficient fleet management. The nation needs to program, design, and construct two new polar icebreakers to replace the aging POLAR STAR and POLAR SEA. Building only one new icebreaker is insufficient due to limitations in operational presence and the risk of failure in harsh polar conditions. The U.S. fleet requires two new Polar class icebreakers to ensure backup assistance and enable more robust operations in challenging ice conditions. A second icebreaker would also allow the U.S. Coast Guard to reestablish an active patrol presence in U.S. waters north of Alaska to meet increasing responsibilities arising from human activity, economic development, and environmental changes. The need for two new Polar class icebreakers is essential to respond to emergencies and increase operational capabilities in challenging ice conditions. Having a second icebreaker would also allow for simultaneous operations in different geographic areas, enhance Antarctic logistics, and support international expeditions. Building two new icebreakers upfront would result in cost savings and improve fleet maintenance and operations. The polar icebreaker fleet has been underfunded for years, leading to diminished capabilities. Deferred maintenance and lack of replacement plans have put national interests at risk. The US needs reliable icebreaking capability in both polar regions to maintain influence and access. The United States needs to maintain leadership in polar research by ensuring sufficient icebreaking capability for maritime resupply of McMurdo Station and access to the Arctic and Antarctic. It is crucial to program, budget, design, and construct two new polar icebreakers operated by the U.S. Coast Guard. The POLAR SEA should remain mission capable, and the POLAR STAR should be available for reactivation until the new icebreakers are in service. The U.S. Coast Guard should receive adequate funding for operations and maintenance to increase its presence in the Arctic. Other agencies should cover additional costs for directed mission tasking. To ensure adequate national icebreaking capability for polar regions, a Presidential Decision Directive should align agency responsibilities and budgetary authorities. The Coast Guard supports the NRC report and is collaborating with interagency partners to develop a national polar policy. Identification of U.S. interests in the Arctic and Antarctic should drive USCG capability and resource requirements. The current USG polar icebreaking fleet should be maintained until U.S. interests and priorities are identified. Appendix C provides funding details for the PSC program from FY2013-FY2020, showing a reduction in funding for a new polar icebreaker during FY2014-FY2016 budget submissions. The Coast Guard testified that without increased funding, the icebreaker would be an unfunded requirement. Admiral Zukunft stated that reactivating Polar Star bought 10 years to recapitalize the ice-breaking fleet, with two years already passed. He emphasized the need for increased acquisition budget to meet this requirement. The FY2013 budget submission included $860 million over five years for a new polar icebreaker, with plans to award a construction contract by FY2018 and take delivery by 2023. The FY2013 budget included $860 million over five years for a new polar icebreaker, with plans to award a construction contract by FY2018 and take delivery by 2023. Subsequent budget submissions saw reductions in funding for the icebreaker project, creating uncertainty about the timing of the construction contract award. The FY2013 budget included $860 million over five years for a new polar icebreaker, with plans to award a construction contract by FY2018 and take delivery by 2023. The White House later deferred acquisition of a new icebreaker to FY2020, which was a two-year acceleration from the previously unpublicized date of FY2022. The Administration also announced plans to begin construction of additional icebreakers beyond the one proposed for FY2020. The Coast Guard announced plans for a new polar icebreaker in FY2020, holding industry meetings for market research. The FY2017 budget requested $150 million for the icebreaker, with $147.6 million in procurement funding. The Coast Guard's FY2017-FY2021 five-year Capital Investment Plan included $780 million in procurement funding for a new polar icebreaker. The FY2018 budget requested $19 million for the icebreaker, with a total of $949 million over five years. This funding supports activities for the Request for Proposal and Detail Design and Construction. The Coast Guard is conducting testing and reviewing Industry Studies contract deliverables for a new polar icebreaker. They are receiving support from the Integrated Program Office and Ship Design Team, developing logistics and integration for government furnished information and equipment, and conducting additional modeling efforts for the evaluation and source selection process for the Detail Design & Construction RFP. The Program is maturing the system specification and preparing for the \"Obtain\" phase in early FY 2018. Collaboration with the Navy has helped accelerate the construction timeline and improve the acquisition approach through Industry Studies. The Coast Guard is maturing the acquisition approach for a new polar icebreaker by incorporating Industry Studies to minimize cost, schedule, production, and technology risks. The FY2019 budget requested $750 million for procurement funding for the program, with a total of $1,805 million over the five-year period FY2019-FY2023. The \"Obtain\" phase will include awarding a contract for Detail Design & Construction for the heavy polar icebreaker. The Coast Guard's FY2019 budget requested $750 million for procurement funding for a new polar icebreaker. However, earlier documents showed a funding request of $30 million. The FY2020 budget proposes $35 million for the PSC program. The Coast Guard aims to fund the PC&I account at a level of $1 billion to $1.2 billion per year. The Coast Guard's budget submissions may hinder funding for acquisition projects like a new polar icebreaker and shore installations. Plans include procuring two Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPCs) per year at a cost of $400 million each, leaving limited funding for other programs. Coast Guard officials emphasize the need for a yearly PC&I account funding of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for successful execution of acquisition programs. Future funding levels for executive branch agencies, such as the Coast Guard, should not always be based on past funding levels. Assuming that future funding will mirror past levels can limit congressional options and hinder the agency's ability to acquire major platforms like polar icebreakers and shore installations. Maintaining Congress's role as a co-equal branch of government requires a broader analysis of funding needs. Past funding levels should not dictate future funding for executive branch agencies like the Coast Guard. This can limit congressional options and hinder the agency's ability to acquire major platforms. Congress must conduct a broader analysis of funding needs to maintain its role as a co-equal branch of government. The Coast Guard operates within a budget of around $1.4 billion for acquisitions annually, but estimates show a need for $2.5 billion per year to sustain infrastructure and upgrade equipment. Tradeoffs must be made to balance frontline operations and recapitalization efforts. The Coast Guard's current budget for acquisitions is around $1.4 billion annually, but there is a need for $2.5 billion per year to maintain infrastructure and upgrade equipment. Rear Adm. Mark Butt and Admiral Papp have both emphasized the importance of increased procurement funding to properly recapitalize the Coast Guard. Admiral Papp emphasized the need for increased procurement funding to properly recapitalize the Coast Guard, stating that $500 million is significant for the agency. With a reduced budget of $1 billion, priority projects can be funded, but others may need to be terminated or reduced to minimum order quantities. The Coast Guard is facing challenges with budget constraints, leading to difficulties in ordering necessary equipment in economic quantities. This results in higher costs and forces the service to sustain older assets, ultimately eating into operating funds. Despite efforts to prioritize projects within the budget, there is a need for increased procurement funding to properly recapitalize the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard struggles with budget constraints, hindering the ability to order necessary equipment in economic quantities. Admiral Papp highlighted the challenge of funding all projects, including aging shore infrastructure and fleet, with a budget of around $1 billion per year. There is a need for increased procurement funding to properly recapitalize the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard faces budget constraints, making it difficult to fund necessary projects. Admiral Zukunft emphasized the need for a higher acquisition budget of $1.5 billion to expedite programs and reduce long-term costs. The Coast Guard requires a $2 billion annual acquisition budget to sustain its recapitalization plans and operations, according to Admiral Zukunft. This budget should grow modestly over time to keep pace with inflation, ensuring predictability and reliability in funding. Admiral Zukunft emphasized the need for a predictable and reliable acquisition budget with 5 percent annual growth to cover operations and maintenance costs. Stable funding is crucial for the Coast Guard's capabilities, as they have been underfunded in recent years. The Coast Guard's Great Lakes icebreaker fleet consists of nine cutters, including one heavy icebreaker, Mackinaw (WLBB-30), and six 140-foot Bay-class icebreaking tugs. The fleet also includes two 225-foot Juniper-class seagoing buoy tenders with light icebreaking capability. Mackinaw is larger and has more icebreaking capability than the other ships in the fleet. The Coast Guard's Great Lakes icebreaker fleet includes nine cutters, with Mackinaw being larger and more capable than the other ships. Additional icebreakers are not seen as an urgent need due to the current fleet's capabilities, Mackinaw's young age, ongoing service life extension work, and Canada's icebreaking capabilities. The Coast Guard's Great Lakes icebreaker fleet, including nine cutters, is capable of managing icebreaking priorities in Tier 1 and 2 waterways. During severe ice seasons, Canada's partnership provides extra heavy-icebreaking resources to fill capability gaps. The 2014 and 2015 ice seasons were unusually severe, leading to increased cutter resource hours. It is uncertain if investing in a single heavy icebreaker would significantly mitigate shipping delays during extreme ice coverage conditions exceeding 90 percent. Various factors contribute to delays, including slow transit speeds, pilot availability, and competing demand signals for icebreaking services across the Great Lakes. Some Members of Congress have shown interest in bolstering the Coast Guard's Great Lakes icebreaking fleet by procuring a second icebreaker similar to Mackinaw due to high ice coverage in recent winters. The Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018 includes a provision for Great Lakes icebreaker acquisition. In 2019, the Commandant of the Coast Guard may use funds for constructing an icebreaker on the Great Lakes. A plan for acquiring the icebreaker must be submitted within 45 days, detailing acquisition activities and funding allocation from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Commandant of the Coast Guard may use funds from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 to support acquisition activities for a new heavy Great Lakes icebreaker. The design and construction cost could range from $175 million to $300 million, depending on capabilities and acquisition strategy. Using an existing icebreaker design could reduce costs, and construction time may be shorter depending on the shipyard selected."
