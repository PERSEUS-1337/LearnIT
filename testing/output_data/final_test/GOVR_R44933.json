    "content": "President Trump's FY2018 budget request included $45.2 billion for FSGG agencies, with $250 million for the CFTC. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a bill with $42.5 billion in funding, $2.5 billion below the President's request. The bill was later considered as Division D of H.R. 3354 in September 2017. The FSGG bill, H.R. 3354, was amended multiple times before passing in September 2017. The Senate Committee on Appropriations released a recommended bill with funding totaling $43.3 billion, $1.9 billion below the President's request. Congress passed a continuing resolution, P.L. 115-56, providing funding for FSGG agencies based on FY2017 rates with anomalies included. The FSGG anomalies focused on decreasing funding related to the presidential transition. Four additional CRs were enacted in December 2017, January 2018, and February 2018. P.L. 115-123 included additional funding for the GSA and SBA to address disaster costs from hurricanes in 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 was enacted on March 23, 2018, with a focus on human trafficking eradication. The FSGG appropriations for FY2018 totaled $47.7 billion, with significant differences between requested and enacted amounts for various agencies including the SBA, GSA, FCC, and EAC. Table 1 provides an overview of the FSGG appropriations process, while Table 2 lists the requested amounts. The FSGG appropriations for FY2018 totaled $47.7 billion, with significant differences between requested and enacted amounts for various agencies. The bill does not include funding for the regulation of much of the financial services industry, which is subdivided into banking, insurance, and securities. Federal regulation of the banking industry is divided among several agencies. The banking industry is regulated by multiple agencies including the FDIC, OCC, and CFPB, while credit unions are overseen by the NCUA. Insurance regulation is primarily at the state level with some oversight by the Federal Reserve. The SEC and CFTC regulate federal securities, with the CFTC funded through appropriations. The CFTC is funded through appropriations, while the SEC funding is provided by the FSGG bill and offset through fees collected by the SEC. H.R. 3280 and H.R. 3354 include provisions amending the Dodd-Frank Act and other statutes related to financial regulation and funding of financial regulators. H.R. 3280 and H.R. 3354 would bring financial regulators under the FSGG bill for funding, instead of outside appropriations. P.L. 115-141 included H.R. 4267 and H.R. 4792 for small business access to capital, not in the FSGG portion. House and Senate Committees reorganized subcommittees in 2007. The FSGG Subcommittee in the House and Senate has jurisdiction over various agencies previously under different subcommittees. The House FSGG Subcommittee includes agencies from TTHUD and Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. The Senate FSGG Subcommittee combines agencies from three previous subcommittees. The FSGG Subcommittee in the House and Senate now has jurisdiction over various agencies previously under different subcommittees, including the FCC, FTC, SEC, and SBA. The CFTC is under the jurisdiction of the FSGG Subcommittee in the Senate and the Agriculture Subcommittee in the House."
