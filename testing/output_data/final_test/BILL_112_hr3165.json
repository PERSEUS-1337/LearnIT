The Positive Behavior for Safe and Effective Schools Act highlights the ineffectiveness of harsh school discipline policies, such as suspension and expulsion, in addressing minor misbehavior. Research shows that these approaches can reinforce bad behavior and lead to higher rates of misbehavior in suspended students. Despite this, suspensions and expulsions are increasing nationally, with over 3,300,000 students suspended at least once during the 2005-2006 school year. Over 3,300,000 students were suspended and 100,000 expelled in a year. Students of color and those with disabilities face higher suspension and expulsion rates. School discipline is linked to dropout rates, delinquent behavior, and teacher turnover. (8) Successful schools have high academic and behavior standards, with improved student behavior correlating with better academic outcomes.\n(9) Evidence-based practices like school-wide positive behavior supports are not widely adopted or accurately implemented.\n(10) Implementing school-wide positive behavior supports leads to higher academic achievement, fewer disciplinary problems, and increased instructional time.\n(11) Early intervening services are effective for instructional support. Implementing school-wide positive behavior supports led to a significant decrease in out-of-school suspensions at an elementary school in Illinois, resulting in a gain of 386 days of instructional time. In Maryland, early intervening services reduced office discipline referrals by 42 percent, recouping 119 days of instructional time for students. Implementing school-wide positive behavior supports can lead to safer teaching environments, reduced teacher transfer requests, and decreased teacher absence days. These approaches help all students, including those with challenging behaviors, to succeed. The purpose of this Act is to expand the use of school-wide positive behavior supports in schools to create a conducive learning environment, reduce discipline referrals, and improve student academic outcomes. The term \"positive behavior supports\" in this Act refers to a systematic approach to reinforce desired behaviors and eliminate reinforcement for problem behaviors in order to achieve social outcomes and increase learning for all students, including those with complex behavioral needs. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 allows flexibility to use Title I funds for school-wide positive behavior supports, including early intervening services for all students, not just those in special education. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 allows flexibility in using Title I funds for school-wide positive behavior supports and early intervening services for all students, not just those in special education. Funds allocated for additional academic and behavioral support must align with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and supplement existing funds without replacing them. Technical assistance provisions are also included in the amendments. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 allows flexibility in using Title I funds for school-wide positive behavior supports and early intervening services for all students, not just those in special education. Technical assistance provisions are included in the amendments to support the implementation of effective approaches for improving the learning environment and reducing disciplinary actions that remove students from instruction. Section 1117(a)(5)(B) is amended to include a provision for schools to review discipline referrals and school climate to implement positive behavior supports. Additionally, Section 1114(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I) allows LEAs to use Title I funds for school-wide behavior supports and early intervening services for all students. The amendment in 1965 allows for improving the learning environment in schools through the implementation of positive behavior supports to enhance academic outcomes and reduce disciplinary actions.

SEC. 6 focuses on safe and drug-free schools and communities. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to support programs that improve school climate, prevent discipline problems, reduce suspensions and expulsions, prevent violence, illegal substance use, promote family engagement, and coordinate efforts with Federal, State, school, and community resources. Federal, State, school, and community efforts support a safe and drug-free learning environment for student academic achievement through Federal assistance for local programs improving school climate. SEC. 7 amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to address the need for early intervening services to improve school climate and reduce disciplinary actions. SEC. 8 focuses on specialized instructional support services. The Secretary of Education oversees programs for specialized instructional support services in schools to enhance academic achievement and educational outcomes for students. This includes improving services, identifying effective practices, and providing ongoing training for personnel. The Secretary of Education oversees programs for specialized instructional support services in schools to enhance academic achievement and educational outcomes for students. This includes providing development opportunities, technical assistance, coordination of services, and evaluation of effectiveness. Specialized instructional support personnel, such as counselors, social workers, psychologists, provide assessment, counseling, and other services to meet student needs. Specialized instructional support services are the services provided by these personnel to support students. SEC. 9. DEFINITION IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT OF 1965. Section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a definition of \"family engagement in education\" as a shared responsibility between families and schools for student success from birth through young adulthood, involving active support for children's learning and development in the home, school, and community.
