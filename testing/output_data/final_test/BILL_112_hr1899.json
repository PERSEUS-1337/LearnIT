The proclamation must specify the geographic area, fuel type, and duration of the restriction. Factors considered in determining a violation of selling gasoline or petroleum distillates at excessive prices include comparing the current price to the average price in the 30 days prior to a proclamation being issued. The excessive pricing of gasoline or petroleum distillates is evaluated based on factors like availability from other sellers, additional costs incurred, and market conditions.

SEC. 303. ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. The Federal Trade Commission enforces violations of section 302 as unfair or deceptive acts. They have jurisdiction and enforcement powers similar to the Federal Trade Commission Act. Priority is given to companies with over $10 billion in annual sales of gasoline and petroleum distillates. Civil penalties apply for violations. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, violators of section 302 may face civil penalties of up to 3 times the profits gained or a maximum of $100,000,000. Penalties are obtained similarly to those under section 5 of the Act. Each day of violation is considered separate, and the court considers mitigating factors when assessing penalties. When assessing penalties for violations under the Federal Trade Commission Act, the court considers factors such as the seriousness of the violation and the efforts made to remedy the harm caused in a timely manner. SEC. 304. CRIMINAL PENALTIES. Any person violating section 302 may be fined up to $500,000,000 under title 18, US Code.

ENFORCEMENT AT RETAIL LEVEL BY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL. A State can bring a civil action in federal court to enforce section 302 or impose civil penalties under section 303(b)(1)(B) if the State's attorney general believes residents' interests are threatened by a violation of this title involving a retail sale. The State must notify the Federal Trade Commission before taking legal action, providing a copy of the complaint if feasible, or immediately after initiating the action. Upon receiving notice from a State's attorney general regarding a civil action under this section, the Federal Trade Commission may intervene in the action, allowing them to be heard on all matters and file petitions for appeal. The attorney general of a State retains the power to conduct investigations and compel evidence. Venue for such civil actions will be in a judicial district where the violation occurred. In civil actions under this section, venue is determined by where the defendant operates, is authorized to do business, or is found. Process serving is not limited by district or state boundaries. Participants in the alleged violation can be joined in the action regardless of their residence. State actions are limited if the Federal Trade Commission has initiated a civil or administrative action for violations of this title. State officials can enforce civil or criminal statutes in State court. They can also bring actions against defendants named in complaints by the Federal Trade Commission for violations of this title. SEC. 306. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS. This section clarifies that the Federal Trade Commission retains its authority to enforce actions under existing laws, and states that this title does not override any State laws."
