    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mercury Pollution Reduction Act of 2009\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. Approximately 10 percent of women of childbearing age in the United States have mercury in their bloodstreams at levels that could harm unborn babies. The main source of mercury exposure in the U.S. is contaminated fish. The long-term solution to mercury pollution is to reduce global mercury use and releases to lower contamination levels in the environment. Mercury pollution is a transboundary pollutant that affects bodies of water globally, including industrial areas like the Great Lakes and remote areas like the Arctic Circle. Only 5 out of 30 chlorine plants in the US use the outdated \"mercury cell\" process, with 4 plants yet to commit to phasing out mercury use. Less than 5% of chlorine and caustic soda in the US comes from these plants. The chlor-alkali industry acknowledges the contamination of products with mercury and the release of mercury from the use of these products. Despite the known use of mercury, neither the industry nor the EPA can account for its disposition. Other countries, like Japan, have already banned the mercury cell chlor-alkali process due to cost-effective alternatives being available and in use in the majority of chlorine and caustic soda production. The United States must work aggressively to minimize mercury supply, demand, and emissions both domestically and internationally. Congress declares that the United States should develop policies to reduce mercury use and emissions, releases from existing mercury reservoirs, and exposures to mercury, especially for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, a new section is added to the Toxic Substances Control Act regarding the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. In this section, definitions for chlor-alkali facility, hazardous waste, and solid waste are provided. The manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States, along with the export of mercury-related products. The Secretary of Energy must develop a system for storing all mercury from chlor-alkali facilities within 24 months. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must report types and quantities of mercury-containing waste generated each year to the Administrator and the state. The chlor-alkali facility must report the mercury content of wastes, how each waste was managed, volume of mercury released into air or water, and estimated mercury accumulation in plant equipment. The chlor-alkali facility must report the quantity and forms of mercury in products for sale, methods of accumulation, and may combine the report with other required submissions to avoid duplication. For facilities ceasing operations after January 1, 2009, an inventory must be submitted within 1 year of cessation. The Administrator, in consultation with the State, conducts a comprehensive mercury inventory for chlor-alkali facilities, including total mercury purchased, remaining in equipment at closure, estimated mercury in waste and products generated, and aggregate mercury releases into the environment. The Administrator is authorized to obtain mercury purchase records and other necessary information from chlor-alkali facilities to determine the magnitude and nature of mercury releases into the environment. This is done in consultation with the State to conduct a comprehensive mercury inventory for these facilities. The Substances Control Act is amended to include a new section after section 6. The Substances Control Act is amended to include a new section, 6A, regarding the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. Enforcement of this new section is added to Section 15 of the Act."
