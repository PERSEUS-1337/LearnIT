The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a leading biomedical research entity that supports researchers in every state to discover treatments and cures, leading to increased life expectancy and improved health. NIH-supported research has contributed to the discovery of numerous FDA-approved drugs and vaccines. However, the application success rate is currently at an all-time low. The grant application success rate for NIH-funded research has dropped to 16.8 percent in 2013, a significant decrease from previous years. Federal funding cuts threaten to diminish the United States' leadership in biomedical research, as other countries are increasing their investments while the US has decreased its funding. In fiscal year 2012, the NIH extramural program supported 50,000 research grants and 300,000 scientists at universities and research institutions across the US. Economists estimate a high return on investment in NIH, with the Human Genome Project alone generating $796 billion in economic output. Sales of products based on NIH inventions in 2013 included 358 items. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has lost purchasing power for medical research since 2003 due to inadequate funding. If NIH had kept up with biomedical inflation, its appropriation would have been $37 billion in 2013, instead of the actual $28.9 billion. To restore funding to 2003 levels, Congress would need to appropriate $46.5 billion in fiscal year 2021. High health care costs from common conditions threaten budgets at all levels. Alzheimer's disease costs over $200 billion annually, projected to reach $1 trillion by 2050 without a cure. A 1% reduction in cancer mortality rates could save $500 billion, while a cure for cancer could save over $50 trillion, more than 3 times the US GDP in 2012. Undiagnosed diabetes also incurs significant annual costs. Annual costs from undiagnosed diabetes are $245 billion, and a study predicts that by 2030, 44% of the US population will have cardiovascular disease costing $1.2 trillion between 2012 and 2030. Congress uses budget cap adjustments to prioritize spending for economic growth and debt reduction. SEC. 3. CAP ADJUSTMENT. Section 251(b)(2) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to include adjustments for the National Institutes of Health in appropriations bills for fiscal years. For fiscal years 2015 to 2019, additional new budget authority amounts are set at $3 billion, $6.3 billion, $8.1 billion, $10 billion, and $12 billion respectively. For fiscal years 2020 and 2021, there will be $14.1 billion and $16.3 billion in additional new budget authority respectively. The term 'additional new budget authority' refers to the amount provided in excess of $29.9 billion in an appropriation Act. The term 'National Institutes of Health' refers to the appropriations accounts supporting the various institutes, offices, and centers within the organization."
