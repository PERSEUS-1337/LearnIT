    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alternative Fuels Promotion Act\" and includes findings. The Senate finds that the United States has imported over half of its oil since 1994, with a projected increase in dependence on foreign oil. This reliance poses a national security risk and negatively impacts the nation's trade balance. To address these issues, Congress should promote domestically-available alternative transportation fuels. Developing alternative transportation fuels is crucial to reduce negative environmental impacts like air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Tax credits at the point of distribution into alternative fuel vehicles are necessary to encourage the installation of fueling infrastructure. In the short-term, US alternative fuel policy should be fuel neutral to promote private innovation and use of economically feasible fuels. Tax credits have increased availability of alternative fuel technology. Extending these credits promotes alternative fuel vehicles and infrastructure. Federal fleets are ideal customers for alternative fuel vehicles but have not met purchase requirements. Efforts are needed to ensure Federal agencies comply with fleet purchase requirements laws and executive orders, as these requirements are often not met. SEC. 101. CREDIT FOR QUALIFIED ELECTRIC VEHICLES. Increased Credit for Vehicles Which Meet Certain Range Requirements. Section 30(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow a credit for qualified electric vehicles meeting a driving range of at least 100 miles on a single charge. The credit includes 10% of the vehicle's cost and an additional $5,000 if the range requirement is met.

Additionally, the credit is extended through 2010, with amendments made to the termination and phaseout provisions.

Section 179A(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to limit the aggregate cost for qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling property placed in service during the taxable year. The maximum amount allowed is $100,000 minus the total costs already claimed under subsection (a)(1)(B) by the taxpayer or related persons.

This change applies to property placed in service after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 103. CREDIT FOR RETAIL SALE OF CLEAN BURNING FUELS AS MOTOR VEHICLE FUEL. This section introduces a new credit for the retail sale of clean burning fuels as motor vehicle fuel. The clean burning fuel retail sales credit allows a taxpayer to claim 50 cents for each gasoline gallon equivalent of clean burning fuel sold for qualified motor vehicles. Clean burning fuel includes natural gas, hydrogen, and methanol-based liquids. Gasoline gallon equivalent is determined by the fuel's Btu content. The term 'qualified motor vehicle' refers to any vehicle meeting Federal or State emissions standards for each fuel it uses. 'Sold at retail' means selling for non-resale purposes after manufacture, production, or importation, with the use of clean burning fuel treated as a retail sale. The clean burning fuel retail sales credit is available for vehicles meeting emissions standards, with the credit amount reduced by any other fuel-related deductions or credits. The credit is treated as a business credit and applies to fuel sold at retail before December 31, 2007. The amendment prohibits carrying back the clean burning fuel retail sales credit to taxable years before January 1, 1999.
