However, no method can fully explain the disparity. Using BLS data, the debate on the male-female pay gap is illustrated, highlighting the complexity of determining the causes of earnings differences. In 2014, full-time female workers earned 83% of what male workers earned. Female workers earn 83% of the median weekly earnings of full-time male workers. Differences in earnings are partly due to occupation choices, with women more likely in lower-paying fields. Male workers tend to work more hours per week than female workers. Among full-time workers who work 40 hours per week, the pay gap between male and female workers is 11% compared to 17% overall. The earnings gap is smaller for younger workers and unmarried workers without children, with gaps of 10% and 6% respectively. Interpretations of these findings vary, with some suggesting the pay gap is negligible while others argue for further action due to potential discrimination in job assignments. The Equal Pay Act (EPA) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are federal laws that address sex-based wage discrimination. The EPA prohibits paying different wages to opposite-sex employees for equal work, while Title VII prohibits sex-based wage discrimination by employers and labor organizations. Despite efforts to attribute the pay gap to factors other than sex, discrimination remains a possibility. The Equal Pay Act (EPA) allows wage differentials based on seniority, merit, quality/quantity of production, or factors other than sex. The standard for \"equal work\" focuses on job similarity in terms of skill, effort, and responsibility. Employers cannot lower pay rates to comply with the EPA. Congress enacted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act a year after the EPA, providing antidiscrimination rules based on race, color, national origin, religion, and sex. EPA and Title VII overlap in coverage for sex-based wage discrimination but differ in substantive aspects. The Equal Pay Act (EPA) and Title VII overlap in coverage for sex-based wage discrimination but differ in important substantive, procedural, and remedial aspects. The EPA's \"equal work\" standard does not limit liability for intentional wage discrimination under Title VII. Violation of the EPA generally violates Title VII, but the reverse is not true. Remedies for violation of the two laws also differ, with the EPA allowing backpay for unlawfully withheld wages due to pay inequality. Title VII allows for backpay and liquidated damages for willful violations of pay inequality, while compensatory and punitive damages are authorized in cases of intentional discrimination. Damages are limited by dollar caps based on employer size. The Ledbetter v. Goodyear case highlighted the impact of past discrimination on ongoing pay disparities. The Court rejected the plaintiff's argument that each paycheck constituted a new violation of Title VII, leading to a significant pay disparity between her and male colleagues. This decision limited some pay discrimination claims under Title VII but did not affect the ability to sue for sex discrimination resulting in pay bias under the Equal Pay Act. The Court's decision limited pay discrimination claims under Title VII but did not affect the ability to sue for sex discrimination resulting in pay bias under the Equal Pay Act. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 amended Title VII to clarify that the time limit for suing employers for pay discrimination begins with each paycheck issued. This change applies to various discrimination acts, including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. In 2004, a federal court allowed a class action lawsuit on behalf of over 1.5 million female employees of Wal-Mart, alleging gender pay disparities. In a class action lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., plaintiffs alleged gender pay disparities and lack of promotions for women. Studies showed that while 65% of hourly employees were women, only 33% held management positions. Female employees earned less than males, with significant pay gaps for female store managers. The district court considered evidence for a class action lawsuit against Wal-Mart regarding gender pay disparities and lack of promotions for women. Plaintiffs presented statistics showing women at Wal-Mart are paid less than men, with disparities in most job categories and slower advancement to management positions. Wal-Mart argued disparities were due to decentralized decision-making, not systematic bias. The court rejected this argument. The court approved class certification for a gender discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart, despite the company's argument that a massive class-action would be too large to administer. The Supreme Court later reversed the class certification ruling in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes. The Supreme Court reversed the class certification ruling in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes. The plaintiffs failed to meet the commonality requirement as they could not prove Wal-Mart operated under a common policy of discrimination. The Supreme Court reversed the class certification ruling in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, emphasizing the need for \"significant proof\" of a specific employment practice leading to discrimination. This decision may make it harder for plaintiffs to receive class certification in employment discrimination cases, potentially reducing the number of suits against larger employers. Plaintiffs in the Wal-Mart case can still pursue their claims individually or as part of a smaller class. Some plaintiffs filed individual charges with the EEOC after the Dukes decision, while others filed regional class action lawsuits in states like California, Texas, Tennessee, and Florida. These lawsuits have faced challenges, with courts denying class certification in California and dismissing requests in Florida as time-barred. Suits in Tennessee and Texas, initially time-barred, have been allowed to proceed. The Dukes plaintiffs in California and Texas, initially time-barred, have been allowed to proceed under subsequent appellate court rulings. The statute of limitations is tolled for individual claims, allowing new plaintiffs to file class action lawsuits against Wal-Mart in the future. Female plaintiffs must prove intentional discrimination in pay and promotions, which may be challenging due to subjective personnel procedures and lack of documentation on promotion opportunities before January 2003. Limited data exists on the number of male or female employees applying for these positions. The Dukes case involved allegations of pay discrimination and sexual harassment at large corporations. For example, Morgan Stanley settled for $54 million for underpaying and failing to promote women executives. The settlement included $40 million for potential discrimination victims and $2 million for antidiscrimination programs. After the settlement in the Morgan Stanley case, Boeing and Citigroup settled pay equity lawsuits, while Costco chose to defend itself in court. The Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp. case was granted class-action status by a federal district court, but a federal appeals court vacated the ruling and remanded the case for reconsideration based on the proper legal standard for evaluating commonality. The district court ruled in favor of the Costco plaintiffs on remand, distinguishing the case from Dukes lawsuit based on specific management positions and controlled promotion process. The court found sufficient commonality for class action status, leading to an $8 million settlement in the Costco case. The Costco case settled for $8 million after the district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. Pay equity legislation, including the Paycheck Fairness Act and Fair Pay Act, continues to be a focus in Congress with new bills introduced in the 114th Congress. The legislation aims to ensure equal pay for men and women, with added programs for training, research, and pay equity employer recognition awards. It would make it harder for employers to avoid liability under the Equal Pay Act (EPA) and protect employees from retaliation. The legislation would reform procedures and remedies for enforcing the law, allowing prevailing plaintiffs to recover backpay and liquidated damages. Compensatory damages for physical or mental distress are not authorized under the EPA. The Paycheck Fairness Act aims to authorize EPA class actions, compensatory and punitive damages, and establish more restrictive standards for proof by employers. It also addresses employer recordkeeping and the conduct of technical assistance, research, and educational programs by federal agencies. The Paycheck Fairness Act and the Fair Pay Act aim to address wage disparities by mandating record-keeping, data collection, and expanding the scope of the Equal Pay Act to include racial and ethnic minorities as protected classes. The Fair Pay Act also proposes a \"National Award for Pay Equity in the Workplace\" to recognize employers who make efforts to eliminate pay disparities. The Fair Pay Act aims to provide greater protection to minority groups by requiring equal pay regardless of sex, race, or national origin for equivalent jobs. It would narrow the EPA's catchall exception and introduce compensatory and punitive damages without a statutory limit. The Fair Pay Act aims to ensure equal wages regardless of sex, race, or national origin for workers in equivalent jobs. It would replace the \"equal work standard\" in the EPA with job equivalency, potentially leading to legal issues similar to those seen in the 1980s. Covered employers would be required to maintain detailed records of how employee wages are set and submit annual reports to the EEOC on the composition of their workforce. These reports would be available for inspection upon request. The EEOC regulations allow for inspection and examination upon request, and could be used for research purposes. New bills like the End Pay Discrimination Through Information Act and Workplace Advancement Act aim to expand antiretaliation provisions to prohibit employer retaliation against employees discussing salary information. The Gender Advancement in Pay Act would also prohibit retaliation based on wage information sharing and alter employer defenses under the EPA. The Gender Advancement in Pay Act aims to exempt employers from liability for wage differentials based on factors other than sex, toll the statute of limitations for EPA suits, add civil penalties for willful violations, and use penalty funds for a grant program and study on increasing women's participation in underrepresented industries. The bill would require the Department of Labor and the EEOC to develop technical assistance materials for small businesses to comply with the law."
