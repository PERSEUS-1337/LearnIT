    "title": "SB 1107",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that citizens should have a voice in politics, elections must be fair, and campaign costs can lead to undue influence from wealthy donors and special interests, eroding public trust in government. Special interests contribute more to incumbents than challengers seeking access to elected officials, accounting for a large portion of the financial incumbency advantage. Citizen-funded election programs have been enacted in six charter cities in California and other jurisdictions. Citizen-funded election programs reduce financial advantages of incumbency, allowing individuals from all backgrounds to run for office. These programs also limit reliance on wealthy donors and special interests, preventing corruption and maintaining political integrity. Studies support the effectiveness of such programs. Public financing of elections reduces fund raising pressures on public office seekers, limits undue influence of special interest groups, and prevents corruption. The United States Supreme Court has recognized the importance of public financing in eliminating improper influence of large private contributions, furthering significant governmental interests. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of citizen-funded election programs in promoting public discussion and participation in the electoral process. The absolute prohibition on public campaign financing allows special interests to gain disproportionate influence and favors incumbents. An exception should be created to permit citizen-funded election programs for fairer elections. Amending Section 85300 of the Government Code would allow public officers and candidates to use public moneys for seeking elective office, with certain limitations. A public officer or candidate may use public moneys for seeking elective office if a dedicated fund is established by the state or local government, available to all qualified candidates without bias. An officeholder convicted of a felony must use funds for specific purposes as outlined in the Government Code. The bill outlines the specific purposes for which an officeholder must use funds, including the payment of outstanding campaign debts or elected officer's expenses, and the repayment of contributions. After six months of a conviction becoming final, any remaining funds must be forfeited and deposited in the General Fund. The provisions of the bill are severable, and if any part is held invalid, it will not affect other provisions that can still be enforced. SEC. 5. This act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing crimes or penalties. SEC. 6. The bill aligns with the Political Reform Act of 1974."
