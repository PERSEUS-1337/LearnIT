    "content": "Malaria, caused by a parasite transmitted through mosquito bites, affects 247 million people annually, with nearly 1 million deaths, mostly children under five. Despite eradication in the US, it remains a serious problem in 109 countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Efforts to prevent and control malaria have been recognized as crucial for community health and economic growth in developing countries. The 1990s saw a resurgence of malaria after a decline in research and control investments. Concerns were raised at high-level meetings, including the U.N. General Assembly, about the impact of malaria on developing countries. U.S. policymakers have shown interest in combating malaria, passing legislation to provide aid and funding for global programs. The U.S. government reorganized malaria programs to focus on funding for prevention and control measures. The U.S. government reorganized malaria programs to prioritize funding for commodities, distribution, monitoring, and evaluation. This report outlines key interventions for malaria prevention, control, and treatment, as well as U.S. programs through USAID and CDC. It also addresses possible issues for Congress regarding funding levels, program priorities, access to commodities, and oversight. Malaria is a complex disease caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted through infected mosquitoes. Eradication efforts have succeeded in some parts of the world but failed in others. Understanding the disease, its impact, and past international efforts is crucial for successful control. Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted through infected mosquitoes. Symptoms include fever, headache, nausea, and organ failure. Vulnerable groups include pregnant women, infants, and those with HIV/AIDS. Most cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, but other regions are also affected. In 2008, 109 countries were considered malaria endemic. In 2008, 109 countries were considered malaria endemic, with 45 in sub-Saharan Africa. High rates of malaria in developing countries can negatively impact economic growth and public health resources. Malaria accounts for a significant portion of outpatient clinic visits and hospital admissions in affected African countries. The disease disproportionately affects poor and marginalized populations, contributing to the cycle of poverty by draining financial resources. Malaria can perpetuate poverty by draining resources and causing absenteeism. Deaths in Africa often occur in conflict-affected populations due to disrupted healthcare. Prevention, accurate diagnosis, and prompt treatment are crucial. Key strategies include early treatment with ACTs to prevent complications and deaths. Health prefer to use artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to combat malaria, as they are more effective than older drugs like chloroquine. ACTs consist of artemisinin and other antimalarial drugs to reduce the risk of drug resistance. IPTp involves giving pregnant women doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to prevent malaria-related complications. IRS, or indoor residual spraying, helps control malaria transmission by using insecticide on house walls. The use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are strategies to control malaria transmission. ITNs protect individuals from malaria-infected mosquitoes, while IRS involves spraying insecticide inside houses to reduce mosquito presence. Different types of insecticides vary in cost, availability, and effectiveness. Some nets retain insecticidal properties for up to six months, while long-lasting nets can last for up to 3 years. The appropriate mix of prevention and treatment interventions is crucial in combating malaria. Malaria prevention and treatment interventions can vary based on local conditions such as parasite and mosquito resistance. USAID selects interventions based on disease transmission patterns, demographics, and feasibility. Malaria control is crucial for community health and economic growth in developing countries. Global eradication efforts in the past had mixed success, with sub-Saharan Africa largely excluded. Sub-Saharan Africa was excluded from global malaria eradication efforts due to high infection rates, costs, and beliefs about tribal populations. Investments in malaria research declined, leading to a resurgence of the disease in the 1990s. Recent high-level meetings reflect growing political interest in addressing the negative impacts of malaria on affected regions. In the late 1990s, African heads of state made declarations to combat malaria's impact in Africa, calling for coordinated efforts and increased investments from governments and international organizations. Since the late 1990s, there has been a global increase in public and private sector investments in malaria control and research. The Roll Back Malaria Partnership was launched by WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, and the World Bank to coordinate efforts in fighting malaria. The U.N. General Assembly aimed to halt and reverse malaria incidence by 2015 as part of the Millennium Development Goals. U.S. policymakers have shown strong interest in combating global malaria over the past decade. Congress increased funding for global malaria from FY2001 to FY2008 through the Assistance for International Malaria Control Act of 2000 and the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. However, criticism of U.S. global malaria policies grew in 2004 and 2005, leading to congressional hearings and proposed legislation to change U.S. malaria efforts. Concerns were raised about USAID's focus on technical assistance rather than purchasing. In 2005, concerns were raised about USAID's malaria programs focusing on technical assistance rather than purchasing and distributing commodities like antimalarial drugs and ITNs. Criticisms included ineffective interventions and lack of transparency in program results and spending. Increased funding coincided with a rise in malaria-related deaths in Africa. USAID reorganized its programs and policies to address these issues. USAID reorganized its malaria programs to prioritize funding for procuring commodities, program transparency, and monitoring activities. President George W. Bush proposed the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) to reduce malaria-related deaths in sub-Saharan African countries by 2010, pledging $1.2 billion over five years for U.S. global malaria programs. This initiative was part of the Bush Administration's African development agenda, aiming to address poverty and disease in the region. USAID reorganized its malaria programs to prioritize funding for procuring commodities, program transparency, and monitoring activities. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) was proposed by President George W. Bush to reduce malaria-related deaths in sub-Saharan African countries by 2010, with a pledge of $1.2 billion over five years for U.S. global malaria programs. This initiative was part of the Bush Administration's African development agenda, aiming to address poverty and disease in the region. The agency concentrated its malaria resources in fewer countries and regions starting in 2006, aiming to combine all malaria activities into a single, strategic, global malaria program. Congress expressed strong interest in U.S. efforts to combat global malaria, applauding the creation and rapid implementation of the PMI approach in several countries but discussing the need for continued improvement in U.S. malaria activities. In 2008, Congress passed the Lantos-Hyde Act authorizing $5 billion for U.S. global malaria efforts. The act directed the development of a comprehensive strategy to fight global malaria and the appointment of a U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator. Senator Barack Obama pledged to end malaria-related deaths by 2015 during his presidential campaign. The Obama Administration committed to increasing investments in global health programs, including HIV/AIDS and malaria. The Obama Administration committed to increasing investments in global health programs, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis through successful programs like PEPFAR and the Malaria Initiative. Congress has not specified targeted countries for U.S. global malaria efforts, suggesting support for a more integrated approach led by the U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator at USAID. The creation of the U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator position replaced the PMI Coordinator, overseeing malaria programs globally. An Interagency Steering Group advises the Coordinator, with USAID and CDC as primary agencies for malaria programs worldwide. USAID supports malaria programs in 15 sub-Saharan African countries as part of PMI, and in other countries globally. CDC conducts research and provides technical assistance in various countries, including PMI countries. The U.S. government contributes to multilateral efforts to fight malaria through financial support and project coordination. PMI is the coordinated U.S. government effort to combat malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. PMI is the U.S. government's effort to fight malaria in 15 sub-Saharan African countries with high malaria rates. It is led by USAID and implemented in conjunction with CDC. The countries were selected based on factors like high malaria rates, alignment with international standards, and willingness to collaborate. The U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator now oversees the country programs. In FY2006, PMI began operations in Angola, Tanzania, and Uganda using USAID's malaria funding. In FY2007, it added Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Senegal, and in FY2008, it added Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, and Zambia. The main target is to reach 85% of vulnerable groups with prevention and treatment measures. PMI has increased spending on commodity procurement. The PMI program has increased spending on commodity procurement, supporting the procurement of ACTs for malaria treatment. Integrated programs provide pregnant women with various health commodities and services, including ITNs, IPTp, and immunizations. PMI implementing agencies have procured over 1.35 million IPTp treatments as of January 2008. The PMI program partners with national governments and organizations to distribute free or low-cost ITNs through mass campaigns focusing on child survival. They also utilize existing maternal and child health programs to deliver nets, with a preference for longer-lasting LLINs. In some countries, PMI may subsidize or promote the sale of nets if they are not provided for free. The PMI program procures and distributes LLINs, educates users on correct ITN use, and supports IRS for mosquito control. As of January 2008, over 6 million LLINs have been procured, two-thirds distributed, 1.1 million ITNs re-treated, and 875,000 re-treatment kits distributed. PMI programs in 10 out of 15 countries have carried out IRS, benefiting over 17. USAID's PMI programs in 10 out of 15 countries have conducted IRS of homes, benefiting over 17 million people. The programs aim to strengthen national malaria control programs and build capacity for country ownership. USAID collaborates with each country's NMCP, contributing to capacity building in pharmaceutical management, malaria diagnosis, IRS, malaria in pregnancy, and monitoring and evaluation. PMI implementing agencies have trained over 29,000 health workers in ACT use and 5,000 in administering IPTp as of January 2008. PMI efforts collaborate with PEPFAR in some countries, sharing mechanisms for commodity delivery. PMI also partners with various organizations and the private sector to carry out its activities. USAID collaborates with various organizations, including RBM, the World Bank, and UNICEF, as well as private sector and NGOs like FBOs and CBOs. Through the Malaria Communities Program (MCP), USAID funds efforts to fight malaria through new NGO partnerships in PMI countries. USAID has scaled up PMI activities in 15 countries while re-evaluating malaria programs in other countries to focus resources for impactful results. Additionally, USAID conducts anti-malaria programs in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and southern Sudan, and supports regional programs in Africa. USAID supports regional programs in the Mekong and Amazon regions to identify and contain antimalarial drug resistance. It also provides one-time and humanitarian assistance to selected countries like Sao Tome and Principe and Zimbabwe. Strategies in non-PMI countries vary based on the malaria situation, national policy, and partner contributions. In Nigeria, USAID supported the sale of 3.5 million ITNs. The Amazon Initiative focused on adopting ACTs for malaria therapy and assisted with mosquito control and monitoring resistance. CDC has been involved in developing and evaluating malaria prevention tools like ITNs, IPTp, and ACTs for over three decades. They have studied malaria during pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa and developed IPTp as a prevention strategy. In Kenya, CDC supports a research station for malaria field and laboratory work. In Latin America, CDC supports malaria research in Kenya, India, and other countries through technical assistance and collaboration. In PMI countries in sub-Saharan Africa, CDC provides technical assistance in program design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. For example, in Malawi, CDC staff focus on strengthening the NMCP by helping develop national malaria policies and guidelines. In Tanzania, CDC staff collaborate with the Ifakara Health Research and Development Centre. CDC staff in Tanzania collaborate with the Ifakara Health Research and Development Centre on malaria control programs in sub-Saharan Africa. They also provide technical assistance in PMI countries and regions with high malaria infection rates, such as Indonesia, India, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Additionally, CDC works internationally with partners like the Global Fund and WHO to support malaria programs. The 2008 Lantos-Hyde Act authorizes funding for U.S. global efforts to combat malaria and contribute to the Global Fund. USAID and CDC received over $915 million from FY2004 to FY2008 for global malaria programs, with $484 million directed to the President's Malaria Initiative from FY2005 to FY2008. Congress appropriated $391.9 million for U.S. global malaria programs in FY2009. For FY2009, Congress allocated $391.9 million for U.S. global malaria programs and $900 million for U.S. contributions to the Global Fund. The Global Fund allocated percentages of contributions to malaria projects in different rounds. Some experts question the sustainability of the PMI structure and the disparities between PMI and non-PMI programs. Members of Congress may need to consider these issues when addressing malaria. Some malaria experts argue that the disparities between PMI and non-PMI programs in resources are not sustainable for fighting malaria in Africa. They believe that excluding countries with complex malaria problems from PMI selection limits the U.S. response to malaria in those areas. However, others argue that this exclusion allows more resources to be focused on countries with fewer implementation challenges. Advocates recommend expanding PMI to include additional countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and southern Sudan, citing the success of PMI in improving malaria mortality rates. They urge Congress to ensure the five-year U.S. strategy to address global malaria addresses these issues. Advocates suggest expanding PMI to countries with high malaria rates like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and southern Sudan, citing its success in reducing malaria mortality rates. They propose applying PMI's strategies and mandates to these countries even if the number of PMI countries is not increased. Critics acknowledge PMI as a model for bilateral malaria efforts but question the need for expansion. Advocates propose expanding PMI to countries with high malaria rates like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and southern Sudan, to apply successful strategies and mandates. Opponents argue that PMI should remain limited to current 15 countries to maintain progress towards five-year targets, as expanding may require significant funding increases and extend U.S. commitments. Some urge Congress to increase funding for U.S. malaria programs to reach authorized levels. Some experts caution against reducing malaria funding, as it may lead to drug resistance and threaten progress in controlling the disease. Advocates suggest maintaining current funding levels to preserve improvements in malaria control and allow ongoing programs to continue. Some argue that increasing funding for U.S. malaria programs could impact funding for other global health efforts. Funding for malaria has grown in the past five years, but some believe it was previously underfunded. Critics worry that without cost efficiencies, current funding levels may not support program expansion. Some health experts believe that the debate over increasing support for U.S. malaria programs, such as PMI, stems from inadequate overall U.S. global health funding. They argue that global health challenges, including malaria, chronic diseases, climate change, and clean water, require more funding. Opponents suggest that addressing these challenges requires collaboration with other governments and multilateral efforts, rather than solely relying on U.S. bilateral programs. Some critics also argue against increasing malaria funding, advocating for leveraging existing resources instead. Some critics argue that PMI should improve funding disbursement transparency to evaluate effectiveness and speed up malaria program scale-up. They also suggest expanding reporting standards to USAID activities. Some observers argue for expanded reporting standards in USAID malaria programs outside of PMI countries, emphasizing the need for detailed objectives and achievements. They also call for clearer descriptions of CDC's role in U.S. global malaria efforts, particularly in technical assistance. Additionally, experts recommend addressing malaria challenges in non-PMI countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and southern Sudan in the new U.S. global malaria strategy. Some experts argue that the balance between providing commodities and technical assistance in malaria control programs should be examined. Technical assistance is seen as crucial for designing and sustaining effective programs in countries with weak health infrastructures. While funding for commodities has increased, there is less support for technical assistance, which is essential for developing local knowledge to prevent disease resurgence. Some health professionals question the prudence of increased funding for technical assistance efforts. Some professionals question the increased funding for technical assistance in malaria control programs, expressing concerns about the cost of consultants. They argue that focusing on technical assistance over providing commodities may not effectively reduce malaria infection rates and deaths. However, some experts believe that a comprehensive approach should address both technical assistance and commodities to combat malaria effectively. Some donors and governments contribute to global malaria efforts, allowing programs to focus on technical assistance or funding for commodities. Debate surrounds how the United States can provide access to life-saving commodities in high malaria infection countries, whether through free or subsidized means or market channels. Recommendations have been made to subsidize the global market for antimalarial drugs to ensure access and effectiveness. Proponents argue for subsidizing antimalarial drugs, ITNs, and RDTs to increase availability and lower prices, delaying parasite resistance. Opponents advocate for free provision in high malaria areas due to poverty, ensuring access for the poor and protecting community health. Opponents of free nets argue that U.S. malaria efforts should focus on supporting countries' capacities to produce or purchase commodities through the private sector, rather than giving away nets for free. They believe that free nets may not be valued or used correctly by recipients, potentially undermining the market for them. This debate extends to pricing commodities for consumers, with concerns about the impact of donor programs on demand for malaria commodities. The high demand for commodities from donor programs like PMI has caused supply shortages in malaria-endemic countries. Lack of education about malaria and financial constraints among potential recipients contribute to low demand. Limited production capacity and supply issues lead to stock-outs in malaria programs. Without additional producers entering the market, existing producers may be hesitant to increase capacity without support from initiatives like PMI. Some experts suggest that better procurement and supply chain management are essential to ensure accurate forecasting of needed commodities. This would prevent stock-outs and expired commodities, improving negotiation efforts for sufficient supplies and production planning. Concerns are raised about low negotiated prices discouraging producers from increasing production to meet forecasted needs. The need to increase production to meet forecasted commodity needs may require subsidies or incentives for commodity producers. Concerns about effectiveness of commodities in addressing malaria are linked to accessibility and availability, with resistance to medications and insecticides becoming greater problems. The increase in parasite resistance to commonly-used antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and ACTs, is a growing concern, particularly along the Thai-Cambodian border. Misdiagnosis and misuse of drugs contribute to drug-resistant malaria, posing a risk of drug ineffectiveness. Parasite resistance to SP is also a problem, highlighting the need for careful attention to prevent misuse of antimalarial drugs. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are crucial in accurately diagnosing malaria in areas with limited laboratory facilities. While PMI programs have distributed RDTs, experts recommend increasing availability and distribution. As drug and mosquito resistance to malaria commodities rise, investments in research and development for alternatives are necessary. Governments and donors should invest in research for alternatives to current malaria drugs and insecticides to combat resistance. Experts stress the importance of education to address incorrect use of commodities and increase coverage with key malaria interventions, especially in high-risk areas. Concerns have been raised about the decline in new drug and insecticide development, urging for increased research funding to prepare for future resistance challenges. Health authorities and experts are concerned about the negative impact of counterfeit or low-quality antimalarial drugs on effective malaria treatment. They warn that ineffective treatment undermines trust in malaria programs, allows the parasite to persist, and increases the risk of transmission and drug resistance. Recommendations include creating and enforcing strategies to prevent the production and use of counterfeit medicines. Some debate surrounds the use of insecticides, like DDT, in malaria control programs. Environmental groups express concern about the impact on the environment and human health, while malaria experts argue that the risks of not controlling mosquito populations outweigh the potential risks of insecticide use. Trade and development experts note that insecticide use may negatively impact developing countries' trade. Development experts warn that insecticide use could harm developing countries' trade relationships, especially with the EU due to restrictions on certain insecticides. Health experts are concerned about the impact of these restrictions on the availability of insecticides for public health purposes. They recommend investing in research for new insecticides and promoting effective ones for disease control. Some critics argue against disease-specific approaches like the President's Malaria Initiative, stating it overlooks broader health challenges and diverts resources. Some experts argue that disease-specific initiatives like the President's Malaria Initiative divert resources from broader health challenges in resource-poor countries. They highlight the lack of healthcare infrastructure and trained workers in PMI-assisted areas, questioning the sustainability of these initiatives if donor support ends before disease eradication. Some experts question the sustainability of disease-specific initiatives like the President's Malaria Initiative if donor support ends before eradication. Ministries of Health may struggle to manage funds independently and prioritize disease-specific efforts over broader health challenges without donor-directed funding. Disruptions in support could lead to setbacks in disease control and resistance to prevention and treatment strategies. Some experts argue that disease-specific initiatives like the President's Malaria Initiative are crucial in countries with limited resources and high infectious disease burdens. They believe sustained funding and focused attention are necessary for large-scale eradication efforts. These initiatives not only target specific diseases but also support broader health systems by sharing knowledge and building platforms for cooperation. Experts emphasize the importance of simultaneous efforts to build health capacity and infrastructure alongside disease-specific interventions. Observers support PMI's focus on malaria prevention and treatment but suggest integrating efforts with basic healthcare and childhood illness prevention. Global Fund is cited as an example of funding for multiple health initiatives. Concerns are raised about the balance between U.S. funding for bilateral and multilateral malaria efforts. The U.S. is a major financier of global malaria programs, with growing funding for bilateral efforts. Policymakers are unsure about the balance between funding for multilateral and bilateral malaria programs. Congress has shown support for increased bilateral funding, but has not discussed the allocation of funds between the two. Some Members have raised concerns about the lack of funding for commodity procurement and distribution in U.S. bilateral programs. The Global Fund supports the purchase and provision of malaria commodities through project grants. Policymakers have shifted towards emphasizing funding for commodities in U.S. malaria policy. Changes in funding priorities now focus on commodities, with policymakers emphasizing the need for coordination between bilateral and multilateral efforts. Advocates stress the importance of PMI and the Global Fund coordinating their planning and funding activities to prevent duplication, reflect country needs, and operate more cost-effectively. PMI implementing agencies have implemented processes to coordinate with the Global Fund, drawing lessons from PEPFAR. The Global Fund and PMI are working together to coordinate programs and funding, including joint projects and collaboration through NMCPs. U.S. government representatives are actively involved in the Global Fund Board. However, there are concerns about the need for improved coordination to ensure partners' capabilities are utilized effectively, especially in funding technical assistance. Some caution against excessive coordination in PMI programs to maintain quick response and reflect U.S. malaria policy. Congress should assess how U.S. malaria programs align resources with the Global Fund. Appendices provide acronyms and additional resources on global malaria. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (AJTMH) published various articles on malaria prevention, control, and research over the past 100 years. These include studies on the economic burden of malaria, advocacy for prevention, and the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative. Samuel Loewenberg also discussed the progress of the initiative after two years. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene published articles on malaria prevention, control, and research. USAID allocated $619 million for malaria programs in PMI countries. Funding for other USAID malaria programs has shifted since the creation of PMI. Funding for malaria programs has shifted to greater amounts for fewer countries and selected regional programs. USAID supports non-PMI country programs and regional initiatives in addition to PMI and central programs. Selected Global Malaria Programs and Organizations list various efforts to fight malaria, including bilateral and multilateral initiatives, private-public partnerships, and non-governmental organizations. The Congressional Research Service does not endorse the selected U.S. Government Programs.
