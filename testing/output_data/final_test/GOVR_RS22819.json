    "content": "On February 17, 2008, USDA announced the largest U.S. meat recall ever, involving 143 million pounds of beef products from Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Co. The recall was due to the company not always notifying USDA about nonambulatory cattle, which are unfit for human consumption. Around 50 million pounds were distributed to school lunch and federal nutrition programs in 45 states. Officials stated that BSE findings are rare in the US, citing effective safeguards such as banning feeding cattle parts back to cattle. Most recalled beef had likely been consumed, with remaining products instructed to be destroyed. Inspection at the plant was suspended and not expected to reopen after inhumane handling of downer cattle was exposed by the Humane Society. In early May 2008, HSUS notified the Secretary of Agriculture about abuse of nonambulatory cows and pigs at livestock auction markets in several states. USDA promised to address the allegations, while the Livestock Marketing Association defended its members' humane handling practices but criticized HSUS for its promotion of an agenda. HSUS criticized USDA for not fulfilling a requirement in the 2002 farm bill for a report on nonambulatory livestock, and called for expanded government oversight of animal handling. USDA noted data collection on such livestock and upcoming research on handling practices. Federal law mandates FSIS inspectors to monitor live animals before slaughter for signs of disease. The HMSA requires humane handling of livestock before slaughter, with antemortem inspections conducted on the day of slaughter to detect any health issues. Inspectors randomly return to verify proper animal handling. Postmortem inspections are done constantly during processing to ensure compliance with humane slaughtering methods. The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA) mandates that livestock must be rendered insensible to pain before slaughter. FSIS regulations and directives outline proper handling procedures, including stunning methods and verification of compliance. There are over 6,200 federally inspected meat and poultry establishments, with approximately 900 slaughtering livestock subject to the HMSA. FSIS regulations required that non-ambulatory disabled cattle be condemned and disposed of separately to prevent BSE-infected beef from entering the food supply. This rule was implemented after a cow imported from Canada was found to have BSE in late 2003. The Federal Register stated that non-ambulatory disabled cattle should be condemned and disposed of in accordance with FSIS regulations, including humane euthanization. The rule defined nonambulatory disabled livestock as those unable to rise or walk due to various conditions. This change was based on European findings that non-ambulatory cattle were more likely to harbor the BSE agent. FSIS modified its rule to allow non-ambulatory cattle to be slaughtered on a case-by-case basis if they had suffered an acute injury. The agency reaffirmed its ban on using non-ambulatory cattle in food, except in cases of acute injury. BSE clinical signs may not always be observed in non-ambulatory animals, but the general ban on their use in food would continue. The American Meat Institute, the National Meat Association, and the National Milk Producers Federation petitioned FSIS to ban nonambulatory disabled cattle from the meat supply. FSIS published a proposed rule in August 2008 and the final rule in March 2009, requiring establishments to notify inspectors of nonambulatory disabled cattle for condemnation and proper disposal. California also passed a law prohibiting slaughterhouses from holding such cattle. The bill (A.B. 2098) prohibits slaughterhouses from holding nonambulatory animals without euthanizing them immediately. It also applies to stockyards, auctions, and dealers, with violators facing jail time or fines. The law was challenged in court by the meat industry, resulting in a preliminary injunction against its enforcement in swine slaughterhouses. The USDA's enforcement of the ban on nonambulatory cattle and humane slaughter law has been criticized. An audit report highlighted inconsistent inspection procedures, including lack of documentation for slaughtered animals. Some plants were only inspecting a small percentage of live cattle, leading to concerns about compliance and BSE risk. The OIG found that older cattle at some plants did not receive full inspection before slaughter due to inadequate enforcement and documentation. Critics argue that antemortem policies are inconsistently applied and inspections are often cursory. OIG's audit at Hallmark revealed deliberate bypassing of inspections and non-compliance with procedures by FSIS inspectors. The OIG found that at 10 other plants slaughtering cull cows, there were no indications of unsuitable animals being passed for slaughter or systemic inhumane handling incidents. The events at Hallmark did not indicate a systemic failure of inspection processes, but management controls can be strengthened. Recommendations include implementing a risk-based methodology for assigning inspection staff, improving supervisory processes, enhancing staff training, and strengthening inspection procedures. The GAO reported in January 2004 that incomplete and inconsistent inspection records made it difficult to determine the extent of humane handling and slaughter violations. The FSIS faced challenges in determining the extent of humane handling violations due to incomplete records and inconsistent enforcement actions. Inspectors at Hallmark were allegedly instructed not to visit cattle pens before slaughter, leading to reduced oversight. Vacancies in inspection positions and lack of filled veterinary positions further hindered monitoring of humane practices. The suitability of downers for food consumption was debated at a 2008 hearing. Secretary of Agriculture argued for their approval if not diseased, while the Humane Society raised concerns about safety due to injuries and diseases being interrelated. Studies show downers are more likely to harbor BSE and foodborne pathogens like E. coli and Salmonella. The USDA's former BSE expert highlighted the difficulty in diagnosing BSE in cows, often only suspected through subsequent testing. In the 111th Congress, a provision to ban downer cattle was considered but ultimately removed from legislation. The Senate provision in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 would have banned the use of federal funds for processing nonambulatory disabled cattle for human food, except for veal calves. This would have removed the economic incentive to slaughter downers. In the 110th Congress, hearings were held on Hallmark and related issues, with bills like S. 394 and H.R. 661 proposing humane treatment regulations for nonambulatory livestock by covered entities, including euthanization requirements. The bill in the 110th Congress aimed to regulate the humane treatment of nonambulatory livestock by requiring euthanization at various stages of the livestock industry. It also included provisions to ban the slaughter of nonambulatory livestock for human consumption and establish penalties for non-compliance with humane treatment regulations. Additionally, the bill required the USDA to disclose the names of retailers that received recalled meat or poultry. In response to concerns about the humane treatment of nonambulatory livestock, USDA allocated funds to enforce the act and hired District Veterinary Medical Specialists. The 2002 farm law urged full enforcement and increased funding for FSIS to hire more inspection personnel dedicated to HMSA enforcement. The Senate expressed concerns about the effectiveness of current inspection practices. The USDA allocated funds to enforce the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA) and hired District Veterinary Medical Specialists. Funding for HMSA enforcement increased, with 63 positions and $5 million annually. Additional funding of at least $10 million since FY2005 was provided for incorporating FSIS's \"Humane Animal Tracking System\" into field computer systems."
