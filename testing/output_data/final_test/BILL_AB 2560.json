    "title": "AB 2560",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 5096.21 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to give the board the authority to regulate out-of-state individuals practicing in California if it is deemed necessary to protect the public. The board has the authority to adopt emergency regulations under the Administrative Procedure Act to implement necessary measures for public safety. Factors considered include the state's response to enforcement referrals and requests from the board. The state's disciplinary history of licensees is made publicly available online for consumer access. The state also imposes appropriate discipline on licensees based on alleged misconduct. The board may waive the requirement for filing a practice privilege form for licensees if certain conditions are met, including adoption of enforcement best practices guidelines by NASBA and the state having disciplinary practices equivalent to the guidelines. The board may waive the practice privilege form requirement for licensees if specific conditions are met, and no form is needed to be filed by licensees of that state as required by subdivision (a), nor is reporting to the Legislature required by subdivision (d). The board must report preliminary determinations to the Legislature, director, and public by July 1, 2015, and review its determinations before January 1, 2016. This requirement will be inactive after July 1, 2017. The board will convene a stakeholder group by July 1, 2014, to assess the consistency of article provisions with public protection duties and stakeholder objectives. The group will establish policies and procedures and report findings to the board. By January 1, 2018, the board will submit a detailed report to relevant committees, the director, and the public upon request. The board will assess the implementation of the article and compare its public protection effectiveness to its predecessor. It will also review how other state boards handle referrals and investigations. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2019, unless extended by a later statute."
