    "content": "The United States banking system processes approximately 42.5 billion checks annually, with only a fraction processed electronically through check truncation. The Federal Reserve Board has proposed legislation for \"substitute checks\" to allow for electronic processing, saving costs and time. The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, also known as Check 21 Act, was signed into law by President Bush on October 28, 2003. The act aimed to replace paper checks with electronic payments to save costs and time. However, widespread adoption of electronic check clearing has been constrained by the difficulty in obtaining processing agreements among banks. The Check Truncation Act of 2002 (S. 3034) was introduced in Congress to eliminate the need to physically return original checks to the paying bank, making electronic check clearing more accessible. This legislation was drafted by the Federal Reserve Board and is similar to the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (H.R. 5414), signed into law in 2003 to promote electronic payments over paper checks. The Fed's proposal aimed to make electronic check clearing more widespread by providing greater consumer protection against unauthorized debits. In the 108th Congress, the Senate held a hearing on the proposal, where the Federal Reserve Board's Vice Chairman suggested removing certain consumer protection provisions to reduce compliance burdens on banks. The Vice Chairman highlighted that the benefits of substitute checks outweigh the small incremental benefits for consumers. He suggested that if expedited recredit provisions are included in legislation, they should not exceed those proposed by the Board. A hearing was held on H.R. 1474, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act of 2003, with no substantive changes between Congresses. Vice Chairman Ferguson's statement to the Committee mirrored that presented to the Senate Banking Committee. On May 21, 2003, the House Financial Services Committee amended H.R. 1474 to allow consumers to claim expedited credit without needing the substitute check. The full Senate passed the Check Truncation Act of 2003 (S. 1334) and incorporated it into H.R. 1474 on June 27, 2003. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs approved S. 1334 on June 18, 2003. The bills are similar with differences in consumer protection, with the CTA being more generous in its provisions. The Conference Agreement on H.R. 1474 adopted provisions from both the House and Senate, allowing consumers 30 days to file an expedited recredit claim without needing the substitute check. The burden of documentation was shifted more onto banks than consumers. A dispute between the Federal Reserve Board and AirNet System Inc. over check transportation costs was a major issue. The Conference Agreement requires the Fed to disclose expenses and revenues for shipping commercial checks between processing facilities for 10 years. It also mandates a study on funds availability and efficiency of depository institutions services. The Comptroller General of the United States is required to evaluate the implementation of the Check 21 Act. Figure 1 shows the paper check process starting with a customer paying a store. The paper check process involves a customer paying a store with a check, which is then deposited in the store's bank. If the customer and store have accounts in the same bank, the check is settled as an \"on-us\" item. Otherwise, the bank of first deposit debits the customer's account and credits the store's account. Interbank check settlement follows rules governed by the Uniform Commercial Code and Federal Reserve regulations. After the store deposits the customer's check, it is returned to the paying bank through various methods like mailing or using a third-party intermediary. Checks must be physically transported to the banks before they are settled, leading to potential delays. If the customer's account lacks sufficient funds, the check is returned to the depository bank or intermediary for resolution. The depository bank returns the bounced check to the store, charging a fee for insufficient funds. The paying bank also charges a fee to the check writer. The depository bank bears most of the costs for collecting funds, including intermediary charges and transporting the check to the paying bank. Despite incurring costs, the depository bank must pay the check at face value as per legal requirements. The use of paper checks incurs costs for both collecting and paying banks. Economists argue that checks create inefficiencies by wasting resources on transportation and not earning interest. The difference between market interest rates and zero interest on checks results in income for the check writer known as float. The float generated from paper checks transfers income from the payee to the payer, with economists considering it costly to society. Users exploit the float by delaying check processing, resulting in additional income for the payer. The cost of using paper checks is estimated to be around $1.60 per transaction, potentially saving $68 billion if checks were replaced with electronic payments. Electronic check clearing, including electronic check presentation (ECP) and check truncation, offers potential savings. ECP involves clearing checks based on electronic data rather than physical checks. This process could result in significant cost savings, with estimates ranging from $1.4 billion to $68 billion if checks were replaced with electronic payments. Electronic check clearing, specifically ECP with truncation, eliminates the need for physical checks to be returned to the writer. Instead, transactions are indicated on monthly statements. Banks can use intermediaries for check truncations if cost-sharing agreements are not reached. The Federal Reserve currently truncates 20% of the checks it processes. The intermediary charges fees for check truncation services, which can be passed on to banks and customers. The Federal Reserve's proposed legislation allows for electronic check clearing without agreements. Estimated costs and benefits of check truncation show potential savings in handling and processing. The benefits of Electronic Check Presentment (ECP) for banks and customers are reversed compared to paper check processes. Banks need explicit agreements on benefit sharing to adopt ECP. Paying bank customers bear the highest cost with ECP due to loss of float and canceled checks, while the paying bank gains the most. Depositing bank customers' costs remain the same, but they benefit from not losing the float. The benefits of check truncation include unchanged costs for depositing bank customers, who benefit from not losing the float. Despite higher infrastructure costs, the net benefit from reduced risk of fraud and return check handling is positive. However, only a few banks have adopted check truncation due to the distribution of costs and benefits among participants. Paying bank customers bear 78% of the costs without receiving any benefits, while the net benefit per payment is 4.97\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. The paper check clearing process involves check truncation, with benefits distributed among banks and customers. The paying bank receives 61% of the benefits, the depository bank receives 9%, and the intermediary gains 16% by eliminating paper check handling. Concerns include potential disadvantages for individuals reliant on the float, leading to fewer checks being written. H.R. 1474 differs from the Fed's Check Truncation Act proposal. H.R. 1474 allows for wider voluntary use of truncated checks with less consumer protection compared to the Fed's proposal. It introduces a new type of paper document called a \"substitute check\" that is the legal equivalent of the original check, containing an image of the front and back, conforming to industry standards, and bearing a MICR line for processing on check-sorting equipment. This enables banks to truncate checks from institutions without electronic exchange agreements. The draft legislation proposes the use of substitute checks as a way for banks to truncate checks from institutions without electronic exchange agreements. It outlines legal protections and indemnity structures for banks processing substitute checks. The draft legislation proposes the use of substitute checks for banks to truncate checks without electronic exchange agreements. It includes legal protections and an expedited recrediting procedure for customers in case of improper payments. The Fed's proposal allows for a one-day recredit, while the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act provides for a recredit 10 days after a claim. The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act provides a recredit 10 days after a claim of an improper payment, but customers of banks with truncation agreements do not have this right. The time to request a recredit of disputed funds is 60 days under the Fed's proposal and 40 days under the Act. Strong opposition to H.R. 1474 came from the Consumers Union and other consumer advocacy groups. The Consumers Union argued against the Check Truncation Act, stating that it would leave 45.8 million households vulnerable to fraud by removing their ability to receive paper checks. They highlighted a loophole in the Act that could prevent consumers from receiving a recredit in case of errors, and made recommendations to close this loophole and expand the right to recredit for all consumers. The Consumers Union recommended expanding the right to recredit for consumers in cases where the original check is not returned and may have been improperly charged to their account. They also argued against using a comparative negligence standard to resolve harm from processing errors. The Union proposes extending recredit provisions to all checks without original returns, expanding coverage to over 20% of bank checks and 80% of credit unions' drafts. Financial institutions may oppose due to increased costs. Consumers Union argues for expedited recredit within one business day for disputed funds up to $2,500. The disputed amount of the payment (up to $2,500.00) would be credited to the consumer's account by the next business day. Consumers Union wants to raise the expedited recredit amount to $5,000 and shorten the recrediting process to less than 20 days, while financial institutions prefer a longer time to clear disputed checks. The Consumers Union proposes changes to protect consumers from losing fraud protection by having the original check returned. Financial institutions argue that these changes could increase costs and make check truncation unprofitable. Processing errors are rare with check truncation, and complaints from credit union members are minimal. Under the CTA, adoption of check truncation or electronic check presentation remains primarily voluntary, despite potential cost savings. Many banks are hesitant to make agreements due to uncertainty about achieving sufficient benefits over the current paper check system. The proposed Check Truncation Act aims to address the uneven distribution of costs and benefits among participants in the check truncation process, with the goal of making legal any distribution agreement approved by banks."
