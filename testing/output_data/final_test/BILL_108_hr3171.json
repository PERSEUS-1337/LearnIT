    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Benjamin Franklin True Patriot Act\". Congress finds that Benjamin Franklin's quote emphasizes the importance of essential liberty over temporary safety. The First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments protect civil rights. However, federal policies post-9/11, such as the USA PATRIOT Act, threaten these rights by allowing indefinite incarceration based on suspicion. The USA PATRIOT Act threatens civil rights by allowing indefinite incarceration based on suspicion, limiting Federal courts' authority in electronic surveillance abuse cases, expanding Federal agents' search powers, and granting broad access to personal information for law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The USA PATRIOT Act allows broad access to personal information for law enforcement and intelligence agencies, chilling constitutionally protected speech, creating divisions between immigrant communities and police, permitting FBI surveillance without evidence of a crime, and mandating the closure of certain immigration. Future legislation like the Domestic Security Enhancement Act (DSEA) or PATRIOT II could potentially undermine constitutional rights by granting law enforcement and intelligence agencies sweeping powers unrelated to terrorism, diminishing personal privacy, and reducing government accountability. The Domestic Security Enhancement Act (DSEA) or PATRIOT II could undermine constitutional rights by increasing government secrecy, expanding the definition of terrorism, and eroding due process rights, particularly affecting Arab, Muslim, or South Asian individuals. The USA PATRIOT Act provisions listed in sections 4 through 10 will cease to have effect 90 days after the enactment of this Act. Congress may hold hearings during this period to decide on removing specific sections. The USA PATRIOT Act provisions listed in section 3 include various measures such as sneak and peak searches, the use of pen registers for foreign intelligence purposes, obtaining certain business records, and more. These provisions are subject to review and may be removed after 90 days from the enactment of the Act. Section 508 pertains to the collection and disclosure of individually identifiable information under the National Education Statistics Act of 1994. Section 802 defines domestic terrorism.
