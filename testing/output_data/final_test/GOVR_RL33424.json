    "content": "The Supreme Court ruled in Smith v. Maryland (1979) that there is no Fourth Amendment protection for telephone call records held by third-party providers. This decision clarified that the use of a pen register does not require a warrant under the Fourth Amendment. In Smith v. Maryland (1979), the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the use of pen registers without a warrant. The Court distinguished between capturing telephone numbers with a pen register, which does not violate privacy, and using electronic listening devices to intercept communications, which is considered a search under the Fourth Amendment. In Smith v. Maryland (1979), the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the use of pen registers without a warrant. Telephone users do not have a legitimate expectation of privacy when it comes to the numbers dialed into a telephone system. Pen registers are routinely used by telephone companies for billing operations, fraud detection, and law enforcement purposes. Customers assume the risk of exposing their phone numbers to the telephone company's equipment. The Supreme Court ruled in Smith v. Maryland that the use of a pen register to record telephone numbers dialed does not require a warrant under the Fourth Amendment. Customers assume the risk of their information being disclosed to law enforcement when using a telephone. The dissenting opinions argued that telephone numbers reveal intimate details and should be protected like telephone conversations under Katz. The Supreme Court's ruling in Smith v. Maryland stated that telephone dialing information can be disclosed to the government without a warrant. Congress has enacted statutes allowing access to telephone number records for intelligence or law enforcement purposes, with limitations on access and usage. Pen registers and trap and trace devices can be used to obtain information on calling patterns, duration, and usage. The government can collect telephone calling activity directly through pen registers or trap and trace devices, as authorized by statutes like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and 18 U.S.C. Section 3121. Additionally, access to stored electronic communications is addressed in 18 U.S.C. Section 2701 et seq. 18 U.S.C. Section 2702 prohibits voluntary disclosure of customer communications records by a service provider unless it falls within exceptions. Required disclosure to the government is addressed under 18 U.S.C. Section 2703, including disclosure pursuant to a warrant or subpoena. 18 U.S.C. Section 2709 allows the FBI to compel wire or electronic service providers to provide subscriber information in response to a request by the Director of the FBI. Section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934 restricts disclosure of customer information by telecommunications providers, with violations leading to criminal sanctions and civil penalties. Additionally, under 50 U.S.C. Section 1842, the Attorney General can apply for court orders in national security investigations. The Attorney General or designated government attorney can apply for an ex parte court order to use a pen register or trap and trace device for foreign intelligence purposes. The application must be approved and certified for foreign intelligence information or ongoing terrorism investigations. An ex parte court order can be obtained by the Attorney General or designated government attorney for clandestine intelligence activities. The order must specify the identity of the subject of the investigation, the person to whom the device is attached, and the attributes of the communications involved. Additionally, the order can direct providers to furnish any necessary information or assistance. The court order allows the installation and operation of a pen register or trap and trace device with secrecy and minimal interference. The provider, landlord, or custodian must not disclose the investigation or device unless ordered by the court. Records must be kept secure, and the applicant must compensate for expenses incurred. Upon request, the court can direct the service provider to provide the federal officer with customer information, including name, address, and telephone number, under the court order. The provider may also need to disclose the length of service, telephone records, and usage periods of the customer or subscriber if ordered by the court. The court can order the service provider to disclose customer information, payment sources, and communication details. Orders issued under this section are typically valid for 90 days, with possible extensions. The court can order service providers to disclose customer information, payment sources, and communication details for up to 90 days, with possible extensions up to a year for foreign intelligence information. No legal action can be taken against those who provide information under this provision. Results of surveillance must be provided to government officials regularly. The FISC judge can authorize the installation and use of pen registers and trap and trace devices upon request. This is subject to certain provisions regarding disclosure of customer information to the government. Prohibition exists on using these devices without a court order under FISA or relevant statutes, except for specific purposes such as service provider operations and user protection. Government agencies can use technology to restrict the recording of electronic impulses when installing pen registers or trap and trace devices. Applications for court orders must be made in writing under oath to a court of competent jurisdiction. Applications for court orders to install pen registers or trap and trace devices must be made under oath to a court of competent jurisdiction. The application must include the identity of the government attorney or law enforcement officer, certification of relevance to a criminal investigation, and court authorization for up to 60 days, extendable in 60-day increments. The court order for pen registers or trap and trace devices must be sealed for up to 60 days, with restrictions on disclosure. The FBI Director or designee can apply for access to tangible items for foreign intelligence investigations under 50 U.S.C. Section 1861. The court order for pen registers or trap and trace devices must be sealed for up to 60 days, with restrictions on disclosure. The FBI Director or designee can apply for access to tangible items for foreign intelligence investigations under 50 U.S.C. Section 1861, with certain criteria to be met for the investigation of a United States person. The FISA court judge approves an application for an order under 50 U.S.C. Section 1861 for the investigation of a foreign power or individual in contact with a suspected agent. The order must describe the items sought, allow time for assembly, and be limited to items obtainable under a grand jury subpoena or U.S. court order. The order includes a nondisclosure requirement prohibiting disclosure of the FBI's request, with exceptions. The recipient of the production order can challenge its legality with the FISA court, but must wait a year to challenge the nondisclosure order. A FISA court judge can modify or set aside the production order if it doesn't meet statutory requirements. A nondisclosure order can be changed if disclosure won't endanger national security, investigations, diplomatic relations, or anyone's safety. The FISA judge must treat government certification as conclusive for a nondisclosure order unless made in bad faith. The authority to collect communications records under FISA expires on June 1, 2015, with restrictions on the types of records that can be sought. Access to stored electronic communications and transactional records is regulated under 18 U.S.C. Section 2701 et seq. Voluntary disclosure of customer communications records by a service provider is prohibited under 18 U.S.C. Section 2702. The disclosure of customer communications records by a service provider is restricted under 18 U.S.C. Section 2702, except in certain circumstances such as authorized disclosure under 18 U.S.C. Section 2703, with customer consent, or in emergencies involving danger of death or serious physical injury. Reports on the use of \"exigent letters\" by the DOJ OIG found that many situations did not meet the emergency standard for disclosure. Under 18 U.S.C. Section 2703, a provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service must disclose customer information to a government entity with a warrant or court order based on specific facts relevant to a criminal investigation. This includes details like name, address, telephone records, and payment information. The law allows for the disclosure of customer information to government entities for criminal investigations, including telemarketing fraud. Government entities can obtain records or information through subpoenas or court orders, and service providers are not liable for providing assistance. Government entities must reimburse the costs incurred in obtaining the information. The government entity can obtain records or information through subpoenas or court orders. The amount of payment for providing information is to be mutually agreed upon or determined by the court. Reimbursement is not required for records maintained by communications carriers related to telephone records. Service providers must provide subscriber information in response to a request by the FBI under a national security letter provision. The FBI can request records relevant to authorized investigations to protect against terrorism or intelligence activities. Disclosure may be restricted if it poses a danger to national security or interferes with investigations or diplomatic relations. The FBI can request records relevant to authorized investigations to protect against terrorism or intelligence activities. No wire or electronic communications service provider can disclose to anyone that the FBI has sought or obtained access to information under this section, except as necessary for compliance or legal advice. Recipients of such requests must also notify others of the nondisclosure requirement. The FBI can request records for authorized investigations related to terrorism or intelligence activities. Recipients must identify to the FBI the person to whom disclosure will be made, except for attorneys providing legal advice. Dissemination of records is limited to guidelines approved by the Attorney General for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence investigations. The FBI can request records for authorized investigations related to terrorism or intelligence activities. The Director of the FBI must inform specific committees semiannually about these requests. Section 2707 allows for civil action for violations, with damages including actual damages and violator's profits. A person aggrieved by a willful violation of this chapter or 50 U.S.C. Section 1845(a) may commence a civil action against the United States in a U.S. district court to receive money damages under 18 U.S.C. Section 2712. The court may assess actual damages, but not less than $1,000, plus any profits made by the violator as a result of the violation. If a violation raises questions of willful or intentional action by a federal officer, disciplinary action may be initiated. If a violation is established, the court may assess damages of at least $10,000, plus litigation costs. There is a two-year statute of limitations for this provision, and it is the exclusive remedy against the United States. The agency must reimburse any award to the U.S. treasury. Administrative discipline can be pursued, and civil proceedings may be stayed if it hinders a related investigation or prosecution. Telecommunications carriers must protect customer information. Section 222 of the Communication Act of 1934 requires telecommunications carriers to safeguard customer proprietary network information (CPNI) from unauthorized disclosure. CPNI includes personally identifiable information related to a customer's telecommunications service. The goal is to balance marketing efforts with customer privacy. Section 222 of the Communication Act of 1934 mandates that telecommunications carriers protect customer proprietary network information (CPNI), which includes calling activities, billing records, and other related data. This legislation restricts carriers from using customer phone records for marketing purposes without consent and appropriate safeguards. Section 222 of the Communication Act of 1934 requires telecommunications carriers to protect customer proprietary network information (CPNI) and prohibits the use or disclosure of this information without customer approval. Carriers must safeguard proprietary information and can only use it for providing telecommunications services, not for marketing purposes. The Communication Act of 1934 mandates that telecommunications carriers protect customer proprietary network information (CPNI) and restrict its use without customer consent. Carriers can only use CPNI for providing telecommunications services, not for marketing purposes. Section 222(c) outlines the requirements for disclosing CPNI upon customer request and allows for the use of aggregate customer information for specific purposes. The general principle of confidentiality for customer information is that a carrier may only use, disclose, or permit access to customers' individually identifiable CPNI in limited circumstances as required by law, with customer approval, or in the provision of telecommunications services. Exceptions allow carriers to use CPNI for billing, protecting rights or property, and providing inbound services to customers. Section 222(e) allows carriers to disclose subscriber list information for directory publishing purposes. The CPNI Order, issued in 1998 by the FCC, governs the implementation of Section 222 regarding customer information confidentiality. The FCC's CPNI Order governs the use and disclosure of customer information by telecommunications carriers. Initially, carriers needed opt-in consent to use customer phone records for marketing, but this was struck down by the Tenth Circuit Court. The FCC then required carriers to obtain opt-in consent before disclosing CPNI to third parties, with opt-out consent allowed for affiliated parties. The FCC's CPNI Order allows telephone companies to disclose customer information to affiliated parties with \"opt-out\" consent. Carriers must notify customers of their right to restrict CPNI use, establish safeguards against unauthorized disclosure, maintain access records, certify compliance annually, and face fines for inadequate certifications. The FCC proposed $100,000 fines on telephone companies for inadequate certifications regarding compliance with rules protecting customer information. Violators of CPNI requirements face various penalties, including fines up to $10,000 and imprisonment up to one year under Section 501 of the act. The act imposes fines up to $10,000, imprisonment up to two years, or both for violations. Section 502 punishes willful violations of FCC regulations with a maximum fine of $500 per day. Section 503(b)(1) allows for civil money penalties for willful non-compliance. \"Willful\" is defined as conscious and deliberate commission. The act, 47 U.S.C. Section 312(f)(1), defines \"willful\" as the conscious and deliberate commission or omission of any act, regardless of intent. \"Repeated\" means the act occurred more than once or lasted more than one day. Section 503(b) allows the Commission to impose a forfeiture penalty of up to $130,000 for each violation or day of violation by a common carrier, not exceeding $1,325,000 for any single act. The Commission must issue a notice of apparent liability, giving the violator a chance to contest the penalty before issuing it based on evidence of the violation."
