It was established in February 1989 by President George H.W. Bush to develop a national space policy and strategy. The council is chaired by the Vice President and includes various government officials. The National Space Council was established in 1989 by President George H.W. Bush to develop a national space policy. Congress passed three acts affecting the council's operation the following year, including provisions on staff and funding, consultation on space launch policy, and the establishment of a Users' Advisory Group. The National Space Council was established in 1989 by President George H.W. Bush to develop a national space policy. The Space Policy Advisory Board, consisting of private citizens, was activated in mid-1992 and issued three policy reports. The council ceased to operate after President Clinton took office in January 1993. The National Space Council staff took an active role in revitalizing the civilian space program, leading the Space Exploration Initiative announced by President Bush in 1989. They organized meetings to address NASA's response, explored alternative approaches to space exploration, and initiated a review chaired by Norm Augustine. In 1991, they influenced the replacement of NASA administrator Richard Truly. The National Space Council staff played a key role in revitalizing the civilian space program, leading initiatives and influencing the replacement of NASA administrator Richard Truly. They also engaged in outreach to the new Russian government for space cooperation. However, their interventions in NASA's management were met with resistance, and their effectiveness in addressing funding and jurisdictional issues was questioned. The National Space Council faced challenges in cooperation due to jurisdictional arrangements with agencies. The former executive secretary acknowledged some shortcomings but highlighted the proactive policy process that benefited the U.S. space program. Despite being inactive since 1993, the Council's legacy includes several policy directives and assessments that served the space program well. The National Space Council, inactive since 1993, has provisions in various laws that have not been repealed. Some view it as a recreation of the National Aeronautics and Space Council (NASC) established in 1958 to advise the President on aeronautics and space activities. The National Aeronautics and Space Council (NASC) was established in 1958 to advise the President on aeronautics and space activities. President Eisenhower recommended its abolition in 1960, but President Kennedy retained it with membership changes authorized by Congress in P.L. 87-26. The National Aeronautics and Space Council (NASC) was established in 1958 to advise the President on aeronautics and space activities. In 1961, the council called for an acceleration of U.S. space efforts and the establishment of a manned lunar landing as a national goal. However, by 1969, the NASC was without a dedicated staff and was disbanded in 1973. The National Aeronautics and Space Council (NASC) was disbanded in 1973 as part of a government-wide reorganization. Following this, various bodies within the Executive Office of the President took on space policy responsibilities, including the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Security Council, and the National Science and Technology Council. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) became the lead White House organization for space policy after the NASC was disbanded in 1976. The National Aeronautics and Space Council (NASC) was disbanded in 1973, and space policy responsibilities were taken on by various bodies within the Executive Office of the President. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) became the lead White House organization for space policy after the NASC was disbanded in 1976. From mid-1982 until 1989, national space policy was coordinated through the National Security Council via the Senior Interagency Group on Space (SIG-Space), criticized for being too secretive and focused on national security. During the George W. Bush Administration, a Space Policy Coordinating Committee chaired by the National Security Council led the policy review resulting in the 2006 national space policy. The Obama Administration later established a Space Interagency Policy Committee (IPC) managed by the joint staff of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council, coordinating the development of the 2010 national space policy. The Space IPC coordinated the development of the 2010 national space policy after the National Space Council ceased operation in 1993. The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) took over these duties, chaired by the President or designated officials. Coordination of space policy has been primarily handled by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) since 1993, with collaboration from the National Security Council on national security issues. OSTP also oversaw the development of the 1996 national space policy. The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) coordinated the development of the 1996 national space policy, jointly issued with the National Security Council. The NSTC does not have a space policy committee but has subcommittees focused on space weather observation and Earth observations. Proposals to reestablish the National Space Council began after its disbandment in 1993, with efforts such as the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1994. The committee's report (H.Rept. 103-473) recommended preserving the National Space Council as an effective mechanism for interagency coordination on space policy. Despite hopes for its reactivation, the Rumsfeld Commission in 2001 recommended a return to the SIG-Space model used in the Reagan Administration. The Rumsfeld Commission rejected the National Space Council model in favor of SIG-Space due to concerns about bureaucracy. In 2006, Congress directed the Department of Defense to establish the Allard Commission to review the organization and management of the Department of Defense for national security in space. One of the Allard Commission's recommendations was to reestablish the National Space Council under the President's National Security Advisor. The National Space Council was recommended to be reestablished under the President's National Security Advisor to coordinate a national space strategy across various agencies. This change would signal a move to prioritize space policy within the inner circle of Presidential advisors. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 aimed to elevate the importance of space and aeronautics within the Executive Office of the President by organizing interagency focus on space and aeronautics matters effectively. President Obama supported the reestablishment of the National Space Council in 2008, but the Obama Administration did not follow through. The Administration's 2010 national space policy focused on improving partnerships and collaboration among departments and agencies. The Space IPC was seen as meeting the intent of the National Space Council proposal. President Obama pledged to establish a National Space Council during his campaign to oversee space activities. The Administration found that interagency coordination through the Space IPC met the goals of the proposal. Observers expect the Trump Administration to reestablish the National Space Council. Mark J. Albrecht, a member of the Trump transition team, was the executive secretary of the National Space Council in the George H.W. Bush Administration. The op-ed by senior policy advisors to the Trump campaign proposed reinstating a national space policy council led by the vice president to coordinate space policy and ensure efficiency in advancing U.S. interests. Congressional action may not be needed for its reestablishment, but oversight could be conducted. Congress may consider amending existing authority or conducting oversight for a reestablished national space policy council. Key topics include the council's goals, chairperson, advisory committee, and interagency coordination between civil and national security space sectors. Strengthening alignment between NASA's civil space programs and national security space programs has been a focus in past coordination efforts. The divide between civil and national security space programs has been difficult to bridge, with different levels of activism in various councils. Improved coordination is needed for space topics that primarily involve civil and commercial aspects. The Allard Commission recommended reestablishing the National Space Council to address national security space concerns. The Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Commerce, Federal Communications Commission, and Department of State oversee licensing, oversight, and export controls in the commercial space sector. NASA and Department of Defense increasingly use commercial launch services. Congressional interest in NASA-NOAA coordination on weather satellites and NASA's partnership with U.S. Geological Survey for Landsat land imaging satellites. Changes in national and international space policy present new challenges for coordination due to the congested, contested, and competitive space environment. Commercial space sector's role has grown with new entrants impacting the launch market. The commercial launch market has seen changes with new entrants, increasing the number of countries involved in space activities. The U.S. share of world launches has decreased, while China and India's shares have increased. Concerns about space debris and radio-frequency interference have also grown, making coordination more challenging and important. The National Space Council in the early 1990s provided additional influence over NASA management decisions, which was resented by senior NASA officials. Congressional perspectives on similar interventions by a reestablished council may vary. Some in Congress during the Obama Administration were concerned about excessive influence on NASA decisions by the Office of Management and Budget. Advocates of reestablishing the National Space Council aim to increase the national prominence of space policy. A witness in 1999 advocated for the council's reactivation to ensure rapid federal decision-making and raise awareness of the commercial space industry. The Vice President would likely chair the council under the Trump Administration, but Congress could consider other arrangements. The National Space Council was initially chaired by the President, but other arrangements have been suggested, such as a council chaired by the National Security Advisor. The effectiveness of the council chair may depend more on their interest in the topic and relationship with the President. The existing statutory authority includes a mandate for a Users' Advisory Group. The 1989 executive order established the Space Policy Advisory Board, which was active for a few months in 1992. Congress may consider creating a nonfederal advisory committee for the National Space Council, ensuring its implementation by strengthening requirements for the Users' Advisory Group. The committee would represent the interests of industries and non-Federal entities involved in space activities. The National Space Council and the Space Policy Advisory Board have different mandates. Congress may consider reestablishing the National Space Council to obtain external advice through other mechanisms, such as advisory committees at agencies with seats on the council. Another option is to amend the mandate for the Users' Advisory Group or designate another existing advisory committee to carry out its functions. Section 4 of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act directs the President to establish a National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel. President George W. Bush designated PCAST as the advisory panel. Congress may consider repealing the mandate for an advisory committee if it believes the decision should be left to the President. In 1986, Congress attempted to establish a National Space Council, but President Reagan vetoed the bill, citing interference with his discretion. The President's authority over the National Space Council is broad, allowing flexibility in its organization. Congress may consider revisiting the statutory provisions related to the council's staff to align with current needs. Eliminating these provisions could give the President more flexibility in structuring the council. Interagency coordination is a challenge for the federal government. Different mechanisms have been used to address this, but no single approach is best for every circumstance. The effectiveness of the National Space Council in the Trump Administration may depend on its statutory mandate, leadership, and relationships with key stakeholders."
