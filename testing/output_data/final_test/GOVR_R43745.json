    "content": "Currently, there are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories in the United States, with over 70 specific types issued. These visas allow temporary employment in the country, and the number of visas issued for temporary employment has more than doubled in the past two decades. The Department of Homeland Security estimated around 1.1 million temporary workers and long-term exchange residents in the US in January 2012. The admission of professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers in the United States raises policy options as the country competes for talented workers without impacting wages. Various temporary visa categories enable employment for highly skilled foreign workers in skilled labor, management, and professional positions. Congress has considered legislative options to reform the system of admitting foreign workers. Congress has considered legislative options to reform the system of admitting highly skilled foreign workers, including streamlining procedures, increasing the number of temporary workers admitted, requiring labor market tests for employers, extending labor protections, enabling visa portability, and permitting job changes for foreign workers. The 113th Congress has focused on visa categories like H-1B and L visas for skilled foreign workers, considering legislation for extensive revisions to nonimmigrant categories. Two bills, including the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744), have received action. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) and the SKILLS Visa Act (H.R. 2131) aim to revise visa categories, particularly the H-1B visa for temporary professional workers. Current law limits H-1B admissions to 65,000 annually, but exemptions exist for returning workers and those in certain fields. In FY2012, USCIS approved 257,538 H-1B specialty worker visas. In FY2010, USCIS approved 257,538 H-1B professional specialty worker petitions, an increase from 192,990. S. 744 proposes a flexible cap for new H-1B admissions ranging from 115,000 to 180,000 annually, with adjustments based on demand. Up to 25,000 STEM advanced degree graduates would be exempt from the cap, and spouses of H-1B workers would be allowed to work. The bill aims to ease H-1B renewal process by limiting reviews to specific criteria and providing a 60-day grace period for job loss. It also addresses the backlog of H-1B workers with pending LPR petitions and proposes increasing the annual cap to 155,000 workers. Additionally, it includes exemptions for STEM master's or doctorate degree holders and allows spouses of H-1B workers to seek employment. The Department of Homeland Security would develop a streamlined pre-certification process for employers filing multiple H-1B petitions. Concerns include the impact on U.S. workers, legality of H-1B workers' treatment, displacement of U.S. workers, and outsourcing jobs overseas. Some believe H-1B workers may lower wages for skilled U.S. workers and discourage them from entering STEM fields. Prospective employers of H-1B workers must submit a labor attestation to the Secretary of Labor. The attestation ensures that the employer will pay the nonimmigrant worker fair wages, provide suitable working conditions, and certify no strike or lockout. S. 744 aims to protect U.S. workers by modifying H-1B application requirements. S. 744 aims to protect U.S. workers by amending H-1B application requirements, including revising wage determination based on DOL surveys, requiring employers to advertise on a DOL website, imposing restrictions on advertising for H-1B positions, and establishing a new fee for H-1B visas to discourage overreliance on them. Employers defined as H-1B dependent must meet additional labor market tests and attest to trying to recruit U.S. workers without displacing them. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) aims to increase the numerical limits on H-1B workers admitted each year, revise requirements for H-1B dependent employers, and address fraud and abuse issues. It establishes a new class of H-1B skilled-worker dependent employers and requires them to offer comparable compensation packages to U.S. workers. The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) aims to increase the numerical limits on H-1B workers admitted each year and revise requirements for H-1B dependent employers. New provisions would prevent employers from hiring H-1B workers to displace U.S. workers, with different requirements for H-1B dependent employers, H-1B skilled-worker dependent employers, and all other H-1B employers. Employers must make efforts to recruit U.S. workers before hiring H-1B workers, and H-1B skilled worker dependent employers must offer positions to equally or better qualified U.S. workers. Certain H-1B dependent employers would not be allowed to hire H-1B workers intentionally to displace U.S. workers. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has recommended more controls to protect workers and prevent abuses in the H-1B visa program. GAO identified weaknesses in oversight, legal authority, and eligibility requirements for H-1B workers. A 2008 DHS investigation found a 13.4% fraud rate and a 7.3% technical violation rate in H-1B visa adjudications. Violations included document fraud and misstatements about job details. Some employers shifted filing fees to foreign workers. A 2010 investigation found a 14% \"not verified\" rate, suggesting reduced fraud. S. 744 would allow DOL to review H-1B attestations for fraud evidence. Subtitle B of Title IV of S. 744 broadens DOL's authority to investigate employer violations, conduct compliance audits, and impose fines for labor attestation violations. Employers must provide H-1Bs with insurance, pension plans, and bonuses like U.S. workers. New information-sharing and reporting requirements are established for H-1B employer noncompliance. H.R. 2131 would require H-1B dependent employers to pay additional filing fees, verify foreign educational degrees, and meet specific criteria to qualify as employers. The bill also authorizes the Secretary of Labor to issue subpoenas to employers of H-1B and E-3 workers. The L intra-company transferee visa allows companies to transfer key personnel within the organization, but concerns have been raised about potential displacement of U.S. workers and lack of labor market protections compared to H-1B visas. The L visa allows firms to transfer foreign workers with specialized knowledge, potentially displacing American workers. The visa requires the applicant to meet job qualifications and have been employed by the firm for at least six months in the preceding three years. The L visa allows firms to transfer foreign workers with specialized knowledge without needing to show that U.S. workers will not be affected. S. 744 proposes limits on the number of L workers certain employers can hire and introduces a new fee for L visas to discourage overreliance on them. Additionally, the bill includes requirements for reporting on L workers and employers, as well as providing information to L workers about their rights and employer obligations. S. 744 aims to regulate L visa workers by adding prohibitions on outsourcing, imposing fees for employers, and setting caps on the proportion of L and H-1B workers in certain companies' workforces. It also requires verification of multinational companies petitioning for L workers and authorizes DHS to investigate employer violations. S. 744 authorizes DHS to investigate and adjudicate employer violations of L visa program requirements, imposes penalties for violations, adds whistleblower protections for L-workers, and requires reporting on the L visa blanket petition process. H.R. 2131 adds labor market tests to the L-1B visa for individuals with specialized knowledge working in the U.S., requiring payment of prevailing wages. The employer must provide working conditions that do not adversely affect similarly employed workers. DHS will develop a streamlined process for employers filing multiple petitions. E-1 visas are for treaty traders conducting substantial trade, while E-2 visas are for treaty investors directing operations of an enterprise with substantial capital investment. The E Treaty visas require a treaty between the US and the foreign national's country of citizenship. S. 744 aims to expand E visa access by allowing issuance to citizens from countries with bilateral investment treaties or free trade agreements. It also lowers requirements for treaty professional workers from specified countries, such as the E-3 visa for Australian citizens. The E-3 visa, similar to the H-1B visa, requires employment in a specialty occupation. S. 744 proposes amending the E-3 visa to include Irish nationals, who would not need to work in a professional specialty. H.R. 2131 would impose a Fraud Detection and Prevention Fee on employers of E-3 workers and authorize the Secretary of Labor to issue subpoenas for enforcement. S. 744 also introduces the E-4 visa category with a limit of 5,000 visas per year per country. The bill proposes creating new visa categories: E-4 limited to 5,000 visas per year per country for principal aliens, E-5 for South Korean workers in specialty occupations, and E-6 for nationals of eligible sub-Saharan African countries or beneficiary countries of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act. Employers would need to file a labor attestation form with DOL for E-4 or E-5 workers. The visas for E-6 would be limited to 10,500 per year and require at least a high school education or two years of work experience. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (BECA) approves J visa cultural exchange programs, allowing foreign nationals on J-1 visas to work as part of their program. J visas have evolved to include tasks like child care and camp counseling. Spouses and children on J-2 visas can accompany J-1 visaholders but cannot work. Concerns have arisen as the J visa has shifted from educational to employment purposes. In 2011, 400 temporary workers on J visas went on strike at a Hershey's Chocolate plant. The DOS Office of Inspector General noted public criticism of the Summer Work Travel program in 2012. In 2012, General criticized the Summer Work Travel program for lack of oversight. The following year, temporary workers on J visas protested working conditions at a MacDonald's franchise. Efforts to address these issues have faced opposition from those who view cultural exchange programs differently from non-immigrant labor programs. The Senate approved provisions in S. 744 to redefine foreign labor recruitment for J visas. The bill for J visa holders allows civil action in federal court against sponsors, prohibits retaliation, requires new regulations for J-1 categories, additional disclosures on rights, and a list of employers with complaints. A $100 fee on program sponsors for each J visa entry was approved by the Senate. The proposed Comprehensive Immigration Reform Trust Fund would not charge nonimmigrants. Summer work/travel exchange participants on J visas can work in seafood processing in Alaska. Foreign nationals coming to the US for specialized work requiring language proficiency in countries with low LPR admissions are eligible for J visas. Foreign medical graduates on J visas must return to their home countries for two years unless granted a waiver. States can sponsor up to 30 waivers per year for FMGs. The Conrad 30 Program allows states to sponsor up to 30 waivers per year for foreign medical graduates (FMGs) to work in medically underserved communities. Proposed bills aim to make the Conrad 30 J waiver permanent and increase the number of waivers by up to five per year. Additionally, the bills include provisions to regulate working conditions and provide flexibility for J visa physicians. The bill aims to exempt physicians with Conrad waivers from numerical limits when adjusting to LPR status, extend H-1B status for medical training completion, and remove the two-year home residency requirement for J-1 spouses and children. O visas are for individuals with extraordinary ability in various fields, while P visas are for internationally recognized athletes or entertainers with a lower standard of achievement. The P visa is for foreign nationals in arts, athletics, or entertainment at an internationally recognized level. Athletes can stay up to five years at a time, up to 10 years total. Both S. 744 and H.R. 2131 would add visa portability for O-1 visa holders. DHS would streamline the process for employers filing multiple O or P petitions. Temporary professional workers from Canada and Mexico have specific entry terms. H.R. 2131 proposes labor market tests for TN visas for Canadian and Mexican professional workers, requiring employers to pay prevailing wages and provide suitable working conditions. DOL would have authority to investigate these requirements, and a $500 Fraud Detection and Prevention fee would be imposed on TN and E-3 visas. Foreign students on F-1 visas are generally restricted from off-campus employment. Foreign students on F-1 visas are generally restricted from off-campus employment, but after completing their studies, they can participate in Optional Practical Training (OPT) related to their major. The OPT work period was expanded to 29 months for STEM fields in 2008. Concerns have been raised about the F-1 visa becoming more focused on employment rather than education. The F-1 visa is facing concerns about becoming more focused on employment rather than education. Observers point to difficulties in obtaining H-1B visas and backlogs in adjusting to permanent residence as reasons for relaxing work rules for F-1 students. GAO reported potential fraud and abuse of OPT status, with DHS unable to fully ensure legal status. Proposed bills aim to ease the transition to permanent residence for international students by allowing dual intent for F visa holders seeking degrees. H.R. 2131 proposes allowing dual intent for F-1 visa holders pursuing STEM degrees, enabling them to apply for LPR status while on OPT. Employers of OPT students would need to pay prevailing wages, with DOL oversight. The likelihood of immigration reform for skilled foreign workers depends on differing approaches in Congress. The Senate passed a bi-partisan CIR bill (S. 744), while the House Republican leadership favored addressing issues in discreet \"chunks\" like H.R. 2131. However, there is consensus that action on either approach is unlikely at this time."
