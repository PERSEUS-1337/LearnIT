    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Helicopter Medical Services Patient Safety, Protection, and Coordination Act.\" It includes findings related to the act. Congress finds that the Federal Aviation Administration regulates civil aviation in the United States, while each State is responsible for public health planning, patient safety, emergency medical services, and the practice of medicine within its jurisdiction. Helicopter medical services are crucial for healthcare delivery and emergency services in each State. Existing or future regulation of helicopter medical services by States is in the public interest due to the unique issues they present regarding the adequacy and availability of medical services to patients. Court rulings and interpretations by the Secretary of Transportation have hindered States' ability to effectively regulate helicopter medical services similar to other healthcare services. These limitations impact public health planning, patient safety, and emergency medical services. The regulation of helicopter medical services by States is important for patient safety and public health planning. Federal law preempts certain aspects of helicopter medical services, but using the Airline Deregulation Act to strike down state regulations is not in the public interest. It is crucial to ensure the quality and coordination of medical care in this unique healthcare sector. The Federal Aviation Administration has exclusive jurisdiction over aviation safety, so State regulations on helicopter medical services must align with federal laws. States need clarification on their ability to regulate aspects like public health planning, patient safety, and medical care coordination without conflicting with federal regulations. The practice of medicine must align with federal aviation safety regulations. SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF STATE AUTHORITY OVER HELICOPTER MEDICAL SERVICES. Sec. 40130 clarifies State authority over helicopter medical services, allowing States to require medical licenses and prescribe regulations for such services. State regulations must not conflict with Federal aviation safety requirements. A State may regulate helicopter medical services regarding the qualifications of medical personnel and compliance with health planning and patient safety requirements. This includes coordinating services among different providers and medical institutions. Institutions receiving patients from helicopter medical services must demonstrate capacity, need, affiliation with healthcare institutions, sanitation protocols, and medical records requirements. State regulations for helicopter medical services must align with federal operating requirements and cover areas such as medical criteria, quality of care, and restrictions on offering gifts to referring entities. The establishment of medical criteria for determining appropriate medical institutions, specifying service requirements, coordinating emergency helicopter services, complying with accreditation requirements, and providing necessary emergency helicopter medical services. State regulations can prescribe requirements for helicopter medical services, including necessary equipment and helicopter attributes for quality care. State regulations can specify temperature settings, configuration for adequate access to patients and equipment, appropriate materials for patient care, sufficient electrical supply for medical equipment, and the ability to transport patients a certain distance without refueling within the state. The state regulations may require helicopters to have necessary protection measures for personnel and ensure no structural or functional defects that could harm them. Communication capabilities must also be in place for medical personnel on board. The regulations require communication capabilities for helicopter medical personnel to communicate with emergency services and medical institutions. Providers licensed in multiple states must comply with these regulations. In regulating helicopter medical services, states must establish regulations or agreements with adjacent states to ensure access across borders. The most stringent regulations among states where the provider is licensed must be followed. States cannot delegate authority under this subsection to political subdivisions.
