    "content": "The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act (P.L. 96-223) was enacted in 1980 as a compromise between the Carter Administration and Congress over the decontrol of crude oil prices. Oil price controls were in place from August 1971 to January 1981, with various phases of control. The Act was based on the structure of the oil price control program initiated under President Nixon's wage-price freeze. The Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 extended oil price controls through 1975, creating a two-tiered price control program for domestically produced oil categorized as \"lower tier (old) oil\" or \"upper tier (new) oil.\" The price ceiling for old oil was initially set at about $4.25/barrel, later increased to $5.25/barrel. New oil, stripper oil, and other categories had their own pricing regulations. Oil price controls were amended under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA75), replacing the two-tiered system with a three-tier system. Lower tier oil was produced below the base production control level, while upper tier oil was output exceeding this base level or from new wells. Stripper oil was initially not price controlled. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA75) established a three-tier oil price control system, with lower tier oil priced at $5.25/barrel and upper tier oil at $11.28/barrel. The act allowed for a 10% annual increase in domestic oil prices and gave the President the authority to end price controls between 1979 and 1981. The ECA of 1976 made technical amendments to the price control system. The ECA of 1976 made technical amendments to the oil price control system, exempting stripper oil from price controls. In 1979, the oil price control program categorized domestic oil production into tiers with controlled or market prices. EPCA75 gave the President authority to phase out price controls gradually between 1979 and 1981, leading to prices rising to world market levels. The Carter Administration announced selective decontrol of petroleum products and crude oil to promote gradual decontrol. The gradual decontrol of oil prices between 1979 and 1981 aimed to promote energy conservation and stimulate exploration and production. President Reagan repealed price controls on oil in January 1981. Excess profits taxes are used during economic emergencies like wars to control large profits. The 1980 Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) was introduced as an energy tax. The 1980 Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) was proposed in response to the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973-74 and attempts to decontrol oil prices. The Ford Administration suggested an \"emergency windfall profit tax\" in 1974, and the Carter Administration proposed a crude oil equalization tax in 1977. These proposals led to the precursor of the 1980 windfall profit tax. The 1980 Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) was proposed by President Carter in response to the Oil Price Control Program of 1979. The tax aimed to phase out price controls on oil between 1979 and 1981 to prevent excessive profits in the oil industry. Representative Al Ullman proposed the original windfall profit tax bill in Congress, which was later amended and approved by both the House and Senate. The Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) was enacted in 1980 and underwent multiple amendments. Significant changes were made under the Economic Recovery Act of 1981, including tax rate reductions and exemptions for certain types of oil. Proposals to repeal the WPT were common throughout its eight-year existence, with President Reagan including repeal in his platform during the 1980 presidential campaign. Repeal of the Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) was a recurring proposal during the 1980s, with President Reagan advocating for its removal in his platform. Various attempts, including through tax reform bills and debt limit amendments, were made to repeal the WPT, but it ultimately remained in place despite some congressional support for its elimination. The Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) was repealed in 1988 through an amendment to omnibus trade legislation (H.R. 3), despite initial opposition from House conferees. The Senate and House committees agreed on the repeal amendment in March 1988, leading to the approval of H.R. 3 with the repeal amendment by the House in April. President Reagan had objections to some provisions in the legislation. The Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) was repealed in 1988 through an amendment to omnibus trade legislation despite initial opposition. The tax was an excise tax on domestically produced oil, based on the difference between market price and a 1979 base price. Oil was categorized into tiers based on age, type, and production amount. The Windfall Profits Tax categorized oil into tiers based on age, type, and production amount. Domestic crude oil is produced in the United States or its possessions. Tax rates varied based on oil type and producer type, with lower rates for independent producers. The Windfall Profits Tax imposed a tax on oil producers, with limitations on tax liability based on net income. Certain categories of oil were exempt from the tax, including oil owned by government entities, educational institutions, Indian tribes, and newly discovered oil. Stripper oil and some royalty-produced oil were also exempt. The tax structure before its repeal is shown in Table 2. The Windfall Profits Tax imposed a tax on oil producers, with exemptions for certain categories of oil. Newly discovered oil was defined as oil from a well not producing in 1978. The tax rate on new oil was gradually reduced, with further reductions frozen in 1984. Stripper oil produced by independents was made tax-exempt, and royalty owners received tax credits and exemptions for limited oil production. The Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) was imposed on domestic oil producers at the first sale of taxable oil to a refiner. The tax amount per barrel was subtracted from the oil's purchase price by the first purchaser, who then deposited the funds semi-monthly into an account. The tax was a deductible expense for oil producers, lowering their income tax liability. The Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) was a temporary tax imposed on domestic oil producers, with the tax beginning to phase out between January 1988 and January 1991 based on cumulative net revenues. Once the phaseout began, the tax was to be reduced by 3% each month over a 33-month period. The Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) was a temporary tax on domestic oil producers, set to phase out between January 1988 and January 1991. The tax would decrease by 3% each month over a 33-month period, with a 4% reduction in the last month. Cumulative net revenues fell short of the $227.3 billion target, leading to the repeal of the WPT in August 1988. The tax was not a profit tax but a selective excise tax on oil producers, paid before profits were determined, and not based on actual production costs. The Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) was implemented as a compromise between the Carter Administration and Congress regarding oil price decontrol. Congress was concerned about the oil industry reaping huge profits from decontrol and not paying its fair share of federal taxes. The tax aimed to prevent unfair income redistribution from energy consumers to producers and provide additional federal revenue sources. The Congress implemented the Windfall Profits Tax to address concerns about the oil industry not paying its fair share of federal taxes. Price decontrol would lead to significant increases in oil industry revenues and profits, with projections of prices rising to $50-$60 per barrel by 1985. The added profits were seen as a \"windfall\" and were expected to provide no additional incentive to produce more oil. The Congress implemented the Windfall Profits Tax to address concerns about the oil industry not paying its fair share of federal taxes. Price decontrol would lead to significant increases in oil industry revenues and profits. Existing oil reserves would be worth more, with old oil selling for about $6 per barrel prior to decontrol and increasing to $24 per barrel. The Congress was concerned that no additional effort, investment, or cost would be incurred by oil producers in generating added profits. The Congress implemented the Windfall Profits Tax to address concerns about the oil industry not paying its fair share of federal taxes. The decision to produce much of the oil had been made with the expectation of a return based on the controlled price. Higher oil prices would lead to limited production increases, resulting in excess revenues for oil producers. The additional revenues from decontrol of oil prices and increases in world oil prices are seen as appropriate for taxation. The windfall profit tax was implemented in 1978 to tax excess revenues from oil production. It aimed to address concerns about the oil industry not paying its fair share of federal taxes, as oil prices were expected to rise due to OPEC's market power. Society should benefit from the economic return of natural resource production, as oil is a fixed supply resource unlike labor and capital. The stock of natural resources, like oil, is fixed unlike labor and capital. Some argued that high industry income was unnecessary for adequate oil supplies, leading to the belief that excessive income should be taxed. The Windfall Profit Tax was enacted after oil shocks in the 1970s to address concerns about the concentrated structure of the domestic oil industry and non-competitively determined oil prices. The 1970s saw a significant increase in oil prices due to factors like the Iranian revolution and public suspicion of the oil industry. The Windfall Profit Tax was implemented to address concerns about income redistribution and fairness in the industry. The Windfall Profit Tax aimed to address income redistribution concerns by ensuring a fair share of income gains from oil price decontrol, especially for poorer consumers who would bear a higher relative burden due to increased energy costs. The Windfall Profit Tax aimed to address income redistribution concerns by ensuring a fair share of income gains from oil price decontrol. It was argued that oil companies were entitled to a fair return, not excessive, determined by OPEC-set prices. The tax helped offset the industry's low effective income tax rates due to subsidies like the percentage depletion allowance and expensing intangible drilling costs. The allowance, introduced in 1926, was eliminated in 1975 except for some oil produced by independents. The deduction for intangible drilling costs allows oil producers to deduct costs that should be capitalized. The value of oil and gas subsidies has declined in recent years, but new tax subsidies have been introduced, creating support for a windfall profit tax. The major oil tax provisions lowered effective income tax rates for oil extraction below rates in other industries and the top marginal statutory income tax rate of 34% for corporations in 1980. Early studies showed that oil and gas received twice the tax incentives compared to other industries, with major oil companies having an effective tax rate of 8.7% in 1970. Studies between 1973 and 1980 included the cutback in subsidies and the windfall profits tax. Studies between 1973 and 1980 showed low effective tax rates for oil and gas extraction, with some cases even having negative rates. The inclusion of the windfall profits tax played a significant role in the total effective tax burden for the industry. The oil and gas industry has consistently had low effective tax rates compared to other major industries. Marginal effective tax rates increased after 1986 due to changes in tax laws, but they still remain below the statutory top marginal tax rate and lower than most other industries. A 2000 study found that petroleum and pipeline companies had the lowest effective tax rate among 20 industries. The study sampled 250 of the nation's largest corporations and found that petroleum and pipeline companies had effective federal tax rates of 13.3% for the three-year period 2001-2003. Gruber (2005) found that the mining and extraction industries had an average marginal effective tax rate of 16.8%, slightly below the industry average of 17.4%. The federal government enacted the WPT due to fiscal reasons, as the federal budget was in deficit for many years. The federal budget deficit was at its highest level in U.S. history, reaching 4.2% of GDP in the past. Deficits in the late 1970s were lower but still significant. Recent deficits have been larger in absolute terms but smaller relative to GDP. Revenues and deficit reduction were not the main focus of recent proposals, but additional revenues could help reduce the deficit. Major economic issues related to the Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) included revenues, dependence on foreign oil, and economic effects. The Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) was enacted to generate revenue and reduce dependence on foreign oil. However, it also led to distortions in energy markets and increased administrative burden. Original revenue projections did not align with actual tax collections from 1980-1990. The original 1980 projections for Windfall Profits Tax revenues were not adjusted for changes in tax laws enacted in 1981, 1982, and 1984. Estimates showed the federal government would generate $393 billion in gross revenues over 11 years, with net revenues projected at $223 billion. State and local governments were also expected to receive a portion of the additional revenue from oil price decontrol. The Windfall Profits Tax revenues projections were overestimated due to crude oil price overestimates in 1979 and 1980. The decline in oil prices in the mid-1980s was not anticipated until after 1983, as analysts adjusted forecasts for new oil supply sources and increased conservation efforts. The Windfall Profits Tax revenues fell short of projections, with actual gross revenues totaling $80 billion, significantly less than the projected $393 billion. The initial revenues were highest in 1981-1983, leading to the tax not being repealed despite attempts. Gross revenues started declining after FY1982, dropping sharply in 1984 and almost reaching zero in 1987 due to declining crude oil prices and adjustments in base prices since 1980. The Windfall Profits Tax revenues declined sharply from 1982 to 1986 due to inflation and declining domestic oil production. The small revenue collected in 1987 and 1988 was a key reason for the tax repeal. Table 4 shows estimated net WPT revenues, with column (2) reflecting WPT payments on federally owned oil. The Windfall Profits Tax resulted in reduced income tax collections due to deductibility against income tax liability. Estimated revenue effects of the WPT from 1980-1990 are shown in Table 4, with data sources provided. The estimated net revenue gains from the Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) were over $38 billion, representing 17% of the predicted net revenues from 1979-1990. Most of the revenue difference between gross and net was due to losses in business income taxes because of the deductibility of WPT payments. Income tax revenues were estimated to be $37 billion lower between 1980 and 1989 due to WPT deductibility. The Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) led to revenue losses from federal interests. It reduced domestic crude oil supply, increasing reliance on imported oil. Oil price decontrol aimed to boost domestic production and reduce import dependency. The WPT was an excise tax on domestic oil production, raising production costs and prices. The Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) increased production costs for domestic oil, but the tax could not be passed on to consumers through higher prices due to the international oil market setting prices. This resulted in a reduction in domestic production and supply. The Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) reduced domestic oil production and increased oil imports due to higher industry taxes and increased aggregate demand for oil. The tax could not be passed on to consumers, leading to a decrease in domestic supply and an increase in imported oil as the marginal source. The Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) reduced domestic oil production and increased oil imports due to higher industry taxes. The after-tax price received by domestic oil producers is lower by the full amount of the WPT per barrel. The price elasticity of the oil supply curve determines the reduction in oil production in response to the lower price received by producers. The price elasticity of oil supplies determines the responsiveness of oil production to changes in oil price. In the short run, crude oil production is relatively inelastic, but over the long run, producers can increase production through investment and exploration of new fields. The percentage reduction in oil production in response to the Windfall Profits Tax would be the product of the percentage reduction in the after-tax price of oil and the price elasticity of supply. The price elasticity of oil supply determines the responsiveness of oil production to price changes. Studies show varying supply elasticities, with estimates ranging from .1 to .8 in the 1970s and early 1980s, and smaller elasticities in more recent studies. Production losses are estimated under three alternative elasticity scenarios: +0.2, +0.5, and +0.8. Estimates of annual domestic oil production lost due to the Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) from 1980-1986 show production losses every year except 1986 when WPT was zero. The WPT reduced domestic oil production over the period, depending on assumed price elasticity. The Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) reduced domestic oil production from 1.2% to 4.8% over the period, leading to an increase in imported oil. The estimated production losses ranged from 3.2% to 12.7% of total imports, depending on price elasticity. The Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) led to a decrease in domestic oil production, resulting in increased imports. Production losses ranged from 3.2% to 12.7% of total imports, with the largest effects seen in 1981. Production losses declined between 1981 and 1986 due to declining market prices and increasing base prices. By 1986, production losses were estimated to be zero. The Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) led to production losses in domestic oil production, increasing oil imports and making the United States more vulnerable to oil price shocks. Estimates suggest that production losses in response to the WPT may have been from 3% to 13% of total oil imports. The efficiency effects of the WPT on resource allocation are unclear. The Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) did not have a significant impact on oil prices as they are determined globally. The tax could not be passed on to consumers due to the nature of the oil market. The temporary nature of the tax and the decontrol of oil prices further complicated its effects on resource allocation. The decontrol of oil prices on January 28, 1981, removed distortions and inefficiencies caused by price controls. The Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) may have contributed to economic efficiency by aligning with the idea of imposing an excise tax on oil production to account for external costs. The Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) aimed to align with economic efficiency but may have distorted resource allocation within the oil industry. The tax penalized extraction and favored downstream operations, leading to a shift in resources from exploration to refining and marketing. Different tax rates and base prices under the WPT favored oil from newer and smaller wells, creating additional distortions within the oil-producing sector. The Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) created artificial tax incentives based on oil age, infrastructure, and ownership. Certain categories of oil were tax-exempt, leading to distortions in the oil industry. Despite some distortions, the WPT imposed little to no tax liability on oil producers after 1986 due to oil price changes. The Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) imposed little to no tax liability on oil producers after 1986 due to low oil prices. Despite this, compliance with the tax law was still required, leading to complex interactions between oil industry entities and various tax laws and regulations. The Windfall Profit Tax imposed on oil producers required compliance with complex tax laws. There were four types of producers subject to the tax, including independent producers, integrated oil companies, royalty owners, and tax-exempt parties. Operators managed oil properties and determined tax withholding based on economic interests. In 1984, there were approximately 1 million oil producers in the United States. The Windfall Profit Tax imposed on oil producers required compliance with complex tax laws. The withholding agent, also known as the first purchaser, had to compute and withhold the tax based on information provided by the operator. This involved subtracting the base price and state severance tax from the removal price, adjusting for the oil category, and testing for the 90% net income limitation. The process could be complex even for basic steps. The tax compliance process for the Windfall Profit Tax on oil producers involved complex computations, including determining the removal price for certain oil categories. Different methods were used by oil companies, leading to IRS rulings to settle the matter. After computing tax liability, the first purchaser deducted it from the purchase price and deposited the money in a Federal Reserve Bank. Integrated producers had to deposit twice per month, while independent producers had to deposit every 45 days. Refunds or additional payments were required in case of overpayment or underpayment due to the net income limitation or underwithholding. Various tax return forms and information forms were necessary throughout the compliance process. The Windfall Profit Tax compliance process required numerous tax return forms and information forms, complicated by exceptions to general rules and interactions with other tax laws. The tax statute itself spanned 13 sections in 25 pages, with additional regulations and amendments adding to the administrative burden for the IRS. The Windfall Profit Tax was repealed in 1988 due to its complexity and high compliance costs for the oil industry and the IRS. The tax was considered burdensome to administer and comply with, leading to widespread anti-WPT sentiment and multiple bills introduced for its repeal. The Windfall Profit Tax was repealed in 1988 due to generating little to no tax revenues, keeping domestic oil production low, and increasing petroleum imports, making the US more dependent on foreign oil. This led to the recognition that the tax was burdensome and contributed to vulnerability to price surges and supply disruptions. The share of oil imports in total U.S. consumption increased significantly, reaching nearly 38% in 1990 and projected to rise to nearly 70% by 2025. The domestic oil industry faced economic challenges due to a sharp drop in oil prices in 1986. Oil prices fluctuated but generally increased after 1986, with prices around $18 per barrel at the time of the Windfall Profit Tax repeal. The rapid price decline in the fall/winter of 1998/1999 had a strong negative effect on the U.S. oil-producing industry, particularly impacting small independent producers. Earnings from exploration/production operations declined by about 60% in the first half of 1986, leading to reduced drilling and exploration expenditures and employment. Texas and Louisiana were hit hard by low crude oil prices, affecting oil and oil-dependent businesses. The collapse of oil prices in the 1980s led to bankruptcies in oil-dependent businesses, massive job losses, and plummeting revenues for state and local governments. The industry lost a significant number of jobs between 1982 and 1988, but some segments like independent refiners and marketers benefited. The windfall profit tax was seen as a burden on the industry, and its repeal did not provide economic relief due to low oil prices and minimal tax liability for producers. The repeal of the Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) in the 1980s reduced business costs and improved industry profitability by eliminating the tax burden. Opponents argued that the oil industry's income should be shared through taxation, especially during times of rising oil prices to generate additional revenues for reducing federal budget deficits. The administrative apparatus for the tax was already in place, making the elimination of the tax seem premature. The argument in favor of retaining the Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) was that the administrative costs were already incurred, and the system would only be in effect for seven more years. There are currently 14 bills in the 109th Congress to impose some type of WPT, either excise or income-based, with varying uses for the tax receipts. Several bills in the 109th Congress propose different uses for Windfall Profit Tax receipts, including offsetting supplemental spending bills for hurricane victims, funding the highway trust fund, and supporting the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. The proposed excise tax type of WPT would tax 50% of windfall profits not reinvested in specific industries, with windfall profit defined as the difference between market price and a base price of $40/barrel. Several bills in the 109th Congress propose a Windfall Profit Tax with a base price of $40/barrel. Bills like S. 1631, H.R. 3752, and others aim to impose a graduated excise tax on oil and natural gas profits exceeding a reasonable level. The tax rates vary from 50% to 100%, with proceeds allocated differently in each bill. The income tax type of Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) would impose a 50% tax on excess taxable income of crude producers and integrated oil companies with sales over $100 million in 2005 or 2006. Bills like S. 1809 and H.R. 4276 propose this approach, with a variant in H.R. 3712 imposing a 100% tax on profits above a 15% rate of return from the sale of crude oil and natural gas. Policymakers are considering a Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) on gas to fund a gas stamp program similar to food stamps. In the past, a WPT on crude oil was proposed when oil prices doubled in 1990. Economic and policy issues are raised by these bills, with discussions on market conditions and alternative policy options. The 1980 Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) was imposed to decontrol crude oil prices, allowing prices to rise gradually to market levels influenced by OPEC. Currently, there are no price controls on crude oil, and prices are determined in a competitive market. President Bush signed an energy policy bill in 2005 providing tax breaks to the oil industry, raising questions about the wisdom of subsidizing the industry during high crude oil prices. The high crude and petroleum product prices have led to proposals to reduce or eliminate subsidies to the oil industry in favor of a Windfall Profit Tax. Crude prices have steadily increased, reaching new highs in 2005, with prices peaking at nearly $70/barrel in August 2005. This increase in prices has also spiked petroleum product prices, increasing the revenue from the sale of oil reserves. The recent high petroleum prices have led to increased profits, particularly for major oil companies who own most of the reserves in the United States. The question arises whether these profits are windfalls, accruing unexpectedly to owners of oil reserves. This issue has been discussed in recent CRS reports but is not covered here. Major oil companies own most of the reserves in the United States and produce the bulk of the oil. The increased profits from higher oil prices are seen as both unearned and earned, with additional revenue generated by price increases. Taxes would need to be paid on the windfall profits, impacting overall profitability. The oil industry windfall profits would result in increased government tax revenues, with the federal government gaining about 35% of any windfall at a marginal tax rate of 35%. Refiners also see increased profits, but these are not considered true windfalls like those of crude oil producers. Refinery profits are due to supply capacity constraints. The recent price upsurge in the oil industry could lead to windfall profits for producers and refiners, but there is uncertainty if the spike will be sustained. Crude oil prices have declined from their peak, and there is a possibility of further decreases in the future. History shows that oil prices can fluctuate significantly, with prices dropping from over $30 per barrel in the 1980s to about $10 per barrel in 1986. Oil prices averaged about $17.00 per barrel from 1986-1999, fluctuating between $12 and $20. Prices hit a low of $8/barrel in December 1998. The volatility of oil prices impacts industry profits, with uncertainty about persistent windfall profits. Reinstating the windfall profit tax could increase US dependence on foreign oil, a more serious issue now with the nation importing close to 60% of its petroleum use. A windfall profit tax like H.R. 3752 and S. 1631 could have economic implications. A windfall profit tax like H.R. 3752 and S. 1631 could reduce domestic oil production and increase the demand for imported oil and petroleum products. The tax increases the marginal cost of producing domestic oil, leading to lower production levels and higher imports in both the short and long run. States are a residual, representing the difference between aggregate demand for oil and aggregate domestic oil supply. Factors like higher industry excise taxes or increased national income can lead to higher oil imports. Crude oil prices may rise as demand for imported oil increases, depending on tax rates and price elasticities. Reinstating the windfall profit tax could raise concerns about compliance costs and revenue expectations. The potential reinstatement of the Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) raises concerns about compliance costs and revenue expectations. Analysts are unsure if WPT revenues would justify the high costs of administration, especially given the volatility of oil prices. Alternatively, imposing an excise tax on both imported and domestically produced oil could lead to greater price effects, with domestic oil prices potentially being much higher than under the WPT alone. The excise tax on imports would increase costs and demand for oil, leading to higher prices. A tax holiday on gasoline combined with a WPT on oil would offset each other. Eliminating the gasoline tax would lower prices over time, but the WPT on crude oil would offset the decline in prices. A surtax on corporate income of crude oil producers could mimic a pure corporate profits tax, offsetting price effects and not increasing petroleum imports in the short run. This could capture estimated oil windfalls effectively. A corporate profit tax, whether pure or a surtax on existing rates, would reduce the rate of return and capital flow into the industry, impacting domestic production and increasing imports. The formula for Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) liability is T t = \u00cf\u0084 [P t m - P t b (1+ \u00cf\u0080 t-2 )](1- s ) (1- c ) where various factors determine the WPT in $/barrel."
