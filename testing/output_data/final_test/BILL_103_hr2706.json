    "content": "The Landmine Moratorium Extension Act of 1993 may be cited as the official title. The Act includes findings related to landmines. The Congress finds that anti-personnel landmines have been used indiscriminately, causing harm to civilians worldwide. Millions of landmines have been scattered in various countries, making areas uninhabitable. Advanced technologies are being used to manufacture sophisticated landmines that can be scattered remotely at a high rate. These mines have been found in Iraqi arsenals after the Persian Gulf conflict. Over 300 types of anti-personnel landmines have been made by 44 countries, including the United States, although the US is not a major exporter of landmines. The United States approved the sale of 109,129 anti-personnel landmines under the Foreign Military Sales program, despite signing but not ratifying the 1980 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on Certain Conventional Weapons. The Convention includes Protocol II, known as the \"Landmine Protocol,\" which prohibits the indiscriminate use of landmines. The United States supported practical provisions in military operations to protect noncombatants, but compliance procedures were omitted from the 1980 Convention's final draft. This lack of procedures has weakened the effectiveness of the Landmine Protocol. The Landmine Protocol has been undermined since its inception in 1983, leading to an increase in civilian casualties. The United States imposed a 1-year moratorium on anti-personnel landmines in 1992, while the European Parliament called for a 5-year moratorium. France has also stopped sales, transfers, and exports of these landmines. The 1980 Convention entered into force, allowing any party to request a UN conference to review it. France has requested a review conference, expected in late 1994 or early 1995. The US should extend its moratorium on anti-personnel landmines for 3 more years to set an example for other countries. The US should extend its moratorium on anti-personnel landmines for 3 more years to allow for a United Nations review conference. The US should extend its moratorium on anti-personnel landmines for 3 more years to allow for a United Nations review conference. SEC. 3. POLICY. The United States policy aims to seek international agreements to ban anti-personnel landmines, limit their manufacture, possession, and use, and ratify the 1980 Convention. Additionally, the US should participate in a United Nations conference to review the Landmine Protocol and negotiate a modification or new agreement to prohibit the sale and transfer of landmines. The international agreement aims to prohibit the sale, transfer, or export of anti-personnel landmines and further limit their manufacture, possession, and use. SEC. 4 of the Act enforces a 3-year moratorium on the sale, transfer, or export of anti-personnel landmines. Additionally, SEC. 5 provides a definition. SEC. 5 of the Act defines \"anti-personnel landmine\" as any munition designed to detonate near a person, any device meant to harm when triggered unexpectedly, and any manually-emplaced munition that can be activated remotely or after a delay."
