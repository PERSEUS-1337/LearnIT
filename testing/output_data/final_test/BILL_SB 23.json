    "title": "SB 23",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that young children in deep poverty face cognitive impairments affecting their school success. Research shows increased school absences and ER visits for these children. The Maximum Family Grant rule limited aid for families under AFDC before welfare reform. The California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids Act (CalWORKs) replaces AFDC and enforces lifetime limits on aid, work requirements for adults, and a maximum benefit of 40% of the federal poverty level. The Maximum Family Grant rule reduces income for families with infants to below 30% of the federal poverty level to prevent cognitive impairments and protect reproductive rights of CalWORKs applicants. Section 11270.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code prohibits applicants or recipients of aid from being required to disclose rape or incest victimization, share medical records related to such incidents, or reveal contraception use. Additionally, aid cannot be denied or reduced for a child born into a family receiving aid under this chapter. An applicant for aid under this chapter cannot receive an increased benefit payment before January 1, 2016, due to the repeal of Section 11450.04. Section 11450.04 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is repealed, stating that the number of needy persons in a family cannot increase for a child born into a family receiving aid continuously for 10 months prior to the birth. Children exempt from this section include those conceived through rape if reported to authorities before or within three months of birth, incest if reported before or within three months of birth, or if paternity is established, and contraceptive failure if using specific methods. Children born before November 1, 1995, are also exempt. Children born before November 1, 1995, are exempt from this section. Children conceived when either parent was a nonneedy caretaker relative, no longer living with either parent, or if the family has not received aid for 24 consecutive months while the child was living with the family are also exempt. Child support payments for children not increasing the maximum aid payment are paid to the assistance unit and not considered as family income for aid eligibility calculations. Starting January 1, 1995, county welfare departments must inform applicants and recipients of aid about the provisions of this section. The notification should explain the impact on future aid and does not apply to a recipient's child until 12 months after receiving an informational notice. The department will seek federal waivers for implementation. The department will implement the section once the Director of Social Services declares that necessary administrative actions have been taken. Subdivisions (a) to (g) will be effective on January 1, 1995. No appropriation will be made for this act. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be provided to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
