    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"12 Carrier Act\". The Congress expresses its sense. The \"12 Carrier Act\" acknowledges the importance of aircraft carriers in fulfilling the Navy's missions, providing forward airpower for national security, rapid response to threats, on-station diplomacy, and deterrence against adversaries. Since the end of the cold war, aircraft carrier deployments have increased while the force structure has declined. The Navy aircraft carrier is operating at maximum capacity to meet global peacetime and wartime requirements, but the existing force structure cannot support these military needs. The Navy is struggling to maintain aircraft carrier strike groups in the US Central and Pacific Commands, leading to significant carrier gaps. Extensive maintenance availabilities due to a diminished force structure exacerbate these gaps, forcing the truncation of carrier training and increasing operational risks for sailors. The Navy is facing carrier gaps due to maintenance issues, leading to truncated carrier training and increased operational risks for sailors. Despite objections, shock trials were directed on the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford, potentially delaying its introduction by up to two years. A two-phase acquisition strategy for the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy will also delay its introduction, exacerbating existing carrier gaps. Developing an alternative design to the Ford-class is being considered. Developing an alternative design to the Ford-class aircraft carrier is not cost beneficial and will delay the introduction of future aircraft carriers, exacerbating existing carrier gaps and threatening national security. The Navy requires a minimum of 12 aircraft carriers to meet warfighting response requirements. Sense of Congress is to expedite delivery of 12 aircraft carriers, authorize one every three years, conduct shock trials on U.S.S. John F. Kennedy (CVN-79), construct CVN-79 in a single phase, continue Ford-class design for CVN-81, and pursue bulk procurement for CVN-80 and CVN-81. SEC. 3. Shock trials for CVN-78 are amended by removing the requirement prior to the first deployment of such ship. SEC. 4. The number of operational aircraft carriers of the Navy will increase from 11 to 12, effective September 30, 2023."
