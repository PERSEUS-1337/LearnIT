    "content": "An open question in the Deep Learning community is why neural networks trained with Gradient Descent generalize well on real datasets even though they are capable of fitting random data. The proposed approach, Coherent Gradients, suggests that gradients from similar examples are similar, leading to stronger overall gradients in certain directions. This bias in network parameter changes during training benefits many examples simultaneously, reducing overfitting and explaining common empirical observations in Deep Learning. The Deep Learning community is puzzled by how neural networks trained with Gradient Descent generalize well on real datasets despite being able to fit random data. The question addressed in this paper is how Gradient Descent finds a map that generalizes effectively among all possible maps that fit a real dataset. The paper addresses the question of how Gradient Descent generalizes well on real datasets despite fitting random data. It is suggested that similar to Decision Trees, GD may find common patterns in data to achieve good accuracy. The dynamics of GD enable it to extract these common patterns for effective generalization. The dynamics of Gradient Descent allow for the extraction of common patterns from data through coherent gradients. Gradients that are similar among examples reinforce each other, leading to faster changes in network parameters in those directions. This mechanism helps GD generalize well on real datasets. The Coherent Gradients hypothesis suggests that during training, network changes are biased towards benefiting many examples simultaneously. This is illustrated through a thought experiment with two examples, where gradients reinforce each other in common directions, leading to faster parameter changes. The Coherent Gradients hypothesis suggests that during training, network changes are biased towards benefiting many examples simultaneously. The gradient is stronger in directions that help multiple examples, leading to larger parameter changes. The notion of similarity between examples evolves during training, starting as task-independent and becoming task-dependent. The relationship between strong gradients and generalization can be understood through algorithmic stability. The Coherent Gradients hypothesis suggests that strong gradient directions are more stable and lead to larger parameter changes, benefiting multiple examples simultaneously. This stability is crucial for generalization during training. The Coherent Gradients hypothesis suggests that strong gradient directions are crucial for generalization during training. It explains how a simple modification to Gradient Descent can reduce overfitting. It also helps explain various empirical observations in deep learning literature. Experimental verification of the Coherent Gradients hypothesis is challenging due to the evolving similarity between examples during training. Intervention experiments are designed to compare baseline results with variants testing aspects of the theory. The study focuses on replicating previous observations and analyzing explanations provided by Coherent Gradients. Simple baselines like vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent on MNIST are used to eliminate biases and optimize generalization. The study aims to test the Coherent Gradients hypothesis by reducing similarity between examples during training. This approach is beneficial for easier gradient analysis, lower carbon footprint, and reproducibility. Initial experiments on different architectures and datasets suggest that findings from this simple setup may have broader applications. Injecting label noise can reduce similarity among training examples, making similar examples less similar without affecting coherence. The study uses the MNIST dataset with a fully connected network for baseline testing. The study uses vanilla SGD with cross entropy loss, a learning rate of 0.1, and a minibatch size of 100 for 10^5 steps. Label noise is added to the training set (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) by permuting labels. The proper accuracy of the modified dataset is calculated based on the percentage of examples with unchanged labels. The study uses a fully connected architecture with 1 hidden layer to fit noisy variants of the MNIST dataset to 100% training accuracy. Coherent Gradients suggest that increasing label noise makes training examples more dissimilar. Increasing label noise makes training examples more dissimilar, causing per-example gradients to be less aligned. This leads to a more diffuse overall gradient, resulting in stronger directions becoming relatively weaker. As a result, it takes longer to reach a given level of accuracy with a lower realized learning rate. The alignment of per-example gradients affects the speed of loss decrease during training. If gradients are orthogonal, loss decreases faster, while if they are similar, loss decreases slower. In datasets with noise, pristine examples are more similar than corrupt ones, impacting the gradient alignment. In datasets with noise, pristine examples are expected to align well and learn faster than corrupt examples. The learning rate for pristine examples is closer to 0% label noise, while corrupt examples are closer to 100% label noise. As the proportion of pristine examples decreases with noise, their learning rate degrades. This explains why networks can still learn with noisy labels if there are enough clean examples. The training and test curves for different variants show that pristine examples are learned faster than corrupt examples, aligning with the expected learning rates based on label noise levels. The proportion of clean examples impacts the learning rate, with networks still able to learn with noisy labels if there are enough pristine examples. In early training, the presence of noise weakens the l2-norm of the gradient, leading to more dissimilar gradients with greater noise. This experiment highlights the effectiveness of early stopping to maximize the use of strong gradients and limit training loss. Early stopping maximizes the use of strong gradients and limits the impact of weak gradients in noisy datasets. Pristine examples are expected to be more similar to each other, while corrupt examples are less similar. The gradients from pristine examples are stronger than from corrupt examples during the initial part of training. During training, the contribution of pristine examples decreases as corrupt examples are fitted. For 25% and 50% noise levels, pristine examples initially have higher contributions than corrupt examples, but they eventually cross over. This is because pristine examples are fitted first, followed by corrupt examples. In the case of 75% noise, there is a slight downward slope in the contribution from pristine examples. The contribution from pristine examples decreases due to the sheer number of corrupt examples dominating. A null world analysis shows that there is a difference between pristine and corrupt examples, increasing confidence in rejecting the null hypothesis. The null world analysis reveals a difference between pristine and corrupt examples, boosting confidence in rejecting the null hypothesis. The 75% case shows a slight downward slope in pristine data, indicating a significant difference in sizes between the two sets. Adjusting for this difference can provide a stronger signal for the distinction between pristine and corrupt in the 75% case. In a novel test of the Coherent Gradients hypothesis, the authors modify GD in a specific manner inspired by random forests to suppress weak gradient directions. By updating parameters with \"winsorized\" gradients, they aim to prevent overfitting in the training process. The authors modified stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by using \"winsorized\" gradients to clip extreme values, reducing outliers in per-example gradients. They employed a smaller neural network with 3 hidden layers of 256 ReLUs each, trained for 60,000 steps with a fixed learning rate of 0.1. Training was done on a baseline dataset and 4 noisy variants with different levels of outliers. The value of c in each minibatch determines how many outliers are clipped in the per-example gradient. Strong gradients improve network generalization, while weak gradients lead to overfitting. Winsorizing coordinates suppresses extreme values, ensuring parameter updates benefit multiple examples. Larger c reduces overfitting but makes fitting training data harder. Winsorization helps suppress extreme values in the per-example gradient to reduce overfitting. Training accuracy may fall as a result, but overfitting is still expected to occur at a reduced rate. Experimental results align with predictions, showing that for c > 1, training accuracies do not exceed the proper accuracy of the dataset. The overfit curve growth rate decreases with increasing c, and training and test accuracies peak with a large amount of winsorization before declining. Despite efforts to understand generalization in Deep Learning, a satisfactory explanation has not yet emerged. The implications of stochasticity in optimization algorithms like SGD have been studied, but understanding generalization without detailed knowledge of the optimization landscape is possible. Observations suggest that early stopping plays a role in small generalization gaps, indicating that the nature of solutions in optimization may not be solely responsible for generalization. Stochasticity may not be fundamental to generalization, as evidenced by experiments using full batch training leading to similar generalization results. In optimization, gradient descent is seen as a greedy search with hill-climbing, focusing on staying feasible for generalization. Gradient-based optimization is believed to induce implicit regularization towards simpler models, challenging classical complexity measures. Classical complexity measures struggle to account for generalization in neural networks. Recent research has explored alternative measures such as spectrally-normalized margin, path-based group norm, and compression-based approaches. However, none of these measures fully address the challenges of generalization in practice. Algorithmic stability is proposed as a different approach to understanding generalization in neural networks. Algorithmic stability is suggested as a new approach to understanding generalization in neural networks, as traditional complexity measures struggle to explain it. Previous work by Hardt et al. (2016) looked at gradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) through the lens of stability, but their results do not fully explain generalization in practical settings. Experimental results suggest that stability bounds for SGD without considering actual training data are ineffective. Stability, when formalized correctly, is equivalent to generalization, making it a crucial factor in explaining generalizability in learning problems. A stability-based analysis, similar to a privacy accountant, is crucial for obtaining non-vacuous bounds for practical networks and datasets. This approach is not only descriptive but also prescriptive, leading to the development of better learning algorithms. Rahaman et al. (2019) have shown that ReLU networks learn low frequency functions first, while focusing on the mechanism in gradient descent to detect commonality provides a simpler and more general perspective. The study discusses the application of Coherent Gradients to various neural network architectures and its potential for analyzing generalization via stability. It compares its findings to other studies that show biases towards linear functions and functions with low descriptive complexity. Additionally, it mentions a concurrent submission proposing a descriptive statistic stiffness for characterizing generalization. The study discusses the application of Coherent Gradients to neural network architectures for analyzing generalization via stability. It compares findings to other studies on biases towards linear functions and low descriptive complexity. Sankararaman et al. propose a similar statistic called gradient confusion for studying training speed. Future research could explore the Coherent Gradients hypothesis in settings like BERT and ResNet, requiring more efficient tests. Non-parametric methods for similarity, like those in Chatterjee & Mishchenko (2019), could be useful for characterizing \"easy\" examples. The study explores the concept of Coherent Gradients in neural networks, analyzing generalization through stability. It investigates how adversarial initializations affect training and the impact of wider networks on generalization. The study also considers the application of Winsorized SGD for further development. The study examines the use of Winsorized SGD for efficient learning with generalization guarantees and privacy considerations. It also explores the comparison of winsorized gradients to a privacy algorithm proposed by Abadi et al. (2016) and the potential for designing learning algorithms for discrete networks."
