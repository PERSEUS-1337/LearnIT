    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1212 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require applicants for clinic licenses to provide evidence of reputable character for themselves and any associated individuals or entities. Applicants for clinic licenses must provide detailed information about partners, officers, directors, and stockholders, including their names, business addresses, and ownership percentages. Additionally, evidence of the applicant's ability to comply with regulations is required. Applicants for clinic licenses must provide detailed information about the clinic's name, address, responsible professional licentiate, clinic class, services provided, and operational details for license determination. The clinic must provide additional information required by the department for proper enforcement of regulations, including a written policy on child passenger restraint systems, state laws, local programs, and risks associated with not using a restraint system. No application is needed for a licensed primary care clinic to add a service or remodel an existing site, but the clinic must notify the department in writing at least 60 days before making any changes. The department has the authority to conduct inspections to ensure compliance with regulations. The primary care clinic must provide a signed certification to the department within 60 days after completing any remodeling, modification, or construction project that requires a building permit according to applicable laws. The department must ensure that primary care clinic application forms comply with specific requirements, including separate rules for primary care and specialty clinics. No separate application form is needed for primary care clinics. The department reviews notifications from primary care clinics to add additional physical plants, approves them if compliant, and amends the license within 30 days. Additional information may be requested if needed before amending the license. The department will not amend the license to include the additional physical plant until the additional information is received and reviewed. The written notification for a single consolidated license must include evidence of good standing and compliance with specific criteria, such as a single governing body, administration, and medical director for all facilities. The additional physical plant for clinics must meet construction and fire safety standards as per California Building Standards Code. The written notification should include details like licensee's administrative office, additional plant's details, and services provided. (C) Documentation confirming authority to control additional physical plant required for adding new clinics. New clinics must be within half a mile of licensed clinic. Licensee fee needed for each additional physical plant upon license renewal. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties, within the meaning of the Government Code and California Constitution."
