    "content": "The asset management industry consists of asset management companies offering public and private funds. Intermediaries like investment advisers and custodians provide essential services. 44.8% of U.S. households own public funds. The industry pools assets, shares risks, and protects investors. The SEC regulates the industry. The SEC is the primary regulator of the asset management industry, governing public and private funds. Public funds like mutual funds are accessible to all investors, while private funds like hedge funds are limited to sophisticated investors. Private funds also include venture capital and private equity funds. The asset management industry encompasses public and private investment funds, with regulations in place to disclose, monitor, and mitigate risks. Current trends and policy issues include the industry's impact on financial stability, protection for retail investors, and the influence of financial technology (fintech). The industry is large, concentrated, and subject to varying statistics depending on the source. The asset management industry is large and highly concentrated, with U.S. asset managers managing around $50 trillion in assets in 2017. The top 10 U.S. asset managers held $26.2 trillion in assets under management as of 2017. Assets are measured by assets under management (AUM) and net assets, with U.S.-registered investment companies holding $21.4 trillion in total net assets as of 2018. Private funds held $8.7 trillion in total net assets and $13.5 trillion in AUM as of December 2018. Other market intermediaries, like broker-dealers, held around $3.1 trillion AUM. Public funds are pooled investment vehicles that gather money from a wide variety of investors and invest in stocks, bonds, and other securities. They are SEC-registered investment companies open to institutional and retail investors. Public funds managed over $21.4 trillion in assets by year-end 2018, largely on behalf of more than 100 million U.S. retail investors. The four basic types of public funds are mutual funds, closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds, and unit investment trusts. Mutual funds, also known as open-ended funds, have no limit on shares and are not traded on exchanges. Investors redeem shares at net asset value when exiting their positions. Closed-end funds sell a limited number of shares and do not offer continuous redemption. Closed-end fund shares are not redeemable and are traded in the secondary market. Investors can exit closed-end funds by buying or selling shares on securities exchanges. ETFs combine features of mutual funds and closed-end funds, allowing continuous share offerings that can trade on exchanges like a stock. UITs invest money raised from many investors in a fixed portfolio of securities. Private funds operate through exemptions from certain SEC regulations. Private funds, also known as alternative investments, operate through exemptions from certain SEC regulations. They are available to a limited number of qualified investors and tend to take on higher risks with more investor access restrictions. As of December 2018, private funds held $8.7 trillion in total net assets and $13.5 trillion in gross assets under management. The private fund industry grew over 60% from the first quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily driven by increases in private equity and hedge funds. The regulations governing private funds were established in the 1940s under the Investment Company Act, but the current landscape raises questions about the adequacy of these regulations. The private fund landscape raises questions about updating regulations. Main types include hedge funds, venture capital funds, private equity funds, and family offices. Dodd-Frank Act removed exemption for investment advisers with fewer than 15 clients. Legal definitions exist for venture capital funds and family offices. Selected private funds have legal definitions established. Private equity funds and venture capital funds are types of private funds exempted from new regulations. Private equity funds focus on investments in privately held companies, while venture capital funds provide financing for high-tech startups. Institutional investors often allocate a significant portion of their assets to private equity funds. The SEC defined venture capital funds in 2011. In 2011, the SEC defined venture capital funds as funds that must meet specific criteria to qualify for regulatory exemptions. Hedge funds, on the other hand, are pooled investment vehicles known for their speculative investment practices, high fee structures, and reported underperformance. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated more detailed reporting of hedge funds and other private funds, with confidential filings now reported to the SEC. Despite debates over excessive fees and closures, the hedge fund industry remains at peak net assets levels of around $4 trillion. Family offices manage the wealth of family clients and are exempt from SEC registration requirements. Family offices, which manage the wealth of family clients, are exempt from SEC registration requirements and receive minimal regulation. They have grown rapidly in recent years and are increasingly becoming an option for some hedge fund managers. Private funds typically invest in higher-risk assets and use more volatile investment strategies compared to public funds. Certain private funds focus on funding startups, which are riskier with higher possibilities for business failure. Additionally, private funds have greater leverage capabilities, increasing both risks and returns. Private funds have less regulation compared to public funds, allowing them to have more control over portfolio companies. They also have restrictions on investor access to protect less sophisticated investors. Public funds are more liquid for investors due to their redemption or exchange trading features, while private funds are considered illiquid. Private funds often invest in private securities, leading to longer holding periods of three to seven years before a liquidity event like company buyouts or IPOs can occur. In contrast, public funds mostly invest in publicly traded companies, offering immediate liquidity. Public funds focus on publicly traded securities for immediate liquidity, while private funds invest in private securities with longer holding periods. Some of the world's largest private fund managers, like Amundi Group and Blackstone Group, are publicly traded, allowing public investors to purchase their stocks and gain exposure to their private fund portfolios. These publicly listed asset management firms managed $2.4 trillion combined in 2017. Business development companies (BDCs) are closed-end funds created in 1980 to provide capital to small businesses. They invest in small and developing businesses, offering operational assistance in addition to funding. BDCs are not required to register with the SEC as investment companies, facing less regulation than mutual funds. A fund of funds is an investment fund that invests in other funds, aiming for asset allocation, diversification, and other investment objectives. These funds are subject to SEC reporting requirements and almost half of all registered funds invest in other funds. The asset management industry operates through asset management companies (AMCs) managing multiple funds of different types. The largest AMCs are listed in Table 1. The asset management industry is supported by various players including financial advisers, data and research providers, custodians, and investment advisers. Funds are financial products sold to investors through retail sales and distribution channels like investment advisers and broker-dealers. These players play a crucial role in managing funds' portfolio composition, trading, asset safeguarding, and shareholder voting. The curr_chunk discusses different players in asset management policy discussions, including investment advisers, brokers, and dealers. Investment advisers provide advice on securities and must register with the SEC. Brokers conduct securities transactions for others, while dealers do so for their own accounts. Both brokers and dealers must register with the SEC and follow self-regulatory organizations' guidance. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is the main self-regulatory organization for the broker-dealer industry, supervising around 3,596 member firms and 626,127 individual registered reps. Custodians safeguard financial assets without legal ownership, holding and securing assets as required by regulatory requirements to protect investors. Financial custody has evolved over the past 90 years. Financial custody has evolved over the past 90 years, with custodians now playing a key role in asset management operations. Four major banks service around $114 trillion of global assets. The asset management industry involves investment research, data aggregation, and analysis for decision-making. Proxy votes are commonly used for shareholder meetings, with investment managers required to vote in the best interest of their clients. During the 2018 shareholder meeting season, there were over 4,000 meetings with 259 million proxy votes. Shareholders vote through intermediaries, sparking debates on proxy reform in the asset management industry. The regulatory regime governing asset management has evolved over time, leading to a somewhat fragmented oversight. The asset management industry is overseen by a fragmented regulatory regime with areas of disconnect between business practices and legal definitions. Congress created the SEC during the Great Depression to restore public confidence in the U.S. capital markets. Early policymaking in the 1930s focused on full disclosure to combat fraudulent activities in the industry. In 1940, Congress introduced the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act to regulate the asset management industry. These laws require fair treatment of investors and registration with the SEC for portfolio managers and investment advisers. Asset management companies must comply with the Investment Company Act or seek exemption, while funds are subject to federal securities regulations. After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Congress focused on financial services sector risks and policy solutions, with discussions on risks in banking and asset management industries. Despite similarities in financial risks, differences arise from their business models and risk controls. Asset management operates on an agent-based model, separating investment management functions from ownership, unlike the principal-based model in banking. Asset managers are seen as agents providing services and are compensated through fees. Asset managers are compensated through service or performance fees and are insulated from investment returns or client account losses. They do not own client assets, allowing them to exit the market without significant impact. Unlike banks, asset managers do not guarantee client assets, and clients can transfer assets out of failing firms. Macro-prudential tools, like stress testing mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, are being considered for asset management firms to detect and mitigate systemic risks. The SEC implements annual stress testing for certain asset managers, with disclosure requirements being the cornerstone of securities regulation. Public funds provide public disclosures to inform investors, while private funds provide SEC-only disclosures for risk monitoring and policy informing. Public disclosures allow investors to make informed judgments about specific funds, consistent with the philosophy of transparency in regulation. Public disclosures, including mutual fund and ETF prospectuses, are available for free from the SEC public disclosure portal. SEC-registered investment advisers also play a role in this regulatory framework. The SEC requires public disclosures for public funds to inform investors, while private funds provide SEC-only disclosures for regulatory review and risk monitoring. Private disclosures are used for policymaking and are not publicly available. Examples include public fund liquidity reporting and periodic reporting of private funds by SEC-registered investment advisers. Public funds are open to all investors, while private funds have restricted investor access due to intersecting federal laws governing regulatory requirements. Private funds are restricted by federal laws governing regulatory requirements for securities offerings, investment management companies, and investment advisers. Investors must meet specific definitions such as accredited investor, qualified client, or qualified purchaser to invest in private funds without triggering additional regulatory requirements. Compliance with these definitions allows private funds to maintain reduced regulatory obligations compared to public funds. The SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) oversees examinations and risk oversight in the asset management industry. OCIE focuses on compliance, fraud, and informing policymaking, with approximately 10,000 mutual funds, 13,200 investment advisers, and 3,800 broker-dealers subject to potential examinations. The OCIE completed over 3,000 examinations in fiscal year 2018. Investors should be aware that the federal government does not guarantee the value and performance of investment management accounts. Market fluctuations can lead to underperformance or loss of principal. In case of a capital markets firm failure, investors may receive limited payouts from the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which insures up to $500,000 of cash and securities in brokerage accounts. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) insures up to $500,000 of cash and securities in brokerage accounts to protect customers in case of a firm failure. SIPC only protects the custody function of broker-dealers, restoring missing assets but not protecting against market value declines. In contrast, the FDIC insures up to $250,000 of deposits in banks and thrift institutions. The asset management industry faces various risks, with examples and mitigation controls outlined to help policymakers understand regulatory requirements. Conflicts of interest may arise in the asset management industry when agents make decisions on behalf of principals. An example is directing investments towards products with higher commissions instead of what best suits clients' needs. Mitigation controls include SEC-registered investment advisers acting as fiduciaries and FINRA imposing suitability requirements on broker-dealers. The SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest in June 2019 to address conflict of interest concerns in financial advisory services, requiring broker-dealers to make investment recommendations that suit client financial needs. This aims to prevent financial advisers from prioritizing their own interests over their clients' best interests. Liquidity is defined as the ease of buying or selling assets without affecting their prices, which is crucial during market distress when factors like cash needs and asset valuation volatility can drive panic reactions. Different funds have varying liquidity risk concerns. Private funds present different liquidity risk concerns compared to mutual funds. Investors in private funds enter illiquid investments with longer holding periods and cannot easily sell their positions for urgent cash needs. Mitigation controls include categorizing investments and limiting illiquid investments to 15% of net assets under the SEC liquidity rule. Operational risks in the asset management industry stem from operational challenges and business transaction issues. These risks are crucial due to the management of client accounts, requiring accurate recordkeeping, asset safeguards, information sharing, and cybersecurity measures. Leverage in funds involves the use of borrowed funding to invest, potentially amplifying risks and returns. While mutual funds and closed-end funds have leverage restrictions, private funds typically do not, posing increased risks to investors and the financial system. The asset management industry faces operational risks related to accurate recordkeeping, asset safeguards, information sharing, and cybersecurity. Mitigation controls include the SEC's custody rule requiring qualified custodians for client assets. Changes in the industry include growth, reliance on capital markets, shift to passive investment, and expansion of private securities markets. The asset-management industry has expanded significantly in the past two decades due to various factors, leading to a shift from direct to indirect investing through asset managers. This has resulted in asset managers dominating investment decision-making for retail investors and institutions, with their influence on both investors and companies increasing. The asset-management industry has expanded due to changes in capital markets and banks. Growth in capital markets financing has outpaced bank loans, increasing the importance of asset managers as major holders of bonds and debt securities. Mutual funds and ETFs held 21% of U.S. corporate bonds in 2018, double the percentage in 2009. This shift may be due to tighter banking regulation and bank deleveraging post-financial crisis. U.S. capital markets play a more dominant role in business financing compared to the Euro area. The asset-management industry has seen a shift towards passive management, with passive investment through index mutual funds and ETFs displacing active investment. Passive funds offer lower costs and superior performance, leading to concerns from active managers about reduced price discovery and fundamental research. The shift from active to passive investment in the asset-management industry has raised concerns about reduced price discovery and fundamental research by active managers. This shift has led to increased market volatility and concentration in the asset management industry, according to a recent Federal Reserve whitepaper. Some argue that actively managed funds outperform passive strategies in less efficient markets, potentially capitalizing on market inefficiencies caused by the growth in passive investment. Additionally, the asset-management industry has gained importance due to a rise in private securities offerings. The increase in private securities offerings has made the asset-management industry more central in U.S. financial markets. American companies raised $2.9 trillion through private offerings in 2018, attracting policymakers' attention. Interval funds, with longer repurchase intervals, are being considered for involving less liquid assets like private securities. The Treasury recommended the SEC review interval fund rules in a 2017 report. The SEC explored interval funds in its 2019 concept release on private securities markets. The asset-management industry's increased importance raises policy issues like financial stability, investor protection, and financial innovation. Financial stability involves the system's ability to withstand economic shocks and perform basic functions like financial intermediation and risk management. Policymakers focus on minimizing systemic risk, which can arise from domino effects or spillover effects when a firm's failure impacts its counterparties. Former Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo identified four possible sources of systemic risk. During the 2007-2009 financial crisis, asset-management companies, except for money market mutual funds, did not pose significant financial stability concerns. Asset managers act as agents providing investment services to clients rather than investing for themselves, managing large assets without direct ownership. Systemic risks in the financial industry include feedback loops, contagion effects, and disruptions to critical functions. Asset managers handle large amounts of assets without direct ownership, insulating them from client losses. However, the industry still faces financial stability concerns, as seen in past events like the 2008 market disruptions caused by money market mutual funds and the 1998 failure of Long-Term Capital Management. The Financial Stability Board has identified structural vulnerabilities in asset management, including liquidity mismatch, leverage in investment funds, operational risks, and certain lending activities. The section discusses operational risk and challenges in stressed conditions, focusing on asset managers and funds like money market mutual funds, ETFs, and leveraged lending. Money market mutual funds are highlighted as a source of systemic-risk issues due to their investments in short-term debt securities. Investors consider MMFs safe despite lacking federal insurance, and shares are redeemed at net asset value. Money market mutual funds (MMFs) are typically redeemed at net asset value (NAV), with a stable NAV of $1.00 per share. If the NAV drops below $1.00, it is known as \"breaking the buck.\" The Reserve Primary Fund broke the buck in 2008 triggering market reactions and the financial crisis. The Treasury Department intervened with an emergency guarantee program for MMFs to address the crisis. The SEC implemented rules in 2010 and 2014 for MMFs to address their vulnerability to runs, requiring institutional MMFs to float their NAV and giving boards the ability to impose fees and redemption gates. Policy debates continued on whether MMFs' NAV should be stable or floating, attracting congressional interest. The Consumer Financial Choice and Capital Markets Protection Act of 2019 would require the SEC to revert MMFs' NAV from floating to stable, aiming to reduce investors' incentive to run in distressed markets. Proponents argue that a floating NAV reflects market value more accurately, helps investors understand price movements, and removes the guarantee of zero losses. However, opponents believe that a floating NAV does not prevent investors from fleeing, citing European MMFs with similar structures that did not see a significant reduction in run propensity during market distress. Opponents of the MMF reform argue that implementing a floating NAV requires additional time and resources for calculations, as well as tax, accounting, and disclosure changes. They also point to the decline in MMF volume post-reform, suggesting a shrinking market that could lead to working capital shortages. Some suggest studying the reform's effectiveness before making further changes, while others raise concerns about ETFs and systemic risks. U.S. ETFs hold over $3.4 trillion in assets, driving the passive investment trend. U.S. ETFs, with over $3.4 trillion in assets under management, account for 30% of U.S. equity trading volume. The key systemic-risk issue surrounding certain ETFs is liquidity mismatch, which can amplify market distress and trigger fire sales. Some argue that ETF liquidity provision is additive. The SEC established a new listing standard for ETFs on September 26, 2019, replacing individual exemptive orders with a single rule for plain-vanilla ETFs. This new approach excludes higher-risk ETFs and requires new disclosures. The SEC established a new listing standard for ETFs on September 26, 2019, replacing individual exemptive orders with a single rule for plain-vanilla ETFs. This approach excludes higher-risk ETFs and mandates new disclosures and conditions on index-based and actively managed ETFs. Leveraged lending, also known as leveraged loans, involves financing for below investment grade companies with high debt levels. Syndicated leveraged loans pose higher risks due to riskier borrowers and weak investor safeguards. Regulatory oversight for syndicated loans is considered a gray area by some regulators. The U.S. leveraged loan market has seen rapid growth with deteriorating credit quality and decreased repayment capabilities. Nonbanks dominate the investor base, with mutual funds and hedge funds also holding significant shares. Around 60% of leveraged loans are packaged into collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) sold to institutional investors. The leveraged loan market has seen rapid growth with deteriorating credit quality and decreased repayment capabilities. Nonbanks dominate the investor base, with mutual funds and hedge funds also holding significant shares. CLOs are sold to institutional investors, with concerns raised about leveraged loans' risks and implications for financial stability. Market opacity is a key issue, with high-risk covenant-lite loans lacking transparency and potentially leading to unexpected losses and shocks to the financial system. The leveraged loan market has grown rapidly with concerns about credit quality and repayment capabilities. Liquidity mismatch is a key issue as leveraged loans trade infrequently and settle slowly, prompting caution from the SEC Chairman. Regulators worry about the lack of oversight compared to other financial products. Contagion risk is a concern due to the market size and investor composition, raising worries about financial contagion. The leveraged lending market raises concerns about financial contagion, with most investors being nonbanks, particularly the asset management industry. Some argue that direct financial losses would be contained at the investor level rather than spreading throughout the financial system. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve believes leveraged loans do not pose significant risks to financial stability. However, a data gap exists in monitoring risks in the market due to limited information on CLO holdings. Investor protections aim to prevent harm from inappropriate risk exposure, conflicts of interest, or abusive conduct. Some private funds are limited to \"accredited investors\" who meet specific income or net worth criteria. Institutions can also qualify as accredited investors if they own more than $5 million in assets. This has generated debate about which categories of investors should be eligible for this status. Some regulated entities automatically qualify as accredited investors based on their assets. Critics argue that the current criteria for accredited investor status are not related to investor sophistication and may exclude well-informed but less affluent individuals. There are concerns about equal access to investment opportunities and diversification benefits in private securities offerings. Discussions have included expanding the definition of accredited investors. Expanding the accredited investor definition to include individuals with financial training or experience, allowing investors to opt-in to private market opportunities, and addressing issues with proxy voting and investor protection. Proxy voting involves asset managers voting on behalf of clients, with concerns about stewardship and accuracy in the voting process. The SEC has addressed issues with proxy voting, focusing on voting in clients' best interests and accuracy. Proxy voting is crucial for determining the direction of publicly traded companies. Initiatives have been implemented to improve investor experience by updating fund disclosure, including allowing digital transmission of shareholder reports. The SEC is seeking public input on fund disclosure and retail investor experience, including electronic reports. Financial innovation in the asset management industry raises regulatory issues regarding new technologies and investor protection. Digital-asset custody has attracted regulatory attention due to challenges in safeguarding private keys for digital assets. The SEC's Custody Rule, designed for traditional assets, may pose unique challenges for digital assets without tangible representation. Questions arise regarding the \"possession\" and \"control\" of digital assets. The SEC has raised policy issues regarding custody of digital assets, including the use of DLT, cryptographic key pairings, restoring lost assets, anonymity in transactions, and auditing challenges. Congressional hearings have also discussed digital asset custody. Additionally, nonfinancial technology platforms like Amazon, Facebook, and Uber entering the financial services industry raise policy questions. Firms like Amazon, Facebook, and Uber are entering the financial services industry as potential competitors and partners to asset management. Technology platforms have the potential to disrupt the industry through digital asset transactions, robo advisory services, and direct product distribution. The World Economic Forum predicts that platforms offering access to various financial institutions from a single channel will dominate the delivery of financial services. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba Group, has already demonstrated the influence of technology platforms in overseas markets. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba Group, manages the world's largest MMF with 588 million Alipay users. Technology companies like Facebook are entering financial services, raising concerns about power, user data control, and personal privacy. Facebook's announcement of developing a new cryptocurrency called Libra has attracted congressional interest, with questions raised about regulation and compliance with existing definitions. Libra, backed by reserve assets, operates similarly to ETFs but is intended as a payment tool, not an investment vehicle. The SEC is evaluating if it falls under their oversight. Some Members of Congress oppose Facebook's Libra project, with a proposed bill to keep big tech firms out of finance. The Tech Out of Finance Act aims to restrict large tech firms from creating digital assets for widespread use as currency. The asset-management industry, regulated by the SEC, has evolved with changes in market dynamics and investment trends, raising concerns about financial stability, investor protection, and financial innovation. Asset managers have posed fewer stability risks compared to other financial institutions due to their role as investment service providers. The asset-management industry, governed by investor-protection rules, faces financial stability risks such as redemption risk and liquidity mismatch in certain MMFs, ETFs, and leveraged lending. Policy issues include investor access, fund disclosure, and digital asset custody debates. Technology firms entering financial services raise concerns about balancing financial innovation with investor protection.
