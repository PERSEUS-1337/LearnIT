    "content": "There is no information provided in the prev_chunk to assist with summarizing the curr_chunk about summer camps. The Director will award grants to institutions or organizations to develop and operate summer science and math camps for middle and high school students. Grants will be distributed based on merit and used to promote interest in science, math, and technology. Grant funds can be used to develop educational programs and cover operating costs for summer science and math camps. Applicants must submit a detailed description of the educational program they plan to offer at the camp. The applicant must provide a description of the camp, selection process, duration, capacity, staff involved, and required agreements. The Director will evaluate the ability to carry out the program, its novelty, and educational value. The eligibility requirements for receiving a grant under this section include entering into an agreement with urban high-need local educational agencies to select students for a science or mathematics summer camp. The program's evaluation criteria include its novelty, educational value, number of students served, and tailoring to underrepresented groups in science and technology careers. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to a grant program for urban high-need local educational agencies, such as the Director of the National Science Foundation and eligible nonprofit organizations like museums or science centers. Urban high-need local educational agencies are those located in cities with high child poverty rates and schools where at least 50% of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. The National Science Foundation is authorized to appropriate funds for a grant program benefiting urban high-need local educational agencies. The program targets schools with high child poverty rates and students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Funding amounts are specified for fiscal years 2007 to 2011."
