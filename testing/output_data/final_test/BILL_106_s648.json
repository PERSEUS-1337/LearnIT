The \"Aviation Safety Protection Act\" prohibits air carriers from discriminating against employees who provide information on violations of air safety regulations to the Federal Government. The \"Aviation Safety Protection Act\" protects employees who report violations of air safety regulations to the Federal Government by allowing them to file complaints with the Department of Labor. Employees can file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor within 90 days if they believe an air carrier or its contractor discriminated against them. The Secretary of Labor will notify the relevant parties upon receiving the complaint. Employees can file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor within 90 days if they believe an air carrier or its contractor discriminated against them. The Federal Aviation Administration Administrator will be informed of the complaint, allegations, evidence, and opportunities provided to the air carrier or contractor. Within 60 days of receiving the complaint, an investigation will be conducted, and a preliminary order may be issued. The Secretary of Labor conducts an investigation after receiving a complaint, provides an opportunity for written response and witness statements, determines if there is reasonable cause to believe in the complaint's merit, and notifies both the complainant and the alleged violator of the findings. If a violation is found, an order may be issued. The Secretary of Labor issues a preliminary order with relief if a violation is believed to have occurred. The alleged violator or complainant can file objections within 30 days and request a hearing. Filing objections does not stay any reinstatement remedy. The Secretary of Labor issues a preliminary order with relief for alleged violations. A hearing can be requested within 30 days, conducted expeditiously, and governed by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Failure to request a hearing deems the preliminary order as final and not subject to judicial review. The Secretary of Labor issues a preliminary order with relief for alleged violations, which can be challenged through a hearing request within 30 days. If no hearing is requested, the preliminary order becomes final and cannot be reviewed judicially. In cases of complaints, an investigation is required if the complainant shows that certain behaviors were a contributing factor in the alleged unfavorable action. However, if the employer can prove with clear and convincing evidence that they would have taken the same action regardless, no investigation is necessary.

However, relief may not be ordered if the employer can prove with clear and convincing evidence that they would have taken the same action regardless. The Secretary of Labor issues a final order within 120 days after a hearing, providing relief or denying the complaint. Settlement agreements can be reached before the final order is issued. The Secretary of Labor may terminate a proceeding based on a settlement agreement with the complainant and the air carrier, contractor, or subcontractor. If a violation is found, the Secretary of Labor will order the violator to take corrective action and reinstate the complainant. If the Secretary of Labor finds a violation, they will order corrective action, including reinstating the complainant to their former position, providing compensation, and covering all costs and expenses incurred. The complainant may be reimbursed for all costs and expenses incurred in bringing the complaint. Frivolous complaints will be governed by Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Adverse parties can seek review of the final order in a court of appeals within 60 days. The complainant may seek review of the order in the United States court of appeals, following specific requirements for judicial review. The order is not subject to collateral attack. Enforcement of order by the Secretary of Labor allows for civil action in district court for non-compliance, granting relief such as injunctive relief and compensatory damages. A person can commence a civil action against an air carrier, contractor, or subcontractor named in the order to enforce compliance. The court may award costs of litigation, including attorney fees, to any party if deemed appropriate. The court may award costs of litigation, including attorney fees, in a mandamus proceeding brought under section 1361 of title 28 for any nondiscretionary duty imposed by this section. Subsection (a) does not apply to deliberate violations by employees of air carriers or contractors. The term 'contractor' refers to a company performing safety-sensitive functions for an air carrier. The text discusses the protection of employees providing air safety information under the whistleblower protection program. It amends a section of title 49, United States Code, regarding civil penalties for violations."
