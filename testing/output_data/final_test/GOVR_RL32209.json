    "content": "Estimates of military spending by foreign nations are available from various sources, including The Military Balance and World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers. These publications aim to provide consistent and accurate figures, but cross-national comparisons of defense spending can be imperfect due to discrepancies. This report presents data from these sources to offer Congress a sample of the information available on this topic. The Military Balance defines military expenditures as cash outlays of a central government for national armed forces, including strategic, land, naval, air, and support forces. The IISS provides current estimates of foreign military expenditures using data from national governments and NATO. The IISS estimates military expenditures using data from various sources, including national governments, NATO, the UN, OSCE, and IMF. However, accurate data is not always available, so estimates are made based on multiple sources. Exchange rates or purchasing power parity are used for conversions, especially for countries with limited economic data like China and Russia. The U.S. State Department Bureau of Arms Control's World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers (WMEAT) report uses purchasing power parity (PPP) for currency conversions to calculate military expenditures for countries, especially when no appropriate exchange rate is available. WMEAT measures military expenditures for NATO members according to a common definition that includes military retired pay and defense ministries' military-type expenditures. The World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers (WMEAT) report includes military assistance grants, excludes certain expenditures, and uses various data sources for different countries. For Russia, China, and communist countries, WMEAT estimates military expenditures differently, such as using U.S. Government estimates for China. The World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers (WMEAT) report provides estimates for Chinese military spending with a wide margin of error. Data from the IISS and U.S. Department of State is used to present tables and figures on U.S. and foreign defense spending. U.S. Defense Expenditures compared to other top defense-spending countries in 1999 and 2002, as well as as a percentage of GDP for the top 25 countries. NATO Defense Expenditures data is also included, with figures from the IISS and U.S. Department of State. The text provides data on U.S. and foreign defense spending in 2002, including figures based on purchasing power parity estimates. The information is sourced from the IISS and U.S. Department of State, with tables showing defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP and by country. The text presents data on defense spending in 2002, using purchasing power parity estimates to compare different currencies. The figures were estimated by IISS and include countries like China, Russia, France, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, India, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. The text provides data on defense spending in 2002 for various countries including Saudi Arabia, China-Taiwan, South Korea, India, Turkey, Brazil, Israel, Canada, Spain, Australia, Netherlands, Poland, Iran, Greece, Sweden, Dem. Rep. of Congo, and Ukraine. The United States ranks #47 with defense spending at 3.3% of GDP in 2002. NATO defense expenditures are also listed for countries like United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Greece, Czech Republic, Norway, Portugal, Poland, Netherlands, Hungary, Denmark, Belgium, Spain, Luxembourg, and Iceland."
