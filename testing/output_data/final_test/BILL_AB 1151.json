Section 40204 of the Vehicle Code is amended to allow payment of parking penalties in installments if the violator proves inability to pay in full. Section 40215 is also amended. (a) Within 21 calendar days of receiving a notice of parking violation, a person can request an initial review by the issuing agency at no charge. If the agency finds the violation did not occur, was not the owner's responsibility, or warrants dismissal, the notice will be canceled. After requesting an initial review of a parking violation, the issuing agency will mail the results to the person contesting the notice. If the notice is not canceled after the review, the person will be informed of the reason for denial, the option to request an administrative hearing, and the procedure for waiving prepayment based on inability to pay. If dissatisfied with initial review results, person can request administrative hearing within 21 days. Payment of parking penalty required, unless unable to pay with proof. Hearing must be held within 90 days of request, with one possible 21-day continuance.

Minors can appear at a hearing without a guardian and may be processed in the same manner as adults. The administrative hearing for contested parking violations follows established procedures approved by the issuing agency for an independent, fair, and impartial review. The issuing agency appoints qualified examiners to conduct administrative hearings for contested parking violations. Examiners must demonstrate necessary qualifications, training, and objectivity for a fair review. They must be separate from parking enforcement or citation processing functions, and their employment and compensation should not be tied to fines collected. Examiners conducting administrative hearings for parking violations must have a minimum of 20 hours of training, which can be reimbursed by the issuing agency. Training can be from accredited sources and cover relevant topics such as laws, procedures, and communication. Up to 12 hours of relevant experience can substitute for training hours with approval.

The examiner's decision after the hearing can be delivered in person or by mail, with a written explanation if the violation is upheld. The examiner or issuing agency may allow payment of parking penalties in installments or deferred payment if evidence of inability to pay in full is provided. Community service may be permitted in place of payment. This section does not apply to law enforcement agencies that do not also act as processing agencies."
