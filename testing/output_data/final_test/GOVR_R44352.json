    "content": "President Obama signed the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, mandating the FAA to integrate unmanned aircraft systems into national airspace by October 2015. Despite missed deadlines, FAA is granting approvals for government and commercial UAS operations on a case-by-case basis. Model aircraft and hobby drones can fly below 400 feet for noncommercial recreational purposes. Recreational drone flights below 400 feet are allowed as long as they are within sight of the operator, outside restricted airspace, and away from airports unless prior notification is given. FAA faces challenges in enforcing regulations due to the proliferation of hobby drones. Commercial drone regulations are slowly being implemented, with permits granted on a case-by-case basis. FAA's integration plan for public safety drones is in progress. The FAA distinguishes between visual line of sight (VLOS) and beyond line of sight (BLOS) operations for UAS. Currently, commercial and model aircraft operators are restricted to VLOS operations, limiting potential uses such as aerial surveying and inspections. The FAA restricts UAS operations to visual line of sight (VLOS), limiting potential uses like aerial surveying and inspections. However, UAS technology is advancing towards greater autonomy and automation, with minimal human input and training required for beyond line of sight (BLOS) applications. Integration of unmanned aircraft with manned aircraft in national airspace is envisioned for future uses. In the future, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) may share airspace and facilities with manned aircraft, requiring technological innovations and standardized procedures for integration. UAS are vehicles designed for flight without a human operator on board, controlled from a ground station. Ground control centers for more sophisticated drones resemble modern airliner cockpits. The FAA regulates unmanned aircraft systems based on size and weight, with small UAS weighing less than 55 pounds. Micro-UAS, limited to 4.4 pounds, may pose fewer safety concerns. Large UAS, over 55 pounds, have not been regulated yet. Size and weight affect operating altitude and flight endurance, with small UAS operating at low altitudes and having short endurance. Many consumer drones are battery-powered, with various designs including rotary-wing and fixed-wing airplanes. Some larger drones are gasoline-powered and can operate at high altitudes. Unmanned aircraft have a history dating back to World War I, leading to the development of guided missiles and target drones in subsequent wars. Israeli initiatives in the 1980s further spurred military drone development. In the 1980s, Israeli initiatives led to the development of more advanced unmanned military systems with ground-based command-and-control capabilities and improved imaging sensors. Unmanned aircraft have been used for intelligence missions in Kosovo, reconnaissance in Afghanistan and Iraq, and combat missions. Nonmilitary uses of unmanned aircraft increased after the 9/11 attacks, with Customs and Border Protection testing border surveillance missions in FY2004 and operational use in FY2005 along the southern border. The FBI has deployed small unmanned aircraft for targeted aerial surveillance in search and rescue operations. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are used on a limited basis for targeted aerial surveillance in various operations such as search and rescue, kidnapping investigations, and anti-drug trafficking. However, their role in law enforcement is limited, with fewer than 50 police agencies in the US obtaining FAA authorization for unmanned flight operations. Legal issues related to privacy concerns have also slowed down the adoption of drones for domestic surveillance and homeland security operations. Fire departments have even more limited use of UAS despite their potential benefits. Fire departments in the United States are exploring the use of UAS for urban and suburban environments, with the Fire Department of New York City testing a tethered UAS for aerial surveillance at fires and emergency incidents. The FAA was directed to develop standards for public safety agencies' access to national airspace by the end of 2015, but the deadline has passed with unclear actions from the FAA. Federal government uses of UAS include land management, wildfire monitoring, earth imaging, weather monitoring, and scientific research. The Federal government, including agencies like NASA and the Department of Homeland Security, use UAS for various purposes such as land management, wildfire monitoring, and scientific research. State agencies and university research programs also utilize UAS for aerial surveying and environmental monitoring. Nonfederal government and business applications of unmanned aircraft focus on data collection using different devices. Recreational model aviation using radio-controlled airplanes emerged as a hobby in the 1930s and remains popular. The Academy of Model Aeronautics has over 180,000 members. UAS for government and business involve data collection with various sensors like digital cameras, infrared sensors, LIDAR systems, and multispectral imaging systems. The Academy of Model Aeronautics, with over 180,000 members in the United States, has chartered 2,400 local model aircraft clubs. Hobby drones, a more recent development, focus on recreational aerial videography and photography, incorporating advanced consumer electronics technologies. The demand for using UAS in domestic airspace has evolved differently than expected, initially driven by military unmanned aircraft. The growth of domestic UAS activity was initially driven by military unmanned aircraft repurposed for nonmilitary and commercial use. The rapid development of smaller, low-cost UAS has led to a proliferation of hobby drones and commercial UAS, complicating FAA's efforts to regulate their integration into national airspace. UAS offer cost-effective aerial surveillance and sensing capabilities not easily achievable with manned aircraft or land-based systems. Unmanned aircraft are ideal for missions considered \"dirty, dull, or dangerous\" such as surveillance, border protection, disaster response, and scientific data collection. Industry experts see potential for cargo transport but not passenger-carrying UAS. Analysts predict a strong market for unmanned aircraft systems, with civilian sales playing a significant role. The civilian sales of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are expected to play a significant role in the market, depending on the regulation of civilian drones. The FAA initially projected 7,500 commercial small UAS to be operational within five years of finalizing regulations. However, recent forecasts have been more cautious, anticipating a surge in commercial UAS use once routine operations are authorized. Over 3,000 small UAS have already been approved for various commercial uses. A market study by the Department of Transportation's Volpe Center in 2013 predicted future UAS markets to follow an \"S\" shaped curve of technology adoption with phases of technological innovation, market growth, and saturation. The study projected that public agencies will operate about 58,000 UAS by 2035, with federal agencies accounting for about 10,000 of those vehicles and the rest being operated by state and local entities. The market is likely to be driven primarily by state and local public safety agencies seeking aerial surveillance capabilities. Additional demand is anticipated from state universities, highway, natural resource, and environmental protection agencies. Market growth for commercial UAS is expected to expand exponentially as technology advances and regulations evolve, with an estimated 45,000 commercial UAS in the United States by 2029. By 2029, commercial UAS are projected to outnumber military and government-operated UAS. The public-sector market growth is expected to slow down while commercial use continues to rise. By 2035, around 250,000 UAS will be flying, with approximately 170,000 being commercial. Most of these will be small or micro-UAS used for surveillance and imaging, especially in agriculture for precision applications. Aerial spraying of crops with radio-controlled helicopters started in Japan in the late 1980s and is now common. The use of radio-controlled helicopters for aerial spraying of crops began in Japan in the late 1980s and is now common. However, widespread use of UAS for pesticide spraying in the United States will likely not take off until regulations allow beyond line of sight operations. Current commercial UAS applications are limited to visual line of sight, such as aerial photography, videography, and surveys of properties, construction sites, and infrastructure. The FAA categorizes unmanned aircraft users into three classes: Public Operations, Civil Operations, and Model Aircraft. The regulatory framework for unmanned aircraft users is divided into three classes: government users, Civil Operations for commercial entities, and Model Aircraft Operations for hobby or recreational users. Public UAS operators must obtain approval from the FAA through a certificate of authorization (COA) on a case-by-case basis. The FAA requires operators seeking approval for commercial UAS operations to provide extensive details about the UAS, location, flight altitudes, and operator qualifications. Commercial UAS operations are approved on a case-by-case basis until comprehensive regulations are issued. Current regulations require UAS to operate at low altitudes within the operator's visual line of sight. Regulations for operations beyond line of sight are not yet being considered. The FAA requires operators seeking approval for commercial UAS operations to provide extensive details about the UAS, location, flight altitudes, and operator qualifications. Commercial UAS operations are approved on a case-by-case basis until comprehensive regulations are issued. Regulations for operations beyond line of sight are not yet being considered. Section 333 of FMRA required FAA to assess whether certain unmanned aircraft could be safely operated within the national airspace system in advance of completion of the required integration plan. The law further required FAA to establish requirements for such operations if it determines that certain unmanned aircraft could be operated safely prior to the completion of the integration plan through the Section 333 exemption process. The FAA streamlined the Section 333 exemption process in March 2015, allowing drone operators to fly below 200 feet and away from airports under a blanket nationwide COA. A separate COA is only needed if operators exceed the altitude restriction or operate near an airport. The number of exemptions issued increased significantly, with an average of 300 exemptions approved per month. Commercial UAS operations are approved on a case-by-case basis, with special airworthiness certificates issued for certain operations. The FAA issues special airworthiness certificates for UAS on a case-by-case basis for research, development, testing, training, and demonstrations. The agency was required to issue a final rule on civilian small unmanned aircraft systems within 18 months of its integration plan, but has faced delays. However, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for commercial small UAS operations was issued in February 2015, with the final rule expected in late April 2016. The FAA is expected to issue a final rule in late April 2016 for commercial unmanned aircraft operations of vehicles weighing less than 55 pounds. Operations would be restricted to visual line of sight, between sunrise and sunset, with visibility of at least three miles, flying below 500 feet at a maximum speed of 100 mph. Controlled airspace operations would require air traffic control permission, and registration with the FAA is mandatory. Operators of small commercial UAS must be registered with the FAA, maintain and inspect the aircraft before each flight, and hold an unmanned aircraft operating certificate. They must pass an FAA aeronautical knowledge test and undergo a terrorism threat assessment. Certificated operators need to pass a recurrent knowledge exam every 24 months and cannot operate with known physical or mental conditions that could affect safety. They are restricted to operating one UAS at a time and automated operation without a human operator is not allowed. The FAA's proposal for UAS regulations includes a \"micro UAS\" classification for vehicles under 4.4 pounds. These micro UAS would have restrictions on airspace, distance from airports, airspeed, altitude, and proximity to the operator. Commercial UAS regulations do not apply to hobby or recreational use under Section 336 of FMRA. The FAA's special rule for model aircraft under Section 336 of FMRA exempts model aircraft used for hobby or recreational purposes from FAA regulation if operated according to safety guidelines set by a community-based organization. This rule applies to model aircraft weighing less than 55 pounds, with larger models requiring certification through a safety program. Some model aircraft, like jet-powered scale models, may exceed the weight limit. The legal distinction between model aircraft and small UAS is based on use rather than size or capabilities. Model aircraft must be operated safely and give way to manned aircraft, with restrictions near airports. The Academy of Model Aeronautics has developed safety guidelines for model aircraft enthusiasts. The partnership with AUVSI, Small UAV Coalition, and FAA promotes safety guidelines for recreational small unmanned aircraft systems through the Know before You Fly campaign. Guidelines specify flights below 400 feet, within visual line of sight, clear of manned aircraft, 5 miles from airports, and clear of people or stadiums. FAA issued an updated advisory for model aircraft in 2015 to reflect statutory requirements. The FAA enforces regulations for model aircraft operators to ensure flight safety, including compliance with temporary flight restrictions and NOTAMs. Operators must avoid prohibited airspace and obtain specific authorization for restricted zones. The FAA enforces regulations for model aircraft operators to ensure flight safety, including compliance with temporary flight restrictions and NOTAMs. Operators must avoid prohibited airspace and obtain specific authorization for restricted zones. Model aircraft operators should follow best practices, limiting operations to below 400 feet above ground level. Different rules apply for recreational and commercial purposes, with post-flight activities potentially changing the flight categorization. Section 336 of FRMA limits FAA regulatory authority over model aircraft. FAA enforces regulations for model aircraft operators to ensure flight safety, including compliance with temporary flight restrictions and NOTAMs. Model aircraft operators must avoid prohibited airspace and obtain specific authorization for restricted zones. FAA retains enforcement authority against users of the national airspace system, including model aircraft operators who endanger safety through careless or reckless behavior. The special rule for model aircraft under FRMA does not limit FAA's ability to apply safety and security rules to model aircraft operators. FAA interprets the special rule as not restricting its enforcement actions against operators who violate existing safety regulations. The FAA enforces regulations for model aircraft operators to ensure flight safety, including compliance with temporary flight restrictions and NOTAMs. Operators must avoid prohibited airspace and obtain specific authorization for restricted zones. The slow pace of UAS regulation in the United States reflects uncertainties about the potential risks of unmanned aircraft operations. The potential risks of unmanned aircraft operations include safety hazards to manned aircraft and persons on the ground. Concerns include the possibility of drones being ingested into jet engines, pilot distraction in congested airspace, and sightings near airport approach paths. In 2014 and 2015, FAA reported numerous sightings of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) during critical flight phases, including near wildfires and sporting events. Some UAS disruptions led to the cancellation of manned firefighting flights. Operators have faced criminal charges for unsafe practices, prompting efforts to educate them on responsible drone use through KnowBeforeYouFly.org. In November 2015, FAA released an \"I Fly Safe\" checklist for recreational drone operators, highlighting safety considerations. Targeted messages were disseminated to curtail unsafe practices, such as flying near wildfires. The FAA has issued public safety materials to educate drone operators about temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) and designated \"No Drone Zones\" over areas like sporting events and national security-sensitive sites. They have also launched an education campaign with NFL teams to discourage flying drones near stadiums, people, airports, airplanes, and wildfires. The FAA has launched an education campaign to educate drone operators about safety and airspace regulations. They have also developed a smartphone app, B4UFLY, to help operators determine airspace restrictions and provide regulatory information. Steps are being taken to limit drone use near airports, restricted areas, and on public lands. Steps are being taken to limit drone use on public lands, particularly park lands where UAS use could interfere with others' enjoyment. The National Park Service has prohibited launching, landing, or operating unmanned aircraft within park lands and waters unless approved in writing by a park superintendent. Some states and local areas have also restricted UAS operations on public lands. For example, the state of New Jersey prohibits the use of UAS on its designated state park lands without prior approval. State and local jurisdictions have authority over land use and can restrict certain UAS activities on publicly owned lands. FAA jurisdiction over airspace limits state and local laws from restricting UAS overflights of public lands. Private entities, like Disney theme parks, have established airspace restrictions for security reasons. Ski resorts have policies restricting UAS without FAA involvement. The FAA has authority over UAS operations to ensure safety, with restrictions on altitude and flight paths. Enforcement actions, including investigations and fines, are used to maintain control over unauthorized UAS activities. The FAA has authority to enforce regulations on UAS operations, including fines for unauthorized activities. In a specific case, a commercial UAS operator faced a proposed fine of $1.9 million for conducting unauthorized operations for commercial photography in New York and Chicago. The NTSB upheld FAA's authority to take enforcement action against UAS operators for careless and reckless operations, such as in a case where an individual was fined for operating a fixed-wing UAS for aerial videography in Virginia. The FAA has authority to enforce regulations on UAS operations, including fines for unauthorized activities. Despite challenges in identifying violators and limited resources, FAA has requested support from state and local law enforcement agencies. Operators of UAS under exemptions or in authorized test ranges must register their aircraft. FAA asserted its authority to require all UAS operators to register their aircraft and developed recommendations through a task force. The FAA announced an Internet-based application process for UAS registration, with a cost of $5. Operators of model aircraft and hobby drones weighing between 250 grams and 55 pounds must register by December 21, 2015. Commercial UAS operators can register online after March 31, 2016. Registration aims to identify unsafe operators and prevent flights into restricted airspace. The technology known as \"geo-fencing\" uses geospatial databases to prevent unauthorized flights into restricted airspace. Operators must ensure data is current before launch, and the UAS will override inputs if flown into a prohibited area. Major manufacturers are incorporating this technology into new systems or offering retrofits for existing UAS. There is interest in Congress to make geo-fencing mandatory for consumer UAS and to retrofit existing UAS with this technology. Efforts are also being made to use video analytics and other detection technologies to warn of drone intrusions into restricted airspace for regulatory enforcement. UAS pose security threats as they can be used for espionage, surveillance, smuggling drugs, and potentially carrying out terrorist attacks. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) could be used for terrorist attacks by delivering explosives, chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons. Even small UAS could disperse lethal agents or cause panic with hoax attacks. Firearms or other weapons could also be mounted on UAS. These attack scenarios, though seemingly far-fetched, are technically feasible with existing technology and have been considered in terrorist plots. In 2012, a terrorist plot to attack the Pentagon and the Capitol with model aircraft filled with explosives was foiled. Rezwan Ferdaus, sentenced for the plot, sought to acquire explosives, assault rifles, and grenades for the attack. Other security incidents involving drones have raised concerns, including unauthorized flights near political figures and landmarks. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) face security threats such as potential attacks from terrorists or cybercriminals seeking to hack or jam control signals. Experts recommend UAS to have spoof-resistant navigation systems and not rely solely on GPS signals. The TSA has not formally addressed security concerns from UAS operations in domestic airspace. The persisting security threats of UAS in domestic airspace have led to an increased interest in technology solutions to detect and potentially disable unauthorized UAS activity. Various systems have been developed, including one that detects radio transmissions between an unmanned aircraft and its operator and others that use precision radar to distinguish small UAS from birds. Some technologies also have the capability to destroy, disable, jam, or take over control of an unmanned aircraft to mitigate safety risks and security threats. These systems are being considered for deployment near security-sensitive locations. The integration of UAS into the national airspace system faces technological challenges such as detecting and avoiding air traffic, mitigating risks to people and property on the ground, preventing unauthorized airspace use, securing radiofrequency spectrum, and addressing human factors. Research is ongoing to inform FAA decision-making on UAS operation and regulation. The development of \"sense-and-avoid\" capabilities for UAS operations in the national airspace is crucial for detecting and maneuvering around other aircraft. While these technologies are essential for beyond-line-of-sight operations, they may also be useful for visual-line-of-sight operations. The FAA, in collaboration with NASA and aerospace companies, has conducted demonstrations of prototype sense-and-avoid systems. However, there is a lack of mature detect-and-avoid technology to prevent collisions, as highlighted by the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General. The FAA, in collaboration with NASA and aerospace companies, has conducted demonstrations of prototype sense-and-avoid systems. However, there is a lack of mature detect-and-avoid technology to prevent collisions. The FAA required six test sites to conduct research on integrating UAS into the national airspace system. Test sites must share data with the FAA to help develop regulations, but do not receive funding. The FAA has designated six test site operators to conduct research on UAS integration into the national airspace system. Each operator must adhere to safety standards and privacy policies for UAS operations and data collection. Additionally, a center of excellence for UAS research, education, and training has been established by a consortium of 15 universities led by Mississippi State. The FAA has designated six test site operators to conduct research on UAS integration into the national airspace system. Mississippi State University leads a consortium of 15 universities focusing on UAS research topics such as detect and avoid technologies, safety of low-altitude operations, control and communications, and human factors considerations. The university has also created the Alliance for System Safety of UAS through Research Excellence (ASSURE) for additional research projects involving over 300 UAS. Section 332 of FMRA required FAA to establish permanent areas in the Arctic for small unmanned aircraft operations for research and commercial purposes. The FAA established permanent areas in the Arctic for small unmanned aircraft operations for research and commercial purposes. FAA issued restricted category type certificates to two UAS models for arctic exploration and aerial surveys. This marked the first time unmanned aircraft were certified for commercial purposes. FAA also launched Project Pathfinder to address more advanced UAS operations. Project Pathfinder was established by the FAA to address advanced UAS operations, including research on UAS detection near airports. NASA is also conducting extensive research on UAS integration in areas such as separation assurance and airworthiness certification. NASA is researching an air traffic management system for low-altitude airspace and small UAS operations called UAS traffic management (UTM). The system would be semi-autonomous, with limited human involvement for routine functions. Prototype technologies for safe spacing between UAS over populated areas are expected by 2018. NASA is developing a UAS traffic management system for low-altitude airspace and small UAS operations. Prototype technologies for safe spacing between UAS over populated areas will be completed by 2018, with plans to transition the technology to the FAA for further testing and development in 2019. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress, such as the Responsible Skies Act and the Safe Skies for Unmanned Aircraft Act, aim to regulate unmanned aircraft operation in domestic airspace. The Commercial UAS Modernization Act (S. 1314) proposes an interim rule for small commercial UAS until the FAA finalizes its small UAS rulemaking. The act includes requirements for aircraft registration, operator knowledge testing, and certification. It limits operations to visual line of sight, below 500 feet, and away from towered airport controlled airspace without prior permission. The bill grants the FAA enforcement authorities and mandates reporting of accidents. It also establishes a deputy associate administrator for unmanned aircraft within the FAA to oversee UAS integration into the national airspace system. The bill addresses unmanned aircraft spectrum issues, barriers to operating beyond line of sight, payload carriage, and automated UAS. It directs FAA to expedite exemptions for certain operations, establish a data analysis program, implement an air traffic management pilot program, and test small UAS management at low altitude. Other bills focus on privacy and security concerns of domestic UAS operations. Many anticipate congressional deliberations on a new comprehensive FAA reauthorization measure during the second session of the 114th Congress, focusing on safety, security, and privacy issues regarding domestic UAS operations and integration."
