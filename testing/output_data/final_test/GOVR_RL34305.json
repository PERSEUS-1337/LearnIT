Factors contributing to this trend include affluent baby boomers returning to riding and rising fuel costs. Crash data analysis reveals a rise in motorcycle fatalities compared to other motor vehicles. The report analyzes the increasing share of motorcycle fatalities in the US, examining risk characteristics and fatal crash data. It also discusses federal efforts to reduce motorcycle fatalities and the effectiveness of universal helmet laws. Motorcycle fatalities have more than doubled in the past decade, partly due to a significant growth in the number of motorcyclists. The number of registered motorcycles in the US has tripled in the past decade, with an increase of over 2 million (63%). However, the rate of fatal motorcycle crashes and rider fatalities has almost doubled (116% and 115% respectively) compared to the increase in registered motorcycles. In contrast, passenger vehicle crashes and fatalities have declined (2% and 3% respectively) despite an increase in registered vehicles. Motorcycles represented less than 3% of all passenger vehicles registered in 2006, but motorcyclist fatalities accounted for 14% of all fatalities in passenger vehicles. Factors contributing to the higher rate of fatal motorcycle crashes include the characteristics of motorcycles. Motorcycles are riskier than passenger vehicles due to their characteristics and the operator population. They are less stable in braking and maneuvering, offer little protection in crashes, and are less noticed by other motorists. Motorcyclists have minimal protection with only a helmet and protective clothing. Additionally, 90% of motorcycle operators are male compared to 50% female passenger vehicle drivers. The rate of motorcycle involvement in fatal crashes is several times higher than that of passenger vehicles. In 2005, there were 4,489 fatal motorcycle crashes resulting in 4,553 deaths. Over half of motorcyclist deaths occur on weekends and about half on rural roads. Forty-five percent of motorcyclists killed were not wearing helmets, and speeding was a contributing factor in 37% of fatalities. In 25% of crashes, the motorcyclist did not have a valid license or motorcycle endorsement. Additionally, 27% of motorcyclists killed were legally intoxicated. In 2005, 27% of motorcyclists killed in crashes were legally intoxicated with a BAC of 0.08 or higher. 41% of the 1,878 motorcyclists who died in single-vehicle crashes were intoxicated. In two-vehicle crashes, 74% involved the motorcycle striking the other vehicle, often due to left turns. Changing trends in fatal motorcycle crashes from 1995 to 2004 can be observed. From 1995 to 2004, trends in fatal motorcycle crashes showed improvements in various areas. The percentage of motorcycle operators in fatal crashes who had been drinking decreased, as did the percentage of those legally impaired. The share of crashes involving speeding also declined. However, the number of fatal crashes involving alcohol, speeding, and unlicensed drivers increased. Helmet use rates remained relatively stable. Additionally, motorcyclists involved in fatal crashes were getting older and riding more powerful motorcycles. The average age of motorcyclists in fatal crashes increased from 32 to 38 between 1995 and 2004, with a rise in the share of those aged 40 or older from 25% to almost 50%. The average engine displacement of motorcycles involved in fatal crashes also increased from 841 cc to 1,015 cc during the same period. Congress has tasked the DOT with reducing traffic deaths, with a focus on motorcycle fatalities as the nation's greatest highway traffic safety challenge. In the most recent surface transportation legislation, Congress included provisions for motorcycle safety, such as funding for crash causation studies and a safety grant program. Understanding crash causes is crucial for effective prevention strategies. Detailed information on non-fatal crashes is needed to establish the significance of factors observed in fatal crashes. A large-scale motorcycle crash causation study is needed to understand the factors contributing to fatal crashes. The last study was conducted almost thirty years ago, and significant changes have occurred since then. Funding has been authorized for a new study to be conducted jointly by FHWA and the Oklahoma Transportation Center. NHTSA is also conducting a pilot study, with the final report expected in February 2008. The final report from NHTSA's pilot study is expected in February 2008, while the final report of the larger crash causation study is expected in August 2010. Section 2010 of SAFETEA establishes a motorcycle safety grant program with specific criteria for states to be eligible for a grant. States must maintain their level of spending on motorcycle safety after receiving a grant. The motorcycle safety grant program authorized $6 million annually, with $7 million in FY2009. Forty-four states and Puerto Rico received grants in FY2006. A Motorcyclist Advisory Council was appointed to advise on infrastructure issues, and an action plan was released in October 2007 to reduce motorcycle fatalities. Key initiatives include a crash causation study, national standards for training programs, guidance for safer roads, and a training program for law enforcement officials. In 2000, the DOT published the National Agenda for Motorcycle Safety (NAMS), a plan developed in collaboration with the Motorcycle Safety Foundation. NAMS includes 82 recommendations to improve motorcycle safety, categorized as Urgent, Essential, and Necessary. Key recommendations include conducting comprehensive studies on motorcycle safety, discouraging impaired motorcycling, promoting the use of DOT-compliant helmets, and enhancing education efforts. Efforts to increase use of DOT-compliant helmets and educate motorists about motorcyclists are emphasized in the NAMS implementation guide. The NTSB commended NAMS but highlighted the lack of tracking, evaluation, and effectiveness measures for recommendations. They recommended NHTSA create a guide similar to their highway safety measures guide to assess NAMS recommendations. The NTSB has started examining motorcycle accidents and made recommendations for safety improvements, including universal helmet laws, prioritizing NAMS recommendations, and developing guidelines for collecting accurate data. The focus is on reducing crashes through rider training and educating motorists. The NTSB has recommended safety improvements for motorcycle accidents, including universal helmet laws and prioritizing NAMS recommendations. Strategies to reduce crashes and make them less deadly include rider training, educating motorists, and improving road design and motorcycle stability. Some options are of uncertain value, but a universal helmet law is seen as proven, relatively inexpensive, and quickly implementable. Motorcycle helmets are crucial for protecting riders from head injuries in crashes. They comply with federal safety standards by providing a hard outer shell to prevent penetrating injuries and absorb impact with crushable interior padding. The NHTSA has proven helmets to be effective in reducing injuries and recommends universal helmet laws as a low-cost safety measure for all motorcyclists. The NHTSA recommends universal helmet laws for motorcyclists as helmets significantly reduce the risk of death and brain injury in crashes. Older riders are more vulnerable to brain injuries, making helmets even more crucial as the rider population ages. Additionally, wearing helmets has a substantial economic impact by reducing crash costs for injured motorcyclists. Studies show that motorcyclists wearing helmets have significantly lower crash costs compared to unhelmeted riders. Helmeted riders had an average cost of $71,000, while unhelmeted riders had an average cost of $302,000 due to more severe head injuries. Motorcycle helmet laws have a benefit-cost ratio of nearly 4 to 1, saving $1.3 billion in medical expenses in 2002. Opponents argue that helmet laws limit freedom, but proponents emphasize the economic and safety benefits of wearing helmets. Proponents argue that not wearing a helmet can result in high medical costs, with studies showing that many motorcycle crash victims rely on public funding for their treatment. Only 58% of motorcyclists wore a DOT-compliant helmet in 2007. In 2007, 58% of motorcyclists wore DOT-compliant helmets, up from 51% in 2006 but down from 71% in 2000. The DOT Secretary, a motorcyclist herself, advocates for manufacturers to offer free or discounted helmets with new motorcycle purchases to promote helmet use as standard safety gear. However, the decline in helmet usage nationwide is not due to lack of availability, and offering free helmets may not reverse the trend. States with universal helmet laws have higher helmet use rates (97% vs 50% in other states in 2007). In the United States, some states have universal helmet laws, while others only require certain motorcyclists, usually minors, to wear helmets. Three states have no motorcycle helmet law. Congress has had varying stances on universal helmet laws, including passing legislation in 1966 to withhold highway funding from states without such laws. The motorcycle fatality rate decreased significantly after states adopted helmet laws, but in 1976, Congress repealed the penalty for not having a universal helmet law. In 1979, 27 states repealed mandatory helmet laws, leading to a rise in the nation's motorcycle fatality rate. Congress authorized grants for states with universal helmet laws in 1991, but the provision was repealed in 1995. Opposition to universal helmet laws persists despite acknowledgment of helmets' safety value. The Motorcycle Riders Association supports helmet use for minors but opposes laws mandating helmet use for adults, arguing that adults should make their own safety decisions. Some groups, like the Motorcycle Riders Foundation and ABATE chapters, question the safety benefits of helmets, citing concerns about restricted vision and hearing, as well as increased risk of neck injury. In 1991, the General Accounting Office reviewed studies on motorcycle helmet use and found no evidence to support opponents' claims that helmets impair vision, hearing, or cause neck injuries. Subsequent studies continue to support these findings, showing that helmets save lives, reduce injuries, and save billions in medical costs and lost wages. Proponents of universal helmet laws include NHTSA and various transportation safety and medical groups. Universal helmet laws are supported by NHTSA and various safety, medical, and insurance groups. They argue that helmets save lives and reduce injuries in motorcycle crashes. Opponents of these laws argue for personal choice but proponents highlight the burdens imposed on others and the ineffectiveness of voluntary helmet promotion. Universal helmet laws are seen as easier to enforce and result in higher helmet usage rates. Proponents of universal helmet laws argue that motorcyclists have medical insurance similar to the general population, and the medical burden from motorcycle crashes is insignificant. They believe preventing crashes through education and crackdowns on illegal behavior is the best way to reduce fatalities. They also emphasize the need to balance personal freedoms with protecting individuals from preventable injuries and fatalities. Congress has mandated laws to protect adults in transportation safety, such as seat belt requirements and sounding locomotive horns at grade crossings. These measures aim to save lives and reduce collision rates, even if they impose burdens on individuals. The Department of Transportation (DOT) defends regulations to protect individuals from severe consequences of their actions, even if it burdens society. A survey by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) shows 81% support for universal helmet laws, even among motorcyclists. Opponents suggest motorcyclist training courses as an alternative to reduce motorcycle fatalities, which is widely supported. The NAMS report emphasizes the importance of motorcyclist training courses for safety. The Motorcycle Riders Foundation supports improved education for motorcyclists to reduce fatality rates. However, the long-term safety benefits of training programs are not definitively proven. California's training program showed a lower crash rate for novice riders in the first six months post-training, but the benefit diminished over time and was not significant for experienced riders. Training programs can enhance riders' bike-handling and traffic skills, but may not affect their risk-taking behavior. The effectiveness of rider education programs is not evaluated, and it is unclear if they are teaching essential survival skills for traffic."
