Congressional findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that the current method of collecting Federal estate tax burdens American family-owned businesses, farms, and ranches, leading to job losses and economic dislocation. Despite generating only a small percentage of total IRS collections, the estate tax has a significant negative impact on the nation's family-owned businesses. The estate tax, generating less than 1/2 percent of total IRS collections, has a significant negative impact on family-owned businesses. A study found that the costs of complying with the estate tax equal its revenue yield for the U.S. Treasury. Many wealthy Americans lock up capital in trusts to avoid tax liability, hindering economic growth. In 2009, only half of estate tax filers owed any tax, showing widespread tax avoidance. In 2012, 9,400 Americans still had to file estate tax returns, despite the higher $5 million threshold. It is proposed to modify the mechanism for collecting revenues from individuals with large estates in a revenue-neutral manner. This aims to ensure ongoing collection of an appropriate percentage of historical average estate tax receipts. SEC. 3. ELECTIVE SIMPLIFIED ESTATE TAX. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to add a new subchapter for Simplified Estate Tax, including sections on imposition, rate, election, and a seven-year minimum. SEC. 2301 of the Simplified Estate Tax subchapter eliminates chapter 11 for estate transfers and chapter 13 for generation-skipping transfers for individuals who elect its application. A tax imposed by SEC. 2302 applies to the individual and spouse for the election year and subsequent years. SEC. 2302 imposes a tax of 1 percent of the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year. Modified adjusted gross income includes adjusted gross income plus certain exclusions and tax-exempt interest. SEC. 2303 states that the election for this subchapter is irrevocable, except in specific circumstances determined by the Secretary. If married couples elect this subchapter, they must file a joint return. SEC. 2304 sets a minimum of seven taxable years. In cases where a decedent's last taxable year is not at least the 7th year for which the tax under section 2302 is imposed, the application of this subchapter is considered not elected. For decedents who first elected this subchapter in 2015 or 2016, a transition rule allows the executor to increase the tax amount for the decedent's last taxable year by a specified calculation. The tax amount for a decedent's last taxable year can be increased by a specified calculation if they first elected this subchapter in 2015 or 2016. The Secretary will provide a credit against the tax for a decedent under chapter 11 to offset taxes paid under section 2302, including interest. These amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2014. SEC. 1022. TREATMENT OF PROPERTY ACQUIRED FROM A DECEDENT WHO ELECTED SIMPLIFIED ESTATE TAX TREATMENT. Property acquired from a decedent who elected the application of subchapter D of chapter 11 is treated as transferred by gift. The basis of the person acquiring the property is the lesser of the decedent's adjusted basis or the fair market value at the date of death. Property acquired from the decedent includes bequests, devises, inheritances, or transfers to a qualified revocable trust during the decedent's lifetime. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 2014, including property passing from the decedent to a qualified revocable trust or any other trust where the decedent reserved the right to make changes. SEC. 5. SIMPLIFIED ESTATE TAX RETURNS. This section introduces a new simplified estate tax return process. The executor of an estate with a subchapter D election must provide recipient details, property description, adjusted basis, fair market value, holding period, and potential ordinary income. Section 1022 applies to property acquired from a decedent for tax purposes. For tax purposes, individuals acquiring property from a decedent must provide written statements to recipients within 30 days of filing the required return. Additionally, annual beneficiary asset status returns are necessary for property recipients. Individuals who own property subject to reporting requirements must provide a return with accurate descriptions, disposition details, and adjusted basis. Exceptions apply to property with a fair market value under $10,000 at the decedent's death or with basis determined by fair market value. The fair market value of property at the decedent's death determines reporting requirements. For calendar years after 2015, the $10,000 threshold is adjusted for inflation based on the cost-of-living adjustment. The fair market value of property at the decedent's death determines reporting requirements. For calendar years after 2015, the $10,000 threshold is adjusted for inflation based on the cost-of-living adjustment. The threshold amount shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $100. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart C of part II of subchapter A of chapter 61 of the Code. Section 6018A introduces simplified estate tax returns, with a deadline of 180 days after the decedent's death. Penalty for failure to file returns is outlined in Part 1 of subchapter B of chapter 68. Section 6018A introduces simplified estate tax returns with a 180-day deadline after the decedent's death. Part 1 of subchapter B of chapter 68 of the Code is amended to include this new section. \"SEC. 6720D. FAILURE TO FILE INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO SIMPLIFIED ESTATE TAX RETURNS.\" Failure to file required information under section 6018A(a) results in a $10,000 penalty. Failure to furnish information to beneficiaries under section 6018A(c) incurs a $250 penalty. Failure to provide annual information under section 6018A(d) leads to a $5,000 penalty, with a reasonable cause exception. No penalty under subsections (a), (b), or (c) if failure is due to reasonable cause. Penalty of 5% of fair market value for intentional disregard of requirements under section 6018A. Deficiency procedures not applicable for penalties imposed in this section. The text chunk states the amendment of the table of sections for part 1 of subchapter B of chapter 68 of the Code by adding a new item. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 2014. Any revesting of title to property in a trust by the grantor in 2015 or 2016 in connection with an election for subchapter D of chapter 11 is not subject to tax under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."
