    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Boating Occupancy and Teaching Safety Act\" or the \"BOATS Act\". Definitions are provided in the Act. The \"Boating Occupancy and Teaching Safety Act\" or the \"BOATS Act\" defines key terms such as \"flying bridge\" as an open deck above the main navigating bridge, \"passenger\" as any individual aboard a vessel, and \"recreational vessel\" as a vessel primarily used for pleasure between 20 and 45 feet in length, excluding vessels subject to Coast Guard inspection. The BOATS Act defines key terms and excludes vessels subject to Coast Guard inspection if constructed before January 1, 2016 and engaged in commercial use or carrying paying passengers. SEC. 3. CAPACITY LIMITS FOR RECREATIONAL VESSELS. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must establish standards for determining maximum passenger capacity for recreational vessels, require manufacturers to post this capacity on vessels, and ensure operators inform passengers about weight balancing to prevent capsizing. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must establish penalties for non-compliance with displaying maximum passenger capacity and weight balancing information on recreational vessels. The requirements of this section apply to recreational vessels manufactured after 180 days from the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. STATE RECREATIONAL BOATING SAFETY PROGRAMS. The amendment to Section 13103 of title 46, United States Code, allows States to contract with local governments or private entities for boating safety education services under the State recreational boating safety program. Each fiscal year, a State must spend at least 5 percent of Federal funds received under the recreational boating safety program on contracts for education services that consider geographic diversity, types of vessels, and waterways in the State. To be eligible for a contract under the recreational boating safety program, a local government or private entity must submit a detailed proposal for boating safety education services and certify that they will not profit financially from providing the services. Before the date of enactment of this subsection, a local government or private entity that provided boating safety education services under state standards is exempt from certain requirements. Additionally, 501(c)(3) organizations exempt from taxation can certify that profits will be used for relevant purposes. The Secretary will establish criteria for boating safety education services provided by local governments and private entities. States must outline requirements for education services based on the criteria. Local governments can contract with private entities for assistance in providing these services. The Boating Occupancy and Teaching Safety Act allows local governments or private entities to use funds from contracts to advertise boating safety education services. States must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing contracted governments and entities."
