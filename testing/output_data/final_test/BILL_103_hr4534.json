    "content": "SECTION 1. SIMPLIFIED METHOD FOR COMPLYING WITH PENSION REQUIREMENTS. This section introduces a new simplified method for complying with pension requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. An employer is entitled to benefits if they maintain qualified simplified defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Benefits include an increase in permitted compensation to $200,000 and modification of funding rules. The qualified simplified defined benefit plan has modifications to funding rules, waiver of quarterly contribution requirements, and waiver of certain discrimination rules under sections 401(a)(17)(B) and 412(m). The qualified simplified defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan have various requirements deemed satisfied, including sections 401(a)(4), 401(a)(26), 401(l), 410(a)(b), 411(b), and 416. A qualified simplified defined contribution plan must meet specific criteria, including eligibility for all employees, a minimum employer contribution of 3 percent of compensation, a nonforfeitable right to accrued benefits, and a specified balance for each employee. Under the qualified simplified defined contribution plan, distributions can only be made upon separation from service, death, or disability. Distributions must be in the form of an annuity, trustee-to-trustee transfer, or a pension distribution. The qualified simplified defined benefit plan allows all employees to participate, with exclusions possible until completing 6 months of service. Accrued benefits from employer contributions must provide an annual retirement benefit. The annual retirement benefit is determined by the plan's qualified accrual rate multiplied by years of service and average compensation. The qualified accrual rate must exceed 0.5 percent. The accrual rate for a retirement plan must exceed 0.5 percent, with a possible difference of 1 percentage point for compensation above covered compensation. Years of service are used to calculate benefits. The annual retirement benefit is determined based on years of service and is payable as a single life annuity starting at normal retirement age. A participant's testing period is the period with the highest aggregate compensation, lasting between 3 to 5 years. The annual retirement benefit is based on years of service and is payable as a single life annuity starting at normal retirement age. Employees who have not completed 6 months of service, work less than 17\\1/2\\ hours per week, work less than 6 months a year, or are under 21 can be excluded from the calculation of benefits. Employees can be excluded from the defined benefit plan if they are under 21, work less than 17\\1/2\\ hours per week, work less than 6 months a year, or have not completed 6 months of service. Additionally, employees covered by another defined benefit plan maintained by the employer before the enactment of this section can also be excluded. Employees covered by another defined benefit plan can be excluded from the current plan if accruals cease and the employees are covered by a different plan. The annual retirement benefit calculation must use the employee's average compensation for the testing period. The text discusses rules for aggregating employees under a single employer for retirement plans and integration with social security benefits. SEC. 417A. Simplified method for complying with pension requirements. The Secretaries of Labor and Treasury will conduct a study on establishing a pension portability clearinghouse for rollovers and contributions. The study will also explore participant-directed accounts with investment options. A report with recommendations will be submitted to Congress within a year."
