    "content": "In 1998, Al Qaeda conducted its first U.S.-documented terrorist attacks, killing 224 people in bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Subsequent attacks in East Africa included the first known American suicide bomber in Somalia in 2008. In 2010, 76 people were killed in bombings in Uganda, claimed by Al Shabaab, a group with ties to Al Qaeda. Al Shabaab has threatened attacks in Uganda, Burundi, and other countries in East Africa. Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab threats in Africa mirror each other. Osama Bin Laden called for Jihad in Somalia. U.S. State Department warns of Al Qaeda presence in the region. Al Shabaab recruitment in the U.S. raises concerns. East African countries face terrorist threats. U.S. counterterrorism policy is crucial. The U.S. counterterrorism policy focuses on transnational AQ operatives and local extremist groups like Al Shabaab in East Africa. Various programs are implemented to counter the terrorist threat in the region as part of the \"Global War on Terror.\" Debate continues on the effectiveness of these efforts. The report discusses the evolving threat posed by groups like Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab in East Africa. It outlines regional and bilateral programs aimed at countering violent extremism, including security assistance and efforts to address root causes. Congress may consider oversight questions regarding the focus and scope of U.S. counterterrorism programs in the region, the seriousness of the threat to U.S. interests, and resource allocation against the threat. The U.S. faces challenges in allocating resources to counter terrorist threats in East Africa and other regions. Questions arise about the drivers of violent extremism in East Africa, the effectiveness of counterterrorism programs, interagency coordination, and public perception of U.S. efforts. Efforts to counter violent extremism in East Africa are being evaluated for their effectiveness and impact on disrupting terrorist threats. The focus is on assessing the balance between military and law enforcement interventions, as well as the effectiveness of partner nations in reducing the terrorist threat posed by Al Qaeda and its affiliates. Additionally, there is a need to improve counterterrorism programs and incorporate initiatives to reach out to non-violent Islamists. In November 2001, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Africa emphasized the importance of addressing terrorism in Africa. Former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice highlighted Africa as a vulnerable target for global terrorism. Congress has maintained a focus on terrorist threats, particularly on the capabilities of AQ affiliates. Congress has focused on the evolving threat of Al Qaeda and its global network, with attention on Al Shabaab's activities and recruitment efforts in the United States. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee warned of potential threats from Yemen and Somalia, highlighting political instability and terrorist activities in Somalia. Members have expressed concern about the humanitarian crisis and security situation in the region. The Senate Africa Subcommittee expressed concern about the lack of a comprehensive strategy for Somalia, introducing S.Res. 573 to address the country's crises. Several bills were introduced post-2010 Kampala bombings, including H.Con.Res. 303, H.Res. 1538, and H.Res. 1596 condemning terrorism and child soldier recruitment by Al Shabaab. Additionally, H.Res. 1708 called for Eritrea to be designated. The legislation H.Res. 1708, introduced in September 2010, calls for Eritrea to be designated a state sponsor of terrorism for alleged ties to Al Shabaab. Congress has explored U.S. response to terrorist threats in East Africa through hearings and oversight activities. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concern in H.R. 5136 about the Department of Defense's lack of focus on messaging programs to counter violent extremism. The committee recommended increased funding for counterterrorism efforts, including programs like \"Section 1208\" and \"Section 1206\" to counter terrorism in East Africa. Concerns were raised about the long-term risks of providing military assistance to countries with poor human rights records. The 111th Congress has focused on U.S. military and security assistance efforts in East Africa, particularly on activities of U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) and its sub-regional presence in Djibouti. Congress has requested reports on counterterrorism activities in the region and continues oversight of security assistance to counterterrorism partners. Al Qaeda and affiliated groups have had a presence in East Africa for almost 20 years. Al Qaeda and other violent extremist groups have had a presence in East Africa for almost 20 years, taking advantage of porous borders, weak law enforcement, and state complicity in terrorist activities. Some countries in the region have served as safe havens or transit points for terrorists. The United States has enhanced security measures in the region and engaged with partners to strengthen counterterrorism capabilities. Sudan became a safe haven for Islamic extremist groups in the early 1990s with government support. Osama bin Laden utilized Sudan for terrorist activities. Osama bin Laden used Sudan as a base for terrorist activities from 1992 to 1996, supporting jihad efforts worldwide. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for arming and training Somali factions responsible for killing U.S. soldiers in Mogadishu in 1993. Bin Laden's grievances against the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia and American culture are well-documented. Sudan's refusal to hand over individuals linked to an AQ plot led to U.N. sanctions in 1996. In April 1996, the Council imposed sanctions on Sudan for harboring terrorists. Al Ittihad Al Islamiya (AIAI), a militant Islamist group in Somalia, aimed to establish a Salafist emirate. Somali fighters returning from Afghanistan in the late 1990s helped establish AIAI training facilities. Some former AIAI commanders later formed Al Shabaab. AIAI faced internal divisions and military pressure, relocating operations to Luuq near the Kenyan and Ethiopian borders. Al Ittihad also had a presence in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia. Al Ittihad had a presence in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia and received training and support from Al Qaeda. They were implicated in attacks in Ethiopia in 1995, leading to military retaliation and defeat in 1996-1997. Some former leaders continued political efforts through sharia courts and maintained ties with Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda considered Somalia as a potential base of operations, with training bases established in Ras Kamboni and other Somali sites. Al Qaeda viewed Somalia as a transshipment point for operations in the region, particularly Kenya. Planning for a terrorist attack in East Africa began in 1993, with a cell established in Nairobi. The U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed in 1998, leading to the apprehension of key members. Fazul, a wanted terrorist, was involved in money laundering through \"blood diamonds\" and planned attacks in Mogadishu. In 2002, he orchestrated a failed missile attack on an Israeli airliner in Kenya, followed by a truck bomb at a hotel that killed 15 people. Several suspects were apprehended by Kenyan police. Fazul, a wanted terrorist, orchestrated a failed missile attack on an Israeli airliner in Kenya in 2002, followed by a truck bomb at a hotel that killed 15 people. Kenyan police apprehended several suspects, but Fazul and co-conspirator Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, considered top AQ leaders in East Africa, remained at-large. Fazul later became a senior leader in Somalia's Union of Islamic Courts, while Nabhan trained militants. Fazul is now believed to be the top AQ leader in Somalia after Nabhan's death. In the 1990s, local Islamic courts emerged in Somalia, providing law and order in parts of the country with diverse ideological approaches. Al Shabaab, a militia loosely affiliated with the courts, also played a role. Al Shabaab, a militia affiliated with the courts, emerged in 2003-2004 under former AIAI commanders from Afghanistan. Their vision aimed to unite Somali-inhabited areas under an Islamist caliphate, opposing the political transition proposed by the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of Somalia. The TFG faced opposition from clan, militia, and Islamist leaders, struggling to establish itself in Mogadishu and moving to Baidoa. Tensions rose between the Union of Islamic Courts and a group in Mogadishu. In mid-2006, the Union of Islamic Courts took control of Mogadishu and surrounding areas, expanding their influence in southern and central Somalia. Al Shabaab's power within the UIC increased during this time. Efforts to mediate between the UIC and the Transitional Federal Government failed, leading to a declaration of jihad against Ethiopia by UIC hardliners. In response, the Ethiopian military advanced on Mogadishu in December 2006, defeating the UIC militias within weeks. The United States supported this action due to concerns about the UIC's alleged ties to Al Qaeda. The United States conducted air strikes in early January 2007 against suspected AQ operatives reportedly fighting alongside UIC militia in Somalia. An increasingly complex insurgency emerged, fueled by historic anti-Ethiopian sentiment and a lack of TFG capacity to secure territory without Ethiopian military support. Intense fighting between Somali insurgents and TFG and allied Ethiopian forces forced over 700,000 people from the city, with widespread human rights abuses reported. Some moderate UIC leaders began talks with the TFG. Al Shabaab, a hybrid group of locally focused Islamist insurgents and transnational terrorists affiliated with Al Qaeda, is led by Ahmed Abdi Godane. The group's leadership, structure, and membership are varied, with some suggesting a more centralized control by hardliners and foreign operatives. Reports indicate Al Shabaab as a coalition of jihadists, business interests, and clan militias. Al Shabaab, led by Ahmed Abdi Godane, is a group with significant influence from foreign operatives, including known AQ operatives like Harun Fazul. The group has thousands of fighters, including several hundred foreign fighters from various countries. Some of its top leaders and fighters have trained abroad with terrorist groups, receiving support from Al Qaeda and other foreign entities. Reports suggest support from Iran, Syria, Libya, and Eritrea. Al Shabaab receives support from Iran, Syria, Libya, and Eritrea, as well as from Somali diaspora communities in Dubai and Nairobi. The group generates revenue through controlling infrastructure and imposing taxes in Somalia. They use extremist tactics, including harsh punishments and targeted violence, such as kidnappings and assassinations. Al Shabaab also employs IEDs and suicide bombers. Al Shabaab's use of IEDs and suicide bombers in Somalia is sophisticated, resembling AQ operations. They claimed responsibility for multiple suicide bombings in 2007 and ranked fourth globally in fatalities from terrorist attacks in 2008. U.S. officials consider Al Shabaab to be one of the most deadly extremist groups. Al Shabaab, a deadly extremist group, utilizes various tactics including conventional military tactics, guerilla-style attacks, and weapons like automatic guns, grenades, and missiles. They have been reported to possess chemical bomb-making capability and have used surface-to-air missiles to shoot down aircraft. Al Shabaab receives weapons from Yemeni arms networks through the port of Kismayo and other southern ports. They control territory in southern and central Somalia, as well as parts of Mogadishu. The group uses radio and the internet for propaganda and recruitment, and maintains an official website with videos and statements. Al Shabaab utilizes the internet, including a website with videos in Somali, Arabic, and English, to reach a global audience. They also use Internet chatrooms for contributions and control local FM radio stations in areas under their control. The group exploits alleged abuses by TFG and Ethiopian forces, civilian casualties from airstrikes, and pledges allegiance to Al Qaeda for fundraising and recruitment purposes. In August 2008, Al Shabaab's top leader acknowledged ties to Al Qaeda and threatened attacks against U.S. and Western targets outside Somalia. Despite initial doubts from U.S. officials, further expressions of allegiance followed, culminating in a video greeting to Osama Bin Laden in September 2009. In September 2009, Al Shabaab released a video greeting Osama Bin Laden, showing a reciprocal relationship with Al Qaeda. U.S. officials are concerned about increasing collaboration between Al Shabaab and AQAP in Yemen, as well as recruitment and fundraising in the United States. The recruitment of U.S. citizens by foreign terrorist groups, particularly among the Somali diaspora, has raised concerns among U.S. law enforcement. Al Shabaab's recruitment from the American Muslim community is also worrisome. The FBI notes a significant number of individuals leaving the U.S. for Somalia compared to other conflict zones. U.S. counterterrorism officials warn of a growing and diverse threat from AQ affiliates and sympathizers. Linkages between Al Shabaab, Al Qaeda, and AQAP, along with increased influence of hardliners within Al Shabaab, pose a renewed threat. The 2010 Kampala bombings, attributed to Al Shabaab, have led to a renewed focus on radicalization in East Africa. Uganda has charged over 30 individuals in connection with the attacks, including nationals from various East African countries. The involvement of non-Somali East African nationals in the bombings suggests the presence of violent extremist organizations in the region. The bombings in East Africa by Al Shabaab have raised concerns about violent extremist organizations recruiting in the region, impacting U.S. policies. The threat posed by Al Qaeda and its affiliates in Africa is a growing concern for the U.S. government, with official assessments varying over time. The State Department has consistently classified the terrorist threat in East Africa as the most serious on the continent. The U.S. government's concerns about terrorist threats in East Africa have evolved over time. In 2008, Director of National Intelligence John McConnell noted Al Qaeda's presence in Somalia but praised Ethiopian and U.S. efforts in countering them. In 2009, Dennis Blair highlighted the increasing capabilities of terrorist groups in East Africa, with potential redeployment of Al Qaeda in Iraq veterans to Yemen and East Africa. There were concerns about some operatives redirecting their focus to the U.S. homeland. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism highlighted the threat posed by Al-Shabaab and al-Qa'ida in Somalia, emphasizing the region's instability and permissive environment for terrorist activities. The attempted bombing of a U.S. airliner in 2009 by a Nigerian national trained in Yemen underscored the ongoing threat posed by terrorist groups in the region. The head of British intelligence has expressed concerns about Somalia and Yemen being breeding grounds for terrorism, with suspected AQ plots targeting Britain originating in these countries. Interpol's Secretary General also highlighted the issue of Somali militants training in Afghanistan and Pakistan. U.S. counterterrorism doctrine now focuses on combating terrorism as a preferred tactic for extremists worldwide. The U.S. government's response to terrorism has evolved from law enforcement to a broader strategy to deny violent extremist networks resources. The U.S. government's counterterrorism strategy aims to deny resources to violent extremist networks. This includes direct military operations to capture or eliminate Al Qaeda leaders. The approach has shifted from law enforcement to a broader strategy under the Obama Administration. The United States has conducted military strikes against Al Qaeda targets in Somalia since 2007, including air and naval strikes targeting suspected operatives and training camps. Several senior leaders, including Aden Hashi Ayro and Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, have been killed in these operations. The United States conducted a commando raid in southern Somalia, killing Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a senior leader of Al Shabaab. President Obama emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach beyond military tactics in counterterrorism efforts. U.S. counterterrorism policy aims to shape environments where terrorists operate, as outlined in the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism. The 2006 NSCT outlined priorities to prevent terrorist attacks, deny WMD to rogue states, deny terrorists support from rogue states, and deny terrorists safe havens. President Obama's strategy aimed to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat Al Qaeda, emphasizing partnerships with Muslim communities and counter-radicalization efforts. The Obama Administration's counter-radicalization policy in East Africa focuses on addressing specific factors that may lead to radicalization in communities. U.S. development assistance in the region includes programs targeting at-risk communities to counter ideological support for terrorism. Counter-extremism programs in East Africa target at-risk communities to counter support for terrorism. USAID emphasizes the importance of understanding country-specific contexts for designing effective programs. Root causes of violent extremism vary between countries, requiring tailored approaches. USAID uses regional and country-specific studies to develop counter-extremism programs in Africa. In East Africa, violent extremism is influenced by various socioeconomic, political, and cultural factors. While poverty and unemployment may not directly lead to extremism, they can exacerbate underlying issues that extremist groups exploit. The rhetoric of these groups focuses on identity and existential threats rather than economic conditions. USAID emphasizes the need for tailored counter-extremism programs based on country-specific contexts. The paths toward radicalization among Muslim communities in East Africa vary, with common themes emerging such as the use of a \"victimization narrative\" by groups like Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab to recruit and gain support. Kenya's Muslim population, concentrated in specific regions, faces social, cultural, political, and economic exclusion, with poor social service delivery and infrastructure investments compared to other parts of the country. Middle East-based Islamic charities previously provided essential services before government closures. The closure of social services, including education and health care, by the government in response to the 1998 embassy bombings and the September 2001 World Trade Center attacks, along with factors like boredom and lack of job opportunities, may make Muslim youth more susceptible to recruitment by groups like Al Shabaab. Economic deprivation and the state's inability to provide security can also contribute to recruitment into violent extremist groups. Al Shabaab attracts recruits by offering salaries, rations, and medical care, as well as assistance to fighters' families. The group provides public order and security in areas under its control but has made little effort to govern, leaving local authorities to provide basic services. Reports suggest forced recruitment of men into service. East African Muslims are increasingly exposed to extremist ideologies, with Al Shabaab forcibly recruiting men. The group's narrative of fighting against America and its Christian allies resonates among some, who see anti-terrorism efforts as a Western conspiracy. Muslim communities in Uganda and Kenya have raised concerns about government actions that target them under the guise of counterterrorism. The deportation of radical Muslim clerics and scholars from Kenya has sparked protests, with some individuals showing support for extremist groups like Al Shabaab. Political repression, human rights violations, and perceptions of government corruption in East Africa may contribute to grievances that fuel support for violent extremism. According to the USAID Guide, governments engaging in human rights violations can push individuals into terrorist groups, even indirectly. The United States' perceived role as an \"enabler\" of such actions complicates counter-extremism efforts in East Africa. U.S. interventions aim to reduce drivers of violent extremism and improve local attitudes towards the U.S. and domestic authorities, fostering peace and stability. The U.S. government aims to reduce drivers of violent extremism in East Africa through programs targeting at-risk Muslim youth, minorities, and marginalized populations. USAID emphasizes community involvement in project identification and implementation to address potential mistrust. Outreach to the Somali diaspora is increasing, and deliberate communication efforts are used to influence foreign populations in support of U.S. policies and interests. The U.S. government uses deliberate communication efforts to counter violent extremist organizations and influence foreign populations in support of U.S. policies and interests, targeting key influencers and vulnerable populations. The Obama Administration emphasizes broader engagement with Muslims worldwide, including in Africa, to communicate respect for Islam and indigenous customs. The Obama Administration's approach to engaging with Muslims globally, including in Africa, focuses on countering violent extremist ideology, particularly that of Al Qaeda. Efforts include creating a Global Engagement Directorate and establishing a Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications to coordinate outreach for national security purposes. The State Department engages foreign populations through multimedia and print materials, U.S. embassies, and the America.gov website. It provides information on American society, U.S. policies, and cultural features like \"A Multicultural Ramadan.\" American Corners in East Africa expand access to information on the United States outside capital cities. The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi operates an American Reference Center in addition to American Corners in Mombasa and Lamu. Outreach efforts include working with librarians from Kenya's madrassas and collaborating with other embassies in the region. The embassy's Public Affairs office focuses on Muslim and Somali issues, producing a Swahili publication distributed to key opinion leaders. The State Department sponsors exchange programs for African Muslim leaders and may deploy U.S. Special Operations Command Military Information Support Teams in some countries. U.S. Special Operations Command Military Information Support Teams (MIST) receive specialized training in language and culture. MIST teams operate in Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya to support U.S. embassies. AFRICOM's Operation Objective Voice (OOV) aims to counter extremist ideologies in West and North Africa. OOV programs are expanding into East Africa. In 2010, OOV programs expanded into East Africa, targeting areas prone to terror incidents, genocide, or failed states. The Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts in regional languages, including Swahili for East and Central Africa, and has a Somali service accused by Al Shabaab of using propaganda. The U.S. focuses on preventing terrorist financing in East Africa through programs and sanctions. President Bush signed E.O. 13224 to expand sanctions against terrorists. The Treasury Department freezes terrorist-related assets and designates over 500 individuals as terrorists. Entities implicated in terrorist activities in East Africa subject to U.S. sanctions include Al Qaeda, Al Shabaab, Al Ittihad, the Lord's Resistance Army, and the Al Haramain Foundation. These groups are designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and their associates are prohibited from entering the United States. AHF, a charity with branches in East Africa, including Somalia, was linked to Al Qaeda and Al Ittihad. Its Kenya branch was involved in planning the 1998 embassy bombings. AHF's Somalia office was connected to Al Barakaat Bank, a major source of support for Bin Laden and terrorist groups. Efforts to cut off terrorist financing have sometimes led to reduced funding for charitable causes in East Africa. President Obama declared a national emergency in 2010 to address the security threat from Somalia. In April 2010, a national emergency was declared by President Obama to address the security threat from Somalia, blocking assets of individuals involved in acts threatening peace, security, or stability. Some individuals were also targeted for U.N. sanctions under Resolution 1844. U.S. counterterrorism policy aims to isolate and punish foreign governments found to be supporting terrorism. The Clinton Administration placed sanctions on Sudan in 1993 for supporting terrorism, leading to the country being on the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. Sudan faces various restrictions, including a ban on arms exports and controls over dual-use items. The Treasury Department emphasizes the need for African states to enhance financial sector oversight to prevent terrorism financing. Many African banking systems are vulnerable to criminal activities due to limited resources for tracking funds and overseeing remittance systems. The Somali diaspora uses hawalas for remittances, but increased monitoring has made them less attractive for insurgent groups. New financing methods include breaking down large sums, using couriers, and converting funds into commodities. Al Shabaab raises funds through various means in Somalia, including ports and checkpoints. Al Shabaab raises funds in Somalia through ports, checkpoints, and commercial enterprises, such as the lucrative Kismayo port. The United States works with regional organizations like FATF and ESAAMLG to combat terrorist financing through the CTF program. The CTF program, in collaboration with various federal agencies, supports partner nations in developing legislation on terrorist financing and regulatory reforms. It also provides training on topics like cash courier interdiction and oversight of charitable activities. The program has helped establish financial intelligence units in several African countries and a Resident Legal Advisor in Nairobi assists in training prosecutors and providing expertise on terrorist financing. In Kenya, the RLA aided in drafting anti-money laundering legislation in 2009. The U.S. government has established mechanisms for detecting and seizing illicit proceeds, including the creation of a Financial Reporting Center and an Asset Recovery Agency. They maintain watchlists like the Terrorist Screening Database and the No Fly List, which have received increased attention from Congress after a failed terrorist attack in 2009. The State Department assists foreign governments in improving their watchlisting capabilities through the Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP), providing countries with a system for identifying suspects after a terrorist attack. This program includes providing partner nations with a computer system called PISCES to facilitate immigration. The TIP program, including the PISCES system, has added biometric enhancements to aid in immigration processing and exchange information on suspected terrorists. Kenya, along with Iraq, Pakistan, and Yemen, is a high priority partner in the program, with Djibouti, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda also participating. The U.S. government emphasizes the importance of developing professional security forces that respect the rule of law and human rights in Africa. Strengthening partner governments' security institutions is seen as crucial for peace and security in the region. The U.S. government emphasizes the importance of strengthening partner governments' security institutions to defeat terrorist groups. The East Africa Counterterrorism Initiative (EACTI) was created in 2003 to enhance counterterrorism capabilities in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, focusing on police, judicial, coastal, and border security. EACTI received over $100 million in funding in its first two years. In FY2003 and FY2004, EACTI received over $100 million in funding, with half allocated to border and coastal security. The State Department replaced EACTI with the East African Regional Strategic Initiative (EARSI) in FY2009, aiming to enhance regional counterterrorism efforts in partner countries like Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, and others. Military programs, including naval cooperation, continue under EARSI. Assistance provided under EACTI and EARSI includes training and equipment for border security in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Djibouti, as well as strengthening immigration and border controls in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Efforts also include migration management training, PISCES systems installation at air and seaports, and airport security training and equipment. Under EACTI and EARSI, aid has been provided for airport security training and equipment, coastal security initiatives in Djibouti, Kenya, and Eritrea, police training, and counter-terrorism financing support. This includes maritime training, equipment for navies and coastal patrols, police training, and technical assistance for drafting CTF and money laundering legislation. EACTI funding supported the development of financial intelligence units in partner countries and provided assistance for national counterterrorism coordination cells. Kenya received significant support for joint terrorism task forces. EACTI DA funds also supported education initiatives in disadvantaged Muslim communities. The EARSI program received $5 million in PKO funds in its first year to train counterterrorism units in Kenya and Djibouti. The State Department requested $10 million annually in FY2010 and FY2011 for EARSI. Unlike EACTI, EARSI has its own budget line item and focuses on training and equipping counterterrorism units. The State Department is leading an effort to develop a strategy for counterterrorism in East Africa and systematize the EARSI program. Congress allocated $24.7 million for EARSI in FY2010 through various accounts. USAID allocated $5.5 million for programs in Kenya and Somalia in FY2009, with an expansion in FY2010. Approximately $27.5 million was allocated for EARSI in FY2010. In FY2010, $27.5 million was allocated for EARSI, supporting partner nations' capacities in maritime, border security, and air operations. AFRICOM nominates projects for PKO funding, which are reviewed internally and funded by the State Department. EARSI programs have been implemented by AFRICOM, its components, and CJTF-HOA, with ongoing support from regional ATA funding. Additionally, EARSI provides funding through NADR's RSI account for border patrol training, airport screening equipment, and media and community relations training. In FY2010, EARSI programs in East Africa focused on border patrol training, airport screening equipment, and media and community relations training for police officials. The Safe Skies for Africa program, funded by the State Department, provides technical assistance on airport security, aviation safety, and accident investigation in Djibouti, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. A resident aviation security advisor in Nairobi offers direct advice to East African countries. In Nairobi, Kenya, a security advisor provides advice to East African countries on aviation standards and threats. Only Ethiopia meets international aviation standards for direct flights to the United States. Direct flights between the US and Kenya were cancelled in 2009 due to security concerns. The State Department's Africa Coastal/Border Security program aims to enhance partner nations' border monitoring and defense capabilities. The program, funded with approximately $4 million annually in regional FMF resources, focuses on multilateral engagement, technical surveys, training, and equipment for regional crises. A new regional program, Africa Conflict Stabilization and Border Security (ACSBS), was introduced in FY2009 with a $5.6 million request for FY2011. In 2002, U.S. Central Command developed a joint task force to combat transnational terrorist groups in the Horn region, aligning with the 2002 National Security Strategy's directive. Under the 2002 National Security Strategy, a joint task force was created to combat terrorist threats in the Horn region. The mission evolved towards security cooperation and conflict prevention under AFRICOM's command. CJTF-HOA focuses on countering violent extremism with 1,500 to 2,500 personnel in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Seychelles, Somalia, and Sudan. The CJTF-HOA operates in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Seychelles, Somalia, and Sudan, with additional forward operating locations in Kenya and Uganda. They train security forces, collect intelligence, conduct civil affairs projects, support humanitarian efforts, and provide military assistance and training for peacekeeping operations in Africa. CJTF-HOA supports AMISOM in coordination with ACOTA, contributing to partner capability to respond to terrorist threats and secure their territory. They also conduct humanitarian missions, including airlifting supplies to Ethiopia and Northern Kenya, and deploying weather sensors to predict severe weather. Additionally, they work with NGOs to provide medical supplies to Ugandan forces for assistance in Mogadishu. CJTF-HOA conducts civil-military operations in East Africa, including projects like building schools and providing medical services to influence perceptions about the U.S. military and its partners. The U.S. military and its local partners conduct civil affairs efforts in East Africa to establish relationships, gather information, and address socioeconomic factors to reduce regional instability. Some question if these programs should be led by civilian agencies or NGOs instead of the military. Unlike in Iraq or Afghanistan, CJTF-HOA projects are carried out in a non-kinetic environment. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on CJTF-HOA in 2010, finding that the task force was not assessing the long-term impact of its civil affairs projects. Despite a focus on civil affairs, reports suggest these projects lack continuity and may not effectively counter terrorism or improve stability. CJTF-HOA's civil affairs projects in Kenya have brought positive attention to the U.S. military, but their impact on radicalization is unclear. GAO questions long-term funding for the task force, which operates separately from other AFRICOM activities. A DOD-directed review is underway to determine CJTF-HOA's future role in countering violent extremism. The commander of AFRICOM emphasizes the importance of CJTF-HOA's efforts in countering violent extremism in Djibouti due to the regional threat from Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab. There is a debate on whether the task force should focus solely on counterterrorism or broaden its security cooperation mandate. Congress and DOD are scrutinizing the task force's mandate, structure, and resources. CJTF-HOA follows a \"whole-of-government\" approach but faces challenges due to short deployments that limit cultural understanding and relationship-building in the region. The task force established a Socio-Cultural Research and Advisory Team (SCRAT) to promote cultural understanding among CJTF-HOA personnel. In March 2010, the AU Mission in Somalia emphasized the importance of countering Al Qaeda in Somalia. Al Shabaab threatened revenge against Uganda and Burundi for alleged civilian killings by their forces. The conflict in Somalia was described by East African Heads of State as not just among Somalis but between Somalia and international terror groups. After bombings in Kampala, concerns arose about AU troop contributors withdrawing forces, but Ugandan President Museveni reaffirmed commitment to AMISOM. President Obama also supported AMISOM, warning of the consequences if Al Shabaab gains more control in Somalia. The United States has provided logistics support, equipment, and training for AMISOM in Somalia since 2007, totaling $230 million. Training is provided through various programs, and equipment and logistical support are given by the State Department. The UN authorized a logistics support package for AMISOM in 2009. The United States has provided logistics support, equipment, and training for AMISOM in Somalia since 2007, totaling $230 million. ACOTA has trained over 8,400 Ugandan troops and all eight Burundian battalions for AMISOM deployment. Training focuses on high-end U.N. Chapter Seven Peace Enforcement with counterinsurgency training. AMISOM contributors have received training on military operations, counter-IED techniques, obstacle identification, force protection, combat convoy training, medical procedures, and counter-insurgency tactics. Troop contributors requested cultural awareness and basic language training. AMISOM faces constraints due to troop and equipment shortages, including mobility and force protection assets. Reports suggest a need for improved medical, intelligence, and special forces capabilities. Despite troop pledges, many African countries lack equipment or political will to participate. Additional 2,000 soldiers were added to AMISOM's deployment after the 2010 Kampala bombings. The African Union has called for an increase in AMISOM's troop strength to 20,000 soldiers, citing insufficient international support. The United Nations provides financial assistance to troop contributors through a trust fund, but resources are reported to be insufficient. The U.N. Special Representative on Somalia highlighted donor-imposed restrictions on expenditures for AMISOM's military component, leading to funding challenges for troop allowances. The African Union has requested an increase in AMISOM's troop strength to 20,000 soldiers due to insufficient international support. Funding for troop allowances is currently provided by the European Union, with calls for a more predictable payment system. The U.N. Secretary-General has expressed concern over civilian injuries from mortar attacks and artillery shelling in Somalia, particularly child casualties caused by indiscriminate return fire from TFG and AMISOM troops. Al Shabaab has incorporated these allegations into its narrative. AMISOM officials have expressed regret for civilian casualties in Mogadishu but deny indiscriminate shelling. ACOTA has included mortar training in the curriculum. AMISOM addresses the humanitarian crisis by providing free healthcare, safe drinking water, and education programs. The U.S. government provides counterterrorism assistance to foreign countries through bilateral initiatives coordinated by the State Department. Programs include security and justice sector capacity building to deny terrorists transit, financing, or sanctuary. Some programs are detailed in the State Department's annual Congressional Budget Justification for Foreign Operations. The U.S. government does not provide security assistance to Eritrea and Sudan for counterterrorism efforts due to legislative restrictions. After 9/11, the State Department focused on providing Anti-terrorism Assistance (ATA) to frontline nations in the war on terrorism, including Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya. ATA assistance to Africa has increased significantly, with Kenya being one of the largest recipients globally. Assistance in Kenya aims to enhance interagency collaboration, prosecutorial capabilities, and maritime interdiction. The State Department requests a significant portion of its ATA assistance for Africa from Congress regionally, rather than bilaterally, focusing on improving prosecutorial capabilities and maritime interdiction near the Somali border. In FY2011, bilateral allocations were requested for Kenya and South Africa, while $14 million was requested regionally for dispersal based on needs. East African countries received $7.6 million in regional funding in FY2010 through EARSI, with additional funds for FBI training in Uganda. Regional initiatives included bringing police from heavily ethnic Somali precincts in the United States together with counterparts in Kenya, Djibouti, Somalia, and South Africa for sharing best practices and cultural tips. The State Department requests funding for Counterterrorism Financing, Export Control, and Border Security Assistance bilaterally and regionally. Department of Defense's primary counterterrorism capacity building program, Section 1206, prioritizes programs throughout the fiscal year. Kenya, Ethiopia, and Djibouti are involved in these efforts. The State Department prioritizes Section 1206 funding for counterterrorism programs in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Djibouti. AFRICOM also provides counterterrorism assistance through the CTFP program to East African countries. East African security officials benefit from various training courses offered by AFRICOM. Additionally, the State Department and USAID conduct bilateral programs to support counterterrorism goals. The State Department and USAID conduct bilateral programs in East Africa to support counterterrorism goals, including building law enforcement capabilities, police training, youth programs, and education projects to delegitimize terrorism. Good governance programs also aim to create a less hospitable environment for terrorist groups like Al Shabaab. Efforts to broaden political dialogue and empower local authorities in Somalia, along with programs to improve government effectiveness, may increase the perceived legitimacy of the TFG and reduce support for insurgent groups like Al Shabaab. Assistance addressing non-terrorism concerns such as health, education, and basic crime could also undermine the narrative of violent extremist groups. Strategic guidance for U.S. counterterrorism efforts in East Africa is provided by multiple government agencies, but the existence of a comprehensive interagency plan for countering the threat regionally is unclear. The U.S. has organized counterterrorism efforts through bilateral country teams, leading to potential loopholes for terrorists. While aid to East African countries like Kenya has been robust, regional planning is limited. The Pan-Sahel Initiative (PSI) and East Africa Counterterrorism Initiative (EACTI) aimed to enhance security capabilities in the Sahel and East Africa regions. There is an opportunity for cooperation between partner nations to address the shared threat posed by Al Shabaab. The Pan-Sahel Initiative (PSI) was transformed into the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) in 2005, integrating counterterrorism and military training with development assistance to counter violent extremism in the region. The State Department's East Africa Counterterrorism Initiative (EACTI) evolved into the East Africa Regional Security Initiative (EARSI), which lacks interagency coordination compared to TSCTP. TSCTP is supported by Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Trans-Sahara (OEF-TS) coordinated by AFRICOM's Joint Special Operations Task Force \u2013 Trans-Sahara (JSOTF-TS). The State Department is working to systematize the interagency components of EARSI in East Africa, which has not received comparable funding to TSCTP. TSCTP began receiving funding in FY2007 through its own budget line item, while EARSI's PKO allocation is half that of TSCTP. Congress has allocated roughly $20 million annually to TSCTP for PKO funds. The State Department is working to systematize the interagency components of EARSI in East Africa, which has not received comparable funding to TSCTP. Concerns have been raised over human rights abuses in East African governments receiving U.S. counterterrorism assistance, with reports of unlawful killings, torture, and excessive force in countries like Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, and Uganda. Human rights concerns have been raised regarding security forces in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, and Uganda, with allegations of excessive force, corruption, and abuses. Some governments in East Africa are accused of condoning abuses by anti-terrorism security forces or violating citizen rights under the pretext of countering terrorism. For example, Uganda's Joint Anti-Terrorism Task Force (JATT) and Kenya's Anti-Terror Police Unit (ATPU) have faced allegations of torture and arbitrary arrests, respectively. Muslim groups in Kenya have accused the government of using anti-terrorism measures against them. Muslim groups in predominantly Christian Kenya have accused the government of using anti-terrorism measures to persecute them, citing concerns with the deportation of Muslim scholars and allegations of harassment, extortion, and theft by the ATPU. Human rights groups have also raised concerns over Kenya's alleged practice of \"extraordinary renditions\" and the extradition of suspects to Uganda for trial. Congress has implemented measures, like the \"Leahy Amendment,\" to prevent U.S. security assistance from being provided to foreign security forces involved in human rights abuses. The \"Leahy Amendment\" restricts security assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act and Arms Export Control Act. Congress has introduced other provisions limiting assistance to foreign forces in East Africa with human rights violations. Appropriations bills often restrict security assistance to countries of concern, such as Somalia being prohibited from receiving IMET in the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Ethiopia's FMF funds require State Department approval to ensure assistance doesn't go to individuals with poor records. The State Department ensures that assistance does not go to individuals or units with rights violations. The Leahy Amendment requires vetting of security assistance trainees. Concerns have been raised about the department's resources for proper vetting. There is ongoing debate on U.S.-Somalia policy. The U.S.-Somalia policy debate revolves around humanitarian and national security concerns, including terrorism and piracy. The State Department advocates for a more aggressive international response to address Somalia's status as a collapsed state, regional problem, and international threat. Members of Congress are also involved in the discussions. The U.S.-Somalia policy debate focuses on humanitarian and national security concerns, including terrorism and piracy. Members of Congress and the Obama Administration have called for a more robust international response. In September 2010, the Senate passed S.Res. 573 urging the President to develop a comprehensive policy for Somalia. The State Department announced a \"dual-track\" policy supporting the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and engaging with Somaliland, Puntland, and anti-Al Shabaab groups in southern and central Somalia. This approach aims to counter extremism and radicalism in the region. The United States supports Somaliland and Puntland as a bulwark against extremism from the south. There is no U.S. embassy in Somalia since 1991, with interests represented by the U.S. ambassador to Kenya. Staffing on Somalia issues in Nairobi has increased since 2006. Some in Congress have called for a special envoy for Somalia. A policy review on security sector assistance programs in East Africa is ongoing. Security assistance programs in East Africa have increased due to terrorism concerns. Maintaining recipients' capabilities to counter terrorist threats is challenging due to limited resources. The U.S. and other donors should be cautious of creating incentives for partner nations to tolerate low levels of terrorist activity. Some suggest conditioning security assistance on a partner country's counterterrorism efforts rather than just the presence of a threat. Security assistance programs in East Africa face challenges due to limited resources and complex authorities. There is debate within Congress and the Administration on the appropriate authorities and capabilities of the Departments of State and Defense in combating irregular threats. The House Armed Services Committee views DOD's Section 1206 authority as distinct from traditional foreign aid-related assistance. AFRICOM considers Section 1206 crucial for addressing U.S. national security needs. AFRICOM views Section 1206 as vital for addressing U.S. national security needs in Africa, with Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya being significant recipients of the assistance. Concerns have been raised about the sustainability of capabilities developed under the program, as it lacks multi-year planning and funding authorities, hindering collaborative relationships with foreign partners. Measuring the success of counterterrorism and counter-extremist programs can be challenging, as some metrics may not capture the effectiveness of efforts or potential intelligence failures until another attack occurs. Media reports and official statements may highlight tactical achievements but may overlook missed opportunities or mistakes made. The U.S. government measures the success of capacity building programs through the number of participants trained, but this may not reflect the trainees' ability to apply their new skills effectively. Implementation of new laws for counterterrorism may be hindered by corruption or weak enforcement capabilities. Security sector capacity programs are assessed based on readiness, equipment, leadership, and adherence to human rights standards. Coalition-building programs also aim for measurable outcomes. The U.S. government evaluates capacity building programs based on the number of participants trained, but this may not reflect their effectiveness. Implementation of counterterrorism laws can be hindered by corruption or weak enforcement. Coalition-building programs aim for measurable outcomes, such as increased regional intelligence sharing and joint operations. Terrorist groups in East Africa have failed to achieve their objectives due to various factors, including moderate religious beliefs and pressure from security forces. U.S. efforts to strengthen Somali intelligence services have led to successes in disrupting terrorist operations and capturing AQ operatives. Some U.S. counter-terrorism programs have helped capture AQ operatives in Somalia, but they may also alienate local populations and contribute to support for violent extremism in the long term. Public opinion surveys may not accurately reflect the impact of these programs, and practitioners are working on evaluating their effectiveness. The geographic diversity of the terrorist threat from Al Qaeda and its affiliates poses challenges for containment and marginalization efforts. The terrorist threat posed by Al Qaeda and its affiliates presents a complex challenge for U.S. and allied policymakers. They must allocate resources to prevent various types of attacks, ranging from sophisticated to small-scale, while considering threats from different regions like Afghanistan, Yemen, and East Africa. Prioritizing terrorist concerns against other threats to stability, such as civil war in Sudan and instability in the Great Lakes region, requires careful consideration. The curr_chunk discusses the level of U.S. effort needed to counter violent extremist groups like Al Shabaab in East Africa. It questions the effectiveness of current counterterrorism efforts and the ability to respond to terrorist threats. It also raises concerns about the alignment of U.S. security priorities with allies in the region. The profiles below outline U.S. counterterrorism priorities in East African countries, describing efforts to counter terrorism and radicalization. Program funding information shows U.S. government spending on related programs. Tables present funding levels for State Department objectives and counterterrorism assistance. The first table includes funding information for counterterrorism programs, but may not capture all regional or global funding allocated by the department. The second table shows funding for U.S. counterterrorism and related assistance programs to countries in the region, including bilateral, regional, and global funding from the State Department and USAID. Regional funding is budgeted by the State Department, and country funding levels are typically reported after the fiscal year ends. The State Department provides funding for counterterrorism programs through NADR sub-accounts, which may not be reflected in bilateral NADR funding figures. The assistance aims to enhance partner readiness and capacity to counter various security threats, including terrorism. Djibouti, as a strategic U.S. partner in a volatile region, hosts the only U.S. military base in Africa and supports efforts against terrorism. Djibouti hosts a French military presence, serves as a base for counter-piracy operations, and is a regional logistics hub. It faces regional threats like instability in Somalia and Yemen, a border dispute with Eritrea, and maritime piracy. Aid aims to maintain safety and stability in the region. Djibouti cooperates with U.S. counterterrorist efforts. Djibouti has amended its laws to comply with international conventions on terrorism, allowing for extradition and legal assistance in terrorism investigations. The United States has provided assistance to improve Djibouti's ability to process travel documents at its ports to restrict terrorist movement. Security cooperation efforts include border and coastal security, counterterrorism initiatives, and military professionalization. Djibouti has received significant security assistance from the U.S. to secure its borders. The United States has provided almost $28 million in assistance to Djibouti to secure its land and maritime borders against terrorist threats. This assistance includes maritime domain awareness training, equipment such as navigation radar and night vision goggles, and border security equipment. U.S. Naval staff have provided coastal security training, and the U.S. has supported the construction of facilities for the Djiboutian Navy. In July 2009, the U.S. and Djiboutian Navies established a harbor security force to protect vessels transiting through Djibouti's port. Djiboutian security officials have participated in counterterrorism events and received seaport security training. The State Department is providing funds to train and equip Djibouti's counterterrorism force. Djibouti's ability to control its borders is crucial for countering terrorism in the Horn of Africa. The United States provides security assistance to Djibouti through funding for various security forces, including the National Gendarmerie and the Republican National Guard. Efforts focus on enhancing border monitoring, internal security, and maritime response capabilities. Djibouti also receives support for police professionalization and counterterrorism efforts, as well as improvements in port and airport security. The country is a key partner in the Coast Guard's International Port Security initiative. The United States provides security assistance to Djibouti for various security forces, border monitoring, internal security, and maritime response capabilities. Djibouti's human development indicators are low, with high unemployment and poor human rights record. U.S. aid aims to address governance, education, and health issues to ensure internal stability. Education programs focus on skills development for youth and increasing girls' school enrollment. Some believe addressing socioeconomic challenges may reduce social and political frustrations that could lead to radicalization. USAID works within a constrained budget to support these efforts. USAID has realigned its civil affairs program in Djibouti to address maternal and child health needs by building or rehabilitating health clinics. The impact on countering radicalization is unknown, but USAID suggests that targeted efforts have supported the government's goal of providing healthcare access to 100% of the country. Ethiopia is viewed as a key ally in the region due to its strong military presence and active role in counterterrorism. The country hosts the African Union headquarters and a significant number of refugees from Somalia, Eritrea, and Sudan. Ethiopia hosts over 50,000 Somali refugees and faces ethnic insurgencies and terrorist bombings in Addis Ababa. The country has a history of involvement in Somalia, with ongoing irredentism threats. Ethiopian intervention in Somalia in 2006 led to military engagement, and there are reports of continued support to armed factions. Ethiopia's main concern is its relationship with Eritrea, accusing them of supporting Ethiopian rebels. The United States prioritizes promoting regional stability in its relations with Ethiopia due to its volatile relationship with Eritrea. Ethiopia accuses Eritrea of supporting rebel groups and militants, while Eritrea accuses Ethiopia of supporting opposition groups. The State Department Office of the Inspector General notes a lack of policy guidance in the relationship, with the U.S. Embassy having incentives but no leverage to influence Ethiopia's political direction. Ethiopia has cooperated in shutting down terrorist funding but remains vulnerable to money laundering. The Treasury Department provided technical assistance for Ethiopia's anti-money laundering legislation in 2009. Ethiopia's military, the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF), has received significant U.S. security assistance to counter insurgencies, improve regional security, and deter terrorism. The country is also a major contributor to U.N. peacekeeping operations and has received support through the ACOTA program.

The State Department and USAID support conflict management programs in Ethiopia. Kenya, a regional hub for trade and finance, has a long history of security cooperation with the United States. Kenya is increasingly active in regional security due to concerns over terrorist movement across its porous border with Somalia. Kenya is a regional hub for trade and finance and has a long history of security cooperation with the United States. Over 400,000 refugees, including 350,000 Somalis, live in crowded camps near Dadaab in eastern Kenya. There are concerns about clashes between Kenyan security forces and Al Shabaab fighters in Kenyan territory. Al Shabaab may try to conduct attacks in Kenya, but their reliance on Eastleigh as a hub may reduce the likelihood of an attack. The proliferation of small arms and light weapons in the region poses a significant threat, along with piracy off the coast of Kenya. Coastal Kenya is seen as the decisive arena in the fight against Al Qa'ida and associated movements in the Horn. Al Shabaab targets ethnic Somalis and African Muslims for recruitment, with many foreign fighters reportedly coming from the group. The Kenyan government faces opposition in passing anti-terrorism legislation and challenges in rendition of suspects to Uganda.

In Somalia, security challenges persist, with the TFG facing threats from Al Shabaab, insurgent groups, and clan-based militias. Limited government control in Mogadishu is secured by AMISOM, while Al Shabaab controls southern and central regions, including key port cities like Kismayo. Al Shabaab poses threats in Somalia, with ties to pirate gangs and targeting U.N. and aid agencies. Somaliland and Puntland maintain stability but face challenges from Al Shabaab. The U.S. and donors prioritize building Somali security forces to reduce violence in Mogadishu and support the TFG for long-term stability. The State Department initiated security sector reform efforts in Somalia in 2007, using PKO funds to finance training for TFG forces. The United States began providing operational support to TFG forces in Mogadishu in FY2009, including salaries, rations, spare parts, radios, and cash transfers for weapons and ammunition. US assistance also includes support for third-country training efforts and has spent over $30 million in support. The United States, along with other donors like the EU, supports training for TFG forces in Somalia. AMISOM also provides training and mentors for the Somali Police Force. Improved security measures and counter-IED procedures have led to a decline in casualties. A U.N. report highlighted this progress. The State Department collaborated with various entities to assess the Somali security sector in 2009. The absence of a U.S. diplomatic presence in Somalia poses monitoring challenges. The absence of a U.S. diplomatic presence in Somalia poses challenges in monitoring security assistance. Somali forces have morale issues due to lack of pay, clan favoritism, and cronyism. Concerns exist over possible defections or transfer of intelligence to insurgents. Various armed factions align with the TFG against Al Shabaab. U.S. assistance to Somali security forces has been controversial, with reported links to renditions of rebels and militants to Ethiopia. The State Department reports that Somali police have been ineffective, underpaid, and corrupt, with fewer allegations of abuses in 2009. Somalia received $25 million in Section 1207 assistance in FY2007 for security sector reform activities, including police reform, security and justice infrastructure rehabilitation, and youth employment programs. Regional assistance of $7.5 million aimed to enhance community-police coordination and establish neutral zones for cross-border security. Capacity building for Transitional Federal Institutions and security sector reform are key focuses of the regional program. Efforts to improve governance and stability in Somalia include capacity building for Transitional Federal Institutions, security sector reform, and peace and reconciliation programs in strategic border areas. Donor support for the government is seen as reinforcing poor performance, leading to conditions for radical Islamist insurgency.
