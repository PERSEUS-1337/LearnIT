The Social Security Act is amended to protect medical assistance for eligible juvenile inmates in public institutions, ensuring continuity of eligibility before adjudication or sentencing. This does not change the exclusion from medical assistance for inmates of public institutions under section 1905(a) of the Act. The amendments to the Social Security Act protect medical assistance for eligible juvenile inmates in public institutions, ensuring coverage before adjudication or sentencing. The effective date for these changes is 1 year after the enactment of the Act, with exceptions for states requiring legislation to meet the new requirements. The State plan is not considered to fail compliance with the requirements of the Social Security Act solely based on not meeting additional requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the first regular session of the State legislature following the enactment of the Act. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is treated as a separate regular session of the State legislature."
