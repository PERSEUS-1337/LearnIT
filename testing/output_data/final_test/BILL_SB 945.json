    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Chapter 11 of the Health and Safety Code in California introduces regulations for pet boarding facilities, defining terms like \"enrichment\" and \"permanent enclosure.\" The chapter applies to individuals and legal entities involved in pet care. The Health and Safety Code in California regulates pet boarding facilities, defining terms like \"pet,\" \"pet boarding facility,\" and \"pet boarding facility operator.\" A pet boarding facility is where four or more dogs, cats, or other pets are boarded for compensation, excluding horses. The Health and Safety Code in California regulates pet boarding facilities, defining terms like \"pet,\" \"pet boarding facility,\" and \"pet boarding facility operator.\" A pet boarding facility operator is responsible for maintaining a structurally sound facility, controlling pests, containing pets, and reporting escaped pets to the local animal control agency and owner. The regulations for pet boarding facilities include ensuring cleanliness of interior surfaces, proper lighting for inspection and cleaning, separate grooming areas, food storage away from enclosures, and isolation area for sick pets. Each enclosure must meet specific standards. Each pet enclosure must be structurally sound, comfortable, and sanitary. It should provide heating, cooling, lighting, ventilation, and protection from the elements. The enclosure must allow the pet to move freely and be constructed of easy-to-clean material. A pet boarding facility operator must comply with animal care requirements, including housing only one pet in an enclosure at a time unless consented to by the owner. Enclosures can be permanent or temporary, with specific guidelines for each. Temporary enclosures have time limits for use and require pets to be let out for waste elimination. To ensure proper care, a pet boarding facility must house only one pet per enclosure unless approved by the owner. Pets must be observed at least once every 24 hours for signs of illness or distress, with access to water and nutritious food provided regularly. Enrichment activities should also be given daily to maintain the pet's behavioral health. The pet boarding facility must provide daily enrichment for each pet to maintain their behavioral health. Written policies and procedures covering animal care, disease prevention, emergency care, and disaster planning must be in place and reviewed with employees. Pets with contagious conditions should be isolated, and sick or injured pets must receive immediate care and veterinary treatment. A pet boarding facility operator must notify the pet owner immediately if the pet is sick or injured, unless the owner has specified otherwise in writing. During natural disasters or emergencies, ensure humane care for each animal. The operator must provide written information on drop-off/pick-up times, staff availability, and enclosure size for the pet species being boarded. The pet boarding facility must adhere to general observation practices and a daily activity schedule for the boarded pets. Any deviations from these practices must be disclosed to the owner. The facility must have either a fire alarm system connected to a central reporting station or a fire suppression sprinkler system in place. An animal control officer, humane officer, or peace officer must issue a notice to correct violations in a pet boarding facility, specifying each violation, corrective actions, and a timeframe for correction. Compliance must be verified through a subsequent investigation. A notice to correct violations in a pet boarding facility must be delivered to the operator, either at the time of signing or within 48 hours. Compliance with the notice exempts the operator from further penalties. Multiple violations within five years result in escalating penalties, from an infraction to a misdemeanor. The pet boarding facility operator can be charged with a misdemeanor if harm or injury occurs to an animal. Violations of the chapter result in fines, with escalating penalties for repeat offenses. Other laws protecting animals and consumer rights still apply. The chapter does not limit any acts that violate laws protecting animals or consumer rights. Local governments can establish additional standards for pet boarding facilities. No reimbursement is required for implementing this act."
