    "content": "The Act titled \"Next Generation Hispanic-Serving Institutions Act\" establishes a program under Title V of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to promote postbaccalaureate opportunities for Hispanic Americans. This includes redesignating parts and sections within the Act to accommodate the new program. Congress finds that by 2050, one in four Americans will be of Hispanic origin. Despite this growth, Hispanics only accounted for a small percentage of advanced degrees and instructional faculty in the United States in 1999. Increasing the number of Hispanics pursuing postbaccalaureate studies is crucial for the future research and advanced study capacity in the country. Hispanic-serving institutions are leading in increasing Hispanics attaining graduate degrees. Between 1991 and 2000, the number of Hispanic students earning master's and doctor's degrees at these institutions grew significantly. Expanding postbaccalaureate educational opportunities for Hispanics is crucial for the future research capacity in the country. The goal is to expand postbaccalaureate educational opportunities for Hispanic students and improve their academic attainment. This includes enhancing program quality at institutions educating the majority of Hispanic college students and helping them complete postsecondary degrees. The Secretary will award competitive grants to Hispanic-serving institutions offering postbaccalaureate certifications or degrees. Eligible institutions must meet certain criteria and offer postbaccalaureate programs. Authorized activities aim to enhance educational opportunities for Hispanic students and improve their academic attainment. Grants awarded under this part can be used for various educational purposes such as purchasing equipment, improving facilities, buying educational materials, and supporting postbaccalaureate students in need. The grants awarded under this part can be used for scholarships, faculty support, facilities improvement for distance learning, collaboration with other institutions, and other activities that contribute to the program's purposes. The grants awarded under this part can be used for scholarships, faculty support, facilities improvement for distance learning, collaboration with other institutions, and other activities that contribute to the program's purposes. Approved by the Secretary as part of the review and acceptance of such application. \"SEC. 514. APPLICATION AND DURATION.\" The application for grants under this part must demonstrate how funds will improve postbaccalaureate education for Hispanic and low-income students, leading to greater financial independence.

Cooperative arrangements and authorization of appropriations are also addressed in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Education Act of 1965 is amended to authorize funds for parts A and B of the title for fiscal year 2008 and the following 4 years. $175,000,000 is authorized for part A and $125,000,000 for part B."
