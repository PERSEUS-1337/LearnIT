    "content": "The Act is titled the \"World War I American Veterans Centennial Commemorative Coin Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The Congress finds that in 2017, America marked the 100th Anniversary of entering World War I, with over 2 million soldiers serving overseas and more than 4 million men and women in uniform. The events of 1914-1918 had a lasting impact globally, with over 9 million soldiers losing their lives. The centennial provides an opportunity for Americans to honor their predecessors' commitment, including Frank Buckles, the last American veteran from the war. The last American veteran from World War I, Frank Buckles, passed away on February 27, 2011. Despite other wars being commemorated on US coins, there is currently no coin honoring World War I veterans. The purpose of this Act is to commemorate America's involvement in World War I and honor the over 4 million men and women who served. The Act authorizes the minting of $1 silver coins in commemoration of America's involvement in World War I. The coins will weigh 26.73 grams, have a diameter of 1.500 inches, and contain 90% silver and 10% copper. They will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The design of the coins minted under this Act will symbolize America's centennial involvement in World War I. Each coin will have a value designation, the year \"2017\" inscribed, and include words like \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary through a compensated design competition. The competition to design the coins minted under this Act will be judged by an expert jury chaired by the Secretary. The winning design will receive compensation of at least $5,000, and a plaster model must accompany the design for consideration. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a designated Mint facility during the calendar year starting on January 1, 2017. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. The coins will be sold by the Secretary at a price including face value, surcharge, and cost of designing. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will receive a reasonable discount. All sales of coins issued under this Act will include a $10 surcharge per coin, with the surcharges promptly paid to the World War I Memorial Foundation. The Comptroller General of the United States has the right to audit the Foundation's expenditures related to these surcharges. No surcharge may be included for any coin issuance that would exceed the annual limit of 2 commemorative coin programs. The Secretary may issue guidance for programs exceeding the annual commemorative coin program limit."
