    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Pediatric, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer Survivorship Research and Quality of Life Act of 2011\". It includes findings related to cancer survivorship. Congress finds that approximately 12,400 children and adolescents are diagnosed with cancer each year, with cure rates increasing to 78% for this age group by 2011. The population of childhood cancer survivors has grown significantly, with over 300,000 individuals as of 2007. However, up to two-thirds of survivors may experience late effects of treatment, including serious or life-threatening conditions such as neurocognitive, psychological, cardiopulmonary, endocrine, and musculoskeletal effects, as well as secondary malignancies. The late effects of cancer treatment for childhood cancer survivors may change over time, requiring routine monitoring and modified treatment. The Institute of Medicine emphasizes the need for an organized system of care for pediatric cancer survivors. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include pilot programs for pediatric cancer survivors to explore model systems of care. The Secretary may grant funds to eligible entities like medical schools, children's hospitals, and cancer centers to establish pilot programs for monitoring and caring for childhood cancer survivors. The entities must use the funds to develop, study, or evaluate model systems for this purpose. The curr_chunk focuses on designing protocols for follow-up care, developing multidisciplinary care models, training healthcare providers in culturally competent care, creating support programs for cancer survivors, and designing systems for transferring treatment information effectively. The curr_chunk focuses on the transfer of treatment information and care summaries between cancer care providers and other healthcare providers, dissemination of information to cancer survivors and their families, and initiatives promoting coordination between healthcare professionals. Funding for these initiatives is available for fiscal years 2013 through 2017. The Secretary may transfer funds from the Department of Health and Human Services to carry out this section. The section establishes a Workforce Development Collaborative on Medical and Psychosocial Care for Childhood Cancer Survivors. The Secretary may convene a Collaborative on Medical and Psychosocial Care for Pediatric Cancer Survivors, composed of educators, advocates, and health service providers. The Collaborative will submit a report to establish a plan for workforce development in medical and psychosocial care. The Collaborative on Medical and Psychosocial Care for Pediatric Cancer Survivors will focus on developing curricula, training faculty, enhancing accreditation standards, and evaluating patient navigator and peer support programs in pediatric cancer care. The Secretary may transfer funds for psychosocial care of pediatric cancer patients and survivors. A technical amendment changes a section in the Hematological Cancer Research Act. SEC. 4. GRANTS TO IMPROVE CARE FOR PEDIATRIC CANCER SURVIVORS. Section 417E of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include research on causes of health disparities in pediatric cancer survivorship, allowing grants for research on needs and outcomes of pediatric cancer survivors within minority or medically underserved populations. The Director of NIH shall make grants for research on pediatric cancer survivorship outcomes in minority or medically underserved populations, focusing on health disparities, barriers to follow-up care, and the impact of familial, socioeconomic, and environmental factors on treatment outcomes and survivorship. The Director of NIH will conduct or support research on follow-up care for pediatric cancer survivors, focusing on indicators for long-term patient tracking, risk factors for late effects of treatment, and predictors of neurocognitive and psychosocial outcomes. The Director of NIH will conduct research on follow-up care for pediatric cancer survivors, focusing on indicators for long-term patient tracking, risk factors for late effects of treatment, neurocognitive and psychosocial outcomes, initiatives to protect survivors, transitions in care, training of professionals, and different models of follow-up care."
