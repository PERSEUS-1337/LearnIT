    "content": "Over the past two years, Congress has shown significant interest in U.S. and international trade trends as part of examining U.S. trade policy and key trading relationships. Congress plays a crucial role in trade policy due to its authority over regulating commerce with foreign countries and oversight responsibility over the economy. Congress has delegated certain authorities to the President for negotiating trade agreements. Interest in bilateral trade flows has increased as the Trump Administration renegotiates existing free trade agreements and pursues new ones, aiming to reduce trade deficits and enforce trade laws for \"free,\" \"fair,\" and \"reciprocal\" trade. Total trade as a share of global GDP has increased from 25% in 1960 to 56% in 2017, leading to higher growth in productivity and reduced poverty. Annual real global trade growth used to outpace GDP growth, but this trend has slowed in recent years. Trade growth rebounded to 5.4% in 2017, driven by increased investment. Since 2011, U.S. world trade has steadily grown, with exports increasing by 48.5% and imports by 47.6% in nominal terms. Trade relative to GDP has risen significantly since 1960, with exports expanding from 5% to over 12% of GDP and imports from 4% to over 15% of GDP in 2017. China was the top U.S. trading partner in 2017, followed by Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The United States' top trading partners in 2017 were China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The European Union is the largest destination for U.S. exports and the largest source of U.S. imports. Most of U.S. global trade is with countries without free trade agreements. Trade with emerging market economies is increasing, posing both opportunities and challenges for U.S. international trade relations. The United States' trade relations are evolving, with a focus on shaping policy to reflect changing trade composition, enhancing competitiveness, and addressing issues with emerging economies. Congress is closely monitoring trade negotiations and agreements, including those with the Trump Administration. The economic position of the United States is a key factor in these discussions. The United States' trade relations are evolving, with a focus on shaping policy to reflect changing trade composition, enhancing competitiveness, and addressing issues with emerging economies. The agreements and negotiations raise important policy questions about U.S. interests, Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) obligations, and the relationship between bilateral/regional FTAs and the U.S. multilateral agenda at the WTO. Members of Congress weigh potential costs and benefits to constituents and the economy when considering new bilateral FTAs or debating U.S. trade policy. This report summarizes the main economic developments in U.S. trade activities with major partners in 2017. The report focuses on recent U.S. bilateral trade relations, presenting current data and statistics to inform policy discussions. It highlights the challenges in interpreting trade data due to global production chains and intrafirm trade. For a comprehensive overview of U.S. trade trends, refer to CRS Report R45420 by Andres B. Schwarzenberg. The report relies on data from various U.S. government agencies and international organizations to analyze U.S. trade trends. Global production chains and intrafirm trade complicate traditional accounting methods for trade data interpretation. The conventional trade data used in policy discussions may underestimate trade in services, as they do not measure on a value-added basis. Intermediate services in value chains include transportation, R&D, design, and business services. China's emergence as a global supply chain center is a notable example due to its low-cost labor pool. Many multinational corporations have shifted production to China due to its low-cost labor, resulting in products being assembled in China using imported components. The value added in China is often small compared to the total value of the finished product imported into the United States. Profits from sales, like iPhones and iPads, primarily benefit the multinational company that owns the brand, such as Apple Inc. Apple Inc. benefits the most from the profits generated by the sale of its products, with most of its high-wage functions and employment based in the United States. U.S. trade data often attribute the full value of imported products to China, leading to an inflated trade deficit figure. Studies suggest that measuring bilateral trade flows based on value added in each country before export could reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China by 25%. In 2017, U.S. merchandise exports increased by 6.62% to $1.6 trillion, while imports rose by 6.92% to $2.4 trillion, resulting in a $56.4 billion trade deficit. The EU, China, Canada, and Mexico were the top trading partners for the U.S. in terms of merchandise trade. China's share in U.S. merchandise trade grew significantly from 2000 to 2017. In 2017, the EU and Canada were the top markets for U.S. exports, while China was the leading source of U.S. imports. U.S. exports to top trading partners increased, with the largest increase to Canada and China. The largest increase in U.S. exports in 2017 was to South Korea (14.65%) and China (12.45%). U.S. merchandise imports from top trading partners also increased, with significant rises from China, Canada, and Mexico. The United States has 14 free trade agreements in force, covering 20 countries, but less than 39% of total U.S. merchandise trade is with FTA partners. U.S. two-way merchandise trade with FTA partners was $1.5 trillion in 2017. In 2017, trade between the United States and its 20 FTA partners was $1.5 trillion, accounting for 38.76% of total U.S. merchandise trade. U.S. exports to FTA partners increased to $720.3 billion, while imports were valued at $796.8 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $76.5 billion. NAFTA countries (Canada and Mexico) contributed the most to U.S. trade with FTA partners. In 2017, U.S. trade with FTA partners totaled $1.5 trillion, with NAFTA countries contributing significantly. U.S. exports to NAFTA countries increased by 5.8% to $525.6 billion, while imports rose by 7.33% to $613.6 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $88.0 billion. Trade with non-NAFTA FTA partners reached $378.0 billion, with exports increasing by 8.64% to $194.7 billion and imports by 3.81% to $183.3 billion, leading to a trade surplus of $11.5 billion. In 2017, U.S. imports under FTAs increased by 2.83% to $385.6 billion, accounting for nearly half of total imports from FTA partners. Imports from Chile saw the largest percentage increase at 26.59%, followed by Peru and Bahrain. Imports from NAFTA partners (Canada and Mexico) rose by 3.54%, while imports from Oman, Colombia, and South Korea declined. The United States has preference programs to promote economic growth in developing countries, offering preferential duty reduction or elimination for eligible imports. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is the broadest program, with additional programs like the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). Jordan had the highest ratio of imports under an FTA, followed by Oman, Bahrain, and Chile. CAFTA-DR countries also had a high ratio. Countries with the smallest shares of imports under an FTA include Singapore, Israel, and Panama. The value of U.S. imports under trade preference programs with developing countries increased by 18.43% from $29.3 billion in 2016 to $34.71 billion in 2017. This increase was largely due to a 32.39% increase in the value of U.S. imports under AGOA, CBI, CBTPA, NTPP, HOPE Act, HOPE II Act, and HELP Act. In 2017, U.S. imports under preference programs increased by 18.43% to $34.71 billion. The rise was driven by a 32.39% increase in AGOA imports and an 11.93% increase in GSP imports.
