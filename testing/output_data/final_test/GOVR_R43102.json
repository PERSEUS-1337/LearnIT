    "content": "In response to concerns about the U.S. government's inability to close or consolidate unneeded military facilities, Congress enacted statutory provisions in 1988 and 1990 to establish a process insulated from political considerations. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) Commission recommended closure and realignment of over 100 defense facilities in 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, and 2005. The Department of Defense requested authority for another round in 2015, but it was not authorized. Final BRAC recommendations automatically take effect unless Congress and the President disapprove them through legislation. The BRAC procedure includes \"fast track\" legislative procedures for Congress to consider and reject base closure recommendations within a 45-day period. If Congress does not act, the Secretary of Defense can implement the closures and realignments. The BRAC procedure includes \"fast track\" legislative procedures for Congress to consider and reject base closure recommendations within a 45-day period, governed by special expedited parliamentary procedures outlined in the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. These procedures exempt the joint resolution of disapproval from many time-consuming steps and obstacles that apply to most measures Congress considers. The BRAC procedure includes \"fast track\" legislative procedures for Congress to consider and reject base closure recommendations within a 45-day period. A joint resolution of disapproval must be introduced within 10 days of the President transmitting a certified BRAC report to Congress. This allows any Member in either chamber to introduce the resolution. The BRAC procedure allows for fast-track legislative procedures for Congress to consider and reject base closure recommendations within a 45-day period. A joint resolution of disapproval can be introduced by any Member in either chamber within 10 days of the President transmitting a certified BRAC report to Congress. The resolution is referred to the House or Senate Committee on Armed Services, and there is no limit to the number of resolutions that can be introduced. Multiple resolutions have been aimed at the same BRAC report in prior rounds. Provisions specify the text of the disapproval resolution to clarify eligible legislation for expedited procedures. The joint resolution of disapproval must not contain a preamble and is titled \"Joint resolution disapproving the recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.\" The BRAC procedure sets deadlines for Committees on Armed Services to act on a joint resolution of disapproval, expediting the process to prevent delays or blockages in committee. The resolution is referred to the committee, which cannot amend it and must report it within 20 days. The BRAC procedure requires the Armed Services Committee to report a joint resolution of disapproval within 20 days without amendments. If the committee fails to do so, the resolution is automatically placed on the House or Senate calendar for consideration. Only one resolution or substitute can be reported to prevent automatic discharge of others. After the committee reports or is discharged, any Member can move to proceed with the resolution in chamber. In the BRAC procedure, a Member can move in chamber to proceed to the consideration of a joint resolution of disapproval. Notice must be given on the preceding calendar day, unless directed by the committee of referral. The motion can be repeated if previously rejected, incentivizing a vote on the resolution. Points of order are waived, and in the Senate, the motion is debatable except under BRAC. Under the BRAC procedure, the motion to proceed to the consideration of a joint resolution of disapproval is not debatable and cannot be amended or postponed. Appeals of the chair's decision are decided without debate. Once adopted, the chamber immediately considers the joint resolution without interruption. The measure remains the unfinished business of the chamber until disposed of, and other business cannot intervene until then. The BRAC procedure limits debate on a joint resolution of disapproval to two hours, with no amendments allowed. This fast-track process prevents delays and interruptions in both the House and Senate. The BRAC procedure limits debate on a joint resolution of disapproval to two hours, with no amendments allowed. A final vote on the joint disapproval resolution is virtually unavoidable once a chamber decides to take it up. Passage of the joint resolution requires a simple majority in each chamber, but a two-thirds vote would be needed to override a likely presidential veto. The BRAC procedure limits debate on a joint resolution of disapproval to two hours, with no amendments allowed. Passage of the joint resolution requires a simple majority in each chamber, but a two-thirds vote would be needed to override a likely presidential veto. If either chamber receives a joint resolution before voting on a disapproval resolution, they proceed to consider it without referring it to committee. After voting on the first chamber's joint resolution, the second chamber may no longer consider its own version to avoid the need for reconciliation or wasting time. The joint resolution of disapproval must be signed by the President or enacted over his veto to become law. The BRAC procedure allows for limited debate on a joint resolution of disapproval, with no amendments permitted. A simple majority in each chamber is required for passage, but a two-thirds vote is needed to override a potential presidential veto. The expedited legislative procedure can be altered or set aside by either chamber at any time, as each chamber has the power to determine its own rules of proceedings. This can be done through the adoption of a special rule or by suspension of the rules. In the 101st Congress, Representative George E. Brown Jr. introduced H.J.Res. 165, a joint resolution disapproving the recommendations of the 1988 Commission on Base Realignment and Closure. The House \"rewrote\" the statutory terms related to the consideration of the resolution. In the 101st Congress, Representative George E. Brown Jr. introduced H.J.Res. 165 to disapprove the 1988 Commission on Base Realignment and Closure recommendations. The House made changes to the statutory terms for considering the resolution, including unanimous consent requests and laying aside provisions of the BRAC law. The House also adopted H.Res. 469 in 2005, specifying that only the Majority Leader or designee could make a motion to proceed with a joint resolution of disapproval under the BRAC statute. The Senate has overridden the BRAC fast-track procedure by unanimous consent, limiting debate on disapproval resolutions and allowing consideration of separate legislation. Expedited procedures in the BRAC statute establish default parliamentary rules for resolution consideration, which can be tailored by Members. Table 1 lists joint resolutions of disapproval in Congress related to prior BRAC rounds and their outcomes."
