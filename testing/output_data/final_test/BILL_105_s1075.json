    "content": "The \"Child Support Assurance Act of 1997\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that single-parent families, particularly those headed by mothers, are more likely to be in poverty compared to two-parent families. Noncustodial parents not paying child support significantly contributes to this poverty. In 1990, there was a $33.7 billion gap in child support payments, and in 1991, there was a $5.8 billion deficit in child support income. Only 54% of custodial parents received child support awards in 1992. In 1991, half of parents due child support received full payment, while the other half were split between partial payment (24%) and receiving nothing (25%). Poor custodial parents were much less likely to receive child support, with over three-quarters of them not receiving any support. Only 39% of poor women were awarded child support in 1991. In 1991, 39% of poor women were awarded child support, significantly lower than the 65% award rate for nonpoor women. Families with child support fared better economically, with custodial parents receiving child support having higher incomes compared to those without support. The Act aims to establish child support assurance systems to improve the economic circumstances of children without minimum support from noncustodial parents. The Act aims to strengthen child support awards and promote parental work involvement for the benefit of children.

The Act defines key terms related to child support, including the definitions of \"child\" and \"eligible child\" who meet specific criteria for support. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as determined by the appropriate State agency under section 454(29)(A) of the Act for not pursuing a support order. Establishment of Child Support Assurance Demonstration Projects. The Secretary will grant funds to 3-5 States for demonstration projects to establish or improve a system for assured minimum child support payments. Applications must be submitted by the State's Chief Executive Officer and include details of the project and agencies involved. The project application must specify the project scope, income eligibility, estimated number of eligible children, work requirements for noncustodial parents, and a commitment to carry out the project for 3-5 consecutive fiscal years. The Secretary will select States based on geographic diversity and other criteria for a child support assurance project. States awarded grants must use funds to provide a minimum monthly child support payment for eligible children. Any assured minimum child support payment received will be treated accordingly under this Act. The support payment received under this Act is considered child support for tax purposes and eligibility for means-tested programs. The demonstration project will run for 3-5 fiscal years starting in October 1997, with the option to terminate early if the state is not compliant. States conducting the project must evaluate and report on its effectiveness. The demonstration project under this section must provide evaluation and submit reports to the Secretary as required. Reports must include information on child support collected, economic circumstances, and work analysis. The Secretary must collect information on the economic circumstances and work efforts of custodial and noncustodial parents, compliance with support orders, recipients' need for assistance, and any other specified matters through scientifically acceptable sampling methods for the demonstration project. Reports must be submitted to Congress. The Secretary must submit reports to Congress based on information collected from States administering projects under this section. The reports will assess the effectiveness of the projects and include any recommendations for legislative action. Funding limits and pro rata reductions of State matching funds are also specified. The Secretary must submit reports to Congress assessing the effectiveness of demonstration projects funded under this section. Funding limits are set at $27,000,000 for fiscal year 1998, $55,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, and $70,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2003. Pro rata reductions in State funding may be made to comply with the specified funding limitations. SEC. 5. MANDATORY REVIEW AND ADJUSTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS FOR TANF RECIPIENTS.
