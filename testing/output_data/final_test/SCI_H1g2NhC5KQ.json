    "content": "The paper introduces a new model for text style transfer that does not rely on learning a latent representation independent of style attributes. Instead, it uses a mechanism based on back-translation to control various factors of variation in textual data. This model allows for control over attributes like gender, sentiment, and product type, with a focus on balancing content preservation and style change. Experimental results show that this fully entangled model outperforms existing approaches on challenging benchmarks. The unsupervised learning model aims to learn data representations for fine control over latent factors of variation. It focuses on mappings between different data domains like images and words/sentences. The generative model is conditioned on attribute values and an initial input for transformation while retaining original input characteristics. Generations should retain original input characteristics while learning mappings between data domains. The model learns via unsupervised tasks with a focus on disentanglement to generate outputs based on latent representations and desired attributes. Adversarial terms in training aim to make attribute values unrecoverable from the latent representation. This paper aims to extend previous studies on \"style transfer\" by exploring the necessity of disentanglement and adversarial loss in enabling control over factors of variation. The approach can be applied to various domains beyond sentiment flipping, as demonstrated with re-writes on social media content. The paper introduces a model that uses a back-translation objective instead of an adversarial term for unsupervised machine translation. It includes a pooling operator to balance style transfer and content preservation, and supports multiple attribute control. The authors propose new benchmarks for style transfer evaluation to address limitations in current benchmarks. The paper proposes new benchmarks for style transfer evaluation using full reviews with multiple attributes extracted from each review. It introduces a learning framework combining denoising auto-encoding loss, online back-translation, and a novel neural architecture. The approach is compared with baselines using new metrics and human evaluations, with plans to release code, benchmark datasets, and pre-trained models for reproducibility. The paper introduces benchmarks for style transfer evaluation using full reviews with multiple attributes. It discusses unsupervised image translation techniques, including learning domain mappings without supervision. Cycle consistency loss is used to enforce mappings between different domains. In style transfer, cycle consistency loss is used to enforce mappings between different domains, along with an adversarial loss to generate realistic images. Fader Networks applies a discriminator on the latent representation of an image autoencoder to control specific attributes. Different approaches have been proposed for textual data, such as controlling writing style in sentences using supervised style transfer models trained on datasets like the Bible in different styles. The focus of recent research is on controlled text generation from unsupervised data, with an emphasis on style transfer achieved by disentangling sentence representations in a shared latent space. Most solutions use an adversarial approach to learn latent representations agnostic to the style of input sentences. However, the discrete nature of the sentence generation process makes it challenging to apply techniques like cycle consistency or adversarial training. Recent research focuses on controlled text generation from unsupervised data, emphasizing style transfer by disentangling sentence representations in a shared latent space. Techniques like cycle consistency or adversarial training are challenging due to the discrete nature of sentence generation. Other studies have used methods like REINFORCE or tunable temperature softmax layers, but these are slow and hard to tune. A relevant work involves unsupervised machine translation using cross-domain word embeddings to create a phrase-table for an iterative back-translation pipeline. This approach is more complex than the end-to-end method proposed here, which does not require pre-training. The iterative back-translation approach is compared to on-the-fly back-translation, which is more effective. The task involves learning a model that maps input sentences to new sentences with specified attribute values while retaining original content. The architecture considered is a sequence-to-sequence auto-encoder that encodes x into a latent representation z and decodes it back. Disentanglement is crucial, with methods aiming to learn a z that cannot recover y. The success of a classifier in recovering y shows that z is not invariant to y. The study demonstrates that the latent representation z is not invariant to the input y in a Fader model BID10. The discriminator's ability to predict sentiment decreases with higher adversarial loss, but a separately trained classifier can easily recover the sentiment from the encoder representations. The degree of disentanglement in the latent representation is also evaluated, showing that the attribute value can be well recovered even in an adversarially trained model. The study explores the ability of a post-hoc generator, trained similarly to the discriminator, to recover attribute information from disentangled content representations. Disentanglement may not be necessary for controllable text rewriting, which is the focus of the following sections. Evaluation criteria for controlled text generation include fluency, attribute value utilization, and content preservation. Denoising auto-encoding is suggested as a method to achieve these goals. The study discusses using denoising auto-encoding (DAE) to train a generator that can reconstruct input content and attributes by leveraging externally provided attribute information. Disentanglement is not necessary for controllable text rewriting, and a natural constraint is used to encourage model performance. The study utilizes denoising auto-encoding (DAE) to train a generator for controlled text generation with externally provided attributes. This technique, called back-translation (BT), encourages the model to leverage attribute information for reconstruction and training. The study utilizes denoising auto-encoding (DAE) for controlled text generation with externally provided attributes through back-translation (BT). The model generates sentences by sampling from a multinomial distribution defined by the decoder, aiming to overwrite original attribute information with desired attributes. However, the system may be limited to swapping a single binary attribute. To address limitations in swapping attributes, the system introduces attribute conditioning by embedding multiple attributes and using pooling for content preservation control. Additionally, a decoder bias approach was explored but did not yield significant improvements. Latent representation pooling is used to control content preservation by adding a temporal max-pooling layer on top of the encoder with non-overlapping windows of width w. Different values of w allow for tradeoffs between preserving input information and reducing word-by-word copying in the decoder. Hyper-parameters include \u03bb AE and \u03bb BT for denoising auto-encoder terms. The hyper-parameters of the model include \u03bb AE and \u03bb BT for balancing denoising auto-encoder and back-translation terms, temperature T for unbiased generations, and pooling window size w. The model architecture consists of a 2-layer bidirectional LSTM encoder, a 2-layer decoder LSTM with attention mechanism, and word embedding lookup tables with 512 hidden units. Another embedding lookup table is used for attribute values. The decoder in the model conditions on attribute embedding information and a temporally downsampled representation of the encoder. Adversarial training is not used in the best models, but a discriminator is used in experiments for studying disentanglement. Data from Yelp restaurant and Amazon product reviews is utilized in the study. Amazon product reviews build on previous work by operating at the granularity of entire reviews, considering full reviews with up to 100 words and using byte-pair encodings with 60k BPE codes. They leverage metadata about restaurant and product categories to collect annotations for gender of the review author and category of the product or restaurant. The Yelp Reviews dataset consists of restaurant and business reviews from the Yelp Dataset Challenge. The data is pre-processed to remove non-English reviews, those not about restaurants, neutral sentiment reviews, and reviews where gender is not identifiable. Sentiment and gender labels are binarized, and five coarse-grained restaurant category labels are used. The Yelp Reviews dataset includes restaurant and business reviews, pre-processed to remove non-English and neutral sentiment reviews. Gender and sentiment labels are binarized, and a multi-label classifier is used to assign restaurant category labels. Another version of the dataset, FYelp, includes full reviews, gender, and category information. The Amazon Reviews dataset consists of consumer reviews of Amazon products, following similar pre-processing steps as Yelp. The Amazon dataset consists of consumer reviews of Amazon products, categorized into Books, Clothing, Electronics, Movies, and Music. Gender labels were not collected due to a large number of usernames not being gender-annotated. A new version of the dataset, referred to as Amazon, includes full reviews and product category information. Additionally, an unreleased dataset of public social media content written by English speakers was used to demonstrate the approach with a diverse set of categories. The text discusses the use of different datasets for sentiment analysis, including gender, age group, and writer-annotated feeling attributes. Various datasets like SYelp, FYelp, and Amazon are used, with public social media content from different sources. A fastText classifier is trained for each attribute to reduce noise in the data. Automatic evaluation of generative text models is still a research challenge, with multiple criteria used in this work. The text discusses evaluating generative text models based on attribute control, fluency, and content preservation using fastText classifiers, language model perplexity, and BLEU scores. The evaluation of generative text models includes measuring attribute control, fluency, and content preservation using BLEU scores and human evaluations through crowd-sourcing. Self-BLEU scores are computed with respect to human references, while BLEU scores are averaged across generations conditioned on attribute values. Human evaluations involve annotating sentences for fluency and content preservation on a likert-scale. The evaluation of generative text models includes measuring attribute control, fluency, and content preservation on a likert-scale from 1 to 5. Models meeting specified thresholds were evaluated by humans, with the best model selected for testing. The text chunk discusses the automatic evaluation of models on the SYelp test set, comparing different models and reporting results based on hyper-parameter choices. The experiments aim to demonstrate the model's ability to control attribute transfer and content preservation. The text chunk presents an approach that uses domain adversarial training to remove sentiment information from the encoder's representation. The approach outperforms previous methods on multiple criteria and demonstrates successful sentiment control. The approach uses domain adversarial training to remove sentiment information from the encoder's representation, outperforming previous methods and demonstrating successful sentiment control through human evaluations. The Fader model implementation is found to be superior by human evaluation testing. The model demonstrates the ability to control single and multiple attributes by altering larger fragments while maintaining grammaticality and fluency. Examples show the model retains the overall structure of input sentences, including punctuation and emojis. An ablation study on model components on the SYelp and FYelp datasets reveals the impact on overall performance. The study explores various components in text generation models, such as attention and back-translation, to control attributes of text. It is found that models without domain adversarial training perform the best. The absence of pooling or softmax temperature during back-translation negatively impacts performance, while attention and back-translation have significant effects. Models without pooling tend to converge to a copy mode quickly, affecting accuracy. Pooling helps provide a trade-off between accuracy and content preservation. The study presents a model that can rewrite sentences based on given attributes without using a disentanglement criterion. It demonstrates the model's ability to generalize to restaurant/product reviews and offers fine-grained control over attribute control versus content preservation. Experiments show that the model outperforms existing methods on both existing and large-scale datasets. The study presents a model for rewriting sentences based on attributes without disentanglement.

The model uses the Adam optimizer with specific parameters and training techniques for generating pseudo-parallel data. Training is done with balanced minibatches for skewed class distributions in Yelp and Amazon datasets. The FYelp and Amazon datasets are created by obtaining reviews, ratings, user information, and restaurant categories. Sentiment labels are constructed by grouping ratings into positive and negative categories. Gender of reviewers is determined using their names and a list of gendered names. Reviews without gender information are discarded. The dataset includes restaurant/business category meta-data for reviews, with reviews categorized into \"parent\" categories such as Asian cuisine. A classifier is trained on these parent categories to relabel the dataset. Amazon reviews and categories are obtained from metadata, with sentiment labels constructed similarly to FYelp. Gender labels are not used due to lack of real names in Amazon usernames. Amazon product categories are manually grouped into parent categories.
