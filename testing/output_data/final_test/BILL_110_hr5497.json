The \"Kids IRA Act of 2008 (K-IRA)\" includes a provision for a Young Savers Account, which is a Roth IRA established for individuals under 26 years old. Contributions to this account are subject to specific limits. For individuals under 26 years old, contribution limits for Young Savers Accounts are increased by qualified young saver contributions and the deductible amount under section 219(b)(5) for the taxable year. The term 'qualified young saver contribution' refers to contributions made by an individual to a young savers account established for another individual, with limitations on the total amount that can be contributed in a taxable year. Section 219 of the Code now includes a subsection on Partial Deductibility of Qualified Young Saver Contributions, limiting the total amount an individual can contribute to young savers accounts in a taxable year. The new subsection (f) allows for a 20% deduction on qualified young saver contributions up to $5,000 for individuals. The deduction amount is subject to reduction based on modified adjusted gross income. The new subsection (f) allows for a 20% deduction on qualified young saver contributions up to $5,000 for individuals.

For taxpayers other than married individuals filing separately, the deduction limit is $200,000, and for married individuals filing separately, it is zero. Dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation annually. The amendments made by this section allow for rounding increases to the nearest multiple of $1,000. A conforming amendment is made to section 408A(c) of the Code. These amendments apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008."
