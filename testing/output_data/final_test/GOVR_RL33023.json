    "content": "The report provides an inventory of basic information on open access publishing and citation archives, highlighting differences between proponents and opponents. It also discusses federal open access activities, including NIH initiatives, as well as developments in the UK and internationally. Controversial issues for the 110th Congress are also summarized. The \"open access movement\" began in 1966 and encompasses various activities related to access to article citations and journals. The open-access movement, which makes up 1-2% of the market, is gaining importance in addressing academic discontent over rising journal costs. In traditional publishing, subscribers pay fees to access articles, while open access allows for free, unlimited access granted by authors or publishers holding the copyright. Open access publishing grants users free access and the right to copy and distribute articles. Authors may need to pay fees ranging from $500 to $4,000 for publication. These fees can be covered by individual authors or institutions with subscription contracts. Authors are required to deposit their work in an online database for open access. Open access publishing allows free access to articles without payment from authors or readers. Traditional publishers may offer free online access after a delay, but open access publishers do not require payment for access. Copyright is still held by publishers, and authors may or may not be allowed to post their articles in open access repositories. Open access publishing allows authors to post their published articles in open access repositories or on their own websites. These repositories vary in scope, containing journal articles, preprints, research reports, and other materials. Some repositories only archive citations, while others include full-text materials. Various open access publishing activities are categorized by type, including commercial open access. NIH's PubMed Central (PMC) system and PLoS are examples of open access publishing systems. PLoS, a nonprofit group led by Dr. Harold Varmus, offers free access to peer-reviewed articles in its electronic journals. PLoS journals include Biology, Medicine, Computational Biology, Genetics, and Pathogens, with plans to expand into other disciplines. The goal is to publish high-quality articles comparable to traditional subscriber-pays journals like Science and Nature. PLoS, a nonprofit group led by Dr. Harold Varmus, offers free access to peer-reviewed articles in its electronic journals. Authors retain copyright to their articles but must deposit a copy in an open access repository. The goal is to make research more accessible by eliminating publishers as copyright holders and ending the \"balkanization\" of scientific information. PLoS's editorial policy allows integration of data into new work with appropriate credit. The model is inspired by GenBank, driving progress in genomics and biotechnology. PLoS also aims to assist scientists in developing countries by providing Internet access for readers. BioMedCentral is a British-founded, independent, commercial publishing system that provides free access to peer-reviewed biomedical research online. It publishes approximately 120 biomedical journals with rapid peer review processes. Authors retain copyright of their work, and BioMedCentral charges for peer review and publication costs. Other sources of revenue include subscription access, sales of paper copies, reprints, advertising, and subscription-based value-added services. BioMedCentral offers personalized information services, editorially enhanced databases, and collaboration tools for scientists. It also archives materials in PubMed Central and provides a fee-based subscription service called Faculty of 1000. patientINFORM was launched in 2005 to provide free access to selected full-text research articles in partnership with publishing firms. The initiative by NIH, patientINFORM, offers immediate access to free research articles online, driven by increased public awareness of clinical research. The system may expand beyond initial diseases, but materials posted may not be permanently accessible. The EScholarship Program of the University of California system provides an electronic repository for scholars' publications and research databases, improving access to federally funded research. Many research universities participate in DSpace, a networked electronic repository for sharing research. DSpace is a networked electronic repository developed by MIT in collaboration with Hewlett-Packard. It provides free access to peer-reviewed publications, with articles archived and accessible between 6 and 24 months after publication. Some repositories allow free searching for citations, abstracts, and articles in specific disciplinary fields. The curr_chunk discusses the arXiv, an online archive established in 1991 by Cornell University Library for physical science researchers to share preprints before formal publication. It covers subjects like physics, mathematics, computer science, and biology. The arXiv has evolved to become a major repository for research literature in various fields. Half of all research articles in physics are posted to the arXiv server before publication in journals, making them de facto publications. CogPrints is a British-run self-archive for full-text, peer-reviewed journal articles in cognitive sciences, computer science, philosophy, biology, medicine, anthropology, and more. Controversies arise in the scientific publishing community due to the rapid growth of online and open access publishing. Supporters argue that open access is necessary to adapt to changes in publishing and information dissemination. The development of the Internet has led to inevitable changes in publishing and information dissemination, promoting scientific progress and economic development. Open access publishing provides citizens with access to federally funded research results, but faces opposition from traditional publishers and scientific associations due to concerns about electronic archives, copyright ownership, costs to researchers, article quality, peer review processes, and academic reward systems. The costs of publishing a journal article can range from $3,000 to over $10,000, with high value-added costs for journals like Science magazine. The costs of publishing a journal article can vary greatly, with estimates ranging from $3,000 to over $10,000. Different journals have different costs, with BioScience at about $7,000 per article, and Nature and New England Journal of Medicine exceeding $1,500. Electronic publishing and distribution are generally cheaper than hard-copy publishing, with some research suggesting that open access publishing models are a viable alternative to subscription journals. Open access publishing aims to provide high-quality, peer-reviewed research at a lower cost compared to traditional publishing models. Traditional publishers rely on revenue from subscriptions, advertising, reprints, and author fees. Data from a 2004 study shows that subscriptions accounted for about 70% of total revenue for traditional journal publishers. Open access journals require authors to pay publishing costs ranging from $500 to $4,000. Revenue sources for open access journals include author fees, advertising, sponsorships, grants, and industry support. Contrary to expectations, traditional journals charge author fees for services like color printing and page layout. Traditional publishers charge fees to authors for small changes and color views, while open access publishers charge larger fees for publishing. The future of open access journals may depend on whether federal funding can be used to cover these charges. Federal agencies funding scientific research allow universities, colleges, and nonprofit institutions to charge publishing costs as direct costs if approved. If disallowed, costs may be covered as indirect costs, but full reimbursement may not occur due to limitations. Some agencies have issued policy guidance on allowing direct cost coverage. Some federal agencies allow publication fees as direct costs for project support, including page charges and other publication costs. The National Science Foundation and NIH specify allowable publication costs such as reports, reprints, illustrations, software development, and storage of physical specimens. According to NIH, publication costs for professional journals, reprints, and publishing in other media are allowable for federally supported research projects. Publications under NIH grants must include appropriate acknowledgments. Library fees and journal subscriptions may also be covered. The federal government may not extend allowances to cover publication fees for institutional subscriptions. Harold Varmus believes the government should cover publishing costs. The UK Wellcome Trust and Howard Hughes Medical Institute support open access journals by allowing grant funds to be used for author charges. Some professional groups have widened policies for \"author pays\" publishing, allowing free access to readers. For example, the American Chemical Society and Elsevier announced mechanisms for authors to pay for online access to their articles. Particle physicists are seeking free access to articles in their field, with a proposal for a consortium to cover publication costs. Supporters of open access argue that research sponsors already bear most publishing costs, and shifting support to pay for open access would not cost more. It is estimated that it would cost $6 million or more annually to include all journals offering open-access options, covering half of the 6,000 theory and experimental papers published each year. This would impose new financial burdens on research sponsors, but they already cover a significant portion of the $9 billion annual revenue of scientific journals. The US $9 billion annual revenue of scientific, medical, and technology journals comes from subscriptions, site licenses, and publication fees billed to grants or employers. The cost of open-access digital publishing may not exceed current expenses. Some argue that government funding for publishing could divert money from research. Universities fear increased costs if they have to reimburse researchers for publication fees. Some universities are concerned about increased costs if they have to reimburse researchers for author fees in open access journals and still pay high subscription costs for traditional journals. Young scientists worry that an author-pays model for publication could be a burden on those with smaller grants. In certain fields like medicine and engineering, users of journals may not contribute to publication costs, leaving researchers to bear disproportionate expenses. Traditional academic publishing has a $5 billion global market, with leading publisher Reed Elsevier generating $1.6 billion in revenue annually. Open access publishing could reduce profits to 10-15%. Subscription costs vary, with one instance in 2003 where a university was charged $91,000 for access to six biology journals. The University of California paid $7.7 million yearly for 1,200 Elsevier periodicals. The University of California was charged $7.7 million annually for subscriptions to 1,200 Elsevier periodicals, with a 25% price reduction negotiated after faculty threatened to boycott Elsevier journals. Publishers often force libraries to subscribe to more journals than needed by bundling them into large contracts, leading to increased costs and difficulty for libraries to afford. The rising costs of journal subscriptions are making it difficult for libraries, especially university libraries, to afford many journals, leading to a shift in spending from other media. Prices per journal have reportedly doubled within 15 years, with libraries paying 227% more while the Consumer Price Index increased by 64%. This trend has adversely affected access to biomedical research information. The rising costs of journal subscriptions have made it challenging for academic and health science libraries to support research and healthcare provider communities' needs for biomedical literature access. The open access movement, driven by academics and librarians, protested subscription fee increases in 2003 and 2004, demanding reductions from major publishers like Reed Elsevier. The sustainability of open access journals without subsidies remains uncertain. The sustainability of open access journals without subsidies is still uncertain. Some journals have reversed their free access policies due to declining subscription rates and revenues. For example, the Journal of High Energy Physics initially offered free online access but later imposed a $1000 subscription fee. There are concerns about whether publishers will have enough revenue to support niche journals in narrow scientific fields with small readerships. Critics argue that scientific societies should find alternative funding sources instead of relying on publishing profits, which come from subscribers and libraries. They suggest exploring different business models to support their activities. However, some professional associations believe that online publishing will not decrease their revenues, as stated by one association. According to the American Physical Society (APS), online publishing does not reduce subscriptions to print journals in physics, computer science, and mathematics. APS journals have a liberal copyright policy allowing authors to post articles on e-print servers before publication and update them after. Critics argue that traditional publishers limit access to scientific information. Traditional publishers' practices limit equitable access to scientific information by imposing restrictive licensing terms, controlling long-term archival access, and selectively deleting published articles. Some traditional publishers are starting to adopt features of open access publishing, such as multimedia enhancements, author self-archiving, and improved content search capabilities. However, they often charge fees for access. Traditional, subscriber-pays publishers charge fees for access to journal articles, ranging from a few dollars to tens of dollars. Open access proponents argue against charging fees for access to information. The British Medical Journal allows free access to all materials for one week after publication, with limited access for non-subscribers afterwards. Traditional publishers may offer free access to journal articles after a certain period. Open access advocates argue against delayed access to research findings, especially in biomedical research. Limited access to full-text articles hinders scientific progress and may lead to citation bias. Traditional publishers may not provide electronic access to data for verification or comparison in research projects. Open access publishers allow authors to self-archive their articles immediately for free, with various models and fees charged. Traditional publishers have different policies on self-archiving, such as linking to the printed version after publication or allowing posting on institutional servers only. The policies of U.S. and foreign journals, associations, and publishers regarding self-archiving are summarized by SHERPA. Critics argue that archiving solely on an author's website hinders the discoverability of related articles. Commercial publishers offer search engines for citations and abstracts, but full-text articles typically require payment, averaging $30 per article. Access to scientific articles can be costly, with an average fee of $30 per article for reading or downloading. However, there are open access bibliographic archives like NIH's PubMed/MEDLINE that provide free access to abstracts and full-text articles from biomedical journals dating back to the 1950s. Commercial search engines like Scirus offer limited access to science literature through short abstracts or excerpts. Open access repositories like NIH's PubMed Central (PMC) provide free access to full-text articles, including those from open access publishers and NIH-funded research. Many journals deposit material in PMC, making their articles available for free. However, not all NIH-funded research articles are submitted to PMC. Providing free access to articles in online repositories has multiple benefits, allowing readers to find related papers easily without the need for commercial indexing databases. Copyright protection is argued to be necessary for publishers to market journals and cover publishing costs. In open access publishing, authors retain copyright ownership while readers have free access to articles. The NIH's Public Access Policy requires authors to submit their peer-reviewed manuscripts to PubMed Central within 12 months of acceptance by the publisher. Free access to the manuscript is restricted until after journal publication or the specified embargo period. Publishers retain the right to disseminate the work before free access on PMC, but authors are encouraged to negotiate agreements allowing manuscript placement. NIH can use the article under the government purpose license doctrine, regardless of the publisher's decision. Open access publishing, supported by the government purpose license doctrine, may be adopted by other agencies in the future. This approach aims to provide equitable access to scientific knowledge, especially for researchers in developing countries. Some traditional publishers argue that scientists in these countries already have access to most scientific journals. Many traditional publishers participate in projects sponsored by organizations like the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to provide medical and agricultural journals to readers in developing countries at low or no cost. Over 2,000 biomedical journals are accessible online to researchers and health workers in developing countries through the Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative (HINARI) supported by the World Health Organization. There are differing opinions on the peer review process and quality of articles in open access journals compared to traditional subscriber-pays journals. The process of selecting articles for publication in a journal involves initial selection by editors, peer review by expert scientists, and publication of high-quality articles. The traditional model involves peer review and validation through subscription-based journals, while critics argue that the open access \"author pays\" model may compromise quality control mechanisms. A 2005 survey funded by traditional journal publishers found that open-access journals had lower quality peer review, received fewer submissions, and were less selective. Traditional journals used external peer review, while open-access journals mostly relied on editorial staff for review. Studies show that traditional publishers have more rigorous peer review processes compared to open access journals. A 2005 study found that open-access journals relied more on editorial staff for peer review, while traditional journals used external reviewers. Some analysts believe that open access journals struggle to find enough peer reviewers, leading to potential issues with manuscript filtering compared to traditional journals. Peer reviewers for open access journals may be overwhelmed by the number of articles to review, causing delays in the system. Publication in open access journals may not be viewed as prestigious as traditional journals, but citation data shows that open access articles are used and cited more frequently, making them a better model for scientific research utilization. Open access articles are more frequently cited and have a greater research impact compared to those not available via open access. This is supported by studies in various disciplines such as philosophy, political science, electrical and electronic engineering, mathematics, and computer sciences. Studies have shown that open access articles are cited more frequently than those not freely available online. A scientist analyzed 120,000 computer science papers and found that freely available papers had more citations. Another study in an open access journal found that articles published online were cited more than those in subscriber journals. This suggests that easy access to online articles may increase citation rates. The \"Public Access to Science Act\" was introduced in 2003 to encourage free dissemination of research results from federally funded basic scientific research. This led to the NIH's \"Enhanced Public Access Policy\" in 2004, requiring researchers to deposit peer-reviewed articles in NIH's database. The NIH's \"Enhanced Public Access Policy\" in 2004 required researchers to deposit peer-reviewed articles in NIH's PubMed Central within six months of publication. Librarians and SPARC lobbied for this open-access language in the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act. NIH works with publishers to ensure peer review system integrity. Publishers express concerns about NIH's database handling new articles. NIH's PubMed Central (PMC) is an electronic system launched in 2000, containing peer-reviewed articles in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research fields. The goal is to create a publicly accessible archive separate from publishers' databases. Some journals in PMC offer full-text articles. Some journals in PMC offer immediate access to full-text articles upon publication, while others may have waiting periods of up to three years. Certain journals require readers to visit their website to view abstracts or full articles, which may be behind a paywall. Major biomedical journals like JAMA and NEJM do not submit materials to PMC, and access to their articles is usually available for a fee on their websites. The NIH implemented a policy in 2005 requiring authors funded by NIH to submit their articles for public access shortly after publication. This policy came after public review and comments from stakeholders and traditional publishers. The NIH policy requires authors funded by NIH to submit their final manuscripts to the NIH PMC system within 12 months of journal acceptance. Submission is voluntary, with no penalties for non-compliance. The author's final manuscript, accepted for journal publication after peer review, can be released to the public immediately or with a 12-month delay when submitted to NIH. Authors are encouraged to make their articles available through PubMed Central (PMC) promptly. The submitted manuscript to PMC is not the final copyedited version, as publishers use different electronic formats. NIH's policy allows for accommodating publisher changes to the manuscript. The final manuscript submitted to PMC will not be available to the public until after it is published in a journal. Corrections and revisions will be accommodated, and the published article and author's final manuscript will be linked through PubMed. Corrections and post-publication comments will be linked in PubMed and PMC. NIH's new policy allows electronic access to NIH-funded research, with final versions superseding author's manuscripts in PMC. 80% of high impact journals and 78% of FASEB journals offer public access within 12 months of publication. Zerhouni justified the new policy by providing electronic access to NIH-funded research, creating a central archive of publications, advancing science, and helping NIH manage its research investment. A Public Access Advisory Working Group was formed to advise on policy implementation. Recommendations included making the policy mandatory, posting manuscripts within six months, and posting the final copyedited version. In response to publishers' concerns, NIH revised the public access policy to allow publishers to request removal of articles from PubMed Central that infringe copyright, even if the author has the copyright agreement. The majority of the Public Access Advisory Working Group confirmed that the policy should be mandatory and articles should be submitted within six months. NIH revised the public access policy to allow publishers to request removal of articles from PubMed Central that infringe copyright. The policy mandates submission within six months, with flexibility for quarterly publications, and favors the final published form of manuscripts. Authors publishing in journals automatically depositing content on PMC do not need to submit directly. NIH's revised public access policy allows publishers to request removal of copyrighted articles from PubMed Central. Authors publishing in journals automatically depositing content on PMC do not need to take further steps to comply with the policy. Some journals accessible via PMC require authors to submit manuscripts, while NIH has initiated the PubMed Central (NIH Portfolio) project for NIH-funded research. Publishers may sign agreements with NIH for participation, stipulating that articles be made available in an NIH-funded archive with a 12-month embargo period. After the embargo period, NIH can provide links to the journal and distribute the article through PMC. After negotiations, only one journal, Blood, has agreed to participate in distributing articles directly through PMC. Authors publishing in other journals not part of regular PMC or NIH portfolio journals must continue to submit manuscripts to comply with NIH's policy. These changes aim to increase compliance by NIH-funded researchers and avoid further mandates. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.Rept. 109-143 on the FY2006 appropriations bill for NIH (H.R. 3010) on June 24, 2005. The report endorsed NIH's \"Public Access Policy\" and requested an outreach program for grantees to submit journal manuscripts to the NIH archive. S.Rept. 109-103 endorsed the policy objectives and emphasized the need for interaction between NIH and stakeholders. The NIH report released in January 2006 highlighted low submission rates for articles in the database, despite outreach efforts. The report requested NIH to report on various aspects of the new policy's impact, including public access improvement and operating costs. The NIH report in January 2006 noted low submission rates for articles in the database, with publisher resistance being a possible factor. The report highlighted ongoing issues such as mandatory vs. voluntary participation, article version deposition in PMC, and embargo period length. In 2006, the House Appropriations Subcommittee addressed NIH's public access policy. The House Appropriations Subcommittee addressed NIH's public access policy in 2006. Sec. 220 of bill H.R. 5647 proposed mandatory submission of final manuscripts to PubMed Central within one year. The Senate bill, S. 3708, did not include this provision. The American Center for Cures Act, S. 2104, introduced in 2005, included a provision on translational research. The NIH Reauthorization Act, H.R. 6164, required NIH grantees to submit final peer-reviewed manuscripts within six months of publication. A proposed amendment to deposit federally funded research articles in NIH's Pub Med within six months was not introduced. The bill was approved by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce in 2006. Stakeholder concerns about NIH's open access policy were acknowledged. The Senate passed H.R. 6164 without a written report on December 8, 2006, and the House agreed on December 9. Some Members of Congress supported opponents of the NIH public access policy, questioning NIH's funding ability for the public access system. Senators Larry Craig, Mike Crapo, and Kit Bond sent a letter to NIH Director Zerhouni supporting the FASEB group's position. Critics of the NIH policy, including PLoS supporters, have raised concerns about the voluntary compliance requirement and the 12-month delay for articles' public release. They argue that the language should have been more forceful in requiring deposition of NIH-funded articles in PubMed Central and that the maximum allowable delay should have been 6 months. Some critics argue that the 12-month delay for public access to NIH-funded articles is too long, especially in dynamic fields like biomedicine. They suggest creating a search engine to access articles on original journal websites instead of using PMC. This approach has been supported by groups like the Washington DC Principles for Free Access to Science and the American Physiological Society. Google Scholar is a free search engine launched in 2004 that allows users to find peer-reviewed articles, preprints, and other scholarly analyses. It may link to full-text articles published at least a year before the search date, but not all materials in a field are guaranteed to be captured. Publisher-controlled materials may require a fee for full access. Some concerns focus on NIH policy potentially impacting patent rights. Some argue that NIH policy could affect patent rights by considering pre-publication manuscripts on the PMC database as 'printed publications' for patent purposes. Critics claim that relying on journal publication dates limits technology development and commercial competition, undermining the Bayh-Dole principle. However, the Bayh-Dole law pertains to technology transfer, not publishing research results. NIH officials state that participation in the policy is voluntary. The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) proposed modifying the NIH public access policy to link readers from abstracts of articles to publishers' websites instead of the articles themselves. NIH officials objected, stating this would hinder achieving the policy's core goals. Only a small percentage of NIH grantees have submitted articles to the public access system. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006, introduced by Senators Cornyn and Lieberman, requires federal agencies investing $100 million or more in research to develop a public access policy. This policy mandates that final manuscripts or articles resulting from federal funding be posted in a publicly accessible archive within six months of publication. Agencies like the National Science Foundation could be affected by this legislation. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006, introduced by Senators Cornyn and Lieberman, could affect agencies like the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Department of Defense, and NASA. The proposal has garnered support from universities, liberal arts colleges, library groups, and New England university provosts, while facing objections from some scholarly associations, academics, and publishers. Some objections were raised by publishers and academics against the broader policy of the NIH. A forum was held in 2006 to discuss improving access to publicly funded research, with support for open access publishing of federally funded research. The NIH Public Access policy upholds copyright principles for federally funded research. Authors are encouraged to include language in copyright agreements with publishers acknowledging their obligation to provide a copy of the article to PMC. NIH relies on author permission for policy implementation, not government purpose licenses. The regulation allows recipients of HHS awards to copyright their work but grants the agency a nonexclusive right to use it for Federal purposes. This concept is similar to the government purpose license used in federally funded contracts, allowing agencies to disseminate research articles to the public. The regulation allows recipients of HHS awards to copyright their work but grants the agency a nonexclusive right to use it for Federal purposes. Agencies may need a publisher's permission to reuse or republish articles, and different agencies may have varying interpretations of this function. The recipient of federal funds can copyright their work but the government has a nonexclusive right to use it for Federal purposes. Agencies may require grantees to publish or disseminate research findings and share generated data. Several federal agencies, including NIH, have Public Access policies for research findings. Other agencies may adopt similar policies or use government purpose license or nonexclusive right to use policies. Some agencies publish free, open access journals like Emerging Infectious Diseases and Agricultural Research. Some federal agencies maintain databases with research reports and articles, funded by the government or other sources. These repositories may include preprints of scientific materials. However, some agencies have faced challenges in maintaining these systems, leading to their termination. The Department of Energy (DOE) provides a tool called E-print for searching preprint reports in various scientific fields. E-print gives access to over 17,208 websites and databases worldwide, facilitating the exchange of research documents among peer groups. The GrayLIT Network, Federal Research and Development Project Summaries, USDA's AGRICOLA system, and the Astrophysics Data System are federal agency open access systems that provide access to research results and bibliographic data in various fields. The Astrophysics Data System is a NASA-funded project with four databases containing over 4.2 million records related to Astronomy, Astrophysics, Instrumentation, Physics, Geophysics, and preprints. Critics argue that government-operated databases could lead to censorship and interference with scholarly discourse by allowing federal officials to determine what research gets archived. Some publishers object to government-run databases containing research abstracts or articles, fearing impact on their publishing activities. The DOE E-print system faced controversy when publishers threatened to prohibit articles posted on it, but eventually relented with different rules. PubScience was a DOE effort for a free multidisciplinary database for physical sciences literature. The PubScience system, initiated in 1999 and closed in 2002, provided free access to indexed abstracts but required payment for full-text articles. It faced lobbying from the Software & Information Industry Association, claiming competition with commercial services. This lobbying threatened the budget of the DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical Information. The House Appropriations committee report on the DOE FY2002 appropriation bill cautioned about duplication with commercial information services and cited competing vendors like Scirus and Infotrieve. Efforts were made in 2005 to curtail an NIH database, PubChem, which duplicates ACS's fee-based Chemical Abstract Service. PubChem was launched by NIH in 2004 to provide data and links to articles on chemical structures of small organic molecules and their biological activities. It includes three databases: PubChem Substance, PubChem Compound, and PubChem BioAssay. Links from PubChem's records lead to other Entrez databases for biological properties, PubMed literature, and NCBI's protein 3D structure resource. The system will expand with more data from Molecular Libraries centers and other online chemical databases. PubChem, operated by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), provides free access to links to other NCBI databases. It is operated by 13 staff members with a budget of about $3 million. PubChem jeopardizes CAS service, which employs more than 1,200 people in Columbus, Ohio. CAS subscribers receive summary data on chemicals and links to millions of abstracts from journals and patent abstracts on chemical substances. NIH database focuses on biological information such as protein structures. PubChem, operated by NCBI, focuses on biological information like protein structures, not broader chemical reactions covered by CAS. NIH official warns limiting PubChem would negatively impact medical discoveries. ACS and NIH disagree on overlap with CAS, with ACS lobbying Congress to limit PubChem's scope. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees addressed concerns about potential overlap with the private sector in the FY2006 appropriations bill for NIH, but did not reduce funding for the database. The bill was signed into law as P.L. 109-149, with supporters of PubChem viewing the House language as a victory for NIH. Supporters of PubChem see the House language as a victory for NIH, with an ACS official calling it a 'tremendous step in the right direction.' In late August 2005, NIH declined an offer from ACS to create and manage a database for free. Instead, on September 1, 2005, NIH invited private sector providers and users of chemical information to participate in a new working group for PubChem development. In October 2005, the American Chemical Society objected to the retrospective process for assessing compounds in the database, advocating for a prospective analysis. NIH database managers stated that a prospective analysis should be used for compound selection in PubChem. A meeting between private-sector panel and NIH officials in December 2005 did not reach definitive conclusions, but industry representatives gained a better understanding of PubChem. Many new private sector depositors have contributed to PubChem, with major providers like MDL/Elsevier and Prous Science depositing millions of structures. Some major providers in the chemical information industry have found PubChem useful and complementary to their services. The reasons why some agencies can maintain open access systems more easily than others are not clear. NIH's open access activities are supported to allow taxpayers access to research results funded by their taxes. The DOE's Scientific and Technical Information Advisory Board is considering establishing an open access policy for DOE-funded articles, similar to NIH's, to make research more accessible. Government-supported researchers and agencies are facing challenges from publishers in transitioning to more open access methods due to the lack of guidance from congressional committees. CENDI, an interagency committee of senior STI managers from 12 U.S. federal agencies, is studying open access publishing and issuing reports to develop uniform standards. The European Union is also examining changes in scientific publishing markets following the \"Berlin Declaration\" for open access. The European Union conducted a study on changes in scientific publishing markets, focusing on open access to research findings. The report endorsed but did not mandate open access to publicly funded research. OECD science ministers committed to making research data openly available to promote economic benefits and scientific advancement. The OECD is working on guidelines for cost-effective access to digital research data funded by public sources, balancing open access with the need for restrictions to protect interests. The ultimate goal is to make data sharing and open access the norm. Another OECD report emphasized increasing access to publicly funded research findings for social returns on investments. The curr_chunk discusses the pros and cons of \"hybrid\" business models in open access publishing, including a two-part tariff system for author fees. This model aims to reduce multiple submissions, cover quality costs, and increase revenue certainty for publishers. However, user resistance may be a challenge compared to simpler author pays models. The report also suggests variations of another hybrid model involving segmentation of journals into subscription and open access sections. The curr_chunk discusses a hybrid model for open access publishing where journals can be segmented into subscription and open access sections on an article-by-article basis. This model allows authors to choose their preference and willingness to pay. The OECD report suggests that this model can help journals transition from a subscription model to open access based on author preferences. In the UK, there has been significant governmental and nongovernmental support for open access publishing, with some researchers making their research freely available through platforms like BioMedCentral. The UK government rejected a proposal for open access publishing in November 2004, citing unclear costs and value compared to current methods. In June 2005, the UK Research Councils, a major supporter of publicly funded research, considered implementing open access for government-funded researchers. The UK Research Councils, a major supporter of publicly funded research, issued a draft policy mandating researchers to archive their articles in a free public archive. Publishers may still embargo articles for months after publication due to copyright and licensing arrangements. The costs of publishing in \"author pays\" journals would be covered by the Research Councils' funding grant. The British government will review its policy options considering the draft RCUK policy and other information. The executive board of the RCUK issued a policy statement in 2006 mandating free access to publicly funded research papers. The Wellcome Trust requires papers it supports to be submitted to open access archives. The British Royal Society opposes the RCUK policy. The RCUK policy was opposed in a position paper citing concerns about cost effectiveness, threat to existing journals, and quality control issues in open access publications. Learned societies fear subscription cancellations, while open access activities of foreign organizations are discussed in a publication from 2004. Open access journal policies are evolving and may face contentious issues in Congress. The evolving and contentious issues surrounding citation repositories during the 109th Congress are discussed, with implications for academic institutions. Policy issues include which federal agencies may provide free public access to research manuscripts, comparison of peer review processes in different types of journals, and assessing academic reward systems for articles published by traditional versus open access publishers. Assessing the impact of open access publishing on academic promotion and tenure systems, scientific research quality, and author penalties for posting manuscripts in PMC. Evaluation of NIH-funded authors' participation in the Public Access policy and potential negative impacts. Consideration of limitations on federal open access databases and repositories. The curr_chunk discusses the debate over limiting federal open access databases to publications resulting from federally funded research and proposals for governmental citation archives. It also mentions the NIH monitoring the implementation of its Public Access policy and working with publishers to assess the costs and impacts of open access archiving on PMC. The estimated cost of posting all NIH-funded research studies on PubMed Central is around $2 to $4 million annually. The curr_chunk discusses the annual cost of Central's digital library, cooperation between NIH and private groups on PubChem, and the impact of limiting PubChem on biomedical research. It also addresses federal regulations for supporting open access publishing in research. The curr_chunk discusses the economic impacts of open access publishing on the scientific and technical publishing market, research support funding, federal government's role in funding citation archives, and the effects on the commercial publishing industry. The curr_chunk discusses the utilization of profits from publishing by professional scientific societies, alternative funding sources, and questions about open access publishing. Andy Gass and Helen Doyle raised controversial issues about open access journals, noting growing support in academia. Remaining questions include the future of secondary filters for research articles and the potential for fee-for-access ventures to become profitable for publishers. The curr_chunk discusses the future of research libraries, the role of faculty members in open-access scholarly communication, and the potential changes in funding sources for publication charges. University libraries are considering subsidizing publication charges for authors, and questions remain about the sustainability of these subsidies and their source of funding. The future of research libraries and funding sources for publication charges is being debated. Questions arise about who will cover the costs of open-access publications and how reduced legal barriers will impact scholarly activities. The role of libraries in providing access to research information is also under scrutiny. The NIH allows all articles by its employees to be in the public domain, with some open-access licenses like Creative Commons attribution permitting reproduction with proper credit. This raises questions about the potential for educational tools and resources, including enhanced online articles and increased access for researchers from less-developed countries. The future of open-access publications and their impact on scholarly activities is being debated. Increased availability of open-access journals could help scientists in developing countries increase their output of cutting-edge work and potentially bridge the \"10/90 gap\" in global medical research funding. Open access to journal articles may lead to new discoveries and advancements in various fields through searchable, freely accessible archives of peer-reviewed literature. Open-access literature facilitates systematic review of medical studies, leading to new discoveries and correlations previously unnoticed. Access to data sets and databases is enhanced, potentially sparking more open access. The overlooked potential for open access is its ability to drive new discoveries."
