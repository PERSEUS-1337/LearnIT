    "title": "SB 715",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Right to Try Act, under Article 4.3, allows eligible patients with terminal illnesses to access investigational drugs, biological products, or devices recommended by their physician. Eligible patients must have considered all other approved treatment options. Eligible patients must provide written informed consent for the use of investigational drugs and have documentation from their treating physician confirming eligibility. \"Health benefit plan\" refers to any program that covers health benefits, including health care service plans and health insurance policies. (c) An investigational drug, biological product, or device has completed phase one of an FDA-approved clinical trial but is not yet approved for general use. (d) A physician is licensed under the Medical Practice Act or the Osteopathic Act. (e) The State regulatory board refers to the California Medical Board or the Osteopathic Medical Board of California. Terminal illness is a progressive disease or condition with significant functional impairment that will soon result in death without life-sustaining procedures. Written, informed consent is a signed document explaining approved products and treatments for the terminal illness. The eligible patient or their representative must agree with the physician that conventional treatments will not prolong life. They must specify the investigational drug or device and understand the potential outcomes, including the possibility of new symptoms or hastened death. (5) States that the patient's health plan or provider is not required to pay for the investigational treatment, unless mandated by law or contract.\n(6) Notes that eligibility for hospice care may be affected if the patient starts curative treatment with the investigational product, with the option to reinstate care if curative treatment ends and hospice requirements are met. The eligible patient is responsible for all expenses related to the investigational drug, biological product, or device, including liability extending to their estate. Manufacturers can provide their investigational products to eligible patients, but are not required to do so. Manufacturers can provide investigational products to eligible patients without compensation or require patients to pay associated costs. This article does not impact health care coverage required by state laws or existing coverage provisions. The article allows for coverage of investigational drugs or devices by health benefit plans or third-party administrators, but it is not mandatory. Government agencies are not required to pay for costs associated with these treatments. If an eligible patient dies during treatment with an investigational product, their heirs are not responsible for any outstanding debt related to the treatment. State regulatory boards cannot penalize physicians solely for recommending or prescribing investigational drugs to patients as long as it aligns with medical standards. Similarly, state agencies cannot change Medicare or Medicaid certification based solely on a healthcare provider's recommendation for an eligible patient to access investigational treatments. An official, employee, or agent of the state cannot block an eligible patient's access to investigational drugs. Violations of this rule are not subject to specific chapters. The article does not allow for a private cause of action against a manufacturer or any other person involved in the care of a patient using an investigational drug, as long as they are complying with the terms of the article and exercising reasonable care."
