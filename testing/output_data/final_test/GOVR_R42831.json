Congressional districts are reallocated among states, and boundaries can be changed by state governments. The redistricting process aims to ensure each congressional district has equal population representation within states and moderate population differences among states. The U.S. Constitution mandates that representatives be apportioned based on state population numbers, with district boundaries not crossing state lines. Congress can determine the House size within set limits, with single-member districts being the standard. The redistricting process in the United States ensures equal population representation within states and moderate population differences among states. Single-member districts are the norm in the House of Representatives, with each state divided into districts represented by one Member. Redistricting is carried out by each state, usually by state legislatures or nonpartisan/bipartisan commissions. The redistricting process in the United States involves using census data and other information to draw district boundaries on maps. Line-drawers now use smaller and more complicated geographic units like census tracts and blocks to create equal population districts. This process has evolved over time with changing legal requirements and improved technology. During the 1980s and 1990s, redistricting transitioned from manual methods to computerized databases and mapping software, allowing for more diverse district plans to be presented. However, limited access to sophisticated computer technology initially restricted participation in the redistricting process. Today, advancements in personal computer technology and affordable GIS software have enabled various groups and individuals to create and contribute to district maps, depending on state laws and procedures. The redistricting process is influenced by federal court rulings, statutory laws, state constitutions, and court rulings. Rules include population equality in districts, protection of minority rights against vote dilution, and the prohibition of using race as the sole factor in districting. The redistricting process is influenced by various factors including the U.S. Constitution's equal protection clause, geographic compactness, contiguity of districts, preservation of political subdivisions, communities of interest, protection of political incumbents, maintenance of current political representation, and promotion of electoral competition. The U.S. Constitution authorizes the apportionment of House seats based on population counts, but provides little guidance on the redistricting process. Congressional redistricting is primarily governed by judicial interpretation of constitutional rights and state laws, with historical standards for districts to be compact, contiguous, and equal in population. The Apportionment Acts of the 19th and early 20th centuries set standards for congressional districting, requiring districts to be composed of contiguous and compact territory with an equal number of inhabitants. These standards were not consistently enforced by states. The 1911 Apportionment Act set districting standards, which were later replaced by the Permanent Apportionment Act in 1929. From 1929 to 1967, there were no congressional standards for districting until the requirement for geographically based districts was re-imposed. Malapportionment, unequal representation by population within a state, has existed since the First Congress. Court cases starting in 1962 aimed to minimize malapportionment in congressional and state legislative districts. The purpose of apportionment and redistricting processes is to create fair representation and minimize deliberate manipulation of district boundaries to favor a particular political interest, known as gerrymandering. This term originated from Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry's redistricting cycle in 1800-1812. Gerrymandering involves manipulating district boundaries to favor a specific group by \"packing\" like-minded voters into fewer districts and \"cracking\" them across multiple districts to dilute their voting power. \"Cracking\" is the deliberate distribution of like-minded voters across multiple districts to dilute their voting strength, making it less likely for them to elect their preferred candidates. Gerrymandering traditionally referred to partisan gerrymandering, where district boundaries are manipulated to favor one political party, creating \"partisan bias.\" Racial gerrymandering can have two meanings. \"Racial gerrymandering\" has two meanings: diluting minority voting strength by white legislatures and creating oddly shaped racial districts. \"Bipartisan\" or \"incumbent gerrymandering\" favors incumbents to maintain the status quo in seat distribution. Both partisan and bipartisan gerrymandering are legal, except for racial gerrymandering. Gerrymandering, whether partisan or bipartisan, is legal and can have both positive and negative effects. It can enhance minority representation and promote political stability but can also be used to lock in partisan advantage or eliminate electoral competition. Some experts believe gerrymandering can have positive effects, such as increasing electoral responsiveness and reducing partisan bias, despite being considered unfair and a distortion of representation. Redistricting, whether partisan or bi-partisan, can increase electoral responsiveness by creating uncertainty and shaking up the political system. Courts traditionally avoided involvement in redistricting, but the Supreme Court's Baker v. Carr decision in 1962 set a new standard for equal congressional districts. The Supreme Court's decisions in Baker v. Carr and Wesberry v. Sanders have led to changes in congressional district boundaries in 12 out of 20 Congresses since 1964. States generally redistrict once a decade to ensure equal population representation in congressional elections. The Supreme Court's decisions since 1964 have imposed strict equal population requirements for congressional districts. States must adhere to population equality in redistricting, or risk being forced to redraw districts if challenged in court. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 and its 1982 amendment prohibit laws that diminish minority voting power. The Voting Rights Act prohibits election laws that reduce minority voting power, affecting congressional redistricting. The Supreme Court's 1986 decision in Thornburg v. Gingles emphasized the need to consider race in redistricting to prevent minority vote dilution. Minority groups must prove they are politically cohesive and able to elect their preferred candidate. The Voting Rights Act, particularly Section 5, established the rule of \"no retrogression\" to prevent minority vote dilution during redistricting. This led to the creation of \"majority-minority\" districts in the post-1990 congressional redistricting cycle, resulting in uniquely shaped districts to connect minority group members while complying with population equality rules. The post-1990 census districts were shaped in unusual ways to create \"majority-minority\" districts while complying with population equality rules. Some described this process as \"racial gerrymandering,\" leading to a Supreme Court ruling in Shaw v. Reno that oddly shaped districts concentrating a minority population may indicate improper drawing of congressional districts. Justice O'Connor emphasized the importance of appearances in reapportionment. The Voting Rights Act requires states to consider race during redistricting to prevent vote dilution, but districts cannot be drawn solely based on race according to the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled that there is no need to maximize majority-minority districts. The phrase \"traditional districting principles\" was coined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in Shaw v. Reno, emphasizing the importance of protecting racial and language minorities in redistricting. Violation of these principles may indicate potential racial gerrymandering, requiring scrutiny of the district plan. The burden is on the plaintiff to prove that race was the predominant factor in the legislature's decision-making process. The phrase \"traditional districting principles\" refers to rules used by states to draw district boundaries, emphasizing the importance of protecting racial and language minorities in redistricting. The burden is on the plaintiff to prove that race was the predominant factor in the legislature's decision-making process. The concept of \"traditional districting principles\" involves creating fair, compact, contiguous districts that respect communities and existing political boundaries. These principles aim to ensure equal representation and prevent unnecessary splitting of cities, towns, or counties. Traditional districting principles involve geographic and political components such as compactness, contiguity, preservation of political subdivisions, and protection of incumbents. Contiguity means that a district is not entirely separated by another district, with exceptions for islands. Contiguity was established early on for congressional districts but was not required in later legislation. The Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929 established contiguity as a requirement for drawing congressional district boundaries in 22 states. Contiguity promotes fairness, hinders gerrymandering, and provides a clear rule for the courts. The contiguity requirement for drawing congressional district boundaries promotes fairness, hinders gerrymandering, and provides a clear rule for the courts. Violations of contiguity, such as \"point contiguity,\" can indicate gerrymandering. Redistricting scholars have noted that contiguity alone may not deter determined gerrymanderers, and recent court decisions have made the definition of contiguous more confusing compared to compactness. Compactness, a criterion for drawing congressional or state legislative districts, is defined by shapes and geographic measures. Compact districts are believed to improve communication between representatives and constituents, enhance voter knowledge, and promote the perception of fairness in districting patterns. The perception of fair congressional districting patterns and the legitimacy of the redistricting process are enhanced by compactness. It is seen as a way to prevent gerrymandering and can be easily applied by judges. There are differing views on the role of compactness in drawing district boundaries, with some questioning its meaningfulness, others emphasizing its importance in preventing gerrymandering, and some suggesting it can still be useful alongside other criteria. Despite differing views on the role of compactness in redistricting, it is still considered useful in preventing gerrymandering. Districting based on political principles like preserving political subdivision boundaries and communities of interest can also help minimize gerrymandering attempts. The impact of district shape in redistricting remains a mystery to many, but it is still relevant due to U.S. Supreme Court decisions and state legal requirements. The preservation of county boundaries, contiguity, and compactness criteria have historically been important in constructing congressional district boundaries to prevent gerrymandering. Political subdivision boundaries have been split post-Baker v. Carr and due to Voting Rights Act redistricting requirements in some states. For the 2000 redistricting cycle, some states required the preservation of political subdivision boundaries and communities of interest in congressional redistricting to prevent gerrymandering. However, defining \"communities of interest\" can be challenging, making it difficult to use in boundary construction. Brickner suggests that preserving these boundaries may make it harder to gerrymander districts. The preservation of political subdivision boundaries and communities of interest in redistricting can make it easier to represent homogenous districts and reduce logistical challenges. However, this may conflict with the requirement for equal population districts, leading to a trade-off between boundaries and political equality. The courts recognize the importance of preserving prior district cores as redistricting criteria. In the 2000 redistricting cycle, states varied in their requirements for preserving prior district cores and protecting incumbents. While some states mandated preserving district cores, others allowed it. Protection of incumbents was allowed in some states but prohibited in others. Criticism exists regarding incumbent protection, with calls for drawing districts to enhance political competition and responsiveness to constituents. Electoral competition is seen as vital for democracy, promoting voter turnout, translating voter desires into policy, and ensuring accountability of representatives. Competitive districts can lead to more moderate candidates and reduce ideological polarization in Congress. However, there is concern that electoral competition in congressional races is declining, with gerrymandering being blamed by some for this trend. Others argue that factors other than redistricting are responsible for the decrease in competitiveness. The evidence suggests that factors like incumbency and homogenous communities contribute to the decline in partisan competition in congressional elections. Reformers propose using redistricting to create more competitive districts, but only a few states consider promoting political competition in this process. Some states have provisions to prevent favoritism towards a party during redistricting. Some argue that promoting partisan competition in redistricting may not succeed due to incumbency and districting rules. The idea of politically competitive districts is questioned, with concerns about representation and voter satisfaction. Proposals to pack districts with partisan supporters based on political strength are suggested to address gerrymandering issues. The responsibility for redistricting congressional districts lies with the states, usually with state legislatures. In some cases, independent commissions have taken over this role. This change aims to eliminate gerrymandering, increase voter satisfaction, and improve representation. For the 2010-2012 redistricting cycle, there is increased transparency in the process as seen on state legislatures' websites. The Republican Party has gained control of many state legislatures, giving them more influence in drawing congressional district boundaries. The Republican Party has gained control of many state legislatures, giving them more influence in drawing congressional district boundaries. Nine states saw changes in state legislature control, with some opting for commissions to minimize partisan gerrymandering and promote redistricting reform. Some states have redistricting commissions with varying authority and processes, such as only redistricting congressional or state legislative districts, or both. Commissions may require approval from the state legislature or governor, and membership selection methods differ. Arizona and a few other states have non-partisan redistricting commissions. Currently, Arizona and California have non-partisan redistricting commissions. Some states impose goal requirements for creating election districts, which may lead to more competitive congressional elections and reduce partisan polarization in Congress. Critics argue that current redistricting procedures allow for gerrymandering. Critics argue that current redistricting procedures allow elected officials to effectively choose their constituents, violating democratic principles. Limited congressional turnover and lack of competitive races are cited as evidence for the need for reform through non- or bi-partisan redistricting commissions. Several \"good government\" groups, such as Common Cause and the League of Women Voters, support the adoption of redistricting commissions. Seven states, including Arizona and California, require congressional redistricting plans to be drawn by commissions. The U.S. Congress has the authority to pass federal legislation affecting redistricting standards for congressional districts. Proposed legislation since the 1970s focused on requiring states to use redistricting commissions, specifying standards for redistricting, and imposing restrictions on redistricting. In the 93rd and 95th Congress, legislation was introduced by Representative James M. Hanley of New York to create bipartisan redistricting commissions, limit population differences in districts to 1%, consider communities of interest, and involve federal courts in challenges to redistricting plans. In the 96th and 97th Congress, various bills were introduced to establish redistricting commissions and prevent gerrymandering. Representative James M. Hanley reintroduced a limited proposal, Senator John Danforth proposed a commission for each state with population restrictions, and Representative Robert McClory aimed to prohibit favoritism in district boundaries. In the 93rd Congress, Representative J. Rinaldo of New Jersey introduced a bill similar to H.R. 3468, allowing qualified voters to enforce state compliance with district boundaries. This bill also prevented courts from invalidating state-drawn boundaries without substantial non-compliance with standards. State legislatures complained about redistricting schedules due to the lack of a specified date for census counts from the U.S. Census Bureau. In the 94th Congress, Representative White introduced H.R. 1753 (also H.R. 5035) which became law as P.L. 94-171. In the 2001 redistricting process in Texas, state courts drafted the plan due to the legislature's inability to agree. The plan kept existing district cores, equalized population, and added two seats. The redistricting plan in the 2002 election had a dramatic impact on the state legislature, shifting it from a divided to a single-party control. Concerns over the recognition of Republican electoral strength led to a second redistricting process by the Republican-controlled legislature. This process gained national media attention and prompted the introduction of three bills in the 108th Congress to limit redistricting frequency. In the 108th Congress, three bills were introduced to limit redistricting frequency, with additional bills introduced in the 109th and 110th Congresses. Representative Maxine Waters, Gene Green, and Carolyn B. Maloney introduced bills in the 108th Congress, with Representative Waters reintroducing her bill in the 109th Congress. In the 109th and 110th Congresses, proposals went beyond restricting redistricting frequency. The proposal introduced in the 108th Congress aimed to limit redistricting frequency to once per decade under certain conditions. It required states to establish independent redistricting commissions and outlined criteria for developing redistricting plans, including \"one person, one vote\" and adherence to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Voting history information was prohibited from being used by state commissions. The Lofgren proposal, similar to legislation by Representative Tanner and Senator Johnson, included provisions for expedited judicial review and private right of action. However, no action was taken on any of the proposals in the 111th Congress. Representative Tanner, Senator Johnson, and Representative Lofgren reintroduced their proposals in subsequent Congresses, but no action was taken beyond committee referral. In the 111th Congress, Representative Devin Nunes introduced H.R. 6250, a bill outlining standards for congressional redistricting, including political equality and transparency. Representative John Tanner did not seek reelection, and Representative Heath Shuler reintroduced the Tanner bill in his honor. In the area of redistricting reform, Representative Heath Shuler reintroduced the Tanner bill as H.R. 453 in the 112th Congress, renaming it the \"John Tanner Fairness and Independence in Redistricting Act.\" Other bills introduced include S. 694 by Senator Johnson, H.R. 590 by Representative Lofgren, H.R. 419 by Representative Jim Cooper, and H.R. 3846 by Representative Earl Blumenauer, focusing on public participation and transparency in the congressional redistricting process. Representative Earl Blumenauer introduced H.R. 3846, the \"National Commission for Independent Redistricting Act of 2012,\" which aims to establish a bipartisan commission to handle congressional redistricting. Members of the commission cannot be federal officials and must wait three years after the commission ends before seeking elected office. The commission will create redistricting plans for each state. The National Commission for Independent Redistricting Act of 2012, introduced by Representative Earl Blumenauer, establishes a bipartisan commission to create redistricting plans for each state. The commission must consider criteria such as population equality, Voting Rights Act compliance, geographic continuity, compactness, and restrictions on using voting history information. The bill introduced by Representative Blumenauer aims to reform the redistricting process by restricting the use of certain information and promoting public participation and transparency. However, it is unlikely to significantly change the makeup of the House membership. No action has been taken on any redistricting bills in this Congress so far. The redistricting process determines the number and location of seats in the House of Representatives for each state based on population counts. It is a state process governed by federal law, with the goal of drawing boundaries for fair representation. If Congress legislates in this area, its authority comes from Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution. Gerrymandering distorts representation and diminishes electoral responsiveness by favoring certain interests during redistricting. Rules for drawing congressional boundaries aim to ensure fairness by maintaining population equality, protecting minorities from vote dilution, promoting geographic compactness, minimizing split political subdivisions, and preserving historical continuity. Most redistricting is currently done by state legislatures, leading to concerns about partisan gerrymandering and incumbents' protection. Efforts to create independent redistricting commissions have been successful at the state level, but federal legislation to implement them nationwide has faced challenges."
