    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Investing for Tomorrow's Schools Act of 2007\". The Congress finds that $29.08 billion was spent on education infrastructure in 2004, with an average new high school cost of $27 million. $127 billion is needed for school repair and construction. 14 million students attend schools needing extensive repairs. School facility conditions impact student achievement. Students in schools with poor conditions fall behind by 10.9 percentage points compared to those in excellent buildings. Moving students to new facilities can lead to a 20% increase in test scores. 52% of schools lack technology elements, affecting 21.3 million students. Local educational agencies struggle to finance school improvements. Collaboration is needed to address challenges in public schools and libraries. The deplorable state of collections in America's public school libraries has increased demands on public libraries, with many substituting for school libraries. Research shows that 50 percent of a child's intellectual development occurs before age 4, highlighting the critical role of public and school libraries in early childhood development by providing books and educational resources. Public and school libraries play a crucial role in early childhood development by offering a variety of books and resources to give every child a head start in life and learning. The State Infrastructure Bank Pilot Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, may establish State infrastructure banks and multistate infrastructure banks to provide loans for building or repairing schools and libraries. Congress grants consent for interstate compacts between States for this purpose. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, can establish State and multistate infrastructure banks to provide loans for schools and libraries. Grants will be made for initial capital, and repayments will be used to make additional loans. Each State must meet infrastructure bank requirements to establish a bank under this section. Each State establishing an infrastructure bank under this section must contribute a minimum of 25 percent of the capitalization grant from non-Federal sources. The State must identify an operating entity capable of managing loan funds and issuing debt instruments to leverage the funds. Funds can be used as reserves for debt issued by the State, with investment income generated credited to the account for providing loans. The infrastructure bank must ensure that funds are available for loans to eligible projects, invested in approved instruments to earn interest, and that loans bear interest at or below the lowest rates for tax-exempt bonds. Repayment of loans must start within a year of project completion, and loan terms should be reasonable. An infrastructure bank can provide loans to local educational agencies or public libraries for eligible projects. The bank must ensure loan repayment within 30 years and submit annual reports to the Secretary. The infrastructure bank requires detailed information for renovation projects, including descriptions of deficiencies, corrective actions, improvements, cost estimates, energy conservation plans, and any other necessary information. Final action on completed applications must be taken within 90 days. The infrastructure bank considers applications for loans based on fiscal capacity, safety concerns for students, and demonstrated need for construction, reconstruction, or renovation projects. Qualifying Projects for loans from an infrastructure bank include construction of new schools, repair or upgrading of classrooms, activities to increase safety, and enhancements to educational facilities based on age and condition. The curr_chunk discusses activities to enhance educational facilities, address environmental hazards, provide basic infrastructure for educational technology, and bring facilities into conformity with environmental and safety regulations. The curr_chunk discusses various activities such as enhancing educational facilities, addressing environmental hazards like asbestos, and constructing or upgrading public library facilities. These activities aim to improve energy efficiency, comply with environmental regulations, and support educational technology. The Davis-Bacon Act wage requirements apply to individuals employed on specified projects. The Secretary will establish Healthy, High Performance School Guidelines for energy-efficient construction and renovation of schools and libraries. The Healthy, High Performance School Guidelines cover aspects such as efficiency, renewable energy, water use, building materials, and indoor environmental quality for new construction or renovation projects funded by loans from an infrastructure bank. Loans from the bank should supplement, not replace, other available funds. Repayment of loans from the infrastructure bank is subject to limitations. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish procedures for an infrastructure bank, with Federal funds not creating obligations or guarantees for the United States. The establishment of an infrastructure bank with Federal funds does not create a commitment, guarantee, or obligation for the United States. Sections 3335 and 6503 of title 31, United States Code, do not apply to funds contributed. States can use up to 2 percent of Federal funds for bank administration costs. The Secretary of the Treasury will review the financial condition of each bank and report to Congress within 90 days. Authorization of appropriations is granted for grants to States for bank capitalization. The infrastructure banks are authorized to be appropriated $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and the next 4 fiscal years. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
