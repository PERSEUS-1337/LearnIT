The First Special Service Force, known as the \"Force,\" was a joint American-Canadian unit activated in July 1942 at Fort Harrison near Helena, Montana. It was intended to target military and industrial installations supporting the German war effort. Volunteers trained in hazardous conditions in Montana and Virginia from July 1942 to June 1943. The combat echelon consisted of 1,800 soldiers, half American and half Canadian, with an additional 800 American members in the Service Battalion. The American members of the Service Battalion formed a special bond with Canadian soldiers in the joint American-Canadian unit known as the First Special Service Force. In October 1943, the Force went to Italy and fought in battles south of Cassino, including Monte La Difensa and Monte Majo. On December 3, 1943, the Force's units ascended to the top of La Difensa's precipitous face, overcoming fierce resistance to overtake the German line. After battles on Italian peaks like Sammucro, Vischiataro, and Remetanea, the Force's combat units were reduced from 1,800 to fewer than 500. In 1944, they went to the Anzio Beachhead for 4 months, engaging in raids and patrols. On June 4, 1944, they were the first Allied troops to liberate Rome. After Rome, they moved to southern Italy to assist in the liberation of France. On August 15, 1944, the Force made silent landings on Les Iles D'Hyeres, small islands in the Mediterranean Sea along the southern coast of France. The First Special Service Force faced intense German resistance as they progressed from the islands to the Franco-Italian border. After securing the border, the Force was disbanded on December 5, 1944, in Nice, France. In 251 days of combat, they suffered 2,314 casualties, captured 30,000 prisoners, and never failed a mission. The United States honors their bravery and selflessness in covert missions for freedom. The First Special Service Force played a crucial role in repelling the Nazi advance in Europe and liberating French and Italian communities. The bond between American and Canadian service members remains strong, with annual reunions alternating between the two countries. The traditions and honors of the Force are carried on by active units in the Special Forces of the United States and Canada.
