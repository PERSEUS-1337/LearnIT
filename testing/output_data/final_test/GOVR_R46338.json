    "content": "The President has 10 days to act on presented legislation, considering advice from officials. Options include signing the bill into law, allowing it to become law without signature, or vetoing it. Vetoed bills can be returned to the originating House with objections. The President can veto a bill by returning it to Congress with objections, known as a return veto. If Congress is adjourned, the President can also use a pocket veto by not signing the bill. This type of veto can be controversial as it may prevent Congress from overriding it. To override a return veto, Congress may \"proceed to reconsider\" the bill and pass it with a two-thirds majority in each chamber before the end of the Congress. If successful, the veto is overridden, and the bill becomes law; if unsuccessful, the veto is sustained, and the bill does not become law. Congress cannot override a pocket veto. Recent Presidents and Congresses have disagreed on what constitutes an adjournment that prevents the return of a bill for a pocket veto. Veto threats may deter Congress from passing legislation opposed by the President, as a two-thirds majority is needed to override a veto. The President's veto power serves as a reminder to Congress of his legislative role and can influence the creation of bills. Veto threats are crucial in understanding the President's use of this power, often communicated through SAPs or verbally, and sometimes via social media. Trump has utilized social media to convey his stance on bills, including intentions to veto, oppose, or support them. Presidents can signal their position early in the legislative process through verbal statements, written communications, or formal SAPs issued by the Office of Management and Budget. Verbal veto threats may be accompanied by strategies for working with Congress and a warning to veto legislation if the President's policy agenda is not followed. President Bush and President Obama used their words to deter Congress from passing bills that did not align with their policy agenda and remind the public of their veto power. SAPs are used to express the President's support or opposition to legislation, inserting the Administration's views into the legislative debate. SAPs provide Presidents with a way to assert support or opposition to legislation, including the possibility of vetoing a bill. Congressional leaders view SAPs as indicators of potential veto threats, with written threats being more formal than verbal ones. When the Administration issues a veto threat, it can be in the form of a presidential veto threat or a senior advisors veto threat. The former signals strong opposition to the bill, while the latter may indicate a willingness to negotiate with Congress. Veto threats can pressure Congress to support the President's agenda and often propose compromises to avoid a veto. During the Obama and Bush Administrations, veto threats were not always issued before vetoing legislation. Three-quarters of SAPs were on non-appropriations bills, signaling intent to veto or support a bill. Non-appropriations bill SAPs focus on specific policy objections, while appropriations bill SAPs involve general budgetary policy objections. The President may support or oppose provisions in appropriations bills for programmatic or budgetary reasons. This report analyzes the impact of veto threats in non-appropriations bill SAPs, focusing on data from the Bush and Obama Administrations. The analysis focuses on veto threats in non-appropriations bill SAPs during the Bush and Obama Administrations. The proportion of SAPs with veto threats increased over time, but direct effects on bill outcomes are difficult to determine. During both President Bush's and President Obama's second terms, the number of veto threats in SAPs reached its peak. The Bush Administration issued 491 SAPs on non-appropriations bills, with 24% containing veto threats. Out of the bills with presidential veto threats, one was signed, seven were vetoed, and 16 did not reach the President's desk. For bills with senior advisors' veto threats, 16 were signed, one was vetoed, and 77 were not passed by both chambers. During President Bush's second term, the number of veto threats in SAPs sharply increased, reaching 107 in the 110th Congress. This rise coincided with Democrats gaining control of both chambers of Congress. The partisan makeup of Congress and whether the Administration is in its first or second term may impact the number of veto threats issued. During President Bush's second term, the number of veto threats in SAPs sharply increased, reaching 107 in the 110th Congress. The rarity of presidential veto threats in the Bush Administration suggests they were used sparingly as a message. In a second term, executive branch officials may become more adept at coordinating the veto power, allowing for a stronger stance on unfavorable legislation. During President Bush's second term, the number of veto threats in SAPs sharply increased, reaching 107 in the 110th Congress. In comparison, the Obama Administration steadily increased its use of veto threats in every subsequent Congress, issuing 472 SAPs on non-appropriations bills. During the Obama Administration, 48% of the 472 SAPs on non-appropriations bills contained a veto threat, with 43 from the President and 186 from senior advisors. The President vetoed five bills, signed four after issuing a veto threat, and 34 did not reach his desk. Senior advisors vetoed two bills, signed 17 after a veto threat, and 167 did not pass both chambers. Obama issued more veto threats with each passing Congress, illustrated in Figure 4. The number of veto threats increased during the Obama presidency, with a rise from 8 in the 111th Congress to 104 in the 114th Congress. However, the percentage of presidential veto threats remained relatively low, ranging from 14.3% to 28.3%. The increase in total veto threats may suggest more legislation opposed by President Obama, but most were from senior advisors. This indicates that presidential veto threats were used sparingly compared to senior advisors. President Obama's use of veto threats differed between his first and second terms. During Obama's first term, 69% of SAPs had no veto threat, while 27% had a senior advisor's threat and 4% had a presidential threat. In his second term, 39% had no threat, 49% had a senior advisor's threat, and 13% had a presidential threat. Analysis showed Bush used partial and whole bill veto threats equally, but the type of threat varied. President Bush and President Obama used veto threats differently. Bush issued equal amounts of partial and whole bill veto threats, with 7% and 34% being presidential threats respectively. The remaining were senior advisor threats. In contrast, Obama issued partial bill veto threats less frequently, with 8% being presidential threats. The difference in frequency suggests a different approach to negotiating with Congress. The increased frequency of partial bill senior advisors veto threats suggests that Presidents preferred using presidential veto threats for rejecting entire bills and senior advisors veto threats for negotiating parts of a bill. Bills were less likely to pass when receiving a senior advisors veto threat compared to a presidential veto threat, possibly due to the higher frequency of senior advisor threats. During the Bush and Obama Administrations, bills that received presidential veto threats were vetoed more often than those that received senior advisor threats. Across both presidencies, bills that passed both chambers and were met with a presidential veto threat were followed by a veto 70.6% of the time, while bills that received a senior advisor veto threat were later vetoed 8.3% of the time. President Bush exercised the veto power 12 times, with four overridden vetoes. Six vetoed bills were forewarned with a written veto threat, three of which were preceded by a statement of opposition. None of the bills that Congress later overrode were preceded by a presidential veto threat. President Obama vetoed 12 bills, with Congress overriding his veto once. Unlike President Bush, all of Obama's veto threats were whole bill veto threats. Obama either issued no statement or a statement with a veto threat, marking a different approach. President Obama's approach to veto threats on bills differs from President Bush's, as Obama issued whole bill veto threats without issuing statements."
