The United States Army School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia has a history of human rights abuses among its graduates, hindering efforts to improve relations with Latin American armed forces post-Cold War. Closing the school would not impede the US from providing necessary training to these forces. The United States has an extensive training relationship with Latin American armed forces, including the School of the Americas, Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies, Inter-American Air Forces Academy, and Small Craft Instruction and Technical Training School. Latin American military personnel also train with US Armed Forces members in various institutions and with the over 50,000 active-duty US Armed Forces in Latin America each year. The United States has an extensive training relationship with Latin American armed forces, including the School of the Americas. Graduates of the school have been linked to human rights abuses in the western hemisphere, such as the murder of Jesuit priests in El Salvador and the killing of an anthropologist in Guatemala. Colombian army officers cited in a work on human rights abuses are also among the graduates. The School of the Americas has trained individuals linked to human rights abuses in Latin America, including leaders like Roberto D'Aubuisson, Manuel Noriega, Leopoldo Galtieri, and others involved in atrocities such as the murder of Archbishop Oscar Romero and the El Mozote massacre. The United States Army School of the Americas has only made limited reforms despite pressure following the rape and murder of four American churchwomen in El Salvador. Its continued operation associates the U.S. with the abuses of its graduates. The United States Army School of the Americas located at Fort Benning, Georgia is required to be closed within 30 days of the enactment of this Act. The statutory authority for the school is repealed, and there is a sense of Congress regarding all other training of foreign military personnel by the United States. In training activities with foreign security forces, Congress emphasizes respect for human rights, military's role in democracy, and transparent defense management. The Department of Defense must screen foreign candidates to prevent training individuals involved in human rights abuses, drug trafficking, or corruption. The term \"training activity\" refers to military education and training provided by the United States to foreign security forces, whether conducted domestically or internationally. This includes various programs such as international military education and training, international narcotics control, activities under specific acts like the National Defense Authorization Act, and activities for special operations forces."
