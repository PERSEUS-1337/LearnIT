    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act of 1995\". The Congress finds that approximately half of individuals in the United States with blood-clotting disorders were exposed to HIV through blood-clotting agents. The Federal Government shares responsibility with the blood-products industry for regulating the safety of the blood supply and clotting agents. Blood products are more strictly regulated than most products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. During 1980-1987, individuals with blood-clotting disorders, like hemophilia, faced a preventable risk of contracting HIV due to contaminated anti-hemophilic factor. Despite concerns about blood-borne viruses, the Federal Government did not mandate the use of available technology in the blood-products industry to ensure safety. The blood-products industry failed to ensure the safety of blood products for individuals with blood-clotting disorders like hemophilia, leading to potential infection with fatal diseases. The Federal Government did not require the industry to provide all available information about the risks of contaminated blood products, neglecting its responsibility to regulate effectively. (8) 17 developed countries have compensation programs for individuals with blood-clotting disorders infected with HIV; (9) Those with hemophilia and HIV face high annual medical costs exceeding $150,000; (10) Ricky Ray, born with hemophilia, contracted HIV from contaminated blood products; (11) Ricky Ray's case highlights the suffering of individuals with hemophilia and their families affected by HIV. The purpose of this Act is to provide partial restitution to individuals infected with HIV from contaminated blood products between 1980 and 1987. Ricky Ray, who died at 15 from hemophilia-associated AIDS, inspired the Act. The Trust Fund established under this Act aims to provide restitution to individuals infected with HIV from contaminated blood products between 1980 and 1987. The \"Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States and administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. Amounts in the Fund are to be invested in accordance with specific regulations, and any interest or proceeds from investments will be credited to the Fund. The Fund will be available for disbursement by the Attorney General under section 5 and will terminate after a 5-year period, with any remaining amounts to be liquidated and deposited back into the Fund. The \"Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund\" will be liquidated after 5 years, and any remaining funds will be deposited into the miscellaneous receipts account in the Treasury of the United States. $1,000,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated to the Fund for this Act. SEC. 4. CLAIMS RELATING TO BLOOD-CLOTTING DISORDERS AND HIV. Individuals with HIV infection can receive $125,000 from the Fund if they have a blood-clotting disorder and were treated with blood-clotting agents between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 1987, or if they are the spouse of someone with a blood-clotting disorder. The individual can receive $125,000 from the Fund if they acquired HIV infection through perinatal transmission from a parent with a blood-clotting disorder. A claim must be filed with the Attorney General, who will determine if it meets the Act's requirements. SEC. 5. DETERMINATION AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. The Attorney General establishes filing procedures for individuals to submit claims for payment under the Act, requiring written medical documentation of a blood-clotting disorder. Claims are determined by the Attorney General and paid from the Fund if they meet the Act's requirements, including payments for deceased individuals. If an individual referred to in section 4 is deceased when payment is made under this section, the payment goes to the individual's estate if it exists. If there is no estate, the payment is made to the surviving spouse or equally among living children. If an individual eligible for payment under the Act dies before filing a claim, the estate or a survivor can file a claim on their behalf. If the individual has no surviving spouse or children, the payment will be made to the parents in equal shares. The Act allows for a survivor to file a claim for payment on behalf of an individual eligible under the Act. Definitions for \"spouse,\" \"child,\" and \"parent\" are provided. The Attorney General is restricted in the timing of payments. The Attorney General is limited in the timing of payments under the Act. An individual entitled to a payment can choose to receive a lump sum of $125,000 or 4 subpayments. The Attorney General shall make payments in 4 subpayments: $50,000 within 90 days, followed by three $25,000 payments every 6 months. Claims must be determined within 90 days of filing, and payment settles claims against the United States. The Attorney General will make payments to individuals or estates affected by HIV infection and treatment with blood-clotting agents between 1980 and 1987. No administrative costs can be deducted from the payments. The Attorney General's duties will end when the Fund terminates. Payments under this Act do not affect payments under other laws. The Attorney General will make payments to individuals or estates affected by HIV infection and treatment with blood-clotting agents between 1980 and 1987. Payments received shall be treated as damages for personal injuries, not included as income for benefit eligibility purposes. The Attorney General should use existing resources to carry out functions and may issue necessary regulations. Initial regulations, guidelines, and procedures will be issued to implement the Act. The Act requires regulations to be issued within 90 days of enactment. Judicial review for denied compensation claims can be sought in a US district court, which will review based on the administrative record and set aside denials that are arbitrary or not in accordance with the law. SEC. 6. LIMITATION ON TRANSFER AND NUMBER OF CLAIMS. Claims under this Act are not assignable or transferable. The Attorney General can only pay 1 claim per victim. SEC. 7. LIMITATIONS ON CLAIMS. Claims must be filed within 3 years of the Act's enactment. SEC. 8. CERTAIN CLAIMS NOT AFFECTED BY PAYMENT. SEC. 8.

Violators may be fined up to $50,000. SEC. 10. Definitions. SEC. 10. DEFINITIONS. The terms \"AIDS,\" \"Fund,\" and \"HIV\" are defined in this Act."
