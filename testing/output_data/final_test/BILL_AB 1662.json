    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. PART 6.5 of Division 9 of the Public Utilities Code in California introduces regulations for Unmanned Aircraft Systems. In case of an accident causing injury or property damage, the operator must land the aircraft safely and provide identification and contact information to the affected individual. In case of an accident involving an unmanned aircraft system, the operator must notify the property owner, provide identification, leave a written notice with contact information, and report the incident to the police or sheriff's department promptly. The operator of an unmanned aircraft system must provide their employer's name and address if commercial, failure to comply is punishable by a fine of up to $250 or imprisonment for up to six months and/or a fine of up to $1,000. When operating an unmanned aircraft system, compliance with regulations is required unless it interferes with duties or poses a risk of injury or property damage. This applies to law enforcement officers and employees, as well as individuals involved in organized sports, leagues, or clubs, especially in cases of injury or property damage. For unmanned aircraft operations, exemptions or authorizations from the FAA are exempt from certain regulations. Definitions for \"unmanned aircraft\" and \"unmanned aircraft system\" are provided. The section clarifies that it does not impact other laws regarding accidents involving unmanned aircraft systems. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts as the act pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes."
