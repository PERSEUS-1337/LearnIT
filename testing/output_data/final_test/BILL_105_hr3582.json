Staff will analyze requests and circulate them if they meet the standard. The staff will circulate a statement and draft response to Commission members regarding a request. The Commission will issue the response after a 3-day period, unless any member objects. A written response issued under this section provides a safe harbor for individuals acting in good faith based on its provisions. The Commission will make public any request for a written response and the responses issued under this section, while maintaining the confidentiality of the person submitting the request unless authorized otherwise. The Commission will compile and publish a detailed index of responses issued under this section, allowing for easy access based on subjects.

The standard form for complaints is prescribed by the Commission and must not include extraneous materials. Disclaimer language for complaints is strengthened by the Commission. The Commission's written notice of a complaint includes a cover letter and a statement informing the recipient that the complaint has been filed but not verified. The recipient has 15 days to respond before any decision is made to pursue the complaint. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended to ban candidates and political committees from accepting cash contributions over $100. This Act applies to elections after January 1999."
