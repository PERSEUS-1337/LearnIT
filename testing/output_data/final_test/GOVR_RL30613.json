    "content": "Since being removed from the U.S. state sponsors of terrorism list in 2008, North Korea's actions have prompted calls for its reinstatement. Calls intensified in 2010 after a South Korean naval vessel was sunk by a North Korean submarine, leading to a multinational investigation and efforts to bring the case before the United Nations Security Council. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak announced measures against North Korea after a naval attack, including restrictions on North-South trade and visits. Investments in the Kaesong industrial complex were halted, and the number of South Korean personnel there was reduced. Exceptions were made for humanitarian aid and the industrial complex outside of Kaesong. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton supported South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's measures against North Korea, stating they were \"prudent and entirely appropriate.\" President Obama directed U.S. agencies to review policies related to North Korea. The State Department continually reviews North Korea's actions for potential designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. Israeli sources reported a reshipment of North Korean rockets. The State Department did not consider the sinking of the Cheonan by North Korea as an act of international terrorism, despite reports of arms shipments from North Korea to Hamas and Hezbollah. Israeli sources reported the reshipment of North Korean rockets. The sinking of the Cheonan by North Korea was not considered an act of international terrorism by the State Department. The Secretary of State can designate a country as a State Sponsor of Terrorism based on various criteria, including consistent support for international terrorism. The criteria for designating a country as a State Sponsor of Terrorism include supplying terrorist organizations with support and financial assistance. The ambiguity of the criteria allows for discretion in decision-making. On June 28, 2010, the State Department issued a press release regarding this matter. The State Department did not place North Korea back on the terrorism list in 2010 due to lack of repeated support for international terrorism. Countries on the list face trade restrictions, export controls, and limitations on military equipment sales. Being listed can also result in denial of beneficial trade designations, unfavorable tax status for investors, and stricter licensing requirements for trade with the U.S. Foreign aid under the Foreign Assistance Act is prohibited, with exceptions for humanitarian assistance. The United States spent millions on aid to North Korea despite being on the terrorism list. Removal from the list in 2008 did not lead to increased bilateral trade. U.S. assistance programs were unaffected by the change in status. The impact of re-listing North Korea on the terrorism list would likely be symbolic, as it may signal a distancing from previous nuclear agreements. This could setback the prospects for resuming six-party talks and strengthen hard-liners within the regime. If North Korea is re-listed on the terrorism list, it could be seen as a move to solidify support for Kim Jong-il's son, Kim Jong-un, amidst concerns about the elder Kim's failing health. This decision may also be used by North Korean leaders to shift blame onto the United States and its allies for any future tensions on the Korean Peninsula, potentially causing opposition from China. However, South Korea and Japan may welcome this move. The Bush Administration removed North Korea from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2008 as part of an agreement on verifying North Korea's nuclear program. This decision could serve as an obstacle to future talks and a bargaining lever for the United States. Many analysts believe the decision was influenced more by political and diplomatic factors than legal criteria. President Bush announced his intent to remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism after 45 days, as required by U.S. law. Congress had the opportunity to block the removal with legislation, subject to presidential veto. The President planned to remove North Korea on August 11, 2008, following the 45-day notification period. The U.S.-North Korean nuclear agreement aimed to implement measures from a February 2007 agreement reached in six-party talks. The U.S.-North Korean agreement, signed on June 26, 2008, includes obligations for both parties. North Korea is to disable its plutonium nuclear facilities at Yongbyon and provide a complete declaration of its nuclear programs. The U.S. agreed to lift economic sanctions and remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. North Korea rejected the U.S. plan for a verification system, leading to the Bush Administration not removing North Korea from the terrorism support list in August 2008. North Korea then announced a halt to the disablement program at Yongbyon and planned to restart its plutonium reprocessing plant. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill negotiated a more limited verification deal in October 2008. In October 2008, North Korea agreed to a verification deal focusing on Yongbyon, leading to a resumption of disablement. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice removed North Korea from the terrorism list, but this did not expedite the conclusion of the 2007 nuclear agreement. Disagreements arose over inspection details, including the sampling of nuclear materials at Yongbyon. Delivery of promised heavy oil by the non-North Korea parties was also incomplete. The incoming Obama Administration faced issues after North Korea completed the delivery of 1 million tons of heavy oil promised in the February 2007 agreement. Japan strongly reacted to the U.S. delisting of North Korea, linking it to the resolution of kidnapping cases. U.S.-North Korean diplomacy has revolved around North Korea's inclusion on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism since 2000, with key stages in 2000, 2003-2004, and February 2007. The Agreed Framework was the core of U.S.-North Korean diplomacy until 2000. The Agreed Framework signed in 1994 focused on North Korea's nuclear program, with U.S. obligations including economic and diplomatic measures. The issue of North Korea's removal from the U.S. terrorism list was not addressed in the agreement. In 1999, the Clinton Administration introduced the Perry Initiative for new U.S.-North Korean negotiations on North Korea's missile program, offering economic and diplomatic benefits for a verifiable cessation of the program. The Clinton Administration sought normalization of U.S.-North Korean relations by inviting a high-level North Korean official to Washington. North Korea demanded removal from the U.S. terrorism list as a pre-condition, which was eventually met in 2000. This issue resurfaced in 2003 when the Bush Administration accused North Korea of operating a secret uranium enrichment program, leading to a new round of diplomacy. The Bush Administration accused North Korea of violating the Agreed Framework, leading to the end of U.S. obligations. North Korea retaliated by reopening nuclear facilities and withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Multilateral negotiations involving six governments began in April 2003, with North Korea demanding concessions from the U.S. in exchange for nuclear concessions. The proposal by North Korea in 2004 reiterated demands for concessions in exchange for a freeze on their plutonium nuclear programs. Bilateral meetings in 2006 and 2007 laid the groundwork for a nuclear agreement announced in February 2007, creating a \"working group\" for normalization of relations between North Korea and the U.S. The U.S. and DPRK will engage in talks to resolve issues and move towards full diplomatic relations. Steps to remove DPRK from the terrorism list include issuing a guarantee, providing evidence of no terrorist acts, joining anti-terrorism agreements, and addressing past support of terrorism. South Korea supports the U.S. in responding to North Korea's demands. South Korea supported the U.S. in responding to North Korea's demand for removal from the terrorism list. Japan urged the Clinton Administration to address North Korean terrorist acts, including kidnappings of Japanese citizens and harboring of terrorists, as conditions for removal. The U.S. State Department considered resolving these issues important in addressing concerns about North Korean support of terrorism. According to sources, U.S. officials raised the kidnapping issue with North Korea during negotiations over the terrorism list. Japan intensified diplomacy on terrorism in September and October 2000 as the U.S. prepared for high-level talks with North Korea. Japan urged the Clinton Administration to address terrorism concerns in U.S.-North Korean exchanges and not remove North Korea from the terrorism list. The visit of North Korean military leader Jo Myong-rok to Washington in October 2000 resulted in general statements opposing terrorism, but Secretary Albright's planned visit to Pyongyang did not indicate a removal of North Korea from the terrorism list. The Clinton Administration did not plan to remove North Korea from the terrorism list despite Japan's efforts. During Albright's visit to North Korea, she raised the issue of kidnapped Japanese citizens with Kim Jong-il. Japan's concerns over terrorism were given higher priority in U.S. negotiations with North Korea, shifting the focus away from South Korea's position. The Bush Administration's policy towards North Korea's inclusion on the terrorism-supporting list shifted focus to concerns over nuclear weapons and the Japanese kidnapping issue. They refused to discuss U.S.-North Korean relations until North Korea took steps to dismantle its nuclear programs. Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear programs and the Bush Administration proposed a detailed plan at the six party talks in June 2004. The plan involved North Korea freezing its nuclear programs, submitting to international verification, and eventually dismantling all nuclear programs. The Administration linked North Korea's actions to the terrorism-support list and the kidnapping of Japanese citizens. In 2001, the Bush Administration assured Japan that it would continue to raise the kidnapping issue with North Korea and not remove North Korea from the U.S. terrorism-support list. During the six party talks, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly urged North Korea to settle the kidnapping issue with Japan. The State Department cited the kidnapping of Japanese citizens as a reason for including North Korea on the terrorism-support list in 2004. In September 2002, North Korea admitted to kidnapping Japanese citizens during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi. The issue continued to be a key factor in negotiations between Japan and North Korea. The US designated North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, with President Bush and other officials pledging support for Japan. In May 2003, President Bush stated the US fully supports Japan in finding abducted citizens. Condoleezza Rice also emphasized the US's priority in addressing the kidnapping issue. In April 2004, Vice President Cheney expressed support for Japan's demand for resolution of North Korea's kidnappings. Japan and North Korea engaged in secret negotiations in mid-2002, leading to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il admitting to the abduction of 13 Japanese citizens. In May 2004, Prime Minister Koizumi secured the release of six children of the kidnapped Japanese, but doubts remained about the truthfulness of North Korea's claims. Japan had doubts about North Korea's claim that 8 kidnapped Japanese were dead and their remains washed away. In 2006, Japan added 3 more missing citizens to the list. Claims emerged that North Korea had kidnapped hundreds of Japanese. The Bush Administration supported Japan's efforts but urged them not to provide financial aid to North Korea until nuclear and missile issues were resolved. Japan complied with U.S. urgings, highlighting its importance in U.S. policy towards North Korea. Japan's role in the six party talks was crucial for any settlement with North Korea involving economic benefits. The Bush Administration pushed Japan to condition aid on resolving the nuclear issue first. In 2004, a detailed settlement proposal was put forth, with Japan financing heavy oil for North Korea. In the initial stage of settlement, Korea would receive heavy oil financed by Japan and South Korea. The United States offered negotiations on North Korea's energy needs, requiring Japanese financial input. Japan imposed economic sanctions on North Korea and joined the Proliferation Security Initiative to curb proliferation activities. In response to North Korea's missile and atomic bomb tests, Japan imposed strong economic sanctions in 2006. The Bush Administration obtained U.N. Security Council sanctions after North Korea's atomic bomb test in October 2006. The Bush Administration changed its policy on the North Korean nuclear issue after the atomic bomb test in October 2006. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill directed the changes, including actively seeking bilateral talks with North Korea. Assistant Secretary Hill negotiated details of the six-party agreement in late 2006 and early 2007. The U.S. policy objective towards North Korea's nuclear programs shifted towards dismantlement. The Bush Administration's policy objective towards North Korea's nuclear programs shifted towards dismantlement after the atomic bomb test in October 2006. The February 2007 Six Party Agreement focused on freezing and disabling North Korean nuclear facilities, signaling a containment policy objective. The Administration aimed for full nuclear dismantlement by 2008, but the realistic prospect of success lay in negotiating and implementing the agreement's two phases. The Bush Administration shifted its policy towards North Korea's nuclear programs after the 2006 atomic bomb test. The February 2007 Six Party Agreement aimed for freezing and disabling nuclear facilities. The Administration sought full dismantlement by 2008, focusing on implementing the agreement's two phases. The Rice-Hill strategy linked North Korea's removal from the terrorism list to successful implementation of obligations under Phase Two of the agreement. In January 2007, Hill suggested removing North Korea from the U.S. terrorism list if they dismantled nuclear programs. North Korea offered to disable Yongbyon by March 2008 if relations normalized. This exclusive linkage was part of the Bush Administration's strategy towards North Korea. In July 2007, the Bush Administration began to separate the Japanese kidnapping issue from the terrorism-support list. Secretary of State Rice informed Japanese Prime Minister Abe that there was no legal obligation to link the two issues. President Bush expressed concern over the kidnappings during a press conference in August 2007. Assistant Secretary of State Hill urged North Korea to negotiate progress on the kidnapping issue with Japan in September 2007. In September 2007, Assistant Secretary of State Hill and North Korean negotiator Kim Gye-gwan agreed to complete Phase Two of the nuclear agreement by December 31, 2007. This included North Korea's obligations to disable Yongbyon installations and declare its nuclear programs. There were discussions about removing North Korea from the terrorism list as part of the implementation process. The six parties issued a statement on October 3, 2007, with a target deadline of December 31, 2007, implying a U.S. commitment to remove North Korea. The U.S. committed to removing North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and the Trading with the Enemy Act as part of the nuclear agreement implementation process. Christopher Hill emphasized that fulfilling these commitments depended on North Korea's completion of its Second-Phase obligations. The October 3, 2007, statement represented a \"two for two deal\" between the Bush Administration and North Korea. The Bush Administration and North Korea made reciprocal obligations in a nuclear agreement. North Korea agreed to disable its Yongbyon nuclear installations and provide a complete declaration of its nuclear programs. The US agreed to remove North Korea from the state sponsors of terrorism list and sanctions. Implementation of the agreement was delayed by North Korea's reluctance to disclose its plutonium activities. The Bush Administration's nuclear agreement with North Korea was hindered by North Korea's refusal to disclose details of its plutonium and uranium programs, as well as its proliferation activities with Syria. The declaration issue was addressed by lowering the information requirements for North Korea, focusing only on certain elements of its plutonium program. The State Department's annual report on terrorism in April 2008 highlighted the ongoing negotiations with North Korea. The State Department's annual Country Reports on Terrorism in April 2008 mentioned the United States' intention to remove North Korea from the terrorism support list as part of the six-party talks process. Despite unresolved issues like the Japanese kidnapping problem, North Korea was deemed to have met the criteria for delisting. President Bush's announcement in June 2008 aimed to fulfill this intention, but the verification issue delayed North Korea's actual removal. In April 2007, the Department of State released its annual global terrorism report to Congress, Country Reports on Terrorism, 2006, which includes data on terrorist trends worldwide. North Korea is mentioned in the report as one of the five countries on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. North Korea is one of the five countries on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. The practice of designating and reporting on state sponsors of terrorism has led to a reduction in terrorism activities. North Korea is also on a list of states not fully cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts. The U.S. list of countries subject to severe export controls prohibits selling military equipment and providing foreign aid. A validated license is required for exporting controlled items to these countries, and notification to relevant committees is mandatory. Additionally, the export of munitions list items to these countries is barred under certain acts. The Security and Antiterrorism Act prohibits the export of munitions list items to countries on the terrorism list. Section 1621 of the International Financial Institutions Act requires the U.S. to oppose financial assistance from institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to any state on the U.S. terrorism list. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 prohibits the export of U.S. nuclear materials to countries on the terrorism list, including North Korea. This provision aims to prevent civilian nuclear cooperation between the U.S. and North Korea. Additionally, North Korea is on a list that prohibits the sale of arms without a presidential waiver. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State, provides Congress with a list of countries supporting terrorism annually. The list is compiled based on data gathered by the Department of State throughout the year, with new determinations published in the Federal Register. Congressional report language provides criteria for designation, including allowing territory to be used as a sanctuary. The criteria for designating countries supporting terrorism include allowing territory to be used as a sanctuary, furnishing lethal substances, providing logistical support, safe haven for terrorists, planning and directing terrorist activities, financial support, and diplomatic aid. The Export Administration Act requires a report to Congress before removing a country from the list. The President's report must certify a fundamental change in leadership and policies of a government before rescission. For the same government, justification and certification are needed to remove support for international terrorism. The President's report must certify a fundamental change in leadership and policies of a government before rescission of support for international terrorism. Congress can either allow the President's action to take effect or pass legislation to block it. The Bush Administration removed North Korea, Libya, and Iraq from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Congress has passed resolutions on North Korean support for terrorism since 2005. The Illinois delegation in Congress demanded information on the kidnapped Reverend Kim Dong-shik from North Korea. They stated opposition to removing North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism until his fate is resolved. H.R. 3650, a bill with 27 sponsors, would continue to designate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism until certain conditions are met. These conditions include cessation of nuclear and missile proliferation, support to terrorist groups, counterfeiting of U.S. currency, and the release of kidnapped individuals. The United States may re-list North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism if it is determined that they have provided assistance to terrorists or engaged in state sponsored acts of terrorism. The challenge lies in determining if a government's active involvement has truly changed, especially when there is a history of supporting terrorism. North Korea was added to the list due to its implication in the bombing of a South Korean airliner. North Korea was added to the list of state sponsors of terrorism due to its involvement in the bombing of a South Korean airliner in 1987, which killed 115 people. Despite condemnations of terrorism in 1993, 1995, and 2001, North Korea continued to harbor Japanese Red Army members and abduct Japanese nationals. The country's actions justified its retention on the list. Since the bombing of a Korean Airlines flight in 1987, North Korea has not sponsored any terrorist acts. The DPRK allowed the repatriation of abducted Japanese citizens in 2003 and 2004, but the fate of other abductees remains uncertain. The issue of abductions remains contentious, with ongoing negotiations between Japan and North Korea. Additionally, there are reports of other nationals being abducted from abroad. The ROK government estimates that approximately 485 civilians were abducted or detained since the 1950-53 Korean War. Four Japanese Red Army members remain in the DPRK following their involvement in a jet hijacking in 1970; five of their family members returned to Japan in 2004. United States' policy rationale for keeping nations on the terrorism list includes maintaining ties to terrorist groups and the capability to manufacture WMD. Libya and Sudan cooperated in the global war on terror, while Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria maintained ties to terrorist groups. Iran and Syria routinely provide support to terrorist groups. Iran and Syria continue to support terrorist groups by providing safe haven, resources, and guidance. State sponsors of terrorism play a crucial role in assisting non-state terrorist organizations with funds, weapons, and secure areas for operations. Some of these countries also have the capability to manufacture weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and other destabilizing technologies. The United States is adamant about pressuring these countries to cease their support for terrorist groups. The Patterns 1999 report suggests that North Korea may be considered for removal from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The Patterns 1999 report highlights efforts to remove state sponsors of terrorism from the list by outlining steps for countries to take. North Korea has shown positive signs by condemning terrorism and being open to meeting the criteria for removal. The report emphasizes that meeting these criteria will result in removal from the list, regardless of other policy differences. In June 15, 2000, Michael Sheehan discussed the possibility of moving states off the list of state sponsors of terrorism and onto a \"not fully cooperating\" list. This could serve as an intermediate step towards full cooperation with U.S. counterterrorism efforts. In July 12 testimony before the House International Relations Committee, Ambassador Sheehan confirmed that the United States would consider removing terrorist supporting countries from the list if they cease their support for terrorism. Patterns 2000, issued in 2001, aimed to get North Korea and Sudan out of the terrorism business and off the terrorism list. The North Korean statement in the U.S.-North Korean joint statement of October 12, 2000, reiterated opposition to terrorism and support for international actions against such activity. Patterns 2000 provided evidence of North Korean support for terrorist groups, particularly in the Philippines. Patterns 2001 and 2002 softened language to justify keeping North Korea on the terror list, citing their sale of ballistic missile technology to state sponsors of terrorism. However, Patterns 2003 noted that while North Korea is party to international conventions on terrorism, they have not taken substantial actions against it. Patterns 2003 report acknowledges North Korea's lack of substantial cooperation in combating international terrorism. While the country has not sponsored any terrorist acts since 1987, it continues to provide sanctuary to hijackers linked to the Japanese Red Army. The report does not offer hope for North Korea's removal from the terrorism list in the near future. The DPRK has not shown substantial cooperation in combating international terrorism, but there is progress in resolving the issue of kidnapped Japanese citizens. Pyongyang has not sponsored any terrorist acts since 1987 and has signed international conventions related to terrorism. Kim Jong Il acknowledged DPRK's involvement in kidnapping Japanese citizens and stated that those responsible have been punished. In 2003, Pyongyang allowed the return of five surviving abductees to Japan, followed by eight family members in 2004. Questions about other abductees remain unresolved. The DPRK returned remains of two abductees to Japan, but DNA testing showed they were not who Pyongyang claimed. Four Japanese Red Army members remain in the DPRK since 1970, with five family members returning to Japan in 2004. Pyongyang has not cooperated substantially in combating terrorism despite being party to international conventions. The United States has agreed to begin the process of removing the DPRK from the list of state supporters of terror, as Pyongyang has not taken substantial steps to cooperate in efforts to combat international terrorism. The DPRK harbors four Japanese Red Army members and has not fully accounted for Japanese nationals believed to have been abducted by DPRK state entities. Five abductees have been repatriated to Japan since 2002. The United States has agreed to start the process of removing North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The 2006 Country Reports reflected a new strategy linking this removal to the 2007 nuclear agreement. The State Department claimed North Korea had not sponsored terrorism since 1987, but questions about the accuracy of this claim arose due to reported information. The State Department's Country Reports, 2005 mentioned credible reports of other nationals being abducted by North Korea. This contradicts the claim that North Korea has not sponsored terrorism since 1987. Additionally, reports suggest North Korea has provided arms and possibly training to terrorist groups like Hezbollah and the Tamil Tigers, and maintains a close relationship with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard has been designated as a supporter of terrorism by the State Department. Intercepted shipments of North Korean arms bound for Iran in 2009 were believed to be intended for Hezbollah and Hamas, both terrorist groups on the U.S. list of international terrorist organizations. The shipments contained components for 122 mm Grad rockets with a range of about 25 miles. In December 2009, a shipment of 35 tons of North Korean weapons was intercepted aboard an Ilyushin-T76 transport aircraft en route to Iran. The weapons included rocket launchers, rockets, shoulder-launched missiles, and components of surface-to-air missiles, likely bound for Hezbollah according to Western intelligence sources. The intercepted North Korean arms shipment to Iran in December 2009 included rocket-related weapons likely bound for Hezbollah. Reports from European sources and Intelligence Online detailed North Korean support for Hezbollah, facilitated by Iran since the late 1980s. Hezbollah cadre received training in North Korea, including top officials like Hassan Nasrallah, Ibrahim Akil, and Mustapha Badreddine. North Korean trainers later went to southern Lebanon to instruct Hezbollah in building underground military facilities. In 2004, Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad reportedly met with North Korean officials. In 2004, Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad met with North Korean officials in Damascus and requested assistance for Hezbollah to build underground military installations. One such facility in southern Lebanon was a sophisticated 25-kilometer tunnel that significantly improved Hezbollah's combat capabilities during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Hezbollah concealed rocket launchers underground to evade Israeli aerial surveillance during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. They utilized underground tunnels and bunkers to move and launch attacks on Israeli troops. North Korean assistance in constructing these underground facilities was confirmed by former Israeli diplomat Lenny Ben-David. North Korean tunnels and cooperation with Iran have been confirmed. Reports mention North Korean trainers in Lebanon for Hezbollah's psychological training. Professor Moon Chung-in, a Korean security expert, cited Mossad as the source of information on this relationship. Mossad attributes vital missile components of Hezbollah missiles to North Korea, assembled in Iran and transported to Lebanon via Syria. Israel reported Hezbollah receiving new long-range missiles from Iran post-2006 war. Hezbollah leaders acknowledge increased missile arsenal. The Intelligence Online report of April 20, 2007, stated that top Hezbollah leaders visited Tehran in early April 2007, where Iran promised to provide new medium-range missiles to Hezbollah. There are indications that the missiles supplied to Hezbollah by Iran may contain North Korean components, as North Korea and Hezbollah were reportedly strengthening their relationship after the 2006 war. Iran and North Korea reached an agreement for about 100 Hezbollah field commanders to receive training in North Korea. An agreement was made for around 100 Hezbollah field commanders to receive training in North Korea on infiltration tactics and intelligence-gathering. This training was part of a broader Iranian program to provide advanced military training to Hezbollah after the Israel-Hezbollah war. The goal may have been to give Hezbollah the capability to infiltrate troops into Israel in another war. Korean support for Hezbollah included reports of North Korean arms shipments to the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka. Several attempts to smuggle conventional arms were intercepted by the Sri Lankan navy in late 2006 through spring 2007. North Korean ships carrying arms were intercepted by the Sri Lankan navy in October 2006, February 2007, and March 2007. The Sri Lankan navy seized North Korean weapons and may have captured crewmen. Sankei Shimbun published photos of the seized arms, leading to an official protest from the Sri Lankan government to North Korea. U.S. intelligence agencies provided information about the North Korean ships to Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan navy intercepted unidentified cargo ships smuggling arms for the Tamil Tigers, citing four such incidents with no flags or identifying markers. The Sri Lankan navy intercepted unidentified cargo ships smuggling arms for the Tamil Tigers in multiple incidents. The ships gave false identifications, refused searches, and fired on Sri Lankan naval vessels. The navy seized weapons but did not disclose further information on the ships, crewmen, or origins of the weapons. Reports suggest a long-standing arms supply link between North Korea and the Tamil Tigers. The State Department reported evidence of North Korea supplying arms to terrorist groups in 2001, 2002, and 2003. A video analysis of a Tamil Tiger ship attack in 2000 revealed the use of North Korean weapons. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard was found to be providing support to various terrorist groups according to a 2007 Fact Sheet. In 2006, a U.S. District Judge ruled that the IRG recruited individuals who attacked the U.S. military. Judge Royce Lambert ruled that the IRG recruited individuals who attacked the U.S. military facility in Saudi Arabia in 1996 and manufactured the bombs used in the attack. General David Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker testified in 2008 that the IRG supported attacks by Iraqi Shia \"special groups\" against U.S. and Iraqi military and government targets. Reports indicate a close relationship between the IRG and Hezbollah, with the IRG providing guidance, funding, weapons, and training to Hezbollah personnel in Iran and Lebanon. The IRG also supplied missiles to Hezbollah and coordinated missile attacks against Israel in 2006. The State Department's Fact Sheet highlighted the IRG's involvement in rearming Hezbollah after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, including supplying longer-range missiles. It also mentioned the IRG's heavy involvement in Iran's ballistic missile development program, specifically in testing the Shahab 3 missile. The IRG was reported to have procured equipment to support Iran's missile and nuclear programs as recently as 2006. Additionally, the IRG commanders announced Iran's tests of Shahab-class missiles in 2007. The relationship between North Korea and the IRG involves coordination in supporting Hezbollah, cooperation in ballistic missile development, and potential collaboration in nuclear capabilities or weapons. This partnership is financially beneficial to North Korea, with a significant portion of their earnings coming from collaboration with Iran in missile development. The IRG may have facilitated North Korean training of Hezbollah personnel in the late 1980s and 1990s. The Paris Intelligence Online report from September 7, 2006, revealed North Korean instructors' involvement in constructing Hezbollah's underground military installations in southern Lebanon before the 2006 war. IRG General Mir Faysal Baqer Zadah supervised the construction. The IRG also assisted in building underground military bases, including missile bases, and supplied missiles to Hezbollah. Coordination between the IRG and North Korea likely involved the use of North Korean components in the missiles supplied to Hezbollah. The IRG has supplied a large number of missiles to Hezbollah since the war. Cooperation between North Korea and the IRG in developing ballistic missiles dates back to the 1980s. Delegations from Iran, including IRG officials, visited North Korea in the 1990s to arrange for the purchase of Nodong missiles. North Korea tested the missile in 1993, and an agreement was negotiated to establish a missile plant in Iran. In the 1990s, delegations from Iran negotiated an agreement with North Korea to establish a plant in Iran for producing Nodong missiles. North Korean missile experts were reportedly in Iran assisting with the development of Scud missiles. By 1997, North Korean experts were working on Iranian versions of Nodong missiles, known as Shahab 3 and Shahab 4. The IRG was reportedly directing the Shahab program, with successful test launches conducted in 1997 and 1998. North Korea continued to supply components for the Shahab 3, and collaboration between North Korea and Iran in developing longer-range ballistic missiles persisted. North Korean-Iranian collaboration in developing longer range ballistic missiles was reported in 2003 and 2006. The National Council of Resistance of Iran claimed North Korean experts were working on missiles in Iran. The Iranian government obstructs verification efforts by international groups. The report mentioned the development of an intermediate range missile with a range of 1,900 miles and the Shahab 4 missile. In 2006, North Korea reportedly supplied Iran with Musudan intermediate range missiles. Joint tests of the Musudan were carried out by North Korea and Iran. An agreement was signed in 2008 for North Korea to continue supplying Musudan technology to Iran. In 2009, Iran postponed a test launch of the Musudan due to a lack of electronic components from North Korea. Reports also mentioned a new Iranian missile research and development site resembling North Korean facilities. Iran sought assistance from North Korean missile technicians to launch a missile with an artificial satellite in 2009. A delegation of Iranians from the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, connected to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, observed North Korea's missile tests in 2009. This suggests a continuing relationship between Iran and North Korea in missile development. The IRG in Iran has a likely ongoing partnership with North Korea in missile development, with reports indicating IRG's involvement in Iran's nuclear program. Reports suggest IRG's leadership in Iran's Nuclear Control Center, which reports directly to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini. This relationship could have brought North Korea into the Iranian nuclear program. Numerous public reports since 1993 have described this collaboration. Reports since 1993 describe North Korean-Iranian collaboration in nuclear capabilities development. Initial agreement signed in 1993, with Iran financing North Korea's program and receiving nuclear technology. North Korea and Iran collaborated on nuclear technology, with Iran providing $500 million for joint development of nuclear weapons. CIA sources mentioned enriched uranium as a goal of their agreements. North Korea also sought detailed data on highly enriched uranium from Pakistan in 1993. US officials suspected Iran as the likely customer for North Korean nuclear weapons. Cooperation between North Korea and Iran continued in 2003 and beyond. The reported stage of North Korean-Iranian nuclear cooperation in 2003 and beyond was influenced by joint advancements in missile programs, including the sale of advanced missiles to Iran. North Korean specialists visited Iran in 2003, leading to an agreement for joint development of nuclear warheads for Nodong missiles. Iran offered oil and gas shipments to secure this collaboration. In 2003, North Korean specialists were seen at Iranian nuclear facilities, leading to a joint development of nuclear warheads for Nodong missiles. Iran offered economic aid to North Korea for cooperation in developing nuclear missiles. Israeli officials expressed concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions and collaboration with North Korea. U.S. intelligence revealed Iran's efforts to modify the Shahab 3 missile for carrying a nuclear warhead. Iran and North Korea collaborated on developing nuclear warheads for missiles. Iran's Project 111 involved nuclear research and missile development. The International Atomic Energy Agency found evidence of Iran's nuclear warhead designs and acquisition of advanced warhead blueprints. A.Q. Khan's nuclear smuggling ring provided technology to both Iran and North Korea. Iran also redesigned the Shahab-3 missile to carry a nuclear warhead. The National Council of Resistance of Iran reported collaboration between North Korea and Iran in developing nuclear warheads for missiles at a secret facility in Iran. North Korean specialists are allegedly working at the facility, code-named B1-Nori-8500, on the edge of Tehran. European and Israeli defense officials claimed in 2007 that North Korea shared data from its nuclear test with Iran, and in 2008, an Iranian delegation visited North Korea, including officials from Iran's Atomic Energy Agency. In 2005, Iran initiated a project to develop underground bunkers and tunnels for its nuclear infrastructure with the help of North Korea. The project included the construction of 10,000 meters of underground halls for nuclear equipment connected by tunnels. The specifications called for reinforced concrete tunnel ceilings, walls, and doors resistant to explosions and penetrating munitions. The IRG implemented the project, and a North Korean expert on underground facilities traveled to Tehran to assist in the design and construction. Myong Lyu-do, a North Korean expert on underground facilities, traveled to Tehran to assist in developing underground military facilities for Iran. There was reported collaboration between North Korea and Iran in assisting Syria with a nuclear reactor that was bombed by Israel in 2007. Intelligence reports suggested that North Korean and Iranian scientists were working together at the reactor site. Some of the plutonium production from the reactor was intended for Iran. The reactor was intended for Iran to produce weapons-grade plutonium as a supplement to its uranium program. Reports indicated collaboration between North Korea, Iran, and Syria on the reactor. Iranian officials visited the Syrian reactor in 2005 and 2006, with high-level visits to North Korea in 2008. The Iranian delegation visited North Korea in 2008 to ensure secrecy about their nuclear collaboration. Reports also mentioned non-nuclear military cooperation between Iran and North Korea in Syria, including work at a chemical weapons plant and deployment of North Korean-made submarines. The Bush Administration aimed to remove North Korea from the terrorism support list by completing the disablement of North Korea's plutonium nuclear installations at Yongbyon. However, North Korea suspended disablement in December 2008 due to disagreements over verification. Christopher Hill and others argued for prioritizing limiting and eliminating North Korea's nuclear capabilities. The highest priority in North Korea policy should be limiting and eliminating North Korea's plutonium program, as it is the source of their atomic bombs. Other issues like the highly enriched uranium program and proliferation activities should be given less priority. Removing North Korea from the terrorism support list opened the way for Phase Three of nuclear negotiations, aiming for full dismantlement of Yongbyon and eliminating North Korea's nuclear weapons stockpile. However, this prospect was uncertain as North Korea was likely to make new demands for concessions. North Korea's Phase Three demands may include financial aid from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank after being removed from the terrorism support list. This move could have negative consequences for U.S. policy and strain relations with Japan. Japanese officials have warned of short-term damage to U.S.-Japan relations if the Bush Administration removes North Korea without progress on the Japanese kidnapping issue. U.S. Ambassador Thomas Schieffer and some experts share these concerns. Members of Japan's Diet and public opinion oppose removing North Korea from the terrorism list, fearing potential longer-term damage to the alliance and future policies. This action could also encourage Pyongyang to support terrorist groups. North Korea's expansion of support for terrorist groups in the Middle East poses a major threat to U.S. national security interests. Removing North Korea from the terrorism support list could weaken the U.S. diplomatic hand in negotiations with Pyongyang. H.R. 5350 (Ros-Lehtinen) proposes re-designating North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. The bill aims to re-designate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, maintaining restrictions unless certain conditions are met. It prohibits diplomatic recognition and demands an apology for the sinking of the Cheonan. The international community is urged to implement UN Security Council Resolutions on North Korea. Introduced in May 2010. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requires the Obama Administration to submit a report on North Korea's inclusion on the terrorism list. If North Korea is found to have assisted terrorists or engaged in state-sponsored terrorism, it should be relisted. The bill was agreed upon by the House and Senate in October 2009 and signed by the President on October 28, 2009. The resolution expresses sympathy for the families of those killed in the sinking of the Cheonan and calls for full implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions on North Korea. Introduced and passed unanimously on May 13, 2010."
