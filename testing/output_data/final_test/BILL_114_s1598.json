    "content": "The \"First Amendment Defense Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. Congress acknowledges the real conflicts between same-sex marriage and religious liberty, as highlighted by legal scholars. The importance of maintaining religious freedom was emphasized by the President in response to the Supreme Court's decision on the Defense of Marriage Act. Protecting religious freedom from government interference is a top priority. Laws protecting religious beliefs and moral convictions about marriage promote tolerance and contribute to a more respectful society, complementing the First Amendment's protections. Protection of the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions is emphasized in Section 3. The Federal Government is prohibited from discriminating against individuals based on their religious beliefs or moral convictions regarding marriage and sexual relations. Discriminatory actions include altering tax treatment, imposing penalties, or denying tax deductions for those individuals.

This Act is broadly construed to protect free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions. It does not preempt or repeal State or Federal laws that provide equal or greater protection. The Act does not narrow the meaning of existing laws and allows the Federal Government to provide benefits authorized by law. If any provision of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms used in the Act, including \"Federal benefit program,\" \"Federal Government,\" and \"person.\""
