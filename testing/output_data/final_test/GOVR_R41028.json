    "content": "Congress initiated the rum cover-over program for Puerto Rico under the Jones Act of 1917, allowing internal revenue taxes collected on Puerto Rican products to be covered over into the treasury of Puerto Rico. The act aimed to provide fair treatment for Puerto Rico in terms of tax revenue, without specifying how the funds should be spent. The Revised Organic Act of 1954 extended the rum cover-over program to the US Virgin Islands, transferring revenue collected by the government to a separate fund for expenditure as determined by the legislature. Approval from the President or designated representative is required before funds can be obligated. Congress expressed a desire for the USVI to use the funds responsibly. In 1954, the Revised Organic Act extended the rum cover-over program to the US Virgin Islands, allowing the territory to use the revenue to reduce dependence on US government appropriations. Congress recommended stimulating business growth in the USVI. Two rum manufacturers, Cruzan VIRAL Ltd. and Brugal, began production that year. The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983 mandated that all federal excise taxes on rum imported into the US be remitted to the treasuries of Puerto Rico. The rum cover-over program extends to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, with revenue from any source remitted to their treasuries. The division of \"other\" revenue is based on rum market share. Congress clarified that there are no restrictions on how the territories can use the funds. The law sets limits on the share of excise tax on rum for each territory to ensure a minimum and maximum allocation. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 placed a cap on the rebate of excise taxes on rum and other distilled spirits, increasing the federal tax rate on spirits. The act also specified that the rebate to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands would be based on the previous $10.50 rate, not the increased rate. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 temporarily increased the cap on the rebate of excise taxes on rum and distilled spirits to $11.30 per proof-gallon. This increase was effective from October 1, 1993, through September 30, 1998. Subsequent acts like the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 and the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 also provided temporary increases in the cap. The Worker Assistance Act of 2002 increased the cap on excise taxes on rum to $13.25 per proof-gallon through various extensions in subsequent acts until 2011. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress aims to expand federal control over the use of covered-over revenue, potentially limiting Puerto Rico's and the US Virgin Islands' ability to subsidize the rum industry. The President's FY2013 budget proposal includes an extension of the $13.25 cover-over, collected by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on rum exported to the United States from PR and the USVI. Requests for prepayment based on revenue projections are made by PR and the USVI to the U.S. Department of the Interior. The Department of the Interior requests the Treasury to deposit funds into an escrow account for Puerto Rico (PR) and the US Virgin Islands (USVI) based on revenue projections. PR received $449.1 million in covered-over revenue in FY2011, while the USVI received $123.9 million from domestic production and $9.6 million from other country imports. Since 1994, PR has received $5.8 billion and the USVI $1.3 billion in covered-over revenue. The U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau remits the entire cover-over to PR. The cover-over revenue from U.S. imports for Puerto Rico is used for marketing and promotional activities in the rum industry, with 6% allocated for this purpose. The remaining 94% can be used for general expenditures in Puerto Rico. The U.S. Virgin Islands also receive cover-over revenue, but the details of its usage are not specified. The US Virgin Islands subsidize rum production through tax-exempt bonds issued by the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority. The subsidy indirectly benefits the rum industry by financing public infrastructure used by the industry. The exact size of the subsidy is difficult to measure, but it involves establishing the costs the industry would have incurred without the assistance. Recently, bonds backed by rum tax have been issued by VIPFA. The VIPFA issued \"rum-tax bonds\" backed by cover-over revenues after a 30-year agreement with Diageo to operate in the USVI. In 2009, $250 million of subordinate rum-tax bonds were offered to finance a grant to Diageo USVI for infrastructure. The Government provided a grant to Diageo USVI for a rum production facility on St. Croix. New bonds created annual debt service costs ranging from $12.2 million to $20.6 million. VIPFA issued $458,849,000 in bonds for refunding outstanding debt and new projects like school construction and affordable housing. VIPFA planned to issue $105 million more in bonds. On October 8, 2009, VIPFA planned to issue $105 million in rum bonds for Cruzan, with $30 million for a wastewater treatment facility and $75 million for distillery expansion. In December 2009, $39.2 million was offered for the Cruzan project. By July 2010, $399,050,000 in bonds were offered to loan to the USVI government for capital projects. Cruzan and Diageo would be the two rum producers in USVI by 2012, both receiving subsidies. In FY2009, Cruzan produced 9.6 million proof gallons of rum, with 8 million proof gallons sold in the US. The Diageo Agreement includes production targets and subsidy structure. USVI provides incentives like Molasses Subsidy Fund, marketing support payments, and tax exemptions to attract Diageo. The VIPFA provided subsidy and support for Cruzan rum production, including a molasses subsidy payment, marketing support agreement, and professional services agreement. In FY2009, the USVI provided $21.3 million in direct support for Cruzan rum, representing 18.5% of the revenue from the excise tax on rum imported from the USVI. The most recent bond offering statement included estimates for FY2010 for the Cruzan rum promotion and marketing support payments. On May 12, 2011, Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi introduced legislation to limit the subsidy to rum companies paid with covered-over revenue, restricting the allocation and preventing possessions from offering more than 15% of their covered-over revenue as an industrial subsidy for the rum industry. This is intended to make it more costly for the USVI to provide incentives to rum producers that have relocated from Puerto Rico. The legislation aims to prevent excessive subsidies to rum producers using federal cover-over funds, which is seen as undermining the program's purpose. It would restrict the amount of debt-financed grants to rum producers in US territories, with any excess over the 15% limit deducted from future cover-over payments. Senator Menendez introduced a similar bill in the Senate. The proposed bills would limit rum cover-over revenue allocations to USVI and Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico's share would range from 65% to 70%, while USVI's share would be between 30% and 35%. Currently, there is no cap on cover-over revenue from own-source rum exports. The relocation of Diageo operations from Puerto Rico to USVI is expected to impact market share. A bond offering statement estimated USVI's cover-over revenues to increase to $278.8 million in 2013, mainly from new Diageo rum shipments. The proposed bills would extend the higher cover-over amount of $13.25 without changes to allocation or restrictions. They aim to make direct subsidies to rum producers more challenging and prevent the USVI from using general revenue to subsidize them. The USVI's subsidies include rum promotion, marketing support, molasses subsidy, income tax breaks, property tax exemption, and debt finance support. These benefits are not directly linked to rum cover-over and total around 46% of the amount covered over to the USVI. The so-called rum-tax bonds are secured by revenue from Captain Morgan\u00ae production and export by Diageo in the USVI. Legislation may impact Diageo's agreement to manufacture rum in the USVI, potentially reducing subsidies provided by the USVI. It is unclear how Diageo would respond to the legislation. The legislation may impact Diageo's agreement to manufacture rum in the USVI, potentially reducing subsidies. Supporters claim tax incentives are a misuse of taxpayer dollars, while critics argue economic development incentives are ineffective. States offer various incentives to attract industry, but success in retaining or luring firms is mixed. Critics assert these programs sacrifice tax revenues unnecessarily. The USVI agreement with Diageo involves the cover-over of rum excise tax revenues to support the rum industry, which critics argue sacrifices tax revenues unnecessarily. The incentives aim to shift economic activity without a net gain in national GDP. The legislation aims to limit tax incentives and subsidies for the rum industry in USVI and PR, potentially contradicting the intent of the cover-over agreement. Diageo's decision to move production to USVI could result in PR losing both Diageo and future excise tax revenue. The recent recession has increased interest in the rum cover-over program, with concerns raised about its efficacy and potential for Congress to reconsider the program if the USVI uses the revenue for \"unreasonable\" subsidies. The House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources discussed bills related to excise taxes on rum produced in the Virgin Islands and federal excise tax rebates for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Additionally, they considered appropriations for Guam public works projects and programs for Guam, NMI, and Virgin Islands. The U.S. Congress committees discussed the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the rum excise tax rebates for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico to protect their economies. They also considered bills for trade and tax incentives to encourage economic revitalization in the Caribbean area. The U.S. Congress, Senate Committee on Finance, discussed the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, which includes trade and tax incentives to revitalize the Caribbean area. It involves transferring excise tax revenues from imported rum to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The U.S. Congress, Senate Committee on Finance, discussed the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act to promote economic revitalization in the Caribbean area through duty-free treatment of certain articles and tax credits for U.S. capital investment. The Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association provided a statement on the impact of the act on the Puerto Rican rum industry. The U.S. Congress discussed the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) to promote economic revitalization in the Caribbean through duty-free treatment of certain articles and tax credits for U.S. capital investment. Concerns were raised about the impact on the competitive position of Virgin Islands industries, particularly the rum industry. The hearings also assessed the effects of CBI on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The U.S. Congress discussed the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) to promote economic revitalization in the Caribbean through duty-free treatment of certain articles and tax credits for U.S. capital investment. The hearings also assessed the effects of CBI on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, including concerns about the anticompetitive effect on the Virgin Islands rum industry. Hearings on providing proceeds from Federal taxes on articles produced in the Virgin Islands to the territorial legislature, including discussions on civil works projects and rum industry tax allocations for public works programs. The U.S. Congress is discussing the allocation of taxes collected on articles of Virgin Islands manufacture to the treasury of the Virgin Islands."
