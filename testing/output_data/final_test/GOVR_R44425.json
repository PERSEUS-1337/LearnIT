    "content": "Individuals and families without subsidized health insurance may qualify for premium tax credits under the ACA. These credits help with purchasing private health plans and may also include subsidies for cost-sharing expenses. To be eligible, individuals must enroll in health plans through exchanges in every state and DC, which offer insurance options to qualified individuals and small businesses. The ACA requires exchanges to offer insurance options to individuals and small businesses through separate exchanges. Health insurance companies must comply with various federal and state requirements, including restrictions on using health factors to determine premiums. Premiums can vary by age, geography, enrollment size, and smoking status within specified limits. Premium tax credits are based on a statutory formula and vary for each individual. The premium tax credit amount is based on a statutory formula and varies for each individual. Eligible individuals must contribute towards their health insurance, but the credit is refundable and advanceable. Advance payments reduce monthly premiums, making insurance costs lower for those eligible. Individuals must meet certain criteria to receive premium tax credits. Individuals must meet specific criteria to receive premium tax credits, including filing federal income tax returns, enrolling in an exchange plan, having household income between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level, and not being eligible for minimum essential coverage. The premium assistance is administered by the IRS through the federal tax system, requiring qualifying individuals to file tax returns, even if not normally required. Married couples must file joint tax returns to claim the premium credit. Premium credits for individuals and families enrolled in individual exchange plans are calculated based on joint tax returns for married couples. Changes in tax-filing status, such as marriage or divorce, can affect the allocation of credit amounts. Undocumented individuals are not eligible to purchase coverage through an exchange, even if they can afford the full premium. Exchange plans are available to residents in states with established exchanges who are not incarcerated and have lawful status. Individuals ineligible for exchange coverage are not eligible for premium credits. Family members of ineligible individuals may still receive credits if they meet eligibility criteria based on household income. Modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) determines eligibility, with income ranges from 100% to 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) qualifying for credits. Table 1 shows income ranges for 2018 eligibility. To be eligible for a premium credit, an individual must not qualify for minimum essential coverage (MEC), as defined by the ACA. Exceptions exist, including Medicare, Medicaid, employer-sponsored plans, and other recognized coverage. The ACA provides exceptions regarding MEC eligibility and premium tax credits. The ACA provides exceptions for eligibility for premium tax credits, including individuals eligible for non-group health insurance, unaffordable employer-sponsored plans, or limited Medicaid benefits. States can expand Medicaid eligibility up to 138% FPL. If an individual eligible for premium credits is determined to be eligible for Medicaid, they must be enrolled in Medicaid instead. Premium credit eligibility starts at the income level where Medicaid eligibility begins. Premium credit eligibility begins where Medicaid eligibility ends. The credit amount is based on household income, the exchange plan premium, and other factors. The formula to calculate the credit is: Premium for Standard Plan \u2013 Required Premium Contribution = Premium Tax Credit. Premiums can vary based on certain characteristics, with the Standard Plan being the second-lowest-cost silver plan in the local area. Required Premium Contribution is the amount eligible individuals must contribute. The Required Premium Contribution is capped based on household income relative to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Lower-income individuals contribute a smaller share of income towards the monthly premium compared to higher-income individuals. The Premium Tax Credit is the difference between the premium and the required contribution, varying greatly depending on individual circumstances. In some cases, the tax credit may cover the entire premium, while in others, the required contribution may exceed the premium amount. The premium credit calculation for 2018 is based on household income relative to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Lower-income individuals pay a smaller share of income towards the premium compared to higher-income individuals. For example, a recipient in Lebanon, KS with income at 150% FPL would pay around $61 per month towards the standard plan, while someone at 250% FPL would pay more. The maximum amount an individual would pay for a standard plan is around $2,442 per year or $204 per month. A family of three with a household income of $30,630 would pay approximately $1,234 per year or $103 per month for the same plan. The difference between the premium and the required contribution is the tax credit amount. The tax credit amount provided to individuals or families is determined by the difference between the premium and the required contribution. Factors like age, family size, and choice of plan affect the premium credit amount. For example, an individual in Lebanon, KS with an income of $18,090 would contribute about $61 per month towards a standard plan premium. A 21-year-old in the same area would face a $421 monthly premium for the standard plan. A 21-year-old resident of Lebanon, KS with an annual household income at 150% FPL would contribute $61 towards a $421 monthly premium for the standard plan, receiving a credit of $360. An older individual with the same income level would also contribute $61 towards a higher premium based on age, but their required contribution is capped, resulting in the same premium cost as the younger individual. The 60-year-old individual in Lebanon would receive a monthly premium credit of $1,082, while the 21-year-old would receive a lower credit due to their less expensive premium. Family size can impact premium tax credit calculations. The family's required contribution towards the monthly premium for the standard plan in their local area is $103 per month at 150% FPL. A hypothetical family of three would receive a monthly premium credit of $1,061, while a family of four would receive a credit of $1,363. When enrolling in a health insurance plan, individuals can choose any metal plan and still qualify for premium tax credits. However, opting for a more expensive plan means paying the additional premium amount. For example, a 21-year-old would pay $61 towards the standard plan's monthly premium and receive a $360 credit. If they choose a higher-cost gold plan instead, they would pay $538 and have to cover the $117 difference in premiums, making their total monthly contribution $178. After receiving a $360 monthly premium credit, the individual's total monthly premium contribution would be $178. Advance payments of the premium credit are based on prior year's income tax return. Any discrepancies in the amount received are reconciled when filing taxes, with excess amounts repaid or included in tax refunds. For individuals who received excess premium credits, the amount will be repaid through a tax payment. Repayment amounts are capped for those with incomes below 400% FPL. IRS data shows that in tax year 2014, 3.4 million tax returns received advance payments of the ACA tax credit, totaling nearly $12 billion. Approximately 1.5 million taxpayers received less advance payments than eligible, while 1.8 million received more. Around 3.1 million tax returns for 2014 claimed $11.2 billion of ACA tax credit. The IRS also provided limited tax credit data by state, county, and zip code for tax year 2015. In tax year 2015, 5.7 million tax returns received advance payments of the ACA tax credit, totaling $20.2 billion. This marked a two-thirds increase from 2014 in both claims and credit amounts. Of these returns, 2.3 million received less than eligible, while 3.3 million received more. Additionally, 5 million tax returns for 2015 claimed $18.1 billion, a 60% increase from 2014. HHS regularly publishes data on individuals enrolling in exchange plans and eligible for the premium tax credit. As of February 2017, over 8.7 million individuals were eligible for the ACA tax credit, representing 84% of all exchange enrollees. Those who qualify for the premium tax credit and enroll in a silver plan with annual household income below 250% FPL are eligible for cost-sharing subsidies to reduce healthcare expenses. There are two types of subsidies based on income, and eligible individuals may receive both types. The ACA requires the HHS Secretary to provide full reimbursements to insurers for cost-sharing subsidies, totaling billions in federal outlays. The source of funds for these payments was not addressed in the ACA, leading to a lawsuit by the House of Representatives. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the payments violated the appropriations clause of the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia deemed the cost-sharing subsidies unconstitutional due to lack of valid appropriation by Congress. The Obama Administration was barred from making the payments, which were later terminated by the Trump Administration in October 2017. Insurers are still required to provide subsidies to eligible individuals despite the termination of payments. The annual cost-sharing limit for health care services is capped for individuals and families, with self-only coverage at $7,350 and family coverage at $14,700 in 2018. Cost-sharing assistance reduces these limits for those with lower incomes, targeting individuals and families with high health care expenses. Enrollees who use little health care may not reach the annual limit. Cost-sharing subsidies reduce annual cost-sharing limits for individuals with lower incomes, ensuring they pay less before insurance covers the entire cost. This assistance also applies to premium credit recipients with incomes up to 250% FPL, reducing cost-sharing requirements for their enrolled plans. Cost-sharing subsidies increase the actuarial value of exchange plans, lowering cost-sharing requirements for enrollees. To qualify for these subsidies, individuals must be enrolled in a silver plan with an actuarial value of 70%. This assistance benefits both those who use minimal healthcare services and those who use a lot. The ACA requires insurance companies to offer silver plan variations with higher actuarial values (73%, 87%, and 94%) for individuals eligible for cost-sharing subsidies based on income. For example, a person at 150% FPL would be enrolled in a silver plan with a 94% AV instead of the usual 70% AV. The ACA mandates higher actuarial values for silver plans for individuals eligible for cost-sharing subsidies based on income. This results in significant reductions in cost-sharing requirements, such as a deductible decrease from $3,000 to $250 for a plan with a 94% AV."
