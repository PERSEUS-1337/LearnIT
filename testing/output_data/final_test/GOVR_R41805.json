    "content": "The seismic design criteria for commercial nuclear power plants in the US gained attention after the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in Japan. Concerns have been raised about the vulnerability of US nuclear plants to seismic threats, especially with the ongoing reassessment of seismic risks by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. There are currently 104 commercial nuclear power plants in the US using light water reactor designs. Light water reactors in the United States use ordinary water as a neutron moderator and coolant, with uranium fuel enriched in uranium-235. Designs are either pressurized water reactor (PWR) or boiling water reactor (BWR). Safety features in U.S. nuclear power plants ensure the reactor core remains cooled and containment intact during earthquakes. Nuclear vendors build the nuclear steam supply system (NSSS) for these plants. The nuclear steam supply system (NSSS) for U.S. light water reactors is built by vendors like Babcock & Wilcox, Combustion Engineering, General Electric, and Westinghouse. The balance of the plant (BOP) includes secondary cooling systems, feed-water systems, steam systems, control room, and generator systems. Custom design approaches by architect/engineering firms led to safety verification challenges and hindered the transfer of safety lessons between reactors. The report discusses the design considerations for nuclear power plants to withstand seismic events. It does not compare the safety of different plant designs or assess the risk from earthquakes based on recent seismic data. Design criteria require structures to withstand various natural disasters. The report discusses the design considerations for nuclear power plants to withstand seismic events, including earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, and seiche waves. Safety-related structures, systems, and components are necessary to maintain reactor coolant pressure, shut down the reactor, and prevent or mitigate accidents. BWR plants in the US use General Electric designs, while PWR plants use Babcock & Wilcox, Combustion Engineering, and Westinghouse designs. The reactor's core is cooled by water, which also allows the operator to control the reactor's power. Steam generated in the reactor flows to a turbine-generator through pipelines. The steam is then condensed back to water in a heat exchanger and returned to the reactor vessel. The cooling water in the system is circulated through a cooling tower or discharged into a body of water. Reactors of this design operate at high temperatures and pressures. During normal operation, reactor cooling relies on water and steam. In the event of exceeding operating parameters, safety features control reactivity and cool the reactor. After shutdown, the reactor core continues to generate heat through radioactive decay, with steam bypassing the turbine to cool the reactor. Shutdown-cooling mode is activated when reactor vessel pressure decreases to around 50 psi. During a loss of coolant accident in a BWR, the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) provides water to cool the reactor core independently, without the need for auxiliary power or external systems. This system prevents fuel damage or meltdown by injecting high-pressure coolant into the reactor. The Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) in boiling water reactors (BWRs) provides makeup water during coolant accidents, including a double-ended guillotine break (DEGB). BWRs are simpler designs compared to other light water reactor types, with fewer components due to steam generation inside the reactor vessel. Only General Electric BWRs operate in the United States, with Type 2 through Type 6 designs still in operation. BWRs continue to operate with evolutionary design features summarized in Table 2. Containment structure designs have also evolved. PWRs generate steam outside the reactor vessel, unlike BWRs. The primary system cycles superheated water from the core to a heat exchanger/steam generator. The secondary system transfers steam to a turbine generator. Steam is condensed back to water in a condenser and recycled through a cooling tower or discharged to a water source. A PWR design uses a pressurizer to maintain equilibrium conditions for water and steam pressure in the reactor coolant system. The pressurizer includes heaters, pressure sprays, relief valves, and safety valves to control pressure deviations caused by temperature changes. All PWR systems have the same major components but are arranged and designed differently by manufacturers like Westinghouse. During normal operation, a PWR transfers heat via primary coolant to secondary coolant in steam generators to produce electricity. Even after shutdown, decay heat is removed by auxiliary feed-water and steam dump systems. If steam dumping is unavailable, relief valves can release steam to the atmosphere. During a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) in a PWR, the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) injects borated water to cool the reactor core and stop the fission process. The ECCS consists of four separate systems to provide core cooling in extreme conditions. The emergency core cooling system (ECCS) in a PWR consists of four separate systems: the high-pressure injection system, intermediate pressure injection system, cold leg accumulators, and low-pressure injection system. Each system responds to different emergency conditions to provide core cooling and prevent the fission process during accidents. The primary containment structures of nuclear reactors are designed to minimize releases of radioactive material into the environment. PWR containments surround all components of the primary cooling system, while BWR containments are smaller. They must withstand pressure from steam released during accidents, with larger designs allowing space for steam to expand and cool. Smaller containments require pressure suppression systems to condense released steam. The containment structures of nuclear reactors, such as those for BWRs and smaller PWRs, utilize pressure suppression systems to condense released steam. A steel liner and multiple safety features help limit leakage, while systems like fan coolers and containment sprays reduce temperature and pressure. Dry containment systems consist of a steel shell and concrete shield to protect against external elements. The outer shield of nuclear reactor containment structures does not act as a barrier against radiation release but protects against external elements. The NRC studied containment building design features to estimate leak rates during severe accidents, identifying potential leak paths through containment penetration assemblies. The NRC studied containment building design features to estimate leak rates during severe accidents, focusing on containment penetrations and isolation barriers. Analytical approaches were used due to lack of experimental data on leakage behavior at high pressures. Earthquakes occur when stresses exceed rock strength, creating faults that release seismic shock waves with amplitude and period characteristics. The seismic wave's arrival causes ground motion, which depends on factors like distance from the source, energy released, and soil type. Shallow earthquakes produce stronger waves, and ground shaking intensity decreases with distance. The concept of \"safe shutdown earthquake\" was introduced in regulations for nuclear power plants in 1973. The NRC defines the Safe Shutdown Earthquake as the maximum earthquake for nuclear power plants, where important safety components must remain functional. Ground motion at a plant site depends on earthquake factors like source, magnitude, and distance. Structures resonate differently during earthquakes based on their mass, with heavier structures vibrating at lower frequencies. Ground motion transmits vibrations to a nuclear power plant's foundation and structure, causing acceleration measured relative to the earth's gravitational constant. Both vertical and horizontal ground acceleration place stresses on the plant's structure. Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) is used to estimate nuclear plant fragility to seismic vibrations. Structural damage occurs when ground acceleration exceeds a certain threshold. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) introduced \"cumulative absolute velocity\" (CAV) as an index for predicting structural damage onset in 1988. The threshold for damaging earthquakes conservatively occurs at ground motions with cumulative absolute velocities (CAV) greater than 0.16 g-seconds. CAV is the sum of various ground acceleration frequencies and their duration. Experimental seismic data provide insights into the behavior of structures under different shaking conditions. Engineers design structures based on these insights. Engineers design plant structures to withstand specific earthquake severities and ground shaking estimates. Vibrations during earthquakes vary based on elevation above the foundation, with frequencies of 1 to 10 Hz posing a risk of damaging resonance. Factors like accelerations and shaking frequencies are considered in Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA). The seismic spectrum is characterized by peak ground acceleration (PGA) and different intervals. In the western United States (WUS), earthquake magnitude is a key design consideration for nuclear power plants due to predominant frequencies below 15 Hz. Central and eastern US (CEUS) designs consider both earthquake magnitude and Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) due to sparse earthquake recordings. Higher frequency earthquakes are less damaging to large structures but may affect small components. Structural engineers began considering shear forces in the late 1940s. In the late 1940s, structural engineers started considering shear forces from earthquakes. They used the Seismic Zone Map from the Uniform Building Code to supplement their design calculations. The map divided the US into six seismic zones based on seismic risk levels. It expressed peak ground acceleration as a decimal ratio of the gravitational acceleration constant for Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) and Operating Basis Earthquake (OBE). MCE was the largest possible earthquake along recognized faults, while OBE represented the greatest ground motion likely during a structure's economic life. Designs for nuclear power plants in the 1960s and 1970s used a deterministic approach to seismic design based on site-specific investigations of seismology, geology, and soil conditions to determine the maximum credible earthquake. Deterministic Seismic Hazard Analysis (DSHA) aimed to quantify the effects of a maximum credible earthquake based on known seismic sources near the site. Regulations require an investigation of fault and earthquake occurrences to determine a safe shutdown earthquake. The seismic design criteria for new nuclear power plants are based on Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA), which considers earthquake sources, recurrence, and ground motion estimates to assess the probability of different levels of earthquake-induced ground motion at a specific location in the future. This methodology is widely used in U.S. engineering practice for both nuclear and non-nuclear structures. Seismic hazard analysis quantifies a site's seismic characteristics by identifying seismic sources and developing response spectra. Response spectra show the maximum ground motion response from earthquakes, with important spectra for nuclear power plant design being peak ground accelerations between 5 and 10 Hz. The NRC uses Design Response Spectra based on past strong motion data. The NRC has developed Design Response Spectra based on past strong motion earthquakes. Regulatory Guide 1.60 provides spectral shapes for ground movements that nuclear power plant designs must respond to. Safe Shutdown Earthquake is defined by 10 CFR 100 Appendix A. NRC requires nuclear plant designs to consider site-specific ground motions and may credit foundations with a 5% dampening effect. The example in Figure 8 shows maximum accelerations plotted against corresponding frequencies for the Surry Nuclear Power Plant containment building. The NRC requires nuclear plant designs to consider site-specific ground motions and has specified a minimum ground motion level. Regulatory Guide 1.208 endorses EPRI or LLNL seismic hazard models for conducting a PSHA in siting nuclear power plants. Brookhaven National Laboratory produced a report evaluating seismic design criteria in ASCE/SEI Standard 43-05 for nuclear power plants. This standard provides seismic design criteria for safety-related structures, systems, and components in nuclear facilities. The USGS released updated National Seismic Hazard Maps in 2008 to show the likelihood of earthquake shaking severity. These maps are used for seismic design provisions in building codes to ensure infrastructure can withstand earthquakes. The 2008 hazard maps differ significantly from the 2002 maps, showing reductions in acceleration across the Central and Eastern United States. The USGS released updated National Seismic Hazard Maps in 2008, showing reductions in acceleration across the Central and Eastern United States. The new maps for the Western United States indicate reductions in spectral acceleration and peak ground acceleration at similar hazard levels. Seismic hazard is highest in tectonically active regions like Alaska, but regions in the Central and Eastern United States also have elevated seismic hazard. The New Madrid Seismic Zone and Wabash Valley Seismic Zone are areas of concern. In the Central and Eastern United States, seismic hazard is elevated in the New Madrid Seismic Zone, Charleston area in South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and parts of the Northeast. The hazard level at 2% probability in 50 years is two to four times higher than at 10% probability. The New Madrid Seismic Zone has increased hazard due to three large earthquakes in 1811-1812. The seismic hazard in the Central and Eastern United States is elevated in the New Madrid Seismic Zone, Charleston area in South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and parts of the Northeast. The region requires monitoring with a dense array of seismometers due to past large earthquakes in 1811-1812. The Northeast has seismic activity in the St. Lawrence rift zone, while the Southeast is primarily at risk near Charleston, SC, and the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone. The Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, including parts of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia, experienced a significant earthquake in 1886. A magnitude 5.8 earthquake hit Virginia in 2011, possibly within this seismic zone. Figures show nuclear plant sites in relation to seismic hazards, cautioning against drawing conclusions on seismic risk. The USGS Quaternary Fault and Fold Database shows the proximity of plant sites to faults that have slipped in the last 1.6 million years. These faults are believed to be sources of magnitude 6 earthquakes. The NRC does not rank nuclear plants by seismic risk but recently considered the implications of updated USGS seismic hazard models on nuclear power plant sites. The NRC evaluates seismic hazard models on nuclear power plant sites in the Central and Eastern United States. Design specifications may be re-evaluated based on updated USGS seismic hazard maps. The NRC published a two-stage assessment in 2010 to determine the implications of the updated maps on existing nuclear power plant sites in the CEUS. The objective was to assess the need for further investigations of seismic safety for operating reactors in the region. The assessment evaluated changes in seismic hazard at nuclear power plants in the Central and Eastern United States. It estimated the Seismic Core Damage Frequency (SCDF) resulting from the seismic hazard changes, which is the probability of damage to the reactor core from a seismic event. The report analyzed the implications of updated seismic hazard for each of the 96 operating nuclear power plants in the region, indicating a low but increased probability of earthquake ground motion exceeding design limits for some plants. The design basis for some nuclear plants in the CEUS is larger than previous estimates. The NRC identified 27 nuclear reactors in the CEUS for priority earthquake safety reviews. Hearings were held on Catastrophic Preparedness, U.S. Government Response to the Nuclear Power Plant Incident in Japan, and Earthquake Risk Reduction. Legislation in the Senate and House would reauthorize appropriations and make changes. Legislation introduced in the Senate and House would reauthorize appropriations and amend the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977. The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) aims to improve understanding of earthquakes, reduce hazards, and promote hazard reduction activities. These activities could enhance knowledge on how earthquakes would impact nuclear power plants. The Power Licensing Reform Act of 2011 proposes criteria for nuclear power plant license renewals, ensuring compliance with original construction requirements. The Nuclear Power Safety Act of 2011 aims to enhance regulations for nuclear facilities to withstand natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. The USGS recommended adding 100 new seismic monitoring stations in the CEUS to improve earthquake understanding and assess seismic risk at nuclear power plants. The USGS proposed adding 38 new seismic monitoring stations in seismically active zones to improve earthquake monitoring where it is currently inadequate. These stations would help assess seismic wave propagation and energy loss during earthquakes. The USGS proposes deploying 62 additional seismic stations near nuclear power plants to enhance earthquake characterization for engineering and emergency response. The new stations would supplement the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) to improve earthquake data accuracy within 50 kilometers of the epicenter. The cost of the seismometers ranges from $15,000 to $20,000 for \"Class A\" systems and about $10,000 for \"Class B\" systems. The cost of seismic stations ranges from $15,000 to $20,000 for \"Class A\" systems and about $10,000 for \"Class B\" systems. Operating costs for Class A systems are higher, ranging from $2,000 to $5,000 per year, compared to $200,000 to $500,000 per year for Class B systems. Earthquake magnitude is measured objectively using various methods like Moment Magnitude. The Moment Magnitude (M) is a commonly used measurement that accounts for the strength of the rock that ruptured, the area of the fault that ruptured, and the average amount of slip. It provides an estimate of earthquake size valid over all magnitudes, with each whole number increase representing a tenfold increase in amplitude and about 31 times more energy released. The Richter magnitude scale was developed in 1935 by Charles F. Richter based on a specific seismograph. While no longer in use, the term Richter Scale is still commonly used. The intensity of an earthquake is assessed qualitatively based on its effects at a specific location using the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale. The Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale in the United States ranges from I to XII, indicating the severity of an earthquake. Intensity depends on the effects at each location, with greater magnitude earthquakes associated with longer fault ruptures. The length of the fault break is not directly proportional to the energy released, but the induced amplitude of acceleration (g) increases with magnitude (M). Different methods relate earthquake magnitude to acceleration amplitude, resulting in variations in results. In the late 1940s, structural engineers began considering seismic-based shear forces that structures must resist, referring to the Seismic Zone Map published by the Uniform Building Code (UBC). The UBC map divided the US into six seismic zones representing various degrees of risk, with peak ground acceleration expressed as a decimal ratio of acceleration due to gravity for Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) and Operating Basis Earthquake (OBE). Light water reactor systems like BWR and PWR use ordinary water as a coolant and uranium fuel enriched to 3%-5% uranium-235. Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) involves a break in the reactor coolant system, causing a loss of water cooling the core. Operating Basis Earthquake determines the maximum ground motion a reactor can withstand without shutdown. The Safe Shutdown Earthquake is the maximum ground motion for reactor operation without undue risk to the public. Pressurized water reactors use two loops to convert core heat into steam. Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessments quantify earthquake ground-motion probabilities. Seismic Core Damage Frequency assesses core damage probability from seismic events."
