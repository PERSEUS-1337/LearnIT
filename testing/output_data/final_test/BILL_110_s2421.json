    "content": "The \"Wrongful Convictions Tax Relief Act of 2007\" is cited as the short title. It includes an exclusion for wrongfully incarcerated individuals in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Wrongful Convictions Tax Relief Act of 2007\" excludes civil damages, restitution, or monetary awards for wrongfully incarcerated individuals. It also allows the first $50,000 ($75,000 for joint returns) of income for qualified wrongfully incarcerated individuals in a taxable year. The \"Wrongful Convictions Tax Relief Act of 2007\" allows exclusion for qualified wrongfully incarcerated individuals for up to 15 years or the number of years served in prison for the covered offense. The number of years served is rounded down to the nearest whole number. A wrongfully incarcerated individual is defined as someone who was wrongly imprisoned. An individual convicted of a covered offense, served time in prison for that offense, and was later pardoned, had their conviction reversed, or found not guilty qualifies as a \"wrongfully incarcerated individual.\" The term 'covered offense' refers to any criminal offense under Federal or State law, including those arising from the same course of conduct. A 'qualified wrongfully incarcerated individual' is someone who, apart from the covered offense, has never been convicted of a crime punishable by more than 1 year imprisonment. Refundable credit for employment taxes paid by wrongfully incarcerated individuals is allowed under section 36 of the Internal Revenue Code. The amendments apply to taxable years before, on, or after the enactment of the Act. A credit against taxes is allowed for wrongfully incarcerated individuals, including 50% of self-employment taxes and all taxes on wages, with a limit of $50,000 in total income. The credit under subsection (a) is not allowed for a qualified wrongfully incarcerated individual in any taxable year if a credit has been allowed for the preceding 15 years or the number of years served in prison for the covered offense. The Wrongful Convictions Tax Relief Act of 2007 includes provisions for qualified wrongfully incarcerated individuals, with adjustments to the number of years served in prison for the covered offense. Conforming amendments were made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 36. Employment taxes of wrongfully incarcerated individuals and SEC. 37. Overpayments of tax shall apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2007. SEC. 4 requires reporting for wrongfully incarcerated individuals. The Director of the Administrative Office of United States Courts reports annually to the Secretary of the Treasury on individuals wrongfully incarcerated for the administration of specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. The Secretary of the Treasury will enter into agreements with States to report information on wrongfully incarcerated individuals for the administration of specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code."
