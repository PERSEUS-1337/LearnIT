    "content": "The \"Working Families Flexibility Act of 1999\" may be cited as the short title. It includes provisions for compensatory time. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to allow private employees to receive compensatory time off in lieu of monetary overtime compensation, at a rate of one and a half hours for each hour of overtime worked. This provision does not apply to employees of public agencies. Private employees can receive compensatory time off instead of overtime pay if agreed upon in a collective bargaining agreement or a pre-work agreement between the employer and employee. Employees can choose to receive compensatory time off instead of monetary overtime compensation, as long as it is entered into voluntarily and not as a condition of employment. To be eligible, an employee must have worked at least 1000 hours for the employer in the 12-month period before agreeing to compensatory time off. The maximum amount of compensatory time that can be accrued is 160 hours. Employees can receive compensatory time off instead of monetary overtime compensation for up to 160 hours. Employers must provide monetary compensation for any unused compensatory time off by January 31 of each year. If an employee has more than 80 hours of unused compensatory time, the employer may offer monetary compensation for it.
