    "content": "The Supreme Court has overturned 228 of its own decisions, with the most controversial involving constitutional interpretation. The Court generally follows the doctrine of stare decisis but recognizes the need to correct errors or adapt to changed circumstances. Various approaches and standards are used when deciding to overrule precedent. The principle of stare decisis in constitutional decision making is criticized for being amorphous and manipulable. Adherence to precedent promotes certainty in the law and prevents arbitrariness. Stare decisis is essential for continuity over time and is not a constitutional command but a principle of policy. The principle of stare decisis is a policy judgment that prioritizes settled law over correctness. The Court may correct earlier interpretations deemed erroneous or outdated, but defining when to overrule a decision is challenging. The tension between continuity and error correction can create uncertainty. The Court is more willing to overrule decisions involving constitutional interpretation rather than statutory interpretation. The Court prioritizes settled law over correctness and may overrule decisions based on constitutional interpretation. Special justification is required for departing from the doctrine of stare decisis, with varying considerations depending on the precedent's importance. The Court considers various factors when reexamining a constitutional precedent, including practical workability, reliance on the rule, and the costs of overruling. These considerations help determine whether to adhere to or overrule a prior decision. When reexamining a constitutional precedent, the Court considers factors like practical workability, reliance on the rule, and the costs of overruling. This helps determine whether to adhere to or overrule a prior decision, as seen in cases like United States v. TitleIns. & Trust Co. and Patterson v. McLean Credit Union. The Court may assess if the central rule of a decision like Roe v. Wade has become unworkable or if changes in facts or perspectives justify overruling. The Casey majority found no basis for overruling Roe v. Wade, as they did not see it as unworkable or irrelevant. They noted the reliance on Roe's concept of liberty by a whole generation and stated that there had been no erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy. The Casey Court found no special reason to overrule Roe v. Wade, emphasizing the importance of upholding precedent and avoiding popular misconceptions about the judiciary. They highlighted the significance of societal changes in major overruling decisions of the past century. In West Coast Hotel v. Parrish (1937), the Court overruled its previous decision in Adkins v. Children's Hospital (1923), which had invalidated a state minimum wage law for adult women. This decision reversed the line of Lochner decisions based on laissez-faire economics and employers' liberty of contract. The Court cited changing economic conditions during the Great Depression as a reason for reconsideration. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Court overturned the \"separate-but-equal\" doctrine, ruling that racial segregation in public schools was inherently unequal. The decision was a significant force for social change, as the Court recognized the stigmatizing effects of segregation. The Court in Plessy v. Ferguson rejected any language contrary to the finding that racial segregation stigmatizes minority children, citing modern authority and academic studies. The Casey Court synthesized previous decisions based on changed facts and understanding, emphasizing the application of constitutional principles to new perspectives. In 2003, the Court overturned a state law banning consensual homosexual sodomy in Lawrence v. Texas, citing a misinterpretation of precedent in Bowers v. Hardwick. The Court justified its departure from stare decisis by pointing to eroded foundations and substantial criticism of the previous decision. In dissent, Justice Scalia argued that Roe v. Wade should not be overturned, comparing it to the decision in Bowers v. Hardwick. Recent decisions on the death penalty for mentally retarded individuals and juveniles did not provide clear guidance on departing from stare decisis, as they were based on the unique language of the Eighth Amendment. The Court determined that executing mentally retarded or juvenile offenders had become \"unusual\" by 2002 and 2005, respectively, despite being common in 1989. Factors like reliance and workability can influence the Court's decisions, as seen in a case where lack of workability led to a reversal on a federalism issue. The Court found that the previous test for determining minimum wage and overtime requirements on state governments was flawed and unworkable. Lower courts struggled to apply the test, leading to a shift in the Court's approach. Despite disagreements, the Court may be hesitant to overrule decisions that have proven practical and maintain their theoretical basis. In Dickerson v. United States, the Court upheld Miranda warnings, stating they had become ingrained in police practice and national culture. Chief Justice Rehnquist emphasized the importance of stare decisis and reliance interests in maintaining precedents, as seen in a case involving state taxation of out-of-state businesses. The Court occasionally overrules precedent with minor emphasis on \"special circumstances\" justifying departure from stare decisis. In Payne v. Tennessee, the Court overruled two recent decisions allowing victim impact statements during capital sentencing, citing unworkable or badly reasoned governing decisions. Adarand Constructors v. Pena emphasized correcting errors as a \"special\" circumstance to pay homage to stare decisis. Adarand Constructors v. Pena emphasized correcting errors as a \"special circumstance\" that justifies overruling precedent when it departs from well-established principles. The decision overruled Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, stating that it undermined important principles established over 50 years. This theory of overruling based on departure from established doctrine was not new, finding support in earlier decisions. The Adarand opinion found support in earlier decisions that overruled cases lacking constitutional roots and departing from precedent. Examples include United States v. Dixon, Solorio v. United States, and Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc. These cases emphasized correcting errors and departing from well-established principles. The Adarand opinion, like Dixon, emphasized overruling precedents that departed from well-established doctrine. Justice O'Connor highlighted the importance of quick overruling to restore the law and minimize reliance. The age of a precedent does not always prevent its overruling, as seen in Erie Railroad v. Tomkins overturning a nearly 100-year-old decision in Swift v. Tyson. The age of a precedent can lead to its erosion or reinforcement in the law, with older precedents being more susceptible to doctrinal changes. Overruling a precedent that has become integrated into the legal system may damage the rule of law and require strong arguments. The Court's decision to overrule a precedent should have rare precedential force to counter efforts to overturn it. The Court's decision to overrule a precedent should have rare precedential force to counter efforts to overturn it and maintain legitimacy. Justices balance their normative views with practical needs, leading to inconsistency in the Court's approach to overruling decisions. The implications of a Justice's balance between stare decisis and error correction can vary depending on the issue and their judicial philosophy. Originalists may prioritize error correction over preserving precedent. Justice Thomas recently advocated for this approach in a case involving the Takings Clause. Today's decision continues a trend of construing the Public Use Clause narrowly, disregarding its original meaning. The Public Use Clause, originally a meaningful limit on eminent domain power, has strayed from its original meaning. Justice Thomas has questioned long-standing interpretations of clauses like the Ex Post Facto Clause and the Eleventh Amendment. The Court has interpreted the provision as a broader recognition of sovereign immunity. Justice Brennan urged reconsideration of the doctrine's foundations, arguing that the Court has taken a wrong turn. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer have continued this argument despite the Court's application of the sovereign immunity principle. Brennan and Marshall opposed the death penalty as cruel and unusual punishment despite Court precedents. The impact of stare decisis on decision-making is questioned, with some Justices voting against their disapproval of precedent. Spaeth and Segal found that minority will does not always defer to majority rule in stare decisis. The Court's decision on whether to overrule precedent involves various competing considerations, including stare decisis. However, the Court lacks a clear conception of the role of precedent in constitutional adjudication, making it unpredictable when the Court will rely on stare decisis or depart from it."
