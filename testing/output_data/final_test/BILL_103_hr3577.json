The \"Center for Rare Disease Research Act of 1993\" establishes a Center within the National Institutes of Health to promote and coordinate research on rare diseases, manage a rare disease research clinical database, conduct research, award grants, and identify projects for rare disease research. The \"Center for Rare Disease Research Act of 1993\" mandates the National Institutes of Health to conduct or support research on rare diseases, disseminate information, maintain a central database, encourage diverse participation, and coordinate research among federal agencies. The Director is required to develop a strategic research plan identifying current activities, research opportunities, and priorities for rare disease research. The \"Center for Rare Disease Research Act of 1993\" mandates the National Institutes of Health to conduct or support research on rare diseases, disseminate information, maintain a central database, encourage diverse participation, and coordinate research among federal agencies. The Act also requires the development of a strategic research plan to identify research opportunities, prioritize areas with little research, enhance gene therapy research for rare diseases, establish registries for research subjects, address obstacles to treatment development, and assess training needs for physicians treating rare diseases. The \"Center for Rare Disease Research Act of 1993\" mandates the establishment of a Coordinating Committee on Rare Disease Research composed of key agency directors to coordinate research efforts among federal agencies and address obstacles in treatment development for rare diseases. The Coordinating Committee on Rare Disease Research, led by the Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, has duties including identifying research needs, estimating funding requirements, coordinating research efforts to avoid duplication, and ensuring diversity in research subjects. The National Advisory Board on Rare Disease Research, established by the Director, reviews federal research needs, priorities, activities, funding, and findings on rare diseases. It advises on the development of the research plan required under subsection (c) and is composed of 15 appointed individuals. The National Advisory Board on Rare Disease Research, established by the Director, consists of 15 appointed individuals representing health and scientific disciplines and individuals with rare diseases. The Board selects a chairperson annually, and its members also serve as ex officio members of the Coordinating Committee. Additionally, the Director is tasked with establishing a national rare disease clinical and informational database. The Director is responsible for establishing a national rare disease clinical and informational database that identifies current research, connects researchers with patients for clinical trials, provides information on clinical trials, and connects patients with support groups. The database information must be available to the general public. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1994 to 1996 for this purpose. The term 'rare disease' is defined as a condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States."
