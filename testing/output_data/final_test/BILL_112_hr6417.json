    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Research and Education Act of 2011\". Congress finds that breast cancer accounts for a significant portion of cancer diagnoses among women, with higher survival rates for White women compared to African-American women. African-American women are often diagnosed with more advanced stages of breast cancer despite a lower incidence rate. Early detection is crucial for increasing survival rates, with a 98 percent 5-year relative survival rate for early-stage breast cancers compared to 23 percent for stage IV cancers. Triple-negative breast cancer refers to a specific type of breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive form of cancer that affects women under 50, with a higher prevalence in African-American and Hispanic women. African-American women are three times more likely to develop this type of cancer compared to White women. Triple-negative breast cancer grows and spreads quickly, requiring surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy for treatment. Early detection is crucial for survival due to the ineffectiveness of hormone therapy. Research lacks information on prevalence rates in minority women and treatment costs. The costs of treating triple-negative breast cancer and methods for prevention and cure in women. Research with respect to triple-negative breast cancer. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will expand, intensify, and coordinate research programs on triple-negative breast cancer. This will be carried out through various institutes, offices, and centers of the NIH, with coordination by the Office of Research on Women's Health. Authorization of $500,000 for fiscal years 2013-2015 to support research programs on triple-negative breast cancer across NIH institutes, offices, and centers. SEC. 4. EDUCATION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and share public information on triple-negative breast cancer, focusing on its incidence among women, higher risk for minority women, and available treatment options. Information may be disseminated directly or through various organizations and agencies. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out the public information dissemination on triple-negative breast cancer. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide information to healthcare providers about triple-negative breast cancer, including the elevated risk for minority women and treatment options. Appropriations are authorized for this purpose from 2013 to 2017. The term \"minority women\" in this Act refers to women who are part of a racial or ethnic minority group, as defined in the Public Health Service Act."
