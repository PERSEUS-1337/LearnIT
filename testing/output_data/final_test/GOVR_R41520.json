    "content": "Border security is a key responsibility of the federal government, with threats including foreign military forces, smugglers, unauthorized visitors, and environmental hazards. The focus is on threats to the land borders with Canada and Mexico, with extensive narcotics smuggling being a major concern. Military alliances exist with both countries, but efforts to address unauthorized immigration from Mexico continue. Efforts to address unauthorized immigration from Mexico and other foreign nationals are a major responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other federal agencies. Concerns about terrorists entering the United States from both countries have also been raised. The violence in Mexico, linked to narcotics, is feared to potentially spill over into the US. Multiple federal agencies, including DHS components like Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as well as the Defense and State Departments, are responsible for maintaining border security. State, local, and tribal agencies also play key roles in border security efforts. The FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies work closely with state, local, and tribal governments to collect and share data on border security. They use various methods such as informants, screening devices, aerostats, and drones to disrupt illegal activities. These efforts are not considered intelligence activities and are not funded as such. The U.S. intelligence agencies have capabilities that supplement information from law enforcement sources for border security efforts. Overhead surveillance from reconnaissance satellites is one example of these capabilities, providing valuable information on illegal activities like narcotics production and tunneling under borders. The U.S. intelligence agencies gather information on illegal activities like narcotics production, tunneling under borders, and terrorist training camps. They use resources such as electronic surveillance, human agents, and open source materials to enhance border security efforts. Intelligence officers from agencies like the DEA conduct counternarcotics missions in dangerous conditions in Mexico and other countries. Media outlets from Mexico, Canada, and other countries also provide valuable information related to U.S. border security. The intelligence community's statutory missions include protecting the U.S. homeland from foreign threats, including international terrorist activities and counternarcotics efforts. National intelligence is defined to include matters related to national or homeland security, with priorities set by the DNI and the President. Counterterrorism is a key focus for intelligence agencies. The intelligence agencies' primary responsibility is border security, preventing foreign terrorists and weapons of mass destruction from entering the US. This involves law enforcement agencies, as well as federal non-law enforcement agencies like DOD and intelligence agencies. The US may take active measures outside its borders to combat threats. Narcotics trafficking involves US citizens and resident aliens as participants and consumers. The Obama Administration mandates intelligence community involvement in border security, specifically in counterterrorism and counternarcotics efforts. The National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy aims to enhance intelligence capabilities along the Southwest border by improving information sharing and analysis. The National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy focuses on enhancing intelligence capabilities for border security, including timely and relevant intelligence sharing among various agencies. Intelligence efforts will align with national intelligence initiatives, particularly those coordinated by the Director of National Intelligence. Illegal immigration aspects concerning terrorists, drug smugglers, and human trafficking will be of concern for the intelligence community. The intelligence community includes various agencies such as the CIA, NSA, NRO, NGA, DIA, INR, FBI, DEA, military services, Energy Department, Treasury Department, and Coast Guard. These agencies operate under the National Security Act of 1947 and Executive Order 12333. Funding for intelligence activities is authorized in annual intelligence authorization acts. Some agencies have both law enforcement and intelligence functions. Some agencies with law enforcement and intelligence responsibilities include the FBI, DEA, U.S. Coast Guard, and DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis. Border security officials face challenges in sharing intelligence information within the intelligence community and with law enforcement agencies. The need to share intelligence information with law enforcement officials has been complicated by historical distinctions between intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Coordination among agencies has always been challenging, leading to statutory and policy changes after 9/11. The Senate Intelligence Committee found that the failure to prevent the bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009 was due to a lack of information sharing among intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Different statutory frameworks govern these agencies, limiting CIA cooperation with law enforcement to protect democratic protections. After the enactment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in 1978, rules were established to restrict sharing of information from FISA surveillance. The USA Patriot Act and other post-9/11 legislation aimed to improve information sharing among government agencies involved in counterterrorism efforts. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) was established to analyze and integrate intelligence on international terrorism for government agencies. Fusion centers like the El Paso Intelligence Center also gather relevant information. Law enforcement agencies keep records on U.S. persons, while intelligence agencies focus on non-U.S. persons. Cooperation between law enforcement and intelligence agencies is limited by statutory constraints. The National Security Act allows DOD intelligence agencies to collect information for law enforcement, but not military service intelligence organizations. DOD has counternarcotics responsibilities since the 1980s. Fusion centers facilitate information sharing among relevant agencies, including intelligence agencies like the El Paso Intelligence Center. The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) in El Paso, TX, established in 1974, serves as a fusion center for information on counternarcotics and counterterrorism from various law enforcement agencies. NGA's contribution at EPIC is acknowledged, but not detailed. Other intelligence agencies provide contributions through DHS, DEA, Coast Guard, and FBI. Joint Task Force North in El Paso supports law enforcement agencies in the Southwest border region to counter the flow of illicit activities. The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) in Texas serves as a fusion center for counternarcotics and counterterrorism efforts in the Southwest border region. Other fusion centers like Joint Interagency Task Force-South in Key West and Joint Interagency Task Force West in Hawaii also play key roles. U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) in Colorado coordinates DOD support to civil authorities and assists in setting up intelligence centers with Mexico. Border security oversight involves multiple agencies and congressional committees. The role of intelligence agencies in border security is classified and requires integration with law enforcement at various levels. Oversight is handled by multiple congressional committees, including intelligence, judiciary, homeland security, armed services, foreign relations, and appropriations committees. Border security is a collaborative effort involving various agencies and foreign partners. Observers suggest careful oversight of intelligence community involvement in border security. The role of intelligence agencies in border security requires careful oversight to balance their involvement with traditional missions worldwide, ensure coordination with law enforcement, protect civil liberties, and consider impacts on relations with other countries. Congress addresses these issues in authorization and oversight hearings, but intelligence activities are overseen separately. Intelligence agencies operate separately from other governmental activities and are funded through specific programs. There is no specific budget request for border security within intelligence agency budgets. The statutory requirement for intelligence activities to be specifically authorized may complicate shifting funds from counternarcotics to intelligence activities. Congress may approve DOD budget requests for Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities, which could include intelligence activities. Shifting funds within this account to intelligence activities might lack specific authorization, as noted in DOD's FY2011 Budget Estimates. The Department of Defense is available for all-source collection of counterdrug intelligence and considers Congressional action on the budget request as satisfying the requirement of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 414(a). The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 authorizes appropriated funds for intelligence activities, with the DNI responsible for overseeing intelligence agencies serving multiple clients. The DNI is responsible for providing national intelligence to various clients, including the President and military officers. The Secretary of Defense also has similar responsibilities for using military intelligence to support military operations. Despite increased intelligence budgets, resources are limited, and intelligence support for homeland security missions may impact national security policymaking on topics like Chinese goals and Russian policies. Reducing support for ongoing military and counterterrorism operations to enhance border security missions would be challenging. Given the limited resources and competing intelligence priorities, Congress will need to review and potentially realign intelligence efforts, including those related to border security. Coordination between law enforcement and intelligence agencies is crucial to prevent neglecting important targets and maintaining a balance between collection and analysis during sensitive operations. Intelligence agencies must ensure coordination to avoid working at cross purposes and maintain overall alignment within the executive branch. Congress may need to review procedures to prevent potential conflicts and ensure effective collaboration between U.S. agencies and foreign operatives. Border security issues involve both U.S. persons and foreign nationals, requiring careful consideration and decision-making at policy levels. Border security challenges involve U.S. and foreign nationals at the U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada borders, posing unique difficulties for intelligence agencies like the CIA and NSA. There is a debate about collecting information on U.S. persons within legal boundaries, despite occasional inadvertent data collection. The controversies surrounding the willingness of the executive branch to accept excessive or illegal U.S. person collection by intelligence agencies have complicated their work. Congressional oversight with a complete understanding of program goals may reduce future similar situations. Concerns about potential collection on U.S. persons persist despite post-9/11 statutory changes, limiting the use of national intelligence assets for law enforcement missions. Efforts to establish procedures for using satellite-derived information for law enforcement purposes were reversed in 2009. Efforts to use satellite-derived information for law enforcement purposes were reversed in 2009. NSA's electronic surveillance involving U.S. persons faced heavy criticism and regulation through amendments to FISA. Intelligence agencies are cautious about gathering information on U.S. persons due to media and congressional scrutiny. Law enforcement agencies collect information on U.S. persons within legal boundaries, with overlaps in counterespionage and counterterrorism leading to established information-sharing mechanisms. After the 9/11 attacks, recommendations were made to strengthen information sharing mechanisms. Congressional oversight is in place for intelligence agencies, but border security information collection may pose privacy concerns. Congress should review procedures to restrict data collection on U.S. persons and assess the balance between information availability, security, and civil liberties. The United States' border security measures impact relations with Canada and Mexico, with both countries supporting U.S. counterterrorism and counternarcotics efforts. However, there are concerns in Canada and Mexico regarding some U.S. policies and intelligence agency roles. Canada has raised issues with U.S. counterterrorism initiatives, while Mexico collaborates closely with U.S. agencies in combating drug trafficking through the M\u00e9rida Initiative. The M\u00e9rida Initiative is a key aspect of U.S. border security efforts in collaboration with Mexico, but there are concerns about the role of U.S. intelligence agencies in both Canada and Mexico. Congress may review relations with these countries affected by border security initiatives, with potential diplomatic ramifications. Intelligence efforts in Canada and Mexico could impact overall diplomatic relationships. Issues Congress may examine to ensure secure U.S. borders, global intelligence missions, avoid waste, respect civil liberties, and maintain partnerships with Canada and Mexico in preventing illegal activities."
