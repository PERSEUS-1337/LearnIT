    "content": "Oil is a critical resource for the U.S. economy, meeting nearly 40% of total energy needs. The United States relies on net imports for 45% of its oil consumption, leading to energy security concerns. Concerns about dependence on foreign oil have been present since the late 1940s. Despite fluctuations, net oil import volumes peaked in 2005 and have since declined due to changes in domestic supply and demand. Oil import costs have increased due to rising prices, offsetting savings from lower import volumes. Interest in oil imports grew as prices rebounded in response to global economic recovery and unrest in the Middle East. The US became a net exporter of petroleum products in 2011, despite remaining a large net importer of oil. The US oil supply-demand balance is shown in Table 1. In 2011, the United States consumed 18.8 million barrels a day of petroleum products, down 9% since 2005. Domestic oil production was 9.2 million barrels a day, up 24% since 2005, leading to a decrease in net imports from 60% to 45% of domestic consumption. In the past six years, there was a 2.4 Mb/d decline in gross oil imports and a 1.8 Mb/d increase in exports. Gross imports fell by 17% since 2005, including decreases in both crude oil and petroleum products imports. Oil exports saw a 150% increase since 2005, with U.S. gross exports accounting for about 15% of the U.S. oil market in 2011. The report discusses oil import and export volumes, sources, destinations, and their impact on the U.S. trade balance. The United States imports both crude oil and petroleum products, while exports are mainly petroleum products due to economic and policy reasons. In 2011, the U.S. imported 11.4 Mb/d of oil, including 8.9 Mb/d of crude oil and 2.4 Mb/d of petroleum products. Gross imports peaked in 2005 and have since declined. In 2011, over a third of U.S. gross imports came from Canada and Mexico, while about 40% came from OPEC countries. Most imports from OPEC countries are crude oil, while non-OPEC imports are also mostly crude oil. Oil trading patterns can shift due to market conditions, but many companies consistently import oil from the same countries month to month. Refineries optimize operations for specific grades of crude oil, influenced by proximity, infrastructure, and trading relationships. Imports from various countries have declined in recent years, with lower imports from Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Norway due to declining output. OPEC's output cuts can also impact imports. Imports of crude oil into the United States have seen a general downward trend since 2005, but imports from Canada, Colombia, and Brazil have increased. Canadian imports rose from 2.1 Mb/d in 2005 to 2.7 Mb/d in 2011, with a larger share of gross imports coming from Canada. The Gulf Coast region receives the largest share of U.S. imports and has about half of the country's refining capacity. Around 90% of imports into the Gulf Coast are in the form of crude oil, which is refined and distributed to other parts of the country via pipeline. The East Coast is the only region that imports more petroleum products than crude oil, receiving products from various countries including Canada, St. Croix, Russia, and Europe in 2011. Imports of petroleum products into the East Coast are set to increase due to refinery closures in the U.S. Northeast. Constraints on import infrastructure and refinery closures in Europe and the Caribbean will complicate substitute sources of supply. More than half of the imported products are gasoline and diesel, with exports from the Gulf Coast growing. However, barriers such as pipeline capacity and the Jones Act hinder bringing more products from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. Plans to expand pipeline capacity are in place for the future. The Jones Act constrains trade between U.S. ports to U.S. flagged vessels, limiting tanker capacity for shipments from Gulf Coast to the Northeast. The American Maritime Partnership suggests using barge capacity for additional petroleum products, but larger tankers are more cost-effective for certain routes. Tankers are in high demand for shipments from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast, costing around 7 cents per gallon for a round trip. Articulated Tug Barges (ATBs) and large barges are also used, with transportation rates around 15 cents per gallon. Foreign tankers are available for imports, costing 5-9 cents per gallon for a trip from Europe to New York Harbor. Existing tankers may be diverted from shorter routes to travel between the Gulf Coast and the North East, while barge vessels could take up the shorter routes. Infrastructure constraints exist for shifting petroleum products from regional refineries to seaborne and new pipeline sources. U.S. exports mainly consist of petroleum products rather than crude oil due to policy and commercial factors. The U.S. exports petroleum products due to policy and commercial factors, with rising demand abroad leading to increased exports of diesel and gasoline. Exports have grown from 1.2 Mb/d in 2005 to 2.9 Mb/d in 2011, with a significant portion going to countries in the Western Hemisphere like Mexico, Canada, and Brazil. Exports of petroleum products from the United States have increased from 1.2 Mb/d in 2005 to 2.9 Mb/d in 2011, with a significant portion going to countries in the Western Hemisphere like Mexico, Canada, and Brazil. The U.S. sends more crude oil to the United States than they receive in refined products. Nearly 60% of gasoline exports go to Mexico, while exports of other fuels are more diversified. Export of crude oil is prohibited except in specific cases, but there are almost no limits on export of refined products. The growth in exports in recent years has been led by diesel and gasoline. The growth in U.S. oil exports, led by diesel and gasoline, reflects shifting market conditions. Demand for distillates like diesel has increased due to rapid economic growth in emerging markets, while gasoline demand has been stronger in these markets compared to advanced economies like the United States and Europe. With weak domestic demand and existing refining capacity, some U.S. refiners have turned to exporting petroleum products. The growth in U.S. oil exports, particularly diesel and gasoline, is driven by shifting market conditions and increased demand in emerging markets. Some refiners are looking to export refined products due to weak domestic demand and existing refining capacity. Net oil imports in the United States have decreased, with a shift from being a net petroleum products importer to an exporter. The U.S. remains a large net importer of oil despite the decline in crude oil imports. The United States remains the largest oil importer, with China following behind. U.S. oil imports are projected to decrease, reaching a peak in 2005. The Energy Information Administration forecasts a further decline in net oil imports by 2020, leveling out at around 7.5 Mb/d through 2035. The Energy Information Administration forecasts a decline in U.S. oil imports, with net oil imports projected to decrease from 60% of domestic consumption in 2005 to less than 40% after 2020. Import dependence is expected to decrease due to factors such as high oil prices, rising efficiency, and increased domestic production of crude oil and alternative fuels. Despite flat import volumes, import costs may rise if oil prices increase. The United States spent $327 billion on net oil imports in 2011, despite lower import volumes. The cost has increased from $229 billion in 2005, with each barrel costing more. The cost of net imports in 2011 was lower than the record high of $386 billion in 2008, with lower import volumes and higher export volumes contributing to keeping costs lower. The United States spent $327 billion on net oil imports in 2011, despite lower import volumes. Import dependence can have negative economic impacts, particularly if it contributes to long-term trade deficits or when prices for that good increase. Trade deficits are ultimately financed by borrowing from abroad, generating financial obligations for future repayment. The U.S. Trade Deficit, exacerbated by national oil import dependence, can lead to economic strain due to higher oil prices. This results in reduced savings and spending on domestic goods and services. Wealth from imported oil is sent abroad, with only a portion returned through increased U.S. exports. Even with domestic oil sources, price increases redistribute wealth to domestic oil producers, causing economic dislocation. Rapidly rising oil prices can lead to economic strain, with a sustained $10 per barrel increase potentially causing 0.2% lower economic growth and 120,000 fewer jobs in the first year. The U.S. economic recession in 2007-2008 was likely influenced by rising oil prices. If the U.S. produced as much oil as it consumed, wealth would still be redistributed from oil consumers to producers, impacting household and business budgets. Oil prices paid by U.S. consumers would still be affected by international events. Rising oil prices can lead to economic strain, impacting inflation, unemployment, and oil import costs despite increased domestic production and decreased consumption in the U.S. Global oil market integration plays a significant role in understanding these changes. More than 60% of global oil supply is traded internationally, affecting prices worldwide. Global oil consumption is at an all-time high, driven by demand from emerging market countries. Concerns about the adequacy of global supply have arisen due to the inability of supply to keep up with demand, leading to increased oil prices since 2002. Various factors such as depletion of resources, industry shifts, supply disruptions, and production restrictions have hampered global oil supply. Oil prices rose to balance the market, pricing out some consumers and incentivizing additional supply. Prices collapsed with the global economic downturn in 2008, but the respite was temporary. Prices recovered as economic growth returned, particularly in emerging markets, and new geopolitical developments again raised concerns about global supply. Unrest in Egypt, Libya, and other parts of the Middle East and North Africa contributed to higher oil prices in 2011, as have tensions with Iran in 2012. Supply disruptions or risk of disruptions to particular sources of oil production can raise oil costs even to countries that do not import oil from these sources. The disruptions in oil supply from countries like Iran led to higher oil prices globally. Customers had to find alternative sources, bidding up the cost of oil. Crude oil prices heavily influence gasoline prices, with crude oil making up 76% of gasoline costs in December 2011. Gasoline prices track crude oil prices closely, which had been increasing from late 2011. Oil import and export developments pose policy issues, including concerns about import dependence and rising exports. The debate around the Keystone XL pipeline involves both imports and exports. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created to provide a short-term policy option in case of supply disruptions. President Truman appointed the Paley. President Truman appointed the Paley Commission to examine the security of oil supply and recommended policies for greater domestic production and efficiency. President Eisenhower imposed quotas on oil imports in 1958, which were replaced by import fees by President Nixon in 1974. Current tariffs on oil imports range from 5.25\u00a2 to 52.5\u00a2 per barrel. The Appendix lists various rates for oil and petroleum products eligible for duty-free treatment under trade agreements like NAFTA, GSP, and AGOA. These programs resulted in about $180 million in foregone revenue in 2010, down from $215 million in 2005. Tariffs on refined oil products are already at maximum levels allowed by WTO agreements, so any potential tariff increase may be limited to crude oil tariffs. The United States has not made any tariff commitments to the WTO. The United States has not made any tariff commitments to the WTO binding duties on crude oil. An increase in the tariff on crude oil alone may disadvantage domestic refiners by raising costs, potentially leading to more imports of refined products instead of crude oil. The Obama Administration aims to reduce oil imports by one-third over the next decade through various measures. Members of Congress have introduced proposals to increase domestic liquid fuels supply or reduce demand. The United States aims to reduce oil imports by one-third over the next decade through various measures. Congress has introduced proposals to increase domestic liquid fuels supply, driven by onshore crude oil and natural gas liquids production from tight oil and shale gas formations. Tight oil production is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Tight oil production in the United States is expected to increase significantly, with forecasts suggesting a rise to 1.7 Mb/d by 2016. The Bakken and Three Forks deposits in North Dakota, as well as Texas's Eagle Ford shale, are major sources of this production. Environmental concerns exist regarding the extraction processes, prompting government and industry efforts to address risks. The tradeoffs of offshore oil and gas development have been debated, with concerns about safety and environmental risks highlighted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Efforts are being made to reduce risks through regulatory enforcement and industry-led preventative measures. Ethanol production as a motor fuel is another example of policy tradeoffs, with increased production since 2005. Production of biofuels has increased since 2005, with critics pointing out concerns about higher food prices and the high cost to taxpayers. The ethanol tax credit reduced federal excise tax revenue by $6 billion in 2009, costing taxpayers $1.78 for each gallon of gasoline displaced by corn-based ethanol. Most biofuels blending and production tax credits expired in 2011, except for the cellulosic biofuels production tax credit set to expire in 2012. The United States is self-sufficient in coal and natural gas, with technologies to convert them to liquid fuels being expensive and emitting greenhouse gases. Federal support may resolve these issues, but there is a fiscal trade-off. Growing natural gas supplies and low domestic prices have made natural gas technologies more attractive, with competing uses including power generation, domestic industry, and LNG exports. The Department of Energy has received 10 applications for LNG facilities, equivalent to 22% of 2011 U.S. dry gas production. Congressional policy trade-offs include increasing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard in 2007. Congress increased the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard (CAFE) in 2007 for cars, aiming to reach 49.6 mpg by 2025. The Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009 (CARS) provided rebates for trading in used cars for more fuel-efficient vehicles, stimulating the auto industry and vehicle efficiency. The CARS program provided temporary stimulus for economic recovery, created jobs, and accelerated fuel efficiency. However, it may have cost the government more than future fuel savings for consumers. It only reduces 2020 oil consumption and emissions by 0.02% and accelerated some future sales. Scrapping traded-in cars may increase costs for future used car buyers. Crude oil exports are generally prohibited by law. The Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) grants export licenses for crude oil under certain conditions, including shipments on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, foreign origin, or from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for import of refined products. Crude of foreign origin can be re-exported if not mixed with U.S. crude. EPCA and other statutes allow for these exports. The President can permit crude oil export of U.S. origin if it is in the national interest. Various determinations have been made in the past for limited exports, including heavy crude oil from California in 1992 and oil exports to Canada in 1985 and 1988. Congress passed P.L. 104-58 in 1995, allowing exports of oil on the Trans-Alaska pipeline unless deemed not in the national interest. Small amounts of crude oil were exported from Alaska until 2000. The Export Administration Regulations do not require a license for export of refined petroleum products. The President has the authority to restrict exports of coal, petroleum products, natural gas, or petrochemical feedstock if deemed necessary. There is interest in restricting petroleum product exports due to rising export volumes and prices. U.S. trade commitments may limit the ability to prohibit exports without justification under a trade agreement exception. The GATT prohibits WTO members from maintaining export quotas, but there are exceptions for critical shortages of essential products. The United States has challenged China in the WTO over export restrictions on various materials. The GATT prohibits export quotas, with exceptions for critical shortages. NAFTA places restrictions on US energy exports to Canada. The impact of prohibiting petroleum product exports on prices is uncertain. The export of petroleum products is debated, with some suggesting restrictions while others argue for no decline in gasoline prices. Export proponents believe exporting refined products can support economic growth. Refiners may need to sell more domestically or operate at lower capacity without exports, potentially leading to lower margins. If refiners cannot buy crude, process it, and sell products at a profit, they may curtail operations. Oil consumption is relatively unresponsive to price and more responsive to income and economic growth. It may require large discounts in price to sell additional volumes, especially in a weak economy. Concerns about petroleum product exports can be seen as a distributional issue, with the main driver of higher gasoline prices being the price of crude oil. Utilizing existing refining capacity for export earnings could benefit the economy. Rising petroleum product exports are shown in Table 7. Rising petroleum product exports can help offset the increase in the net oil import bill. Refiners benefit from higher prices of petroleum products compared to crude oil. Consumers may face higher costs due to foreign market demand. Prohibiting exports may not significantly impact consumer prices as they are mainly driven by crude oil prices. Some suggest imposing a federal tax on exports instead of prohibiting them to address the issue. Some suggest a federal tax on exports as an alternative to prohibiting them, citing constitutional limitations. The Keystone XL pipeline is debated for its potential impact on U.S. oil trade, with proponents arguing for increased production from Canada's oil sands and opponents raising environmental concerns. The Keystone XL pipeline is debated for its environmental impacts and economic benefits. Opponents raise concerns about potential exports of crude oil from the pipeline, suggesting it may not benefit the United States in terms of energy security. There is a possibility that Canadian crude oil transported through the pipeline could be exported from the United States. The U.S. Gulf Coast's refining capacity may make it more economical to refine Canadian oil sands crude in the United States. This heavy sour crude will compete with foreign sources like Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela for U.S. imports. If pipeline capacity from the oil sands to the U.S. is not expanded, Canada may look to other markets for its crude. If Canada expands pipeline capacity to its west coast, it may result in growing oil sands output being shipped to Asia, leaving the United States to import more oil from the Middle East and Africa. Projects to expand pipeline capacity face opposition but the Canadian government plans to streamline the environmental review process. There is a separate issue of whether Canadian crude will be refined into petroleum products for export, with no existing policy to restrict exports. The Keystone XL pipeline may lead to the export of petroleum products refined from oil it carries, potentially conflicting with legislation prohibiting such exports. This could impact U.S. commitments under international trade agreements. However, the pipeline will not shield the U.S. from global oil price fluctuations. The Keystone XL pipeline would connect oil sands production and tight oil production in North Dakota to the Midwest oil hub of Cushing, OK, and Gulf Coast refineries, addressing transportation bottlenecks. There is currently sufficient pipeline capacity between Canada and the United States until around 2019. Transport issues for growing North Dakota production and Midwest to Gulf Coast transportation are also discussed. The bottleneck between the Midwest and Gulf Coast for oil sands and U.S. Midwestern crude oil producers is being addressed by the reversal of the Seaway pipeline and TransCanada's Gulf Coast Pipeline Project. This will alleviate the glut of crudes in the Midwest market and provide access to a larger market for crude oil. The Keystone XL pipeline could help reduce the discount oil sands crudes face in the Midwest by providing access to a larger market with sophisticated refining capacity. This could lead to greater investment and more rapid development in the oil sands, potentially increasing global oil supply and lowering oil prices. The pipeline could carry about 0.8 Mb/d, representing a 20% increase in existing pipeline capacity from Canada to the United States. The Keystone XL pipeline could potentially increase global oil supply and lower oil prices by providing additional transport capacity from the oil sands to the United States. While some argue that the impact on oil prices may be minimal given the size of the global market, it could still benefit the U.S. economy by directing more wealth transfer from oil importers to major trade partners who are likely to spend on U.S. goods and services. Increased oil supply from Canadian oil sands may lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to average crude oil used in the United States. Various studies show differences in emissions due to data, methodology, and supply chain focus. Many studies are \"Well-to-Wheels\" life-cycle assessments, including emissions from extraction, transportation, refining, distribution, and combustion by end users. Studies focusing on specific parts of the supply chain, such as \"Well-to-Tank\" or \"Well-to-Refinery Gate,\" can significantly impact the greenhouse gas intensity of oil sands crudes in study results. The debate continues on which inputs into fuel production should be included in a full Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), along with their values and weights. While upstream GHG emissions from Canada's petroleum industry may not directly affect U.S. National Emissions Inventories or GHG reporting, the increased use of more GHG-intensive resources in the U.S. could have negative consequences for both U.S. and global energy and environmental policies. The U.S. Department of State analyzed GHG emissions associated with the Keystone XL pipeline project in comparison to other crudes. The project may have continental scale environmental impacts but may not significantly affect oil extraction in Canada or crude oil transportation to the U.S. The Final EIS concluded that the project's influence on global emissions is minimal. The Final EIS found that the crudes to be transported on the Keystone XL pipeline are somewhat more GHG-intensive than those they would displace in U.S. refineries. A 2009 NETL study showed that gasoline from Canadian oil sands crudes has about 17% more GHG emissions compared to the U.S. baseline, but is similar to gasoline from some Venezuelan and Nigerian crudes. Studies analyzed by the Department of State found that fuel from oil sands crudes is 9% to 19% more GHG-intensive. The Department of State found that fuel from oil sands crudes is 9% to 19% more GHG-intensive than fuel from Middle Eastern heavy sour crude, Mexican Maya crude, and Venezuelan Bachaquero crude. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created by Congress after the Arab Oil Embargo in 1973-1974, currently holding 696 million barrels of oil in Texas and Louisiana, equivalent to 83 days' worth of U.S. net oil imports. The President can release oil from the SPR in case of severe energy supply interruptions. After the Arab Oil Embargo, the United States helped form the International Energy Agency (IEA) to ensure member countries hold 90 days' worth of oil stocks. IEA members collectively held over 4 billion barrels of oil stocks in January 2012, with 1.5 billion controlled by governments. The U.S. has used the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) during global supply disruptions like the Gulf War, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and disruptions in Libyan exports, impacting global oil prices. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a short-term tool to respond to sudden supply disruptions at home or abroad. In 2012, the tightening U.S. and EU sanctions on Iran are affecting global oil prices, as former purchasers of Iranian crude oil are seeking supply elsewhere, potentially driving up prices for U.S. consumers. The current disruptions in oil supply from Sudan, Syria, and Yemen have led to calls for releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to lower prices for U.S. consumers. There is debate on what constitutes a significant enough supply disruption to warrant an SPR drawdown, as using the SPR may leave less oil for future disruptions and risk refilling at higher prices. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) may not be fully utilized if too cautious, leading to market participants discounting its future use. More details on SPR issues can be found in CRS Report R41687."
