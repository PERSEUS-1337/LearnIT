    "content": "In recent years, laws have expanded law enforcement's use of DNA for investigating crimes. Biological matter is collected and sent to the FBI for analysis, with unique DNA profiles stored in a national database for matching individuals to crime scene evidence. Originally, DNA extraction was only authorized for violent or sex-based felonies, but new laws have broadened the scope of compulsory DNA collection. The Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act of 2010 (H.R. 4614) expands DNA collection authority to include individuals arrested for specified crimes. Courts have generally upheld compulsory DNA collection as constitutional, despite challenges under the Fourth Amendment. This report examines the statutory authorities, constitutional principles, and case law related to compulsory DNA extraction from arrestees. DNA profiles function like genetic fingerprints in matching perpetrators to crimes, and recent developments may impact Fourth Amendment cases. Compulsory DNA collection involves blood or saliva samples, creating DNA profiles that can match biological evidence from crime scenes. The FBI manages DNA storage and analysis for law enforcement agencies, creating profiles from \"junk DNA.\" This process complements fingerprint analysis in identifying criminal suspects. The categories of individuals from whom law enforcement officials may require DNA samples have expanded in recent years, including those convicted of specified criminal offenses and those arrested or detained. DNA analysis is done on \"junk DNA,\" which is not associated with known physical or medical characteristics, to minimize invasion of privacy. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act 2000 authorizes compulsory DNA collection from individuals in federal custody, including those detained, arrested, or facing charges. Relevant officials may use necessary means to collect a DNA sample if an individual refuses to cooperate. State laws vary, with nearly all states allowing compulsory DNA collection from convicted individuals and a growing number also allowing collection from arrestees. Federal statutory authority for compulsory DNA collection has expanded rapidly since the 1990s. The federal laws in the 1990s established the framework for DNA collection, storage, and analysis. The DNA Identification Act of 1994 funded DNA collection for law enforcement and created the FBI's Combined DNA Index System. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 provided grants for DNA collection procedures, and the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 funded DNA analysis programs. The Combined DNA Index System is central to the framework, with over 170 law enforcement agencies participating. Recent laws have expanded DNA collection authority for law enforcement. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 and subsequent laws have expanded DNA collection authority for law enforcement. Qualifying federal offenses for compulsory DNA extraction have been broadened to include terrorism-related crimes, crimes of violence, sexual abuse crimes, and all felonies. States also authorize DNA collection from individuals convicted of any felony, as well as from those detained or arrested but not convicted. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 and subsequent laws expanded DNA collection authority for law enforcement to include individuals arrested, facing charges, or convicted of certain offenses. The U.S. Department of Justice implemented this authorization in 2009, requiring DNA samples from such individuals and non-U.S. persons detained under U.S. authority. Some states have also enacted laws for DNA collection from arrestees. H.R. 4614, a bill passed by the House, aims to provide grant funding incentives for states to collect DNA from persons arrested for specified offenses. Congress's goal is to create a comprehensive database to prevent crimes by catching serial offenders early. The expansion to collecting DNA from arrestees is seen as a significant step in law enforcement effectiveness. The expansion of DNA collection to include arrestees is seen as a significant step in law enforcement for crime prevention and creating DNA profiles for detained aliens. Congress has provided protections for arrestees, mandating expungement of DNA samples upon discharge or acquittal. The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. Different tests determine if a Fourth Amendment right is triggered depending on whether the government action is considered a search or seizure. Seizures involve interference with property rights, and a seizure of property occurs when government action \"meaningfully interferes\" with those rights. Government action constitutes a search when it intrudes upon a person's \"reasonable expectation of privacy.\" This expectation requires both a subjective manifestation of privacy and societal recognition of it as reasonable. People generally have no expectation of privacy for physical characteristics knowingly exposed to the public. The Supreme Court has sometimes indicated that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in fingerprints, distinguishing them from the drawing of blood and other internal fluids. The Supreme Court has indicated that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in fingerprints, as they are knowingly exposed to the public. However, the extraction of blood, urine, and other fluids is considered an intrusion upon a reasonable expectation of privacy. The level of privacy expectation also depends on the status of the person from whom the evidence is gathered, creating a continuum of privacy expectations. For example, probation conditions can diminish a person's reasonable expectation of privacy, affecting the outcome under the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment right is crucial in determining the constitutionality of government actions as it pertains to searches and seizures. Different standards are applied by courts in various circumstances to assess the reasonableness of these activities. The Court's analysis of the Fourth Amendment falls into three main categories, with traditional law enforcement activities requiring \"probable cause\" for their reasonableness. Probable cause is a fluid concept based on probabilities in specific contexts and is the most stringent standard under the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment standard for issuing warrants requires probable cause based on specific evidence to determine a \"fair probability\" of contraband. In situations with a lower standard than probable cause, such as in Terry v. Ohio, searches can be justified by \"reasonable suspicion\" or \"specific reasonable inferences.\" This includes searches in exempted areas. The Fourth Amendment standard for issuing warrants requires probable cause based on specific evidence to determine a \"fair probability\" of contraband. In situations with a lower standard than probable cause, such as in Terry v. Ohio, searches can be justified by \"reasonable suspicion\" or \"specific reasonable inferences.\" This includes exempted areas and other suspicionless searches like routine inventory searches, border searches, roadblocks, and drug testing. Courts apply a \"general approach to the Fourth Amendment\" to determine reasonableness by balancing privacy intrusion with legitimate governmental interests. In the context of law enforcement's collection of DNA from individuals under supervision, questions arise about when a special need must exist for a court to apply a general reasonableness standard. The special needs test, originally for drug testing, extends to probation and post-conviction punishment regimes as distinct from law enforcement purposes. For example, in Griffin v. Wisconsin, the Court recognized probation systems as having special needs separate from law enforcement. The Supreme Court has applied a general reasonableness test in Fourth Amendment cases involving post-conviction punishments without requiring a special need for DNA collection from individuals under supervision. This approach focuses on the status of the person searched rather than the justification of government action, distinct from existing legal bases for suspicionless searches. In United States v. Knights, the Court justified government action based on reduced privacy expectations of post-conviction individuals, allowing searches without a warrant as a condition of probation. In Knights v. United States, the Court upheld a search of a probationer's home without a warrant, citing the curtailment of privacy rights for post-conviction individuals. The search was evaluated under a general balancing test, considering Knights's diminished expectation of privacy. The Court emphasized that Knights' probation status justified the search based on reasonable suspicion. In Samson v. California, the Court extended this reasoning to uphold a search of a parolee's pockets without specific suspicion, solely based on their parole status. In Samson, the Court held that a parolee's diminished privacy rights affected the outcome of the general balancing test, extending the reasoning from Knights. It is unclear which other groups may have reduced privacy expectations based on their status, with suggestions that pre-trial detainees may also experience a lesser reduction in privacy rights. The Supreme Court referred to parolees and probationers as falling along a continuum of state-imposed punishments. In Samson, the Court ruled that parolees have limited privacy rights due to searches being a condition of parole. Lower courts view prisoners as having the lowest privacy expectations, followed by parolees, supervised release individuals, and probationers. U.S. district courts differ on DNA collection from pre-trial detainees and its impact on privacy expectations. Courts agree that DNA collection is a search triggering Fourth Amendment rights, with some suggesting it may also be a seizure. Courts have generally not addressed whether DNA collection or storage constitutes a seizure. The question in cases brought is whether DNA collection satisfies the Fourth Amendment reasonableness test. Prior to expanding DNA collection authority to arrestees, most courts upheld laws authorizing compulsory DNA collection against Fourth Amendment challenges. Various U.S. Courts of Appeals upheld federal and state laws authorizing DNA collection from individuals convicted of felonies, sexual crimes, and crimes of violence. Courts have applied different legal tests for post-conviction DNA collection. Federal courts of appeals have interpreted Samson as requiring the general reasonableness test without a special needs prerequisite. For example, in Wilson v. Collins and United States v. Weikert, the courts applied the general reasonableness test in cases involving prisoners and individuals on supervised release. Some federal courts of appeals have not applied the special needs test in DNA collection cases, such as in United States v. Amerson where compulsory DNA collection was upheld for individuals on probation. The Sixth Circuit also suggested that the Samson ruling may not apply to cases involving non-prisoners, emphasizing a diminished expectation of privacy. The Supreme Court's emphasis on diminished privacy rights for post-conviction individuals aligns with the question of whether suspicionless searches offend the Fourth Amendment. Courts have consistently upheld post-conviction DNA collection regardless of the standard applied, indicating that a change in analytic tools would not impact the constitutionality determination. Some courts have clarified that their approach to DNA collection in post-conviction cases remains unchanged. Some courts have addressed DNA collection in post-conviction cases, clarifying that their rulings do not apply to collection from arrestees. Only a few state and federal decisions have tackled DNA collection from individuals awaiting trial, with mixed outcomes. Two federal district courts have issued conflicting rulings on pre-conviction DNA collection challenges. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will soon rule on a federal collection challenge from an arrestee. In two U.S. district court cases, the government sought DNA samples from defendants before trial. The courts differed in their views on the intrusiveness of DNA collection, with one likening it to fingerprinting and the other highlighting its potential to reveal private genetic information. This difference in perspective also influenced their assessment of the government's interest in collecting DNA. The Mitchell court viewed DNA collection as more intrusive than fingerprinting, stating that identifying suspects can be done with a fingerprint and photograph. The Pool court considered a grand jury indictment as a significant event that justifies detaining a defendant, leading to a diminished expectation of privacy for post-indictment arrestees. The court in Mitchell found that post-indictment arrestees have a reduced expectation of privacy, specifically in cases where DNA collection occurs after an indictment. Criticizing the Pool opinion, the Mitchell court disagreed with elevating the standard of probable cause to match the higher standard of reasonable doubt required for conviction. The Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments in Pool, where Pool argued that his case, involving DNA collection before conviction, should be distinguished from previous cases upholding post-conviction DNA collection. The court in States v. Kriesel upheld post-conviction DNA collection, possibly considering a narrow ruling limited to cases following an indictment or probable cause determination. Future cases may grapple with conflicting decisions on pre-conviction DNA collection. Emerging issues like the use of junk DNA for biological purposes and the FBI's storage of DNA profiles could impact the constitutionality of DNA collection from convicted individuals. Despite rapid technological advancements in DNA analysis, these factors may influence future judicial analyses. Despite the rapid pace of technological development in DNA analysis, much of its scientific value remains a mystery. FBI analysts use junk DNA, which is believed not to reveal sensitive medical or biological information. Proponents of expansive DNA collection argue that any privacy intrusion from DNA storage or analysis is minimal. Senator Kyl emphasized that the DNA samples kept are \"junk DNA\" and do not intrude upon individuals' privacy rights. Courts have assumed that DNA analysis and storage minimally intrudes on privacy, but this assumption may change with new discoveries. Some opinions suggest that the assumption about junk DNA may change with new discoveries. Research indicates that junk DNA may have more biological value than previously thought, with the potential to evolve into protein-coding genes. Scientists believe there could be valuable information hidden in junk DNA, raising questions about its use in DNA analysis for identifying medical or biological characteristics in the future. The constitutionality of storing convicts' DNA profiles after their sentences end is a potential issue in future cases. Federal law requires expungement of DNA profiles for acquitted individuals, but does not address storage for those who have completed their sentences. This raises concerns about police accessing DNA without consent or warrant long after release. This issue may become more prevalent as laws expand collection authority, especially for minor charges. Some courts have raised concerns about the constitutionality of storing convicts' DNA profiles after their sentences end, especially as laws expand collection authority for minor charges. The issue of long-term storage of DNA may be viewed as an unconstitutional search, depending on whether completion of a sentence restores a person's reasonable expectation of privacy. The constitutionality of DNA collection from arrestees or those facing charges prior to trial is still debated in courts. Key issues include the distinction in privacy expectations between arrestees and convicts, and the level of intrusion from DNA sampling. The outcome of future cases may hinge on whether DNA collection is seen as similar to fingerprinting. The constitutionality of DNA collection from arrestees or those facing charges prior to trial is still debated in courts. Existing expungement provisions might play a role in future challenges to pre-conviction DNA collection, with some federal courts noting the provisions but not addressing their impact in Fourth Amendment analyses."
