The \"Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act of 2005\" acknowledges the prevalence of lead-based paint in 38 million housing units in the US, with 25 million posing hazards due to lead levels above safety standards. Despite a decrease in lead poisoning cases in children, it remains a serious threat to their health and development. The Secretary of Health and Human Services aims to end childhood lead poisoning by 2010. Federal lead abatement programs have limited resources, only making 7,000 homes lead-safe annually. Old windows with lead-based paint pose significant risks due to deterioration and lead dust generation. The purpose of encouraging safe removal of lead hazards from homes is to reduce childhood lead poisoning, which can cause reduced intelligence, learning difficulties, behavioral problems, and other health consequences. Removing old windows with lead-based paint can significantly reduce lead poisoning hazards and save energy. Studies show that abatement or interim control measures can effectively reduce lead poisoning risks. SEC. 30D. HOME LEAD HAZARD REDUCTION ACTIVITY. This section provides a tax credit for activities aimed at reducing lead hazards in homes. Tax credit of 50% for lead hazard reduction activity costs paid by taxpayer for eligible dwelling units, with a limit of $3,000 for lead abatement measures and $1,000 for interim lead control measures. The term 'lead hazard reduction activity cost' refers to the expenses incurred for assessing and addressing lead-based paint hazards in eligible dwelling units. This cost is subject to a tax credit of 50%, with a maximum limit of $3,000 for lead abatement measures and $1,000 for interim lead control measures. The abatement supervisor oversees the removal of lead-based paint and dust, encapsulation of lead-based paint, replacement of painted surfaces, windows, or fixtures, and soil remediation. This includes interim lead control measures such as specialized cleaning, repairs, maintenance, painting, and ongoing monitoring. The cost for a certified lead abatement supervisor, workers under their supervision, or a qualified contractor to conduct lead abatement measures must be evaluated and completed by a certified supervisor using accepted methods. The measures should have an expected useful life of more than 10 years. The term 'lead hazard reduction activity cost' includes costs for interim lead control measures and relocation for occupant protection. An eligible dwelling unit refers to any dwelling unit in a taxable year. A 'unit' for a taxable year is a dwelling unit in the United States, built before 1960, where at least 1 child under 6 years old or a woman of child-bearing age resides for at least 50% of the year, with residents having an income below 185% of the poverty line. The terms 'dwelling unit', 'lead-based paint hazard', 'certified lead abatement supervisor', and 'certified inspector' are defined in federal regulations. A certified risk assessor is an inspector certified by the EPA or a State agency. A qualified contractor is a contractor who has completed an approved training course on lead safe work practices. After lead hazard reduction activity is complete, a certified inspector or risk assessor must provide written documentation to the taxpayer for credit allowance under subsection (a) of the Environmental Protection Agency regulations. This documentation must include evidence that the eligible dwelling unit passes clearance examinations required by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The taxpayer must provide documentation showing that the eligible dwelling unit is free of lead dust hazards or meets lead hazard evaluation criteria. This documentation must be filed with the appropriate State agency and attached to the tax return for the taxable year. The taxpayer must provide documentation of lead hazard reduction activity costs paid or incurred for the eligible dwelling unit in the taxable year. The basis of the property eligible for the credit will be reduced by the amount of the credit allowed. Any deduction for costs used to calculate the credit is not eligible for a double benefit. The credit for lead-based paint abatement costs is limited by the amount of tax liability for the taxable year. Any excess credit can be carried forward for up to 20 years. The credit for lead-based paint abatement costs can be carried forward for up to 20 taxable years. Rules similar to section 39 apply to the credit carryforward. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting a new item after section 30C for lead-based paint abatement costs credit carryforward. The amendments made by section 30D apply to lead hazard reduction costs incurred after December 31, 2005, in taxable years ending after that date."
