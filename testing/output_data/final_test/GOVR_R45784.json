    "content": "Many U.S. officials and Members of Congress view Poland as a key ally and one of the most pro-U.S. countries in Europe. Close bilateral cooperation areas with Poland include NATO capabilities, counterterrorism, nonproliferation, missile defense, human rights, economic growth, energy security, and regional cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe. Poland, the most populous Central European and Baltic country in NATO and the EU, has a significant economy and military presence. Poland, a key ally and pro-U.S. country in Europe, joined NATO and the EU with strong U.S. support. It continues to look to the U.S. for foreign policy leadership. Recent developments related to Russia and NATO are relevant for Congress, with Poland being a central partner. Concerns have been raised about governance trends since the 2015 parliamentary election, led by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of the Law and Justice party. In the 2015 parliamentary election, the conservative-nationalist Law and Justice party won with 37.6% of the vote, securing an absolute majority in parliament. The center-right Civic Platform party came in second place. The next parliamentary election is scheduled for October or November 2019. Poland's president is Andrzej Duda, backed by Law and Justice. Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, head of Law and Justice party, is considered the most powerful politician in Poland despite holding no formal government post. He co-founded the party with his late twin brother Lech, who served as president from 2005 to 2010 before his tragic death in a plane crash. In 2010, Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, the President of Poland, died in a plane crash along with 95 others, including high-ranking officials. The 2015 election saw Law and Justice capitalize on public concerns over migration and advocate for increased social spending. Voter fatigue towards Civic Platform and discontent with the political establishment also played a role in the election outcome. The Civic Platform party in Poland faced a decline due to a scandal in 2015 and a change in leadership with Donald Tusk becoming President of the European Council. The 2015 election highlighted a divide between national-oriented social conservatives and Western-oriented liberals. The Law and Justice-led government implemented controversial reforms, causing tensions with the EU and domestic opponents. Law and Justice in Poland seeks to reform the country's political system and institutions based on traditional national-patriotic values, distancing from liberal European values. The party condemns the communist era, holds nationalist views, and maintains suspicion towards Russia and tensions with Germany. In the 2018 regional elections, Law and Justice party maintained steady support, winning 34% of the vote and the most seats in 9 out of 16 regional assemblies. They did well among rural and less affluent voters, while opposition parties like Civic Platform performed better in urban areas. Law and Justice also won 27 seats in the May 2019 European Parliament elections, securing approximately 45% of the Polish vote. Despite public protests against the government's reforms, Law and Justice party maintained support in the European Parliament elections, winning 27 seats with approximately 45% of the Polish vote. Opposition parties, including Civic Platform, won 22 seats with 38% of the vote, but struggled to offer an effective alternate message. Law and Justice's support was unaffected by controversy over domestic reforms or corruption scandals. The party faced pressure due to a documentary film about sexual abuse by Polish priests, leading to increased prison sentences for offenders. The Law and Justice-led government in Poland has faced criticism for reforms to the judicial system that are seen as undermining judicial independence and the rule of law. The reforms have increased executive and parliamentary powers over the selection and removal of judges, which were previously determined by professional bodies within the judiciary. Law and Justice leaders argue that the reforms were necessary due to inefficiencies in the judicial system and lack of accountability in selecting new judges. The Polish government's reforms to the judicial system have been criticized for undermining judicial independence. In addition, the government has taken control of public broadcasting stations and cut funding to civil society organizations, leading to concerns about media independence and stifling opposition. Reforms to the electoral system have also been implemented, with the government claiming they will increase fairness and transparency. The Polish government's reforms to the electoral system, set to take effect after the 2019 parliamentary elections, have sparked controversy. Critics argue that the changes, including replacing members of the National Electoral Commission and appointing new local election commissioners, could politicize the administration of elections and favor the ruling Law and Justice party. This has raised concerns among domestic political opponents and outside observers, who fear a rollback of Poland's democracy and the creation of an \"illiberal\" state. Law and Justice leaders and supporters, however, deny these claims and accuse their political opponents of crafting a false narrative. In 2016, the European Commission launched an inquiry into the effects of judicial and public media reforms in Poland. The Polish government rejected EU's recommended measures, citing interference with sovereignty and lack of understanding of the legal system. In December 2017, the European Commission recommended imposing an \"Article 7\" sanction on Poland. The EU is considering imposing an \"Article 7\" sanction on Poland, which could suspend its voting rights. However, Hungary has stated it would veto such a measure. The EU is also looking into linking regional funding to Poland's judicial independence and rule-of-law standards in the next budget framework. Poland is the largest beneficiary of EU funding, receiving \u20ac106 billion in the 2014-2020 budget. In October 2018, Poland complied with a ruling from the European Court of Justice to suspend a law regarding Supreme Court retirements. In July 2018, Poland suspended a law allowing the president to retire Supreme Court judges over 65. This marked the first backtrack by the Law and Justice party on its reform program. The EU has complained about Poland's disciplinary proceedings for judges, and there is tension over migration policy, with Poland opposing EU relocation plans for migrants. In 2015, Poland's election campaign focused on the EU relocation plan for migrants, causing divisions in society. The Law and Justice party criticized the plan and refused to implement it, along with Hungary and the Czech Republic. The European Commission referred the countries to the ECJ for not following the plan, but Law and Justice stated they do not intend to leave the EU. Poland's Law and Justice party has no intention of leaving the EU, as the majority of the Polish public sees EU membership as beneficial. The country's economy has been successful, with strong growth and stability due to pro-market policies and stable institutions. Despite being hit by the 2008 global financial crisis, Poland fared better than most EU members and was the only European economy to sustain growth during that time. Poland, although an EU member since 2004, still uses the z\u00c5\u0082oty as its national currency and avoided a domestic banking crisis. Poland's economy remains strong with high growth rates and low unemployment. The country is bound to adopt the euro eventually but has no fixed target date. Economic growth has been driven by private consumption, EU funding, and exports, with nearly 80% of exports going to other EU countries. Forecasts project continued growth in the coming years. The Law and Justice-led government in Poland has implemented fiscal policies to benefit lower-income households and families, including the \"Family 500+\" program offering a monthly subsidy for children. They also reversed the retirement age reform, returning it to 65 for men and 60 for women. The aging population in Poland, with a median age expected to rise from 38 to 51 by 2050, poses challenges for healthcare and retirement systems. Concerns about government spending on child support, pensions, and defense have been offset by strong economic growth. The budget deficit was 0.6% of GDP in 2018 and is projected to reach 2.2% in 2019, with public debt at 43.6% of GDP. Poland's security strategy focuses on deterring Russian aggression, with armed forces modernization, NATO membership, and close ties with the United States as key components. The country has the ninth-largest army in NATO with 61,200 active personnel and a total of 117,800 across all branches. Military conscription was ended in 2009, and Poland participates in EU defense initiatives and cooperates with regional partners. Poland's defense expenditures meet NATO's recommendation of 2% of GDP, with plans to increase spending to 2.5% by 2030. A \"Technical Modernization Plan\" prioritizes air defense, navy, cybersecurity, tanks, and territorial defense capabilities. Approximately $14.5 billion is allocated for weapons and equipment acquisition from 2017 to 2022, including air defense systems, helicopters, UAVs, and submarines. The defense ministry announced a revised plan with $49 billion in spending. The Polish government has revised and expanded its defense modernization plan, allocating approximately $49 billion for armed forces modernization from 2017-2026. Priorities include anti-aircraft missiles, attack helicopters, submarines, cybersecurity, and fifth-generation combat aircraft. Efforts are being made to develop Poland's defense-industrial base through local manufacturing and technology transfers. Additionally, a new territorial defense force consisting of 53,000 volunteers is being established for critical infrastructure protection and unconventional warfare. Close relations with the United States continue since the end of the Cold War. Since the end of the Cold War, Poland and the United States have maintained close relations. The United States supported Poland's NATO accession in 1999 and both countries have collaborated in global counterterrorism efforts. Poland has contributed troops to U.S.-led missions in Iraq and NATO-led missions in Afghanistan. Cultural ties between the two countries are strong, with approximately 9.6 million Americans of Polish heritage. The Law and Justice-led government has worked to strengthen ties with the Trump Administration, including discussions about a permanent U.S. military base in Poland. In February 2019, Poland and the United States co-hosted a conference on peace and security in the Middle East attended by high-level U.S. officials. President Trump's speech in Warsaw on July 6, 2017, was well received by many Polish observers and the government. Critics noted that his visit did not address Poland's domestic policies, leading to controversial judicial bills. Despite positive relations, concerns have been raised about judicial independence and the rule of law in Poland by the U.S. State Department and some Members of Congress. Some Members of Congress and U.S. officials expressed concerns about Poland's judicial and media reforms, urging the country to uphold core principles of democracy, human rights, and rule of law. Controversial Holocaust-related legislation criminalizing attributing responsibility for Nazi crimes to Poland was amended in June 2018 after international pressure. In June 2018, under international pressure, the Polish government amended a law making violations a civil offense. Polish officials object to the term \"Polish death camps,\" preferring \"Nazi concentration camp in German-occupied Poland.\" Scholars agree the term is inaccurate, but historical research shows some Poles committed atrocities against Jews. Critics fear the 2018 legislation may stifle debate and whitewash individual Poles' culpability. In November 2018, a leaked letter from U.S. Ambassador Georgette Mosbacher to Prime Minister Morawiecki raised concerns about media freedom in Poland. The Polish government considered prosecuting the TVN television station for airing footage of a Polish neo-Nazi group. After the murder of Gda\u0144sk Mayor Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz in January 2019, concerns were raised about Poland's political environment potentially motivating the perpetrator. Representative Marcy Kaptur expressed these concerns and introduced the Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz Democratic Leadership Exchange in February 2019. In February 2019, Representative Kaptur introduced the Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz Democratic Leadership Exchange Act of 2019 (H.R. 1270) to reauthorize the United States-Poland Parliamentary Exchange Program. Poland and the United States have close defense cooperation, with Poland being a focus of U.S. and NATO efforts to deter Russian aggression. Polish officials have expressed interest in permanently basing U.S. forces on their territory, with a proposal to contribute $2 billion towards establishing such a base. Negotiations between the U.S. and Poland are ongoing regarding the permanent stationing of U.S. forces in Poland as part of the missile defense for Europe. Aegis-Ashore site with radar and 24 SM-3 missiles is set to be operational in Poland in 2020. Russian officials view U.S. missile defense installations in Europe as a threat to global and regional security. The European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), launched in 2014, has increased rotational military presence in Central and Eastern Europe, improved infrastructure, and enhanced partner capacity for newer NATO members. Approximately 6,000 U.S. military personnel are involved in the Atlantic Resolve mission at any given time, with units operating in the region on a rotational nine-month deployment basis. The United States has not increased its permanent troop presence in Europe but has rotated additional forces into the region, including a third Brigade Combat Team (BCT) on a nine-month deployment. The European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) has increased rotational military presence in Central and Eastern Europe, with a third Brigade Combat Team (BCT) based largely in Poland. President Trump announced an additional 1,000 troops to be added to the rotational U.S. deployments in Poland, with plans to expand logistical infrastructure and boost special operations forces presence. At the 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, multinational battle groups were deployed to Poland and the Baltic countries to deter Russian aggression. The United States leads the battalion in Orzysz, Poland, with a squadron of aerial reconnaissance drones. NATO's enhanced forward presence is rotational, not permanent, and Poland has made significant defense purchases from the U.S. of interest to U.S. defense planners and industry. In February 2019, Polish Defense Minister prioritized procurement of fifth-generation fighter aircraft. Poland requested 32 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters from the U.S. In February 2019, Poland also planned to purchase 20 HIMARS launchers for $414 million. Additionally, Poland signed a $4.75 billion deal for Patriot air defense system in March 2018. In December 2017, the U.S. approved F-16 support services sale to Poland. The U.S. State Department approved the sale of F-16 support and sustainment services to Poland worth up to $200 million. In previous sales, Poland acquired AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM missiles, AGM-158B JASSM-ER missiles, and AGM-158A JASSMs with Mid-Life Update packages. Trade between the U.S. and Poland has significantly increased. Trade between the United States and Poland has seen significant growth over the past 15 years. In 2004, U.S. goods exports to Poland were valued at $929 million, increasing to over $5.4 billion in 2018. Imports from Poland also rose from $1.8 billion to over $8 billion during the same period. Leading U.S. exports to Poland include aircraft, machinery, electrical equipment, and vehicles, while imports from Poland consist of items like heavy machinery, chemicals, and agricultural products. In 2017, U.S. services exports to Poland were valued at $3.1 billion, with services imports at $2.25 billion. U.S. foreign direct investment in Poland in 2017 was approximately $12.6 billion, with U.S. companies like JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and Hewlett having significant investments in the country. U.S. affiliates employ nearly 200,000 people in Poland. Many U.S. companies, including JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and Hewlett Packard, have significant investments in Poland. Polish officials and citizens are disappointed that Poland is not part of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) like most EU countries, which allows for visa-free travel to the U.S. for up to 90 days. Poland's visitor visa refusal rate remains above the 3% threshold required for VWP qualification. The refusal rate for Poland's nonimmigrant visas remains above the 3% limit required for Visa Waiver Program (VWP) qualification. Efforts have been made by some Members of Congress to change the law to allow Poland to qualify for the VWP. Supporters argue that including Poland in the VWP would boost tourism revenue, enhance public diplomacy, and strengthen national security, while opponents fear an increase in visa overstays and unauthorized aliens. Including Poland in the Visa Waiver Program would boost U.S. tourism revenue, enhance public diplomacy, and strengthen national security by extending information-sharing elements to Poland. Poland's historical distrust of Russia, exacerbated by events in Ukraine, has led to a hardline approach towards Russia, making Poland one of the EU's most hawkish countries on Russia policy. Poland is a leading advocate for robust EU sanctions against Russia due to its actions in Ukraine. Kaliningrad, a strategic Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania, is heavily militarized with nuclear-capable missiles. Russia uses Kaliningrad for anti-access/area denial tactics. According to NATO officials, Russia is using Kaliningrad for an anti-access/area denial strategy by layering surface-to-air missiles to potentially block access to the Baltic states and Poland. Poland opposes the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, arguing it would allow Russia's Gazprom to monopolize the Central European gas market. Poland opposes the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, fearing Russia's dominance in European gas markets. They believe U.S. involvement and sanctions are crucial to prevent the pipeline's construction. Poland relies on coal for electricity but is working to diversify energy sources and increase pipeline interconnectivity with neighbors. Poland is expanding pipeline interconnectivity with neighbors, including the Baltic Pipe project connecting to Norwegian supplies. The country plans to end its supply contract with Gazprom in 2022 and has the ability to reverse gas flow in the Yamal pipeline. A LNG terminal near the German border is operational, and Poland signed a long-term contract for LNG from the U.S. The government advocates for a stronger EU energy policy. The Polish government is actively promoting a stronger EU energy policy to reduce dependence on Russia. Projects like the Gas Interconnection Poland-Lithuania are underway to enhance regional energy security. U.S. officials are concerned about Russian energy dominance affecting transatlantic unity on Russia-related issues. In the 116th Congress, bills like the European Energy Security and Diversification Act 2019 and the Protect European Energy Security Act aim to reduce EU energy dependence on Russia through diversification of supply and increase regional energy security. Introduced by Representative Adam Kinzinger and Senator Christopher Murphy, these bills prioritize U.S. efforts to encourage European countries to diversify energy sources and oppose the construction of Nord Stream 2. The U.S. is actively opposing the construction of Nord Stream 2 and promoting European energy security to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Poland is seen as a strong U.S. ally and security partner in Europe, with close cooperation expected in deterring Russian aggression, NATO, energy security, and economic issues. Poland looks to the U.S. for leadership on foreign policy and security matters, with discussions in Congress about a permanent U.S. military base in Poland and arms sales to the country. Members of Congress may be interested in U.S. arms sales to Poland, including the F-35 and Patriot missile systems. Poland's status with the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, European energy security, and governance issues, including controversial domestic reforms, are also of congressional interest. Monitoring political developments related to the Polish parliamentary election in October or November 2019 may be important to Members of Congress."
