The Attorney General will make lists of covered arrests available to the public on a Federal website. The Secretary will withhold 25 percent of a grant if a State is subject to withholding for the first time. The Secretary will withhold varying percentages of a grant from a State based on the number of times the State is subject to withholding under certain conditions. The Secretary will withhold grant amounts from States based on specific conditions, but during the first fiscal year, no withholding will occur. States will be notified if withholding would have been applied.
