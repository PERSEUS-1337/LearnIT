    "content": "Congress mandated the implementation of an automated entry and exit data system to track aliens' arrival and departure, with a focus on immigration control. After 9/11, border security became the top priority for the system, originally named the U.S. Visitor and. The history of the automated entry and exit data system, now known as the US-VISIT Program, is discussed along with laws affecting its implementation and documentary requirements. Efforts to implement the program and selected issues are also analyzed. The report does not cover the NSEERS and SEVIS programs, which will be integrated into the system. Tracking foreign nationals' entry and exit at U.S. ports of entry is a significant task, with over 428 million inspections conducted in FY2005. Implementing an automated entry and exit data system at U.S. ports of entry poses logistical challenges due to the unique characteristics of land borders and varying traffic volumes. Air and sea ports face similar challenges, but to a lesser extent. Land ports of entry have the heaviest traffic volume among the 280 ports in the United States. Implementing an automated entry and exit data system at U.S. ports of entry, particularly at air and sea ports, poses challenges due to concerns about disrupting traffic flow and inadequate infrastructure. Airports have delayed implementation due to potential congestion and concerns about the exit process not being fully developed. Sea ports also lack necessary infrastructure for the system. Sea ports, like other ports, lack necessary infrastructure and may not have full-time immigration or customs inspectors. Nonimmigrant arrivals at airports are recorded on Form I-94, a paper-based system later keyed into the Nonimmigrant Information System. Form I-94 is a numbered card with arrival and departure portions. The departure portion is completed by the carrier and submitted to the Department of Homeland Security within 48 hours. Congress required commercial carriers to improve this process due to its unreliability. Congress mandated that commercial carriers electronically submit passenger manifest information to DHS by January 1, 2003, to integrate with DOJ and DOS data systems at ports of entry. The I-94 Arrival/Departure Record is collected from foreign nationals at air and sea ports but rarely at land ports. Implementing an automated entry and exit data system at most ports will require infrastructure expansion, posing challenges at some ports. The Administration is in the third phase of system implementation, with the exit process currently being addressed. The exit process is operable at selected ports of entry as part of the third phase of system implementation. Five principal laws require the development of an integrated entry and exit data system, including the INS Data Management Improvement Act, Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act, USA PATRIOT Act, Border Security Act, and Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The USA PATRIOT Act, Border Security Act, and Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated the development of an automated entry and exit data system with biometric identifiers. These laws aim to create an integrated system interoperable with law enforcement and national security databases. The Attorney General was required to develop an automated entry and exit data system under IIRIRA by September 30, 1998. This system would record the entry and exit of every alien in the U.S. and identify those who overstayed their authorized period. Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the implementation of an automated entry and exit data system by October 15, 1998. The deadline was later extended to March 30, 2001, for land and sea ports of entry to avoid disruption of trade and tourism. In June of 2000, Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act to rename the automated entry and exit data system as the \"Integrated Entry and Exit Data System.\" The amendments included provisions for the development of the system using existing data, staggered deadlines for implementation at different border ports, establishment of a task force to evaluate the system, and a call for improved cooperation with foreign governments. The Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act of 2000 mandated a fully automated entry and exit control system for aliens entering the US under the Visa Waiver Program. It required machine-readable passports for VWP entrants by October 1, 2007, to strengthen documentary and reporting requirements. This system is part of the broader entry-exit system component. In late 2001 and 2002, Congress passed laws like the USA PATRIOT Act and the Border Security Act, requiring the development of an automated entry and exit data system with biometric identifiers. The USA PATRIOT Act mandated the development of a technology standard to verify the identity of visa applicants and called for the full implementation of the integrated entry and exit data system. The Border Security Act further advanced requirements set forth in IIRIRA by mandating the implementation of an integrated entry and exit data system with biometric technology and tamper-resistant documents. Key provisions included technology standards at U.S. ports of entry and consular posts, a database for arrival and departure data, integration of INS databases, and development of the system. The Border Security Act of 2004 mandated the implementation of an interoperable electronic data system for real-time access to federal law enforcement and intelligence community databases to make visa and admissibility determinations. It also required the issuance of machine-readable, tamper-resistant visas with biometric identifiers by October 26, 2004, and the installation of equipment for biometric comparison at all U.S. ports of entry. The Border Security Act of 2004 mandated the implementation of an interoperable electronic data system for real-time access to federal law enforcement and intelligence community databases to make visa and admissibility determinations. It also required the issuance of machine-readable, tamper-resistant visas with biometric identifiers by October 26, 2004. The act extended the deadline for VWP countries to issue tamper-resistant, machine-readable, biometric passports to October 26, 2005. Visa applicants under the VWP must present a passport with ICAO-compliant biometric identifiers. The deadline for Laser Visas to contain a biometric identifier matching the card holder was extended to September 30, 2002. The Border Security Act of 2004 required an interoperable data system for real-time access to law enforcement and intelligence databases. It mandated the use of biometric identifiers in visas and passports, with language-sensitive algorithms for searching names. Airline carriers had to provide electronic passenger manifests to the Attorney General. The USA PATRIOT Act, Border Security Act, and IIRIRA mandated the use of biometrics in travel documents for entering the United States. Biometric identifiers were required to match the card holder's characteristics for entry. The USA PATRIOT Act required the development of technology standards like fingerprints and facial photographs for identity verification. The Border Security Act mandated the development of a technology standard for identity verification in visa issuance and entry into the United States. It required consultation with relevant federal agencies and integration with law enforcement and intelligence databases. The standard had to be accessible to consular officers, federal inspection agents, and designated law enforcement and intelligence officers. Funding was authorized to meet the requirements set forth in IIRIRA. The Border Security Act mandated the implementation of a technology standard for biometric identifiers in visas and travel documents by October 26, 2004. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 requires all travelers to the US to possess documentation, but does not explicitly mandate biometrics in travel documents. The US-VISIT program was established to create an integrated entry and exit data system using biometric identifiers for alien arrivals and departures. It requires all travelers to the US to have a passport or other documents by January 1, 2008. The program will be implemented in phases. The US-VISIT program will be implemented in phases over several years with resources from various entities to meet requirements. Plans include four increments, with the first three being temporary systems focusing on enhancing existing capabilities at entry points. The US-VISIT program is being implemented in phases with the first phase focusing on collecting biometric data from certain aliens at air and sea ports of entry. The initial plan lacks specific information on capabilities, benefits, timelines, and costs. The US-VISIT program is being implemented in phases, with plans to establish exit pilot programs at up to 15 air or sea ports of entry. The program aims to collect biometric data from certain aliens, with expansion to additional ports announced by DHS in August 2004. DHS implemented the second increment of US-VISIT on August 31, 2004, requiring certain aliens to provide biometric identifiers at the 50 most trafficked land ports of entry. The implementation was staggered to test the system and improve biometric data collection processes. A Federal Register Notice listed the ports and implementation dates, with further enhancements announced in August 2005. DHS announced plans to test RFID technology for exit and entry control at U.S. land border locations. US-VISIT program requires biometric data collection for aliens entering or departing the U.S., including fingerprints and photographs. DHS plans to collect a digital photograph and two fingerprints from nonimmigrant aliens at designated ports of entry. This biometric data will be used for the US-VISIT program, initially entered into the Automated Biometric Fingerprint Identification System (IDENT). The US-VISIT program collects biometric data from nonimmigrant aliens at designated ports of entry, which is entered into the Automated Biometric Fingerprint Identification System (IDENT). Departure information is verified by comparing it against stored data to identify overstays. The US-VISIT program collects biometric data from nonimmigrant aliens at designated ports of entry to identify overstays and compile reports required by DMIA. The program may expand to include other groups of aliens and more ports, including land border ports of entry. Biometric identifiers are not required for U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. The US-VISIT program collects biometric data from nonimmigrant aliens at designated ports of entry to identify overstays and compile reports required by DMIA. Biometric identifiers are required for VWP participants, Canadian citizens, and nonimmigrant Mexican visa holders entering through designated air and sea ports, but not at land ports of entry along the southwest border. 18 other categories of individuals are exempt from providing biometric identifiers upon entry to or exit from the United States. An inspector retains the discretion to collect biometric information from aliens as needed. The US-VISIT program integrates alien arrival and departure data from various databases, including APIS and ADIS, to determine an alien's age and biometric requirements. The system collects biometric information to identify overstays and comply with legislative mandates. The Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS) uses information from APIS and ADIS databases to identify individuals for closer scrutiny at ports of entry. Commercial aircraft and vessels must transmit arrival and departure manifests to DHS officials, containing specified data elements. Arrival and departure manifests for commercial aircraft and vessels must be submitted electronically to DHS before arrival and within 48 hours of departure. Certain individuals are exempt from submitting manifest data, including U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, new immigrants, and those traveling directly to or from Canada. The entry-exit system also includes visitors under the Visa Waiver Program, allowing nationals from 27 countries to enter the U.S. without a visa for temporary business or pleasure. The Visa Waiver Program (VWPPA) requires carriers to electronically transmit passenger information for those arriving in the U.S. under the program. Travelers under the VWPPA are enrolled in US-VISIT as of September 30, 2004. The 9/11 Commission report in July 2004 highlighted the implementation of the US-VISIT biometric screening program for visitors with visas to the U.S. It noted that only about 12% of noncitizens crossing U.S. borders are covered, with plans to include visitors from visa waiver countries. The Commission urged the swift adoption of biometrics despite challenges with outdated technology. The 9/11 Commission recommended the replacement of antiquated computer systems with improved biometric systems for border screening, including the consolidation of various programs like NEXUS and SENTRI into the US-VISIT system. Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to implement these recommendations. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) mandated the development of an automated biometric entry and exit data system by the Secretary of DHS, with a report due to Congress by July 17, 2005. The plan needed to detail the functionality of the system, including locations with biometric systems, interoperable databases, and identified deficiencies. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated the development of an automated biometric entry and exit data system by the Secretary of DHS. The plan required details on identified deficiencies, technology used, programs to correct deficiencies, and system effectiveness. It also needed to describe improvements needed for processing individuals, interoperability with other databases, and how the US-VISIT program meets entry and exit screening goals. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated the development of an automated biometric entry and exit data system by the Secretary of DHS. The act required integration of databases and data systems processing information on aliens by December 2006, involving various agencies. The system had to be interoperable and fully implemented by the Secretary. The Border Security Act required the Secretary of DHS to fully implement an interoperable electronic data system for entry and exit data. It also mandated the establishment of policies for maintaining system accuracy, training front line personnel, and developing a plan for expedited processing of registered travelers. The Border Security Act mandated the establishment of policies and procedures for maintaining accuracy and integrity of the entry and exit data system, guidelines for data collection and removal, training for authorized personnel, and a clearinghouse for corrections. Additionally, the act required the Secretary to submit reports to Congress on implementing integrated databases and compliance with the act. The Border Security Act mandated policies for entry and exit data accuracy, training, and reports to Congress. The DHS provided status reports on compliance and progress with a registered traveler program. Concerns have been raised about US-VISIT integration with the VWP and potential exceptions. Traveler requirements for US entry are detailed in agency regulations, with the VWP linked to US-VISIT components. The VWP regulations have been merged with electronic manifest requirements for passengers arriving on commercial aircraft from foreign countries. Travelers entering the US under the VWP are enrolled in US-VISIT starting September 30, 2004. Foreign nationals in the VWP must have a machine-readable, tamper-resistant passport meeting ICAO biometric standards. VWP participants must enroll in US-VISIT due to the lack of biometrics in their passports. The VWP participants must enroll in US-VISIT due to the lack of biometrics in their passports. Concerns have been raised about the integration of biometric technology in passports and US-VISIT. The scope of \u00a7110 of IIRIRA as amended by the DMIA is narrower, focusing on recording alien arrivals and departures. The DMIA amended \u00a7110 of IIRIRA to require a system for recording alien arrivals and departures without adding new documentary requirements. The amendment does not mandate collecting new documents or data from aliens, especially those with waived document requirements under \u00a7212(d)(4)(B) of the INA. However, it does not limit the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Secretary of State to impose new documentary or data collection requirements under other laws. The DMIA amended \u00a7110 of IIRIRA to require a system for recording alien arrivals and departures without adding new documentary requirements. While it does not limit the authority of the Attorney General or the Secretary of State to impose new documentary or data collection requirements, DHS argues that the biometric requirements in the Interim Final Rule are supported by statutory authority outside the DMIA. The DMIA amended \u00a7110 of IIRIRA to require an integrated entry-exit system using biometric technology. The broad authority granted to DHS and DOS supports the use of biometric identifiers. Other cited authority includes INA \u00a7\u00a7 214, 215, and 235, with particular emphasis on the President's ability to regulate alien departure and arrival under INA \u00a7215. Executive Order 13323 delegated this authority to the Secretary of DHS, granting new regulatory power for alien entry and exit. The DMIA amended \u00a7110 of IIRIRA to require an integrated entry-exit system using biometric technology. DHS claims authority to collect additional biometric data as technology advances, raising questions about consistency with \u00a7110's mandate. Certain circumstances allow for omission of visa information, and exemptions from passport or visa requirements may be granted. The DMIA amended \u00a7110 of IIRIRA to require an integrated entry-exit system using biometric technology. Seventeen categories of individuals are exempt from providing biometrics, but determining exemptions can be complex. The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State may jointly exempt a \"class of aliens\" from biometric requirements, potentially including all aliens from certain nations. This exception could lead to a listing of persons similar to those already exempted from visa and passport requirements. Despite formal regulations, applicants for visa and passport exemptions may be processed differently due to reasons like national security concerns, emergencies, and travel delays. DHS reserves the right to request identifying information from individuals suspected of false claims. Certain aliens are still subject to special registration procedures for national security reasons. DHS has developed mitigation strategies to expedite screening processes during immigration and customs delays, causing some controversy. The Canadian government opposes implementing an automated entry and exit data system at northern ports of entry, citing concerns about loopholes for foreign nationals. Canadian citizens have exemptions from some US-VISIT program requirements, such as not needing a passport or visa for entry. They may also not be required to obtain an I-94 form for temporary business or pleasure visits to the United States. Canadian citizens may be able to omit passport and visa information from the I-94 form if they have not traveled outside the Western Hemisphere. The Canadian government collects I-94 departure records for U.S. immigration officials. Biometric requirements apply to Canadians arriving at designated ports of entry, but those on temporary visits without nonimmigrant visas are exempt. Manifests are not required for aircraft or vessels arriving directly from Canada. Canadian citizens traveling temporarily in the United States without applying for admission are exempt from US-VISIT program documentation requirements, but still subject to border inspection. Mexican nationals face different requirements, needing a visa or Mexican Border Crossing Card. The Mexican government has raised concerns about the disparate treatment of its nationals compared to Canadians. Mexican citizens can obtain a laser visa from the Department of State for short-term entry into the United States for business or tourism. The visa is valid for up to six months, allows multiple entries, and is valid for 10 years. Biometric verification is required at all ports of entry, including land borders. Travelers going beyond 25 miles inland or staying longer than 30 days must also obtain a Form I-94. Upon departure, Mexican nationals must deposit their I-94 forms at ports of entry. Mexican nationals with a laser visa traveling within 25 miles of the border for less than 30 days are temporarily exempt from US-VISIT biometric data collection. This exemption is due to their biometric data being captured at the visa issuance and facial recognition upon admission. Mexican travelers with a laser visa may be subject to US-VISIT biometric requirements if they exceed travel restrictions. US-VISIT tracks foreign nationals entering and leaving the US, but concerns exist about potential delays at ports of entry. Some believe implementing US-VISIT biometric system could cause delays at U.S. ports of entry, with concerns about infrastructure and technology. Questions arise about the system's purpose and compliance with deadlines, suggesting resources should focus on immigration enforcement instead. The exit process is not fully developed, raising doubts about the program's effectiveness. The language in the DHS mandate for an integrated entry and exit data system by December 31, 2005 may be ambiguous, with debates on whether full implementation at all ports is necessary. Issues such as pilot programs, varying technologies, and funding levels could affect the timeline. Infrastructure at U.S. ports of entry may need expansion to accommodate the automated system, potentially involving neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico. Some observers believe that additional lanes may be needed at land ports of entry in the United States to handle the influx of individuals. A \"port of exit\" is necessary to track the departure of aliens, but neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico may not have the infrastructure to create more lanes. This could result in delays for travelers. Similar concerns exist for air and sea ports of entry. Securing space and facilities at air and sea ports of entry, especially for the exit process, poses challenges. Passengers are sometimes inspected on board vessels due to limited inspection areas at sea ports. Concerns on the northern border include potential border congestion. The Canadian government may collect exit information on non-citizens for the US. Improved infrastructure is crucial for the US-VISIT program implementation. The US-VISIT program requires improved infrastructure for development, but it is uncertain if Canada will extend its infrastructure at relevant border crossings. There are concerns about the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's resources to track nonimmigrants who overstay their visas. Enforcement of immigration law within the country has been lacking resources, with the INS having few agents before 9/11. Commissioner James Ziglar testified that the INS reassigned investigators to terrorism investigations after 9/11. The merger of INS and Customs into ICE increased the number of agents to over 5,500, but concerns remain about enforcing immigration laws adequately. Customs also needs to continue its missions to stem illicit drug flow. The US-VISIT Program's Increment I Privacy Impact Assessment was released to the public on December 18, 2003, emphasizing the importance of protecting individuals' privacy rights. Critics argue that resources should focus on interior enforcement and integrating existing immigration databases rather than developing a new entry and exit system. The Administration maintains it is using existing databases during the initial phase. The Administration introduced biometrics in the US-VISIT Program, using existing databases initially. Critics question if new technology is being used. A privacy impact assessment was published before implementation, stating that biometric data collected from foreign nationals discloses limited personal information and poses no significant privacy concerns. Facial photographs and fingerprints reveal minimal additional information. The USA PATRIOT Act mandated the integration of IDENT and the FBI's IAFIS for automated entry and exit data systems. The former INS was criticized for outdated databases and lack of integration. The Administration currently utilizes the IDENT system. The Administration is currently using the IDENT system to capture two flat fingerprints instead of 10 fingerprints, which may not be sufficient for returning a match from the FBI's system. Real-time information processing is critical for border security to prevent backlogs, especially at sea ports of entry for foreign nationals seeking entry into the US. Immigration inspectors at sea ports of entry use the Portable Automated Lookout System (PALS) to access lookout information on individuals deemed inadmissible to the United States. Passenger manifests for sea vessels must be submitted in advance, allowing inspectors to query real-time databases. The effectiveness of US-VISIT program depends on the quality and accuracy of integrated watchlists with immigration databases. The US-VISIT program integrates various watchlists with immigration databases, including the IDENT database for storing biometrics of foreign national travelers. Some argue against storing biometrics of admissible foreign nationals in IDENT, as it may confuse inspectors. The transfer of immigration and customs functions to DHS has raised concerns about the integration of these databases. Prior to the transfer of immigration and customs functions to DHS, agencies cross-trained inspectors for primary inspections. More experienced inspectors from designated agencies handled secondary inspections. Concerns have been raised about the discretion and training required for immigration inspectors due to the complexity of immigration law. Inspectors at U.S. ports of entry must quickly decide whether to exclude or detain undocumented individuals. Some have questioned the training provided to non-immigration inspectors at U.S. ports of entry, especially with the implementation of the \"one face at the border\" initiative. The US-VISIT program adds another layer of technology for inspectors to master, with some concerns about familiarity with immigration databases. Programs like NEXUS, SENTRI, and FAST are seen as essential for facilitating the passage of low-risk travelers and commerce. The number of travelers using automated inspections has increased in recent years, reaching 2.6 million in FY2002. The number of travelers using automated inspections has risen to 2.6 million in FY2002. Questions remain about how these programs will be integrated into US-VISIT and how participants will be vetted. Concerns exist about the feasibility and financial burden of implementing US-VISIT. Proponents cite success stories as evidence of the program's effectiveness. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) supports the requirement for foreign nationals to provide biometric identifiers for admission to the United States, citing various provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act. President Bush signed an Executive Order related to this on January 2, 2004. President Bush signed an Executive Order on January 2, 2004, delegating authority to the Secretary of DHS to regulate the departure of aliens. The Secretary, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, can now require certain aliens to provide biometric identifiers upon arrival or departure from specific U.S. air and sea ports. This rule initially applies to nonimmigrant visa-holders. The Interim Final Rule amends regulations to include biometric requirements for nonimmigrant visa-holders at designated air and sea ports. Failure to comply may result in inadmissibility under INA 212(a)(7). Certain categories of travelers are excluded, and all nonimmigrant aliens will be issued Form I-94. The amended regulations now require all nonimmigrant aliens to be issued Form I-94 upon entry, regardless of the port of entry. Compliance with entry-exit examination process is necessary for admission, and failure to provide biometrics upon departure may result in a violation of immigration status. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to establish pilot programs at designated air or sea ports of entry. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to establish pilot programs at designated air or sea ports of entry, requiring aliens departing from the US to provide fingerprints, photographs, or other biometric identifiers. DHS extended the departure capability of US-VISIT to 15 air and seaports through a regulation published on August 3, 2004."
