    "content": "Medicare is a federal insurance program that covers health care services for individuals aged 65 and older and certain disabled persons. It serves approximately one in six Americans and is expected to cover about 61 million persons in 2019 at a cost of $798 billion. The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and consists of four parts\u2014Parts A through D, covering hospital services, medical services, supplies, and more. Medicare consists of four parts - A through D, providing a range of medical services and supplies. Part A is funded through payroll taxes and beneficiaries do not pay premiums for it. Part B is voluntary, with about 91% of beneficiaries enrolled. Part C offers private plan options for those enrolled in both Part A and Part B, while Part D provides optional prescription drug coverage. In 2019, total Part A expenditures are expected to reach $328 billion, representing 41% of program costs. Parts B and D are funded through the SMI Trust Fund, financed by general revenues and enrollee premiums. Part B and D expenditures are expected to reach $367 billion and $104 billion, respectively. Part B beneficiary premiums are set at 25% of average expected per capita Part B costs. Premiums for Medicare Part B are set annually at 25% of average expected per capita costs. Higher-income enrollees pay higher premiums, while low-income individuals may qualify for assistance through Medicare Savings Programs. Part B premiums are deducted from Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits. The standard monthly premium in 2019 is $135.50, with a hold-harmless provision protecting some enrollees from premium increases. Medicare Part B premiums are capped to prevent them from increasing more than the annual rise in Social Security benefits. Beneficiaries pay premiums under $135.50 and may also have out-of-pocket costs like a $185 deductible and 20% coinsurance. The report covers eligibility, enrollment, penalties, premium collection, high-income enrollee premiums, low-income assistance, and protections for Social Security recipients. It also discusses historical premium trends and various premium-related issues. An individual who has worked in covered employment for 40 quarters is entitled to receive premium-free Medicare Part A benefits at age 65. Those with fewer quarters can enroll by paying a premium. All Part A beneficiaries can also enroll in Part B. Individuals who have resided in the United States continuously for five years are automatically enrolled in Medicare when they turn 65, especially if they are receiving Social Security or RRB benefits. They will receive a Medicare card and a \"Welcome to Medicare\" package before their 65th birthday. Those who choose Medicare Part A are also enrolled in Part B, but they can opt out of Part B coverage. Disabled individuals receiving cash payments for 24 months under Social Security or RRB disability programs are also automatically enrolled in Medicare Part B unless they decline. Those opting for Medicare Advantage (Part C) must enroll in Part B. Beneficiaries not receiving Social Security or RRB benefits must apply for Medicare benefits through SSA or RRB. There are specific enrollment periods for Medicare, including an initial enrollment period and an annual general enrollment period for those who missed signing up initially. Beneficiaries can drop and reenroll in Part B multiple times, but may face premium penalties. The initial enrollment period is seven months long, starting three months before turning 65. During the initial enrollment period for Medicare, individuals must apply for benefits before turning 65 to avoid late-enrollment penalties. Coverage can start as early as the month of their 65th birthday if enrolled in the first three months, or delayed by up to three months if enrolled in the last four months. Those eligible based on disability or kidney failure have enrollment linked to the onset of their condition. If one does not sign up for Medicare during the initial enrollment period, they must wait until the next general enrollment period. Late-enrollment penalties may apply for those who decline or terminate Part B coverage. The general enrollment period lasts from January 1 to March 31, with coverage starting on July 1. Monthly premiums for Part B may increase by 10% for each 12-month period of delayed enrollment. Some individuals may be exempt from penalties if they meet specific conditions for a special enrollment period. In 2018, about 1.4% of Part B enrollees paid a penalty for late enrollment, with their total premiums being 28% higher. Those receiving premium assistance through a Medicare Savings Program are exempt from the penalty. Disabled individuals under 65 subject to a penalty qualify for a new enrollment period at age 65 without penalty. The penalty provision was included in the original Medicare legislation to prevent adverse selection. Adverse selection in Medicare Part B can drive up costs and premiums, leading healthier individuals to drop out. Most eligible persons over 65 are enrolled, helping to keep per capita costs lower. Those living in areas without Medicare coverage may still face late-enrollment penalties if they do not sign up for Part B when eligible. If an individual stops paying Part B premiums while living overseas for a three-year period and reenrolls upon returning to the US, they would not be entitled to a Special Enrollment Period (SEP). Late-enrollment penalties may apply based on the lapse in coverage. Part B does not have a \"creditable\" coverage exemption like Part D. Having equivalent coverage does not guarantee a SEP for enrolling in Part B later. Retiree coverage similar to Part B may result in late-enrollment penalties if not enrolled initially. Late-enrollment penalty is 10%. The late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B is a 10% premium surcharge for each full 12 months of delay in enrollment. Individuals who do not enroll within a year of their initial enrollment period may be subject to this penalty. If an individual delays enrolling in Medicare Part B beyond the initial enrollment period, they may face a penalty. The penalty is a 10% premium surcharge for each full 12 months of delay. The penalty can increase to 20% if enrollment is delayed until the general enrollment period in the following year. The late-enrollment surcharge is added to the monthly premium amount, and the hold-harmless provision does not protect against penalty increases. Penalties for late enrollment in Medicare Part B are based on the 2019 premium of $135.50 per month. A 20% penalty would result in a total monthly premium of $216.70, including an income-related adjustment. The penalty continues for the entire enrollment period in Part B, with no upper limit on the surcharge amount. Each year, the surcharge for late enrollment in Medicare Part B is calculated based on the standard premium amount. Beneficiaries may be exempt from the penalty under certain conditions, such as having group coverage or delaying enrollment due to incorrect information. Working individuals and their spouses with group coverage can delay enrollment without facing the penalty. In 2018, 2.0 million of the 3.8 million working aged population were enrolled in Medicare Part A only, with most of the rest enrolled in both Parts A and B. Delayed enrollment is permitted for certain disabled persons with group health insurance coverage from a large employer. Medicare Secondary Payer rules require employers with 20 or more employees to offer the same group health insurance coverage to workers aged 65 and over. The worker can accept or reject the employer's coverage, with the employer plan being primary for workers/spouses aged 65 or over. Medicare becomes the secondary payer, filling in gaps in the employer plan. A group health plan from an employer with 100+ employees is the primary payer for employees under 65 or their dependents entitled to Medicare due to disability. Medicare Part B can be signed up for while still working with group health plan coverage, or during the eight-month period after retirement or ending of group health plan coverage. Individuals who retire or lose group health plan coverage must enroll in Medicare Part B within eight months to avoid penalties. Disabled individuals with involuntarily terminated group plans have six months to enroll penalty-free. Failure to enroll during this special period may result in delayed enrollment and penalties. Returning to work may allow individuals to drop Part B coverage and qualify for a new special enrollment period. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows certain individuals who volunteered outside the US for at least 12 months to delay enrolling in Medicare Part B without penalty. They must show proof of health insurance coverage during their service. These individuals have a six-month special enrollment period starting when they no longer qualify under this provision. Under certain circumstances, a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) may be created or late-enrollment penalties waived for Medicare beneficiaries who can prove that federal worker errors led to late Part B enrollment. Documentary evidence of the error is required, and time-limited relief may be granted for specific situations like weather emergencies or disasters. CMS is providing equitable relief to individuals with exchange coverage who enrolled in Medicare Part A but did not receive adequate information about Part B enrollment. This relief is available until September 2019. CMS advises those with exchange coverage who become eligible for Medicare to enroll in Medicare during their initial enrollment period to end tax credits and cost-sharing reductions from the exchange plan. CMS is offering time-limited equitable relief through September 30, 2019, for individuals enrolled in both premium-free Medicare Part A and an exchange plan. Those eligible can enroll in Part B without penalty if their initial enrollment period began on or after April 1, 2013. Individuals who signed up for Part B outside of their initial enrollment period may have their coverage reduced or eliminated. To request relief, they must contact the Social Security Administration with proof of enrollment in an exchange plan and Medicare eligibility. Part B premiums are deducted from Social Security, Railroad Retirement, or Federal Civil Service Retirement benefits. Premiums are not deducted for beneficiaries receiving state public assistance through a Medicare Savings Program. Medicare Part B enrollees whose premiums are not deducted from Social Security, Railroad Retirement, or Civil Service Retirement benefits must pay premiums directly to CMS. In 2018, about 68% of Medicare Part B enrollees had their premiums deducted from their Social Security benefit checks. Security beneficiaries exempt from paying Medicare Part B premiums include those under 65, receiving Medicaid assistance, on SSDI for less than 24 months, or choosing not to enroll. Social Security benefits are protected from Part B premium increases, except for higher-income individuals. Some Medicare Part B enrollees do not receive Social Security benefits, such as those who deferred signing up or worked in non-covered employment. Part B premiums are deducted from RRB or CSRS benefit payments, with CSRS benefits not protected by the hold-harmless provision. Medicare Part B premiums are not held harmless from annual increases for CSRS beneficiaries. Premiums can be paid by the enrollee, a relative, friend, organization, or anyone else. Group billing arrangements can be made with CMS for organizations to pay Part B premiums for multiple beneficiaries. If a beneficiary's Social Security benefit is insufficient to cover the premium, Medicare may bill the beneficiary for the balance. Nonpayment of premiums results in consequences. The Part B premium is set annually to cover 25% of expected Part B expenditures for beneficiaries aged 65 and older. Contingency margin adjustments are made to accommodate potential variations in actual expenditures. The premium is a fixed national amount and may be adjusted for late enrollment. Monthly Part B premiums are adjusted based on estimated expenses and potential legislative changes. Premiums may increase for late enrollment or high-income beneficiaries, and decrease for those protected by the hold-harmless provision. CMS considers past cost variations and future legislation impact when setting premiums. Part B premiums are set based on expected program costs for aged beneficiaries, with standard premiums being one-half of the actuarial rate. Costs not covered by premiums are funded through transfers from the General Fund. A $3.00 per month surcharge was added in 2016. In 2016, a $3.00 per month surcharge was added to Medicare Part B premiums, with higher amounts for high-income individuals. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 required premiums to be set as if the hold-harmless rule were not in effect to offset lost premium revenue. Additional transfers from the General Fund were allowed to ensure adequate income for Part B benefits. The $3.00 surcharge added to Medicare Part B premiums in 2016 will continue until federal costs are fully offset, with higher surcharges for high-income individuals. The surcharge is estimated to be applied through 2021. CMS estimated the 2019 monthly premium to be $263.47 to cover half of total benefit and administration costs for the aged. The 2019 Part B standard premium for the aged is $135.50, including a contingency adjustment and a repayment surcharge. The contingency margin accounts for variations in projected and actual costs. In 2018, Medicare Part B financing fell short of the 17% contingency reserve ratio goal. However, CMS actuaries estimate that 2019 premium rates will increase asset levels in the Part B account to appropriate levels by the end of 2019. The 2019 premium rates were adjusted to ensure that aggregate premiums cover 25% of Part B costs, with 3.5% of enrollees paying reduced premiums. The 2019 Medicare Part B premium rates were adjusted to maintain coverage of 25% of costs, with a contingency margin adjustment of $3.74. High-income enrollees began paying higher premiums in 2007 under the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 required high-income enrollees to pay higher premiums starting in 2007. In 2018, about 3.6 million Medicare Part B enrollees paid these higher premiums. Adjustments, known as income-related monthly adjustment amounts (IRMAA), are made to the standard Part B premiums for high-income beneficiaries, with the share of expenditures paid by beneficiaries increasing with income. In 2019, individuals with incomes exceeding $85,000 and couples with combined incomes exceeding $170,000 are subject to higher premium amounts. The hold-harmless provision does not apply to those subject to an income-related increase in their Part B premiums. Social Security uses the most recent federal tax return to determine high-income premium recipients for Medicare Part B. The income definition for high-income premiums is modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), which includes AGI plus certain income and tax-exempt amounts. The Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) for high-income premium recipients of Medicare Part B includes AGI plus certain income and tax-exempt amounts. A one-time increase in taxable income, like from the sale of property, is considered in determining income for the following year. Major life-changing events can also impact MAGI, allowing for a more recent year to be used for premium calculations. Major life-changing events can impact Medicare enrollees' IRMAA decisions. Enrollees can appeal decisions by filing a \"Request for Reconsideration\" or contacting their local Social Security office. Income levels play a role in the appeal process. In 2019, Medicare beneficiaries are classified into income categories affecting premium payments. Those with incomes over $85,000 pay higher percentages of Part B costs, with adjustments ranging from 35% to 85%. High-income individuals also pay surcharges to offset federal spending. In 2019, Medicare beneficiaries with incomes over $85,000 pay higher Part B premiums, with surcharges ranging from $54.10 to $325.00 for high-income levels. Married couples filing separately face different premium amounts. Adjustments to income thresholds were previously based on CPI-U changes. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act froze income thresholds for Medicare enrollees at 2010 levels through 2019, causing more enrollees to pay high-income premiums. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 changed income thresholds for top two categories, affecting individuals with incomes between $133,500 and $160,000 per year. The income threshold for the highest category was changed to $160,000 in 2019, with a new top threshold category added for individuals with annual income of $500,000 or more. Premiums for high-income enrollees now cover 85% of the average per capita cost of Parts B and D benefits. The income threshold for Medicare beneficiaries has been adjusted, with a new top income tier set at $500,000 or more. Premiums for high-income enrollees now cover 85% of the average cost of Parts B and D benefits. Medicare beneficiaries with limited incomes may qualify for assistance with premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, with about one in five receiving Part B premium subsidies. Full dual-eligibles have most of their healthcare expenses covered by Medicare or Medicaid, with Medicaid supplementing Medicare for services not covered under Medicare. Medicare beneficiaries with limited incomes may qualify for assistance with premiums and out-of-pocket expenses through Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs). These programs provide assistance with Part B premiums based on income levels, with the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program available for aged or disabled individuals with incomes at or below the federal poverty level. Each state has different rules for Medicaid eligibility, which can also help cover costs not included in Medicare. In 2019, the QMB program offers assistance to individuals and couples with qualifying incomes. QMBs have their Medicare Part A and B cost-sharing charges covered by Medicaid. SLMBs with incomes between 100% and 120% of the Federal Poverty Level may also qualify for assistance with Part B premiums. In 2019, the QI program provides assistance to individuals and couples with incomes between 120% and 135% of the Federal Poverty Level. QIs have their monthly Medicare Part B premiums covered by Medicaid, with funding from the federal government up to the state's allocation level. Any additional expenditures beyond the state's allocation level are voluntary and paid entirely by the state. Funding for the QI program was established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The QI program, established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, provides assistance to individuals and couples with incomes between 120% and 135% of the Federal Poverty Level. MACRA permanently extended the program. Social Security benefits are adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index-Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. If the CPI-W decreases, benefits stay the same. When the annual Social Security COLA is not enough to cover Medicare Part B premium increases, most beneficiaries are protected by a hold. The hold-harmless provision in the Social Security Act protects Medicare beneficiaries from a decrease in their Social Security checks due to an increase in the standard Part B premium. This provision ensures that the amount of the individual's Social Security check does not decline by reducing the Part B premium if necessary. The determination is made by the Social Security Administration based on the comparison of net dollar amounts of benefit payments. The hold-harmless provision in the Social Security Act protects Medicare beneficiaries by reducing the Part B premium if their net Social Security benefit for January is lower than in December of the previous year. This provision primarily affects those with low Social Security payments and has minimal impact on Part B financing, but in years with no or very low Social Security COLA, it can protect a larger number of beneficiaries. Not all beneficiaries are protected by the hold-harmless provision and may face higher premiums. Higher-income beneficiaries paying income-related Part B premiums are excluded from protection. Lower-income beneficiaries receiving Medicaid assistance are also not held harmless. Medicaid pays for any increase in their premiums. The Medicaid program pays the full amount of any increase in Part B premiums for low-income beneficiaries who do not receive Social Security, including those who have deferred signing up, disabled beneficiaries whose SSDI benefits have been discontinued, and those who receive benefits exclusively through a different retirement plan. This group includes federal retirees under the Civil Service Retirement System and certain state and local government workers with their own pension programs. Some individuals, such as law enforcement personnel and firefighters, may not have Medicare premiums deducted from their Social Security checks at certain times. This can include those who enroll in Social Security or Medicare during a specific year, as well as individuals who had Medicare premiums paid for them one year but lost that coverage the next year. While the hold-harmless provision may protect some people from a decrease in their Social Security checks, an increase in Medicare Part D premiums could still impact them. Additionally, those who pay the late-enrollment penalty are not fully protected. The hold-harmless provision may not fully protect those who pay the late-enrollment penalty from surcharges calculated as a percentage of premiums. The number of people held harmless can vary yearly based on inflation rates and projected Part B costs. Low inflation has led to no COLA adjustments for Social Security. In 2010 and 2011, due to low inflation, no COLA adjustments were made to Social Security benefits. Most Medicare beneficiaries were protected by the hold-harmless provision and paid the 2009 standard monthly premium. However, those not held harmless had higher premiums of $110.50 in 2010 and $115.40 in 2011. About 27% of beneficiaries were not held harmless, including new enrollees, high-income individuals, Medicaid recipients, and those not having premiums withheld from Social Security. In 2016, about 70% of Medicare Part B enrollees were protected by the hold-harmless provision and continued to pay the 2015 monthly premium amount despite an increase in premiums. In 2016, 70% of Medicare Part B enrollees paid the 2015 monthly premium amount of $104.90. Those not held harmless included those eligible for premium assistance through Medicaid, high-income earners, non-Social Security beneficiaries, and new enrollees. Legislation mitigated large premium increases for the remaining 30% and added a $3.00 monthly surcharge until costs are offset. In 2017, due to a small Social Security COLA increase, about 70% of Medicare Part B enrollees were held harmless and paid an average of $109.00 per month for their premiums. The remaining 30% faced premium increases, including a $3.00 surcharge, to offset costs. In 2017, Medicare Part B enrollees who were held harmless in 2016 may have qualified for the same benefit in 2017, with premiums set at $121.80 plus the increase in their Social Security benefit. The remaining 30% of enrollees faced potential premiums as high as $149 per month, but the Secretary mitigated this by setting a lower contingency reserve ratio, resulting in lower premiums than projected. In 2018, Medicare Part B premiums remained at $134.00 per month with a 2.0% Social Security COLA. Many enrollees who were held harmless in 2017 saw an increase in their Social Security benefits, covering the difference in premiums. Those held harmless in 2017 returned to paying standard premiums in 2018, including the $3.00 BBA 15 surcharge. In 2018, about 72% of Medicare Part B enrollees were not held harmless, leading to an increase in premiums to $134.00 per month. 42% of enrollees who were held harmless in 2017 no longer qualified for reduced premiums in 2018. The remaining 30% included those who do not normally qualify for reduced premiums. About 28% of Medicare Part B enrollees did not receive a large enough increase in their Social Security COLAs to cover the full amount of the Part B premium in 2018. Their premiums could have increased from the premium amount they paid in 2017, plus the dollar amount of the increase in their monthly 2018 Social Security benefit. For example, if someone had a $600.00 monthly Social Security benefit in 2017, the 2.0% 2018 COLA would have provided an increase of about $12.00. If their Medicare premium was $109.00 per month in 2017, the $12.00 increase would not have been enough to cover the full $134.00 per month premium in 2018. In 2019, only about 3.5% of Medicare beneficiaries are being held harmless and pay premiums lower than the standard monthly Part B premium of $135.50. The Part B premium has increased from $3.00 in 1966 to $135.50 in 2019, reflecting the growth in total Part B expenditures. Costs per beneficiary have increased significantly over the years, from about $101.00 in 1970 to a projected $6,391 per beneficiary in 2019. The Part B premium has seen fluctuations, with decreases in 1989 and 1995 due to legislative changes. In 2010 and 2011, most beneficiaries were held harmless and paid the 2009 premium of $96.40 per month. Since 2000, the standard Medicare Part B premium has nearly tripled, from $45.50 to $135.50 in 2019, due to factors like rising healthcare costs and increased technology utilization. The Medicare trustees project a 2020 premium increase to around $141.10 per month, with faster benefit spending growth expected in the next five years. The Medicare trustees project a steady increase in premiums, with estimates of $141.10 per month in 2020 and $202.70 in 2027 for Medicare Part B. This rise in premiums could significantly impact Social Security beneficiaries, especially those who heavily rely on it for income. Social Security beneficiaries may face a decline in their standard of living as Medicare premiums rise, impacting those who heavily rely on Social Security for income. Medicare premiums are expected to represent a growing proportion of beneficiaries' Social Security income due to the increasing cost of medical care and a shift towards outpatient settings. This could result in a significant impact on beneficiaries' finances over time. Since 2000, Social Security's annual COLA has increased benefits by about 50%, much less than the nearly 200% growth in Part B premiums. The Medicare trustees predict that Part B and Part D premiums could make up 12% of the average Social Security benefit in 2018, rising to 17% by 2092. The hold-harmless provision shields against Part B premium hikes but not Part D premiums or late-enrollment penalties, potentially leading to benefit reductions even in years with low or no Social Security COLA increases. Medicare Part B financing under the hold-harmless provision can lead to significant premium increases for those not protected, creating equity issues. Without legislative changes, these individuals may face higher premiums to cover Part B costs. The current approach, as noted by the Medicare trustees, is the only option under existing law, despite concerns about fairness. In years with low or no Social Security COLA and Medicare premium hikes, the financial impact on those not protected by the hold-harmless provision is a growing concern. Some concerns have been raised about the financial impact of premium increases on individuals not protected by the hold-harmless provision for Medicare Part B. Suggestions include changes to the provision to prevent disproportionate premium hikes for certain groups, such as linking Social Security COLA to a measure of inflation based on elderly purchasing patterns. The concern is that more Medicare-eligible individuals may face late-enrollment penalties due to confusion about enrollment rules, particularly regarding Part B decisions. The Medicare Rights Center has reported an increase in calls related to transitioning to Medicare. Some proposals suggest modifying Medicare Part B penalty provisions to limit the surcharge amount and duration, similar to Part A enrollment rules. There is also a suggestion for a creditable-coverage exemption for Part B, allowing beneficiaries with equivalent coverage to postpone enrollment without penalty. Under the Part D prescription drug benefit, individuals can avoid a late-enrollment penalty by maintaining creditable prescription drug coverage. This includes employer-based coverage, State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs, and military-related coverage. Suggestions for improvement include educating employers about Medicare coverage, enhancing education on Medicare and late-enrollment penalties for those nearing eligibility age, and expanding equitable relief to address misinformation from entities beyond the federal government. In recent Congresses, bills have been introduced to address issues with the Part B late-enrollment penalty. For example, H.R. 1788 in the 116th Congress would limit the penalty to 15% and exclude certain coverage periods when determining the penalty. H.R. 2575 and S. 1909 in the 115th Congress aimed to improve Medicare enrollment by providing advance notification, creating a centralized enrollment webpage, restructuring enrollment periods, and expanding eligibility for special enrollment periods. In the 115th and 112th Congress, bills were introduced to establish special enrollment periods for obtaining marketplace and Medicare coverage, including a special Medicare Part B enrollment period for individuals with COBRA continuation coverage. H.R. 707 aimed to eliminate late-enrollment penalties for individuals aged 65-70. H.R. 1654 and H.R. 2235 proposed changes to Medicare enrollment, including special enrollment periods and limits on late enrollment penalties. These bills aimed to expand eligibility for equitable relief and reduce penalties for late enrollment in Part B. Additionally, they sought to exclude periods of COBRA and retiree coverage from the penalty. Many proposals to reduce federal deficits include suggestions to reduce Medicare program spending and increase program income. Some proposals aim to increase Medicare premiums for high-income beneficiaries, with the President's FY2017 budget suggesting raising the percentage of expenditures paid by high-income enrollees. Other proposals suggest increasing premiums for all Part B enrollees. Some proposals suggest raising the standard Part B premium from 25% to 35% over five years. About 34% of Medicare beneficiaries have Medigap policies that cover some or all of Medicare's cost sharing. Medigap plans have varying levels of coverage, with two plans offering first-dollar coverage for Parts A and B deductibles and coinsurance. Section 401 of MACRA prohibits the sale of Medigap policies covering Part B deductibles to new Medicare beneficiaries from 2020. Proposals include imposing a Part B premium surcharge for certain Medigap plans and placing limits on federal subsidies for Medicare, with premiums varying based on the Medicare plan chosen. Proposals to limit federal subsidies for Medicare would change the program to a defined-contribution system, potentially increasing beneficiary premiums if costs exceed the subsidy limit. Issues to consider include the impact on beneficiaries' ability to afford higher costs and the willingness of high-income individuals to remain in Medicare Part B. The Part B premium amount in Medicare has changed over time, initially covering 50% of program costs. Legislation in 1972 tied premium increases to Social Security benefit adjustments. The current concerns include high-income beneficiaries' willingness to pay higher premiums and Medicaid's ability to assist low-income beneficiaries with premium increases. The Part B premium in Medicare initially covered 50% of program costs, but dropped to below 25% due to cost-of-living adjustments. Congress overrode the COLA limitation by setting premiums at 25% of costs, with general revenues covering the rest. Premiums increased in 1989 due to the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, but fell in 1990 after its repeal. Congress returned to the 25% coverage approach in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90) set specific dollar figures for Medicare Part B premiums for the years 1991-1995, aiming for premiums to cover 25% of program costs. However, due to slower program cost growth, the 1995 premium of $46.10 actually represented 31.5% of costs. OBRA 93 extended the policy for 1996-1998, using a percentage rather than fixed dollar figures, resulting in lower premiums of $42.50 in 1996 and $43.80 in 1997. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 set the Medicare Part B premium at 25% of program costs, leading to lower premiums in 1997 compared to 1995. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 required higher-income beneficiaries to pay higher Part B premiums starting in 2007. The income thresholds for high-income premiums were frozen from 2011 to 2019 by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 maintained frozen income thresholds for high-income premiums until 2017 and lowered thresholds for the highest income tiers starting in 2018. In 2020, income thresholds for all categories will be adjusted annually for inflation to maintain the proportion of beneficiaries paying high-income premiums. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 15; P.L. 114-74) mitigated a sharp increase in Medicare Part B premiums in 2016 by spreading increased costs across all beneficiaries, instead of only those not protected by the hold-harmless provision. The standard premium was calculated as if the hold-harmless rule was not in effect, preventing a significant premium hike. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 15; P.L. 114-74) prevented a sharp increase in Medicare Part B premiums in 2016 by spreading costs across all beneficiaries. Part B enrollees not held harmless paid a standard monthly premium of $121.80 in 2016, with a $3.00 surcharge added to offset increased costs. The surcharge will continue until the additional federal cost of about $9 billion is fully offset. Premium adjustments in 2017 were based on Social Security COLA, and a provision in BBA 18 added an additional high-income surcharge. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 introduced a new high-income category for Medicare Part B premiums, affecting individuals with incomes over $500,000 or couples over $750,000. Premiums for this category cover 85% of the average cost instead of 80%, with a surcharge of $10.20. The top income threshold will be frozen until 2027 and adjusted for inflation from 2028 onwards. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 made changes to 2016 Part B premiums, projecting an increase to $121 per month from $104.90. However, due to the absence of a Social Security COLA in 2016, most Part B enrollees continued to pay $104.90. This resulted in only 70% of enrollees paying the lower amount, causing the remaining 30% to bear the entire cost increase. The Medicare trustees estimated that premiums for those not held harmless would need to increase to about $159 per month, while high-income beneficiaries would pay significantly higher premiums based on their income levels. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 required 2016 Medicare Part B premiums to be set as if the hold-harmless rule was not in effect, aiming to mitigate large premium increases. Enrollees paid the same standard premium, with additional transfers from the General Fund to the SMI Trust Fund to cover Part B benefits. To offset increased federal spending, a $3.00 per month surcharge was added to standard premiums in 2016, increasing annually until $9 billion is fully offset. High-income premiums saw a sliding scale surcharge up to $9.60. The surcharge on Medicare Part B premiums is expected to continue through 2021, with a sliding scale increase for high-income individuals. Those not held harmless are required to pay the monthly repayment surcharge. Appendix E explains that most individuals turning 65 are automatically eligible for Medicare Part A, but those who are not eligible can voluntarily purchase Part A coverage, usually alongside Part B. In most cases, individuals who voluntarily purchase Medicare Part A must also purchase Part B. The monthly premium for Part A is based on the full average per capita value of the benefit, with a reduced premium available for those with at least 30 quarters of covered employment. Penalties apply for delaying enrollment in Part A beyond the initial enrollment period. Under Part A, individuals who delay enrollment for at least 12 months beyond their initial enrollment period are subject to a 10% premium surcharge for a period equal to twice the number of years of delay. This is different from Part B, where a permanent 30% penalty applies for the same delay period."
