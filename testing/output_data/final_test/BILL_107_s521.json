The Congress finds that billions of dollars are spent annually on transportation needs, with road congestion costing over $74 billion in lost work time and fuel consumption. On-road vehicles contribute 30% of nitrogen oxides emissions, and teleworking could eliminate 1,800,000 tons of pollutants, save 3,500,000,000 gallons of gas, and free up 3,100,000,000 hours of personal time. The potential benefits of teleworking include reduced congestion, decreased maintenance costs, and increased employee productivity. The average American daily commute is 62 minutes for a 44-mile round-trip, resulting in a decrease in parental time available for families. Companies with teleworking programs have seen a productivity boost of 5% to 20%. Today, 60% of the workforce is involved in teleworking. In recent years, teleworking has seen a significant increase in the workforce, with 60 percent now involved in information work, a 43 percent increase since 1990. Studies in the United States show a notable expansion of teleworking, with an estimated 19 million Americans teleworking by 2002, five times more than in 1990. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 30B, which provides a teleworking credit. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 30B, which allows eligible taxpayers a credit for qualified teleworking expenses paid or incurred, up to $500 per individual teleworker for a full taxable year. The credit is reduced proportionally for individuals in a teleworking arrangement for less than a full year. The new section SEC. 30B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides a tax credit for eligible taxpayers who incur qualified teleworking expenses, up to $500 per individual teleworker for a full taxable year. An eligible taxpayer is defined as an individual or employer involved in a teleworking arrangement where an employee teleworks for at least 75 days per year. The tax credit allows eligible taxpayers to claim up to $500 per individual teleworker for qualified teleworking expenses. Telework involves using electronic technologies to work remotely and reduce commuting. The credit cannot exceed the regular tax for the year minus other credits. The tax credit allows eligible taxpayers to claim up to $500 per individual teleworker for qualified teleworking expenses. The credit is subject to limitations based on the sum of allowable credits and the tentative minimum tax for the year. Excess credits can be carried forward to the following year. Special rules include reducing the basis of property by the credit amount and potential recapture by the Secretary through regulations. The Secretary can recapture the benefit of any credit for property no longer eligible. No credit for property used outside the US or if taxpayer elects not to apply. No double benefits allowed. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow expenses for determining the credit under section 30B. Additionally, a technical and clerical amendment is made to the code. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a teleworking credit under section 30B, effective for expenses incurred after the enactment date of the Act in taxable years ending after that date."
