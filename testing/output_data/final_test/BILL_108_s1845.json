    "content": "The \"Service to Country Reimbursement Act of 2003\" provides assistance to state and local governments that continue to pay employees serving on active duty in a reserve component of the uniformed services. The \"Service to Country Reimbursement Act of 2003\" amends Chapter 17 of title 37, United States Code, by adding a new section to provide assistance for State and local governments that continue to pay employees who serve on active duty in a reserve component. The purpose is to ensure that employees receive compensation equal to their civilian pay when combined with military pay. Reimbursement is offered to governments that continue to pay civilian compensation. The \"Service to Country Reimbursement Act of 2003\" amends Chapter 17 of title 37, United States Code, by providing reimbursement to State and local governments for civilian compensation paid to employees on active duty in a reserve component. Reimbursement is capped at the difference between civilian compensation and military pay for each pay period. The \"Service to Country Reimbursement Act of 2003\" provides reimbursement to State and local governments for civilian compensation paid to employees on active duty in a reserve component. Reimbursement is capped at the difference between civilian compensation and military pay for each pay period. Employees on active duty for more than 30 days, hospitalized, or convalescing from an illness or injury incurred during active duty are eligible for reimbursement. If an employee fails to return to employment, reimbursement to the government may be affected. The employee must refund the total reimbursement to the government if they fail to return to employment by the specified period. The obligation to refund is considered a debt owed to the United States, but the Secretary concerned may waive the refund if recovery would be unjust or against the best interests of the country. Refund is mandatory if the employee's failure to return to work was due to a non-fault injury or disability. A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 within five years does not discharge an employee from a debt arising from civilian compensation or military pay. The Secretaries concerned will prescribe regulations for this section. Definitions include civilian compensation, local government, and military pay. The term 'pay' is defined in section 101(21) of this title. The term 'State' includes various regions of the United States. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in title 37. Section 910 of title 37, United States Code provides assistance for State and local governments paying employees on active duty. The amendment applies to pay periods starting after the enactment of the Act."
