    "content": "The \"Predatory Lending Sunset Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends Chapter 2 of the Truth in Lending Act by adding a new section 129B on covered lending. The maximum interest rate on a covered loan is capped at 36 percent annually. Creditors are prohibited from using certain means of access for security, such as checks or vehicle titles. Definitions for terms like \"annual percentage rate\" are provided in this section. The term 'covered loan' refers to a consumer credit transaction that is unsecured and does not exceed $3,000. It includes all fees related to the loan, such as finance charges and application fees. A covered loan is a consumer credit transaction with a credit limit not exceeding $3,000 and a term of 91 days or less. For open-end credit transactions, the amortization period or the amount due in the first 91 days must not exceed 25 percent of the total. The extension of credit cannot exceed 25 percent of the credit limit and does not include non-recourse extensions of credit by pawn brokers secured by tangible goods physically delivered by the consumer. The term 'creditor' in relation to covered loans includes a person who offers or makes such loans, as well as any affiliate involved in the loan process. (b) Closing the Single Payment Loophole.--Section 903(9) of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693a(9)) is amended by striking ``to recur at substantially regular intervals''. (c) Remotely Created Checks Prohibited.--Section 905 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693c) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: ``(d) Remotely Created Checks Prohibited.--\" The new subsection prohibits the use of remotely created checks, defined as checks not created by the holding financial institution and lacking the account holder's signature. This Act does not override any State laws. The Act prohibits State laws that offer greater consumer protection, allows loans in states where they are not permitted, and prohibits credit extensions exceeding state law APR limits. Contracts violating the Act are unenforceable. Definitions of \"consumer\" and \"covered loan\" align with the Truth in Lending Act. (g) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 2 of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include new items after section 129. The amendments made by this Act regarding duty of servicers of residential mortgages and covered lending will take effect 180 days after enactment and apply to all covered loans initiated after that date."
