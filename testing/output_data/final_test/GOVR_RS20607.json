    "content": "Social Security is funded by payroll and self-employment taxes, as well as income taxation of benefits. Revenues go to the U.S. Treasury, with any surplus credited to the trust funds. The trust funds represent the authority for the Treasury to issue benefit payments when needed. The Social Security trust funds, with holdings of $2.8 trillion at the end of 2013, are invested in interest-bearing obligations guaranteed by the U.S. government. The Managing Trustee (Secretary of the Treasury) is required to invest in special nonmarketable federal public-debt obligations, with maturities tailored to the trust funds' needs. The trust funds invest in federal securities with maturities tailored to their needs. Marketable federal securities can be sold at market price, and special issue obligations can be redeemed at par plus accrued interest. The Treasury Department purchases marketable federal securities to stabilize the market for Treasury issues, which benefits the trust funds. The trust funds currently hold special issues only, with interest earned credited semiannually. In 2013, net interest totaled $102.8 billion, representing 12% of total income. The interest rate earned on special issues purchased in August 2014 is 2.375%. Revenues are invested in short-term issues called certificates of indebtedness, which mature on the next June 30. The trust funds hold special issue bonds that mature annually on June 30 and are reinvested in longer-term bonds with maturities ranging from 1 to 15 years. Critics have questioned the investment policy's impact on earnings, but it has been endorsed by advisory councils and congressional committees for its safety and stability. The goal is to ensure a safe rate of return without political influences or intrusion into private markets. The trust funds aim to provide a safe rate of return by investing in U.S. securities, without giving them an advantage or disadvantage compared to other investors or government entities. Interest income has become more important in recent years, leading to discussions about alternative investment practices such as replacing special issue bonds with marketable securities or investing in assets other than U.S. government obligations."
