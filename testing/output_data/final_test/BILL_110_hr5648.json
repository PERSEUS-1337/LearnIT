The \"Emergency Wildland Fire Response Act of 2008\" defines terms like appropriate management response and appropriate congressional committees for wildland fire response planning. The \"Emergency Wildland Fire Response Act of 2008\" defines terms such as declared emergency wildland fire incident, Fund, Secretary concerned, and wildland fire operations. These terms are crucial for understanding the act's provisions related to wildland fire response planning. The \"Federal Wildland Fire Emergency Suppression Fund\" is established to cover costs of Federal wildland fire suppression activities during declared emergency incidents. It includes amounts appropriated to the Fund and other emergency funds. The Federal Wildland Fire Emergency Suppression Fund covers costs of Federal wildland fire suppression activities during declared emergency incidents. It includes appropriated funds, transfers from other emergency funds, and interest earned. Amounts in the Fund remain available until expended. The Secretary may declare a wildland fire incident as a declared emergency if certain criteria are met. The Secretary may declare a wildland fire incident as a declared emergency if it meets specific criteria, such as size, severity, potential for extreme fire behavior, or threat to lives and property. The Secretary or a designee at the subcabinet level can declare a wildland fire incident as an emergency based on specific criteria. The Secretary can access the Fund for wildland fire operations if the budget requested for that fiscal year meets certain expenditure requirements. Secretaries concerned must report on Fund activities. The Secretaries concerned must submit joint reports every six months detailing Fund expenditures and deposits, including costs for each declared emergency wildland fire incident. Appropriations are authorized to maintain the Fund at a level equal to the average annual costs incurred over the preceding five fiscal years. The Secretaries concerned must estimate costs for declared emergency wildland fire incidents for a fiscal year before the enactment of the Emergency Wildland Fire Response Act of 2008. They should notify congressional committees when only two months of funding remains in the Fund. Transfers from non-fire program accounts to cover wildland fire expenses are limited. The Secretaries estimate costs for emergency wildland fire incidents before the enactment of the Emergency Wildland Fire Response Act of 2008. They notify congressional committees when funding is low. Excess funds for wildland fire operations can be transferred for reforestation and rehabilitation of forests. The Emergency Wildland Fire Response Act of 2008 allows funds to be used in areas with lower fire suppression costs. A stratified cost index compares actual expenses to expected costs based on fire characteristics. The Secretary must review wildfires costing over $10,000,000 and report findings to congressional committees. SEC. 3. REDUCING WILDFIRE RISKS TO PEOPLE, PROPERTY, AND WATERSHEDS IN FIRE-READY COMMUNITIES. Section 10 of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 is amended to include support for Fire-Ready Communities, defined as communities with cooperative fire agreements, local codes for fire-resistant home design, and located in priority areas for wildfire suppression and protection. The Secretary of Agriculture shall develop a national map of landscape areas at risk of wildfire and in need of fuel treatment. Priority areas for fuel reduction projects will include at-risk communities in fire-prone areas. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 prioritizes funding for fire-ready communities, watersheds, municipal drinking water sources, emergency evacuation corridors, and electricity transmission corridors. Grants are available for fire-ready communities to enhance their wildland firefighting capabilities. Grant funds can be used for education programs, training for firefighters, equipment acquisition, and community implementation to enhance wildland firefighting capabilities. The Secretary may authorize the implementation of a community wildfire protection plan or other activities. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out this section. In developing wildland fire cost-share agreements, the Secretary encourages State and local communities to become fire-ready communities. Cost-sharing responsibilities in these agreements are determined with State Foresters or equivalent officials. When entering into agreements with State Foresters, the Secretary will assess if participating communities are fire-ready or taking steps to become fire-ready communities. The Department of Agriculture partners with State Foresters to reduce hazardous fuels on National Forest System lands. The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 is amended to include Good Neighbor Partnerships, defining contracts and good neighbor projects on National Forest System land. The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 is amended to include Good Neighbor Partnerships, allowing the Secretary to enter into contracts or agreements with State Foresters to implement projects on National Forest System land that meet requirements for hazardous fuels reduction or improve watersheds and wildlife habitat. The Secretary has the discretion to proceed with good neighbor projects on National Forest System land, allowing State Foresters to serve as agents for project facilitation. Decision-making under the National Environmental Policy Act cannot be delegated to State Foresters. Project requirements for implementing good neighbor projects are outlined. The Secretary must ensure good neighbor projects align with land management plans and improve cost efficiency. Priority is given to collaborative projects developed with non-governmental entities and consistent with community wildfire protection plans. The Secretary must ensure that good neighbor projects align with land management plans and improve cost efficiency. Priority is given to collaborative projects developed with non-governmental entities and consistent with community wildfire protection plans. Contracts or agreements under this subsection are not subject to certain laws related to the National Forest Management Act of 1976. A State Forester or equivalent official may subcontract under State and local law to prepare or implement contracts or agreements under this subsection."
