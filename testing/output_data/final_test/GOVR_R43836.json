    "content": "Human-induced earthquakes, or induced seismicity, are a growing concern in the United States due to the injection of fluids from oil and gas production into deep disposal wells. This practice can lead to damaging earthquakes in regions with low seismic activity, especially with the rise of hydraulic fracturing. The use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing has increased wastewater disposal needs and the demand for disposal wells in new areas. It is crucial to differentiate between seismic activity related to hydraulic fracturing and other potential causes of earthquakes. The increase in oil and gas production in the United States has led to a rise in induced seismicity, particularly due to the disposal of wastewater using deep-well injection. This seismic activity is linked to human activities such as hydraulic fracturing and injecting fluids into subsurface formations. The use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing has further exacerbated the issue, highlighting the need to differentiate between seismic activity related to fracking and other potential causes of earthquakes. The disposal of wastewater using deep-well injection in the central United States has led to a significant increase in seismic activity since 2009. Studies suggest that the rise in earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater is likely due to oil-and-gas-related wastewater injection. However, the exact relationships between earthquake activity and injection practices are still not fully understood. Several studies have shown that only a small fraction of the more than 30,000 wastewater disposal wells classified by the EPA as Class II are associated with damaging earthquakes. However, due to the large number of disposal wells, the overall seismic hazard in the central United States has measurably increased. The potential for damaging earthquakes from fluid injection for hydraulic fracturing operations is much smaller compared to deep-well injection of wastewater from fracking and other oil and gas production. Multiple studies indicate that the majority of fluid injections into production wells are not linked to seismic activity. This report reviews the scientific understanding of induced seismicity related to Class II oil and gas wastewater disposal wells. It also discusses regulatory frameworks and initiatives at the federal and state levels to address induced seismicity events. The link between deep-well injection and seismic activity, along with efforts to mitigate this linkage, is of interest to Congress due to potential implications. The potential implications of continued development of unconventional oil and gas resources in the United States, specifically regarding deep-well injection of waste fluids, are of interest to Congress. Efforts to address and mitigate human-caused earthquakes from deep-well injection may provide guidance for carbon dioxide sequestration. The relationship between long-term, high-volume carbon dioxide injection and induced earthquakes is not yet known. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act authorizes EPA to regulate underground injection activities to prevent endangerment of drinking water sources. EPA's UIC program includes seismicity-related requirements for hazardous waste and carbon sequestration injection wells, but not for oil and gas wastewater disposal wells. In 2015, EPA released recommendations for minimizing induced seismicity from oil and gas wastewater disposal. No legislation has been introduced in Congress to address induced seismicity from oil and gas wastewater disposal. The Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals (FRAC) Act of 2015 aims to address induced seismicity from oil and gas wastewater disposal or injection activities. The legislation would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to regulate hydraulic fracturing operations under EPA authority. The potential for induced seismicity from hydraulic fracturing is smaller compared to deep-well injection of wastewater. Since the 1920s, it has been known that human activities like deep-well injection of wastewater from oil and gas production can cause earthquakes. Various activities such as reservoir filling, mining, and geothermal energy extraction can also trigger earthquakes. These activities change the stress in Earth's crust, causing faults to slip and generate shock waves. Despite understanding the mechanics, it is challenging to differentiate between natural and human-induced earthquakes. Human activities like deep-well injection of oil and gas wastewater and hydraulic fracturing have been linked to earthquakes, particularly in states like Oklahoma, Texas, and Colorado. However, most activities are considered \"aseismic\" and do not cause significant seismic activity. Scientists struggle to predict human-induced earthquakes due to limited capabilities. Scientists have limited capability to predict human-caused earthquakes due to uncertainty in stress state, fluid flow underground, poor fault knowledge, limited seismometer networks, and difficulty in predicting earthquake size. A conceptual model is evolving for understanding how deep-well injection triggers earthquakes, especially in Oklahoma. The increase in pore pressure propagates into pre-existing faults in the crystalline basement rocks, some of which are critically stressed, leading to potential earthquake initiation. Small pressure perturbations can cause large earthquakes along these faults, as seen in Oklahoma in 2011 and 2016. In central Oklahoma, an M 4.8 earthquake in 1967 was the largest recorded human-induced earthquake in the United States. It was triggered by deep-well injection of hazardous chemicals at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal defense plant. Injection rates varied, and earthquake activity continued for two decades after injection ceased. Scientists concluded that the injection caused the earthquakes. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal earthquakes, caused by deep-well injection of hazardous chemicals, continued for years and triggered earthquakes along an ancient fault system miles away. Similarities were found with recent increased earthquake activity in deep-well injection activities in the United States, indicating a link between deep-well injection and earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater. The frequency of such earthquakes has dramatically increased since 2009, suggesting a potential for human-induced earthquakes of magnitude 5.0 or greater. The frequency of human-induced earthquakes of magnitude 5.0 or greater has increased since 2009, with some potentially linked to deep-well injection activities. Most deep-well injection wells are in low-risk geologic formations, but there is concern that injecting fluids into deeper zones could trigger larger earthquakes. States have seen higher seismic activity levels compared to pre-2005 averages. Seismic activity has increased in several states since 2005, potentially linked to deep-well injection of oil and gas wastewaters. Instances of suspected human-induced earthquakes include events in Texas and Arkansas. Seismic activity increased in central Arkansas, northern New Mexico/southern Colorado, Oklahoma, and Ohio between August 2010 and September 2016. The earthquakes were potentially linked to deep-well injection of wastewater from natural gas production. A study in central Arkansas found a significant increase in M 2.5 or greater earthquakes since 2009, with 98% of earthquakes during a 2010-2011 swarm occurring near waste disposal wells. The Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission imposed a moratorium on oil and gas wastewater disposal wells in response. A study in central Arkansas found a significant increase in earthquakes near waste disposal wells. The study linked high injection rates of oilfield-related wastewater to earthquakes of M 1.5 or greater near Dallas-Fort Worth and Cleburne, Texas. All 24 earthquake epicenters were located within 1.5 miles of injection wells, suggesting a probable linkage between earthquakes and high-volume injection wells. The study hypothesized that injection might trigger earthquakes if the injected fluids reach suitably oriented areas. The study in Youngstown, Ohio, found that over 100 small earthquakes occurred between January 2011 and February 2012, with the largest being an M 3.9 event on December 31, 2011. These earthquakes were induced by fluid injection from a deep well, with seismicity decreasing when injection volumes and pressures were low. The earthquake rate in the central and eastern United States has significantly increased since 2009. The earthquake rate in central and eastern United States has increased significantly since 2009, with over 50% of earthquakes occurring in central Oklahoma. The rate of M 3.0 or greater earthquakes in Oklahoma saw steep increases in 2014 and 2015, surpassing California's rate. The earthquake rate for M 3.0 earthquakes since 2009 is nearly 300 times higher than previous decades. Studies suggest the increase in earthquake activity is not a natural fluctuation, with the region having ancient buried faults contributing to the seismic activity. The region includes ancient buried faults in the Arbuckle Formation where oil and gas wastewater is injected, potentially causing earthquakes. Oklahoma has seen a rise in M 3.0+ earthquakes, with record-breaking events in 2011 and 2016. South-central Kansas also experienced earthquakes near wastewater injection wells in 2013 and 2014. In south-central Kansas, earthquakes occurred in 2013 and 2014 near wastewater injection wells. The governor convened a task force on induced seismicity in 2014, resulting in an action plan to address earthquakes possibly induced by deep well injection. The Kansas Corporation Commission later required operators to reduce injection rates in certain areas. The United States excluded human-induced earthquakes from building codes due to uncertainty in assessing their seismic hazard. Natural seismicity is assumed to be time-independent, while induced seismicity varies with factors like injection rate and location. Combining natural and induced seismic hazards on one map is challenging. The USGS released a one-year seismic hazard forecast for 2016, including contributions from induced and natural earthquakes. The map shows earthquake hazard zones near New Madrid, Missouri, and around Oklahoma City into south-central Kansas. New Madrid represents natural seismic hazard, while Oklahoma is primarily induced seismicity hazard from deep-well injection. The chance of an earthquake caused by deep-well injection depends on injection activity, such as hydraulic fracturing (fracking) to extract oil and gas from unconventional formations. Fracking induces microseismicity, with some cases leading to earthquakes larger than M 2.0 in places like Oklahoma, Ohio, and England. Hydraulic fracturing activities in western Canada have been correlated with earthquakes larger than M 3.0. Compared to disposal wells, fracking is considered less risky for inducing large earthquakes due to shorter injections and smaller fluid amounts. Seismic events in the Horn River Basin were linked to fluid injection near faults, with nearly 40 events recorded between 2009 and 2011. An investigation revealed these events were caused by hydraulic fracturing activities. The study linked fracking activities in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin with seismic events above M 3.0, including a M 4.6 earthquake. It noted that most seismic activity in the region since 1985 is associated with oil and gas operations, with only a small fraction of fracking wells (0.3%) linked to seismic events. The study also warned that hydraulic fracturing could induce earthquakes even days after injection activities ceased, suggesting that policies to limit injection may not immediately prevent such events. Hydraulic fracturing injection activities in Blackpool, England and south-central Oklahoma induced small earthquakes up to M 2.9. The earthquakes deformed well casing and were linked to fracking activities. Recent studies in Oklahoma further strengthen the association between fracking and earthquakes. Research on small earthquakes in Ohio in 2013 suggested that fracking operations affected previously unmapped faults, triggering seismic activity. Changes in Ohio's well permitting now include seismic monitoring equipment requirements due to seismic activity possibly related to fracking in the Marcellus and Utica Shale. The permitting changes for wells now require seismic monitoring equipment within three miles of faults or areas with seismic activity above M 2.0. If a seismic event above M 1.0 is detected, activities must stop for investigation. Despite low natural seismic activity in the Marcellus Shale region, a few M 2.0 earthquakes have been linked to hydraulic fracturing. Youngstown, OH, experienced earthquakes due to deep-well injection of waste fluids from Marcellus Shale gas development. The potential for generating earthquakes from hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus Shale region is an area of active research. While most operations create microseismic activity, there is a risk of larger earthquakes if the fluid injection affects nearby faults. The National Research Council estimates that conventional oil and gas production, along with hydraulic fracturing, generate over 800 billion. Oil and gas production, along with hydraulic fracturing, generate over 800 billion gallons of fluid annually. One-third of this is disposed of in Class II injection wells. The increase in wastewater from high-volume hydraulic fracturing has led to the need for disposal wells in new locations, resulting in recent seismic events near disposal wells. This has prompted a review of laws and regulations at the federal and state levels for managing underground injection. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 authorizes federal regulation of underground injection activities to prevent endangering drinking water sources. EPA historically has not regulated oil and gas production wells, and the SDWA excludes regulation of hydraulic fracturing operations. States and tribes can assume primary enforcement authority for the underground injection control program. The Safe Drinking Water Act allows states and tribes to take over enforcement of the underground injection control program. States can administer the program using their own rules for oil and gas injection operations, as long as they prove it protects drinking water sources. EPA, states, and tribes oversee over 800,000 injection wells under the program. The UIC program, overseen by EPA, states, and tribes, regulates 800,000+ injection wells. EPA has established six classes of wells based on injected materials, each with similar construction and operating techniques. Class II wells are used for oil and gas production purposes like disposing of brines, storing hydrocarbons, or enhancing recovery. Class II wells in the UIC program are used for injecting fluids to enhance oil and gas recovery or for disposal purposes. There are over 172,000 Class II wells in the US, with 80% being enhanced recovery wells and 20% disposal wells. The SDWA focuses on preventing endangerment of underground drinking water sources, but seismicity can impact water quality by damaging wells or creating new pathways for fluids. EPA regulations aim to protect underground sources of drinking water by ensuring injected fluids stay in permitted zones. EPA regulations aim to protect underground sources of drinking water by ensuring injected fluids stay in permitted zones and limiting injection pressures to prevent seismic events. Regulations for Class I hazardous waste disposal wells require suitable geological siting to minimize seismic risks. The UIC Director must evaluate geologic suitability for Class I wells based on structural, stratigraphic geology, hydrogeology, and seismicity. Seismic monitoring may be required if injection activity poses seismic risks. Class VI CO2 sequestration wells also require seismic risk assessment. Factors like seismic activity potential are considered before granting permits for new Class VI wells or converting existing wells. The owner or operator must provide information on seismic history and ensure seismicity will not interfere with containment when converting a Class VI well. EPA regulations for oil and gas wastewater disposal wells do not address seismicity but allow UIC Directors to add conditions to protect drinking water sources. Permits for Class I, II, and III wells must include specified operating conditions to prevent fluid movement into underground sources. The EPA regulations for Class I wells specify that injection pressure must be limited to prevent fracturing of the injection zone. EPA Region III evaluates induced seismicity risk factors for Class II disposal wells when considering permit applications. The SDWA regulations for Class II wells do not require specific consideration of seismicity, unlike Class I wells used for hazardous waste injection. The EPA evaluates seismic risk factors for Class II disposal wells, following the SDWA regulations to prevent endangerment of drinking water sources. In response to earthquake events, the EPA requested technical recommendations to address concerns related to induced seismicity events. The workgroup was asked to address concerns about induced seismicity from Class II disposal wells potentially endangering drinking water sources. EPA requested a report with specific elements including a comparison of relevant parameters, a decision-making model for preventing induced seismicity, lessons learned from case studies, recommended monitoring techniques, and applicability to other well classes. The EPA released the National Technical Workgroup's final report in February 2015, addressing concerns about induced seismicity from Class II disposal wells. The report provides practical management tools and best practices for addressing induced seismicity on a site-specific basis. It identifies three key components necessary for injection-induced seismic activity to occur. The EPA's report on induced seismicity from Class II disposal wells highlights the key components needed for injection-induced seismic activity to occur. These include sufficient pressure buildup, a fault of concern, and a pathway for pressure to communicate to the fault. The report also discusses potential risks to underground sources of drinking water (USDWs) from seismic events, such as loss of well integrity and contamination. Additionally, it mentions that current regulations allow for additional conditions in permits to protect USDWs. The report provides a decision model for regulators on site assessment strategies and recommends approaches for managing injection-induced seismicity. It suggests early actions for wells suspected of causing seismicity and identifies research needs for better understanding. The workgroup recommends a holistic and multidisciplinary approach for future research. The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) and the Ground Water Protection Council (GWPC) formed an Induced Seismicity Work Group (ISWG) in March 2014 to discuss the possible link between injection wells and seismic activity. In September 2015, the workgroup issued a primer on mitigating seismic risks associated with waste water disposal wells. Several states have strengthened oversight and added new requirements for disposal wells in response to injection-related seismic events. Several states have implemented policy and regulatory changes in response to injection-related seismic events. For example, some states have expanded permit application requirements, banned drilling in high-risk geological zones, and imposed moratoriums on new disposal wells. The Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission imposed a moratorium on new disposal wells in areas with increased seismic activity and required operators to report injection rates and pressures regularly. Additionally, the commission revised rules for Class II wells and established a permanent moratorium in 2011. In 2011, the AOGC revised rules for Class II wells, including a permanent moratorium zone near a major fault system. New disposal wells were banned, existing wells were required to be plugged, and commission approval and public hearings are now necessary for drilling near fault lines. Additional requirements include new siting and spacing regulations for disposal wells above or below the Fayetteville Shale formation, and the installation of flow meters for existing wells with daily injection volume reporting. State officials in Colorado monitor disposal well operations and seismic activity daily. Additional seismic monitoring equipment has been purchased to support an \"early warning\" system for detecting seismic activity. The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) has implemented various requirements to reduce induced seismicity, including setting limits on injection volume and rate, and ensuring that maximum injection pressure is below the fracturing pressure. In 2011, the COGCC expanded the UIC permit review process to minimize the risk of induced seismicity from oil and gas wastewater disposal following a significant earthquake near injection wells. The Colorado Geological Survey (CGS) reviews permit applications for proposed well sites near injection wells to evaluate seismic activity. They analyze geologic maps, USGS earthquake database, and area-specific information to assess the potential for seismic events. If seismicity is identified, operators must define seismic potential and proximity to faults before approval. In 2014, the COGCC collaborated with CGS, USGS, and state universities to address induced seismicity concerns. The Colorado Geological Survey (CGS) collaborates with USGS researchers and state universities to establish an induced seismicity advisory group. Kansas Governor Sam Brownback convened a State Task Force on Induced Seismicity in response to increased seismic activity in three counties. The task force report called for increased seismic monitoring and a response plan to detect earthquakes greater than magnitude 1.5. The response plan for induced seismicity in Kansas includes the ability to detect earthquakes above magnitude 1.5 and a set of criteria for evaluating disposal wells near earthquakes. The state has purchased a portable seismic array and established monitor stations. In 2015, injection rates for over 70 wells were limited to monitor seismic effects, with specific requirements for high-volume Arbuckle wells in response to earthquake clusters. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources implemented new permit requirements for Class II disposal wells following earthquake clusters in Youngstown in 2011. The rules, effective since October 2012, include restrictions on drilling into Precambrian basement rock and additional site assessment measures. Permit application requirements now involve various tests such as pressure fall-off testing, geological evaluation, seismic monitoring, and geophysical logging. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources has implemented new permit requirements for Class II disposal wells, including geophysical logging and seismic monitoring. Companies must provide a complete suite of geophysical logs and install monitoring technologies for new Class II permit applications. ODNR has also purchased portable seismic units for proactive seismic monitoring around deep Class II wells. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources has imposed new drilling requirements for horizontal production wells hydraulically fractured in response to seismic activity linked to hydraulic fracturing. The rules include design standards, approval processes, and construction conditions for wells near faults or previous seismic activity. New permits within 3 miles of a fault or seismic activity area over 2.0 magnitude must install seismic monitors. If a seismic event over 1.0 magnitude is detected, operations must halt for investigation. If a connection to hydraulic fracturing is found, fracturing must be suspended. In Oklahoma, seismicity events have increased due to Class II disposal wells used for managing produced water. The state reported that most wastewater disposed of is saltwater brine from oil and gas production. In response to induced seismicity concerns, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission implemented a \"traffic light\" permitting system for Class II disposal wells based on National Academy of Sciences recommendations. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission implemented a \"traffic light\" permitting system for Class II disposal wells based on National Academy of Sciences recommendations. The system requires review of disposal well permit applications for proximity to faults and seismicity. Well operators near stress faults or seismic clusters must demonstrate risk of induced seismicity and provide technical data. Additional requirements apply to wells in seismic clusters, with \"yellow light\" criteria for areas with some seismicity concerns. In March 2015, the OCC announced new directives for disposal well operators injecting into the Arbuckle Formation. Operators had to show wells were not in contact with basement rock to resume normal operations. Operators were required to plug back wells in contact with basement rock to a shallower depth and meet specified criteria. Failure to comply resulted in a 50% reduction in injection volumes. The OCC used the traffic light system to restrict well operations in certain areas after seismic events, with mandatory shut-ins for Arbuckle disposal wells following a seismic event in September 2016. In September 2016, operators in Osage County were required to shut in wells within 5-10 miles of an earthquake by September 13. EPA requested operators to shut in 17 disposal wells, with 5 wells in the Osage Nation Mineral Reserve remaining shut in. OCC expanded the seismicity impact area to 1,116 square miles, with a total of 67 wells of interest, 27 under OCC jurisdiction required to cease operations. EPA requested operators at 14 wells to reduce injection volumes by 25%. In November 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) implemented new rules related to seismic events in connection with wastewater disposal permits. Applicants for disposal well permits must provide information on historical seismic events within 100 square miles of the proposed site. Permits may be modified or terminated if injection is contributing to seismic activity. Additional information may be required for wells in high-risk areas. Operators may need to conduct more frequent monitoring and reporting of disposal well injection pressures and rates in areas with conditions that increase the risk of fluids not being confined to the injection interval. Additional regulatory actions may be taken in response to seismic events and wastewater injection, with ongoing evaluations by state regulatory agencies and geological surveys. State regulatory agencies and geological surveys are actively assessing the evolving understanding of deep-well injection of waste fluids from oil and gas production, including hydraulic fracturing operations. Policy makers face challenges in making timely decisions amidst public concerns about potential earthquakes from deep disposal wells. Some states have already adjusted their regulatory requirements in response to increased seismic activity in certain disposal areas. While most Class II disposal wells and hydraulic fracturing wells do not show significant seismic events, the rising injection volumes raise concerns about potential risks. The United States is concerned about the potential link between injection of fluids from oil and gas production and increased seismic activity. Some states are conducting geologic studies to address risks, while the EPA has outlined best practices to manage seismic events. Congress may oversee the EPA's UIC program and research on induced seismicity. Some U.S. wastewater disposal wells may cause damaging earthquakes, raising concerns about similar risks from other energy activities like underground injection for carbon dioxide sequestration."
