    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The California Clean Truck, Bus, and Off-Road Vehicle and Equipment Technology Program is created to fund development of zero- and near-zero-emission truck, bus, and off-road vehicle technologies, with priority for projects benefiting disadvantaged communities. The California Clean Truck, Bus, and Off-Road Vehicle and Equipment Technology Program funds development of zero- and near-zero-emission truck, bus, and off-road vehicle technologies, with priority for projects benefiting disadvantaged communities. Until January 1, 2018, 20% of funding will support early commercial deployment of existing zero- and near-zero-emission heavy-duty truck technology. Between January 2, 2018, and January 1, 2023, at least 50% of the allocated funds each year will support the commercial deployment of zero- and near-zero-emission heavy-duty truck and bus technology meeting emission standards. Two-thirds of the funds will be allocated to heavy-duty truck projects. From January 2, 2018, to January 1, 2020, heavy-duty trucks and buses receiving funds must use a minimum of 30% renewable fuel. Beginning January 2, 2020, heavy-duty trucks or buses with internal combustion engines receiving allocated funds must use at least 50% renewable fuel. The state board may increase this percentage in subsequent years if deemed feasible, with the requirement applying to funds awarded after the increase is adopted. The percentage in effect at the time of fund allocation will not change the award. The state board limits incentives for vehicle manufacturers to 49% of allocated funds. Projects must show significant greenhouse gas reductions to receive funding. Funding is allocated competitively for zero- and near-zero-emission bus technology development and deployment. (3) Development and deployment of zero- and near-zero-emission off-road vehicle and equipment technology in various sectors.\n(4) Purchase incentives for zero- and near-zero-emission truck, bus, and off-road vehicle technologies to support early market deployments.\n(5) Projects promoting commercial motor vehicle freight efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reductions through advanced technologies. The state board, in consultation with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, will develop guidance for the implementation of incentives for truck, bus, and off-road vehicle technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, in line with the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. The guidance will include performance criteria and metrics to create a simple and predictable structure for deployment incentives. The program aims to coordinate investments with funding programs under the California Alternative and Renewable Fuel, Vehicle Technology, Clean Air, and Carbon Reduction Act. It also promotes projects to help the state achieve its climate goals post-2020, focusing on medium- and heavy-duty trucking, buses, and off-road vehicles. Additionally, purchase incentives for clean vehicles in disadvantaged communities will be implemented. (6) Allow remanufactured and retrofitted vehicles to qualify for purchase incentives if they meet warranty and emissions requirements.\n(7) Establish a competitive process for allocating funds for projects.\n(8) Maximize federal or private funding.\n(9) Measure and report emissions reductions every two years.\n(10) Ensure projects align with air quality standards and prioritize those demonstrating specific characteristics. The curr_chunk highlights the benefits of projects that support disadvantaged communities, leverage additional funding, have potential for replication, cobenefits, and regional collaboration. It also emphasizes support for technologies with broad market potential and enabling technologies that benefit multiple pathways. The state board, in consultation with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, will create an annual framework and plan for technology development, demonstration, and commercialization processes. The state board will outline technology categories, performance criteria, and mandates for funding technologies in medium- and heavy-duty trucking, buses, and off-road vehicles. The roles of relevant agencies and coordination among participants and fuel providers will be described. The term \"heavy-duty truck\" is defined as a truck with a GVWR of 26,001 pounds or more. Effective January 2, 2018, a \"heavy-duty bus\" is defined as a bus with a GVWR of 19,501 pounds or more. \"Zero- and near-zero-emission\" refers to vehicles, fuels, and technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality compared to conventional alternatives, as determined by the state board in consultation with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission. This includes zero-emission technology, enabling technologies for emissions reductions, advanced fuel engines for long-haul trucks, and hybrid or alternative fuel technologies for trucks and off-road equipment."
