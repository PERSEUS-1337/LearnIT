    "content": "Recent advances have shown that learning to solve linear inverse problems in imaging using training data can outperform traditional regularized least squares solutions. The Neumann network, inspired by a truncated Neumann series expansion, offers an end-to-end learned architecture for this purpose. An extension of the Neumann network incorporates a patch-based regularization approach for more sample efficiency in solving linear inverse problems in imaging. Existing research explores using neural networks to solve inverse problems in image reconstruction. Learning-based approaches can be decoupled or end-to-end, with decoupled methods learning data representation independent of the forward model X. In the context of image reconstruction, neural networks can be used in various ways, such as learning a low-dimensional image manifold with GANs or incorporating the forward model directly into the network architecture for end-to-end optimization. Decoupled methods allow for a more versatile representation that can be applied to different inverse problems without the need for retraining. Neural networks in image reconstruction can be used for a wide range of inverse problems without retraining, but this flexibility requires a high sample complexity. Learning a generative model or denoising autoencoder involves estimating a probability distribution P(\u03b2). However, if X is known at training time, learning the conditional distribution P(\u03b2|X\u03b2) can require fewer samples. The MSE-optimal reconstruction function in the noiseless setting is characterized by a specific formula involving the pseudoinverse of X. The optimal reconstruction function in image reconstruction focuses on estimating a conditional expectation in the nullspace of the linear forward model. End-to-end approaches are favored in limited data settings due to lower sample complexity, with networks needing a structure compatible with the optimal function. The Neumann network architecture is highlighted as an end-to-end approach for learning. The Neumann network architecture is an end-to-end approach for learning to solve inverse problems. It includes an extension for patch-based regularization, improving sample complexity. Motivated by regularized least squares optimization, it uses a Neumann series expansion for matrix inversion. The Neumann network architecture utilizes a series expansion for matrix inversion, allowing for the estimation of a trainable estimator \u03b2 using a neural network R with parameters \u03b8 to be learned from training data. This approach includes skip connections for improved performance. The Neumann network architecture includes skip connections for improved performance and utilizes a series expansion for matrix inversion to estimate a trainable estimator \u03b2 using a neural network R with parameters \u03b8. The presence of additional skip connections in Neumann networks may enhance the optimization landscape and ease training. The Neumann network may benefit from preconditioning due to challenges in finding a solution to ill-conditioned linear systems. The Neumann network architecture incorporates skip connections and utilizes a series expansion for matrix inversion to estimate a trainable estimator \u03b2 using a neural network R with parameters \u03b8. The modified estimator, known as a preconditioned Neumann network, approximates the MSE optimal reconstruction function and directly approximates \u03c1 * (y) by incorporating a learned patchwise regularizer.

An extension to the Neumann network incorporates a learned patchwise regularizer to leverage the structured nature of image patches. This regularizer divides the input image into overlapping patches, subtracts the mean from each patch, and utilizes the shared low-rank and subspace structure among small patches of natural images for accurate reconstructions.
