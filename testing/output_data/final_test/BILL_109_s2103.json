    "content": "TEMPORARY WINDFALL PROFITS TAX: A new chapter is added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, imposing a tax on windfall profits from crude oil. It includes provisions for removal price, adjusted base price, and qualified investment, along with special rules and definitions. A 50 percent excise tax is imposed on integrated oil companies for windfall profits from taxable crude oil removed in 2005. The tax is based on the fraction of barrels removed, paid by the producer. The term \"windfall profit\" in this chapter refers to the excess of the removal price of taxable crude oil over the adjusted base price of the barrel. The removal price is determined by the amount for which the oil is sold, with specific rules for sales between related persons and oil removed from property before sale. The price for determining gross income from property under section 613 is based on the constructive sales price. If crude oil is refined on the property before removal, it is treated as removed on the day of refining, with the removal price being the constructive sales price. The term 'property' is defined by section 614. The adjusted base price for taxable crude oil is $40 per barrel. \"Special rules and definitions are outlined in section 5898.\" The Secretary will establish rules for withholding and depositing tax on taxable crude oil under section 5896. Taxpayers must maintain records, submit returns, and provide information as required. The Secretary will specify the filing requirements for the windfall profit tax return. Definitions include 'producer' as the economic interest holder of crude oil and 'crude oil' broadly defined. The term 'crude oil' includes condensates and natural gasoline, excluding newly discovered oil from wells drilled after enactment. A 'barrel' is defined as 42 US gallons. The Secretary may adjust removal prices to reflect fair market value, and regulations will be prescribed accordingly. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this chapter. A clerical amendment is made to the table of chapters for subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Chapter 56 introduces a windfall profit tax on crude oil. The deduction for this tax is added to the Internal Revenue Code, effective for taxable years starting in 2005. Additionally, a new section on household rebates is added to the Code. Regulations will be prescribed to implement these changes. The IRS will provide a $450 payment to individuals for the 2005 taxable year by March 1, 2006, except for those with no income or income over $40,000, those claimed as a dependent, estates/trusts, and nonresident aliens.
