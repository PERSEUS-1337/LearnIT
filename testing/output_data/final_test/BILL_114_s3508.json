    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Transparency and Honesty in Energy Regulations Act of 2016\". It includes findings related to energy regulations. Congress finds that the social cost of greenhouse gases, such as carbon and methane, is used to justify federal actions to address emissions from fossil fuels. Circular A-4 guides federal agencies in developing regulatory impact analysis. The social cost of carbon estimates, developed in 2009, do not comply with the discount rates prescribed by Circular A-4 from the Office of Management and Budget. The Circular A-4 from 2003 specifies that global effects of a rule should be reported separately from domestic costs and benefits. The social cost of carbon calculates global benefits instead of domestic effects. Using social cost of carbon estimates in rulemakings without public notice violates scientific peer review requirements and transparency commitments. In January 2009, the President issued a memorandum on transparency and open government. In July 2015, the social cost of carbon estimates were revised following a review by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. The Environmental Protection Agency used the social cost of methane estimate during this review process. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency developed rules for the Oil and Natural Gas Sector without proper peer review or public input to assess costs and benefits. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency developed rules for the Oil and Natural Gas Sector without proper peer review or public input to assess costs and benefits. The continued use of the social cost of carbon and methane by the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the EPA ignores sound science to eliminate domestic fossil fuel energy sources, costing US families billions each year. The social cost of greenhouse gases, including carbon and methane, justifies regulations implemented this year. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The term \"social cost of carbon\" is defined as the social cost of carbon described in specific documents published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon in February 2010. The Social Cost of Carbon is defined in specific documents published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon. It includes estimates of monetized damages associated with an increase in carbon dioxide emissions. The documents were published and revised by the United States Government in various years. The social cost of greenhouse gas refers to the monetized damages associated with an increase in carbon dioxide emissions, as defined in documents published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon. The social cost of greenhouse gas is defined in documents published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon, including the methodology for estimating the social cost of methane and nitrous oxide. The social cost of methane is defined as the estimate of monetized damages associated with an incremental increase in greenhouse gas emissions, as outlined in specific government publications. The curr_chunk discusses the final rule and regulatory impact analysis related to emission standards for the oil and natural gas sector. It also mentions a document on the social cost of methane. The curr_chunk discusses the Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis under Executive Order 12866, specifically focusing on estimating the Social Cost of Methane and the Social Cost of Nitrous Oxide. The document discusses estimating the Social Cost of Methane and Nitrous Oxide emissions, as well as any other estimate of damages associated with an increase in nitrous oxide emissions. SEC. 4 prohibits considering the social cost of greenhouse gases, including carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide. The Secretary and the Administrator are prohibited from considering the social cost of carbon, methane, nitrous oxide, or greenhouse gases in any cost-benefit analysis, rulemaking, guidance, or agency action. The Secretary and the Administrator can only consider the social cost of carbon, methane, nitrous oxide, or greenhouse gases in their activities if explicitly authorized by a Federal law enacted after the date of this Act. SEC. 5. REPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATOR: The Administrator must submit a report within 120 days of this Act's enactment, detailing the use of social costs of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide in rulemakings and cost-benefit analyses since January 2009."
