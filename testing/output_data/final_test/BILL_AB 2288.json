    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 14230 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to ensure comprehensive workforce services are provided through one-stop career centers. Services target high-wage industry sectors and offer universal access to career services for adult residents. This includes outreach, assessment, job search assistance, career counseling, and labor market information. The one-stop career centers provide a range of services including career counseling, labor market information, program performance details, supportive services information, assistance with unemployment compensation claims, welfare-to-work eligibility, individual employment plans, skill assessments, counseling, career planning, and prevocational services. Short-term prevocational services are provided to prepare individuals for training or employment. State and federally funded workforce education, training, and employment programs are integrated into the one-stop delivery system for universal access to career services. Training services are available to individuals who meet certain requirements and are in need of training to obtain or retain employment leading to economic self-sufficiency. Training services may include occupational skill training and on-the-job training. Training programs offered under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act include on-the-job training, workplace training with related instruction, private sector programs, skill upgrading, entrepreneurial training, incumbent worker training, transitional jobs, job readiness training, adult education and literacy activities, and customized training by employers or labor-management partnerships. Priority for training services and career services under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is given to adult recipients of public assistance, low-income adults, and individuals with basic skills deficiencies. Each local workforce development board must establish a full-service one-stop career center in the area, with all required partners. These centers offer integrated employment, education, and training services, including apprenticeship programs in coordination with approved standards. Collaboration between community colleges and apprenticeship programs is encouraged for preapprenticeship and continuing education in apprenticeable occupations. The approved apprenticeship programs offer training, apprenticeship training, and continuing education in apprenticeable occupations. The California Workforce Development Board and local boards must ensure that federal funds for preapprenticeship training in building and construction trades follow specific curriculum and include outreach for women participants. The California Workforce Development Board will develop policies for implementation. Each one-stop career center in California should be able to provide services in various languages and cultures to meet the needs of the diverse population. This act implements a federal law and does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution."
