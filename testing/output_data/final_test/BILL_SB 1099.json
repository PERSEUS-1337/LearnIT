    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 6731.1 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to include the practice of civil engineering, which involves locating, establishing, and determining alignments or elevations for fixed works. This also includes determining surface configurations, volumetric calculations, and positions of objects using mathematics or geometric measurements. A person practices land surveying by locating, establishing, or retracing alignments or elevations for fixed works using mathematics or geometric measurements. This includes rendering statements on the accuracy of maps or survey data. A land surveyor uses mathematics or photogrammetry to determine the configuration of the earth's surface, locate property boundaries, and position fixed objects on or below the surface. A land surveyor determines property boundaries and positions fixed objects using land surveying techniques, including geodetic surveying for three-dimensional geospatial data acquisition. The geospatial establishment of three-dimensional positions of fixed objects, geodetic control points, monuments, or stations is determined using land surveying techniques, including the California Coordinate System coordinates. This information is used to determine the horizontal or vertical positions of objects for mapping purposes. The California Coordinate System coordinates are used in land surveying to establish positions of objects for mapping purposes. Land surveyors are prohibited from using the title \"land surveyor\" to procure work or manage a business related to land surveying activities. They are also responsible for determining information in property documents. The curr_chunk discusses the creation, modification, and accuracy of electronic data in land surveying activities. It also exempts certain entities from requiring a licensed land surveyor until a replacement is found. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for governmental approval by authorized land surveyors. The curr_chunk amends Section 8725 of the Business and Professions Code to require licensing for anyone practicing land surveying in California. No reimbursement is needed for local agencies or school districts as a result of this act. It is illegal to practice as a land surveyor in California without a license or exemption, including setting or removing survey monuments on land without legal interest."
