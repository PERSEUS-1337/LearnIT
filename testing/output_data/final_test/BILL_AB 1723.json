    "title": "AB 1723",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Identity Theft Resolution Act prohibits creditors from selling consumer debt to debt collectors if the consumer is a victim of identity theft. This does not apply if the debt is sold to a subsidiary or affiliate that does not take action to collect the debt. The requirement for using an instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in debt collection does not apply in this case. Section 1788.18 of the Civil Code is amended to require debt collectors to stop collection activities upon receiving a police report and written statement from a debtor claiming to be a victim of identity theft for the specific debt in question. The written statement can include a Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Affidavit of Identity Theft. The California Office of Privacy Protection provides a written statement for identity theft victims, certifying the truthfulness of the information provided. The statement must include the debtor's claim of identity theft, a copy of their driver's license, and a declaration of the information's accuracy. To support a claim of identity theft, the debtor must provide a copy of their driver's license or identification card, any other supporting identification documents, specific facts backing the claim, an explanation of non-involvement in the debt, correspondence disputing the debt, documentation of residence at the time of the debt, and contact information for further communication. The debtor must provide information on who may have incurred the debt, a statement denying authorization for the use of their personal information, and a certification of the truthfulness of the representations made. If a debtor notifies a debt collector orally or in writing about being a victim of identity theft, the debt collector must inform them that their claim must be in writing. If the debtor omits required information, the debt collector must provide written notice of the additional information needed or send the debtor a copy of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Affidavit of Identity Theft form. Within 10 business days of receiving the complete statement and information, the debt collector must notify the consumer credit reporting agency if adverse information was reported and initiate a review. The debtor will be informed of the determination within 10 business days after the review. Debt collection activities can only resume if the debt collector determines in good faith that the debtor is responsible for the debt. The determination must comply with relevant provisions of the United States Code. The debt collector must notify the debtor in writing of their determination and the basis for it before continuing with collection activities, based on information provided by the debtor and other sources. (e) No inference shall arise if the debt collector decides to cease or recommence collection activities after review. The exercise of rights under this section is not a waiver of any other rights. (f) Documents complying with subdivision (a) may satisfy the notice requirement of Section 1798.93. (g) A debt collector ceasing collection activities must notify credit reporting agencies to delete adverse information within 10 business days. The debt collector must notify the creditor within 10 business days if debt collection activities are terminated due to identity theft. The debt collector can provide requested documents to the debtor. \"Debtor\" refers to various entities from which a debt collector seeks to collect a debt. Violations of this section are subject to the remedies provided by the law."
