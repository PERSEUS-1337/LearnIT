    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community Health Centers Investment Act\". Congress finds that 35,000,000 Americans lack access to basic health services, especially those in underserved rural or urban areas, without insurance or ability to pay. This leads to high infant mortality, low immunization rates, and overuse of emergency rooms for primary care. Community health centers, serving over 16,000,000 needy Americans in 5,000 communities, have proven to be effective in providing high-quality care with cost-efficiency. Nearly 900 underserved communities were funded in the past 5 years to establish these centers. In the past 5 years, nearly 900 underserved communities were funded to establish health centers, providing care to almost 5,000,000 needy individuals. However, 800 communities approved for centers were not funded due to lack of available funding. Existing health centers have faced reduced Federal grant support, jeopardizing their sustainability and ability to meet the needs of the uninsured. Growing new centers without supporting existing ones weakens this valuable resource for disadvantaged Americans. Health centers rely on the National Health Service Corps for over 20 percent of their physician workforce, but fewer than half of all Corps placements are made to health centers. Health centers experienced a 15 percent physician vacancy rate and a 19 percent dentist vacancy rate nationally, with higher rates in rural areas. Adequate reimbursement for services is crucial for health centers. Adequate reimbursement is crucial for health centers to fulfill their mission, as their Medicare payments are subject to an outdated cap, causing significant annual revenue losses nationally. SEC. 3.
