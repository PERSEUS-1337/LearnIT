PROMISE ZONE EMPLOYMENT CREDIT.\" The Promise Zone employment credit is determined based on the applicable percentage of qualified wages paid to employees. The applicable percentage is 20% for certain qualified wages and 10% for others. Qualified wages are those paid to employees who are qualified zone employees. The Promise Zone employment credit is based on qualified wages paid to qualified zone employees. The maximum amount of qualified wages per employee is $15,000 per year. The credit does not include wages used for the work opportunity credit, and the $15,000 limit is reduced by wages used for the work opportunity credit. The term 'wages' for determining credit under section 51 is defined in section 1397(a). A qualified employee is either a qualified zone employee or a qualified resident employee. A qualified zone employee is someone whose services are mostly performed within a Promise Zone for the employer. A qualified resident employee is defined as an employee whose principal place of abode is within a Promise Zone, but most of their services for the employer are not performed within the Promise Zone. Individuals described in section 1396(d)(2) are not eligible as qualified zone employees or qualified resident employees. The section outlines special rules similar to section 1397 and requires taxpayers to provide necessary information for evaluating the program's effectiveness. SEC. 1400V-3 outlines rules for expensing Promise Zone property. A taxpayer can elect to treat Promise Zone property costs as an expense, deductible in the year the property is placed in service. Promise Zone property includes tangible property with a recovery period of 20 years or less, water utility property, and computer software. The taxpayer can elect to treat Promise Zone property costs as an expense, deductible in the year the property is placed in service, excluding property to which section 168(g) applies. The election is made under rules similar to section 179(c), and Promise Zone property is not treated as section 179 property for coordination purposes. The Promise Zone property is not considered section 179 property. Rules similar to section 179(d) apply, and taxpayer reporting is required for evaluation. Conforming amendments include a Promise Zone employment credit under section 1400V-2. The Promise Zone employment credit under section 1400V-2 is added to the table of parts for subchapter Y of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments related to Promise Zones in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will take effect on the date of the enactment of the Act. The Promise Zone employment credit and expensing of Promise Zone property will apply to wages and property placed in service after the enactment date."
