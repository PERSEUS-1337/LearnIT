    "content": "The Constitution of 1789 established a federal district for the national government with exclusive legislation by Congress. Residents of the District of Columbia lack voting representation in Congress despite paying taxes and voting in presidential elections. The Constitution grants only states voting representation in Congress, leaving District residents without voting rights. The debate revolves around principles of consent of the governed and taxation without representation, as well as reconciling constitutional provisions for the District and voting representation. Various proposals have been made over the years to give the District of Columbia voting representation in Congress, including constitutional amendments, retrocession to Maryland, semi-retrocession allowing District residents to vote in Maryland, statehood, and virtual-statehood. Congress has limited the District's ability to advocate for voting representation through provisions in appropriation acts. During the 10-year period between 1790 to 1800, Virginia and Maryland residents ceded land for the permanent \"Seat of the Government of the United States\" and retained voting rights in their respective states until December 1800. District of Columbia residents sought representation in the national legislature as early as 1801, expressing concerns about political disenfranchisement. Augustus Woodward, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Thomas Jefferson, highlighted their entitlement to citizenship rights in a pamphlet. District of Columbia residents have sought voting representation in the national legislature since 1801. Congress has considered legislation for this, but permanent voting representation has not been granted. During the 103rd Congress, District's delegate was allowed to vote in the Committee of the Whole under amended House rules. During the 103rd Congress, the District's delegate was allowed to vote in the Committee of the Whole under amended House rules. This change was challenged in court but upheld, only to be repealed by the new House Republican majority in the 104th Congress. In the 110th Congress, a rules change (H.Res. 78) allowed resident commissioners and delegates to vote in the Committee of the Whole. Various proposals have been made over the years to give the District voting representation in Congress, including through constitutional amendment, retrocession to Maryland, semi-retrocession, statehood, and virtual statehood. Various proposals have been made over the years to give the District voting representation in Congress, including through constitutional amendment. Over 150 proposals have been introduced since the late 1800s, aiming to settle the question of voting representation for District citizens. These proposals can be grouped into six categories, ranging from electing two Senators and Representatives to electing at least one Representative to the House. Various proposals have been made over the years to give the District voting representation in Congress, including through constitutional amendment. The idea of a constitutional amendment was first suggested in 1801, by Augustus Brevoort Woodward, in a pamphlet entitled \"Considerations on the Government of the Territory of Columbia.\" His proposal would have entitled the District to one voting Representative or delegate in Congress. Augustus Brevoort Woodward proposed amending the Constitution to give the District of Columbia one Senator and House members based on population. He argued that residents should have the same rights as other U.S. citizens and participation in lawmaking is a fundamental republican principle. Woodward highlighted that the Senate represents states equally, regardless of population. Augustus Brevoort Woodward proposed amending the Constitution to give the District of Columbia representation in Congress based on population. He argued that residents should have the same rights as other U.S. citizens and participation in lawmaking is a fundamental republican principle. Woodward highlighted the disparity in Senate representation based on population and advocated for equal representation in the House of Representatives. Senator Henry Blair later introduced a constitutional amendment for voting representation in Congress for the District of Columbia. Senator Blair introduced a resolution in the 50th Congress in 1888, similar to Woodward's proposal in 1801, advocating for voting representation in Congress for the District of Columbia. Despite facing opposition from the Senate Judiciary Committee, Blair reintroduced modified versions of the amendment in the 51st Congress. He addressed the Senate in 1890, emphasizing the need for voting representation in Congress for the District of Columbia. In the years between 1902 and 1917, several bills proposed constitutional amendments entitling the District of Columbia to voting representation in Congress. Senator Chamberlain introduced S.J.Res. 196 in the 64th Congress in 1917, empowering Congress to recognize the District's citizens as citizens of a state for representation purposes. Congress was given the power to determine the structure and qualifications of the District's delegation for congressional representation. This resolution allowed Congress to act as a state legislature, granting the District one or two votes in the Senate and House based on its population. It was the first resolution to permit, rather than mandate, voting representation for District residents in Congress. Representative Emanuel Celler introduced a legislative proposal in 1967 on behalf of President Lyndon Johnson for this purpose. In 1967, a legislative proposal was introduced by Representative Emanuel Celler on behalf of President Lyndon Johnson to grant District residents voting representation in Congress. The proposal sought to authorize one voting Representative and granted Congress the authority to provide additional representation in the House and Senate. The House Committee on the Judiciary later reported an amended version of the resolution to allow full voting representation for the District of Columbia: two Senators and the number of Representatives it would be entitled if it were a state. In 1972 and 1976, constitutional amendments were proposed to grant voting representation to citizens of the District of Columbia, but were ultimately defeated in the House. In 1978, a proposed amendment (H.J.Res. 554) passed the House and Senate, granting the District representation in Congress. The Senate approved a resolution in 1978 granting the District of Columbia representation in Congress. The proposed amendment required ratification by three-fourths of the states, but expired in 1985 without enough support. In 1992, a new proposed amendment was introduced to declare the District as the seat of government. The proposed constitutional amendment in 1992 aimed to declare the District of Columbia as a state for representation in Congress and the election of the President and Vice President. Retrocession proposals were debated to provide voting representation for District residents by potentially relinquishing part of Washington to Maryland. Retrocession proposals aim to provide voting representation for District residents by potentially relinquishing part of Washington to Maryland, which may require the repeal of the 23rd Amendment. The 23rd Amendment grants the District of Columbia electoral college votes equivalent to the number of Senators and Representatives in Congress. A motion for retrocession was introduced in 1803, proposing to return part of the District to Maryland and Virginia. Supporters argued that exclusive jurisdiction over the District was unnecessary and deprived citizens of their political rights. Opponents of retrocession argued that Congress lacked the competency to govern the District and that it denied citizens the right of suffrage. They also believed that the national government needed a place unencumbered by state laws and that the District residents had not petitioned for retrocession. Additionally, they argued that the expense of administering the District would decrease over time and that retroceding the land removed the government of any obligation to remain in place. The motion for retrocession of the District of Columbia to Virginia and Maryland was debated in Congress, with arguments for and against the proposal. The Bacon motion was defeated, and a similar provision was introduced a year later. The House postponed a vote on the resolution until December 1804, and further debate took place in January 1805. The House debated retroceding the District of Columbia to Virginia and Maryland, excluding Washington, due to concerns about disenfranchisement and taxation without representation. In 1846, an act of Congress retroceded the District territory west of the Potomac River to Virginia, representing two-fifths of the original area. Virginia's agreement prevented immediate constitutional challenges. In 1869, a resolution challenged the seating of Virginia's 7th Congressional District representative, claiming the retrocession of Alexandria was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court later upheld the retrocession in 1875 but did not rule on its constitutionality. The Supreme Court upheld the retrocession of Alexandria in 1875 but did not rule on its constitutionality. The Court noted that since the parties involved were satisfied with the outcome, no third party had standing to bring suit. In 1896, the Senate adopted a resolution to determine the original cession of Virginia for the creation of the District of Columbia and to assess the steps needed for the District to regain the area retroceded to Virginia. The Attorney General of the United States did not offer an opinion on the constitutionality of the retrocession. The Supreme Court upheld the retrocession of Alexandria in 1875 without ruling on its constitutionality. In 1902, a joint resolution questioned the constitutionality of the retrocession and directed legal action to determine its validity. Senator George F. Hoar's report concluded that the retrocession was a political matter, not for judicial consideration. The resolution was recommended to be adversely reported. The Committee report recommended adverse reporting and indefinite postponement of the resolution regarding retrocession of the Maryland side of the District. Various bills and resolutions from 1838 to the Civil War proposed retrocession, some tied to abolishing slavery in the capital, but all failed. Georgetown unsuccessfully sought retrocession in 1838 and 1856. In 1848, Senator Stephen Douglas submitted a resolution to study retroceding the District of Columbia to Maryland. On January 22, 1849, a motion to retrocede part of the District to Maryland failed. In 1856, a bill was introduced to determine Georgetown's sentiments on retrocession. Since then, several bills have been introduced but none successful in retroceding the District to Maryland. Several attempts were made to retrocede all or part of the District to Maryland, but none were successful. Various bills were introduced in the 1960s, including creating a federal enclave and retroceding a portion of the District to Maryland. The bill introduced in 1965 by the House District of Columbia Committee aimed to create a federal enclave and retrocede the remaining part of the city to Maryland, contingent on Maryland's acceptance. If Maryland did not accept within a year, a referendum would be held to determine the form of government for the outer city, with congressional approval required for any changes. The bill introduced in 1965 aimed to retrocede part of the District of Columbia to Maryland, with provisions for additional representatives and federal payments. Several bills since then have proposed retrocession, but none have advanced to hearings or votes. Retrocession as a strategy for voting representation in Congress for District residents would require approval from Congress, the President, Maryland, and possibly voters in the retroceded area. Another option would be to treat District residents as citizens of Maryland for voting in federal elections, allowing them to vote in House elections and for Maryland's Senators. The idea of semi-retrocession would allow District residents to be considered inhabitants of Maryland for voting eligibility in federal elections, similar to the arrangement between 1790 to 1800. Several bills have been introduced since 1970 to enable District residents to vote in Maryland's congressional and presidential elections. Several bills have been introduced since 1970 to allow District residents to vote in Maryland's congressional and presidential elections without retroceding the area to Maryland. In 1973, a proposed constitutional amendment considered the District a part of Maryland for congressional apportionment and representation, but no further action was taken. In 1990, a bill was introduced to give District residents the right to vote in congressional elections as if they were residents of Maryland. In 1990, a bill was introduced to give District residents the right to vote in congressional elections as if they were residents of Maryland. The bill aimed to address the District's lack of voting representation in Congress and was seen as an alternative to statehood. However, it faced opposition from District officials and some members of the House. Both this bill and a statehood measure were referred to the House District of Columbia Committee but did not progress further. Parris proposed a plan in 1990 to give District residents the right to vote in Maryland elections instead of seeking statehood. This would allow the District to remain autonomous from Maryland while still having voting representation. The proposal aimed to address the lack of voting representation in Congress, differentiating it from past failed attempts to elect members of Congress from the District. Parris proposed a plan in 1990 to grant District residents voting rights in Maryland elections instead of pursuing statehood. This approach would maintain the District's autonomy from Maryland and provide voting representation in Congress, addressing the current lack of representation. The proposal does not require Maryland legislature approval and considers constitutional limitations on statehood. Parris proposed a plan in 1990 to grant District residents voting rights in Maryland elections, bypassing the need for statehood. The proposal raised constitutional and procedural questions, aiming to give Maryland an additional House seat temporarily. The idea resurfaced in the 108th Congress with the District of Columbia Voting Rights Restoration Act of 2004 introduced by Representative Dana Rohrabacher. Representative Rohrabacher introduced a bill to restore voting rights to District residents that were severed by the Organic Act of 1801. The bill aimed to treat District residents as Maryland voters for federal elections, allowing them to participate in Maryland's delegation to the House and Senate, run for congressional and senatorial seats in Maryland, and increase the size of the House by two additional members. The bill introduced by Representative Rohrabacher aimed to restore voting rights to District residents by treating them as Maryland voters for federal elections. It would allow them to participate in Maryland's delegation to the House and Senate, run for congressional and senatorial seats in Maryland, and increase the size of the House by two additional members. The bill also raised questions about state sovereignty and federal mandates. The bill introduced by Representative Rohrabacher aimed to restore voting rights to District residents by treating them as Maryland voters for federal elections. It raised questions about state sovereignty and federal mandates, particularly regarding the imposition of federal mandates on Maryland for administering federal elections in the District. The proposal of semi-retrocession, transferring administrative authority and costs to Maryland, also sparked concerns about constitutionality and the power of Congress to define state residency for voting representation. The District's unique status raises constitutional questions about achieving statehood through a simple majority vote in Congress. Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution outlines requirements for admission as a state. The District's unique status raises constitutional questions about achieving statehood through a simple majority vote in Congress. Some opponents argue that Maryland's consent may be necessary for creating a new state out of its former territory, which was ceded for the national capital. This raises concerns about potential constitutional conflicts with Article I, Section 8, Clause 17, which gives Congress exclusive control over the District. Granting statehood to the District of Columbia would provide full voting representation in Congress for residents, with two Senators and at least one Representative. Efforts for statehood date back to 1921, with a shift towards this goal in 1983 when a proposed constitutional amendment for voting rights failed to gain enough support. Statehood legislation in Congress focuses on making non-federal land in the District a state. Statehood legislation in Congress aims to make the non-federal land in the District the nation's 51st state, with efforts dating back to 1983. Multiple statehood bills have been introduced since the 98th Congress, but only one floor vote has occurred. Statehood bills, including H.R. 51 and H.R. 4208 introduced by Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, have been presented in Congress. H.R. 51 was voted against in 1993, while H.R. 4208 did not progress in the Committee on Judiciary. These bills did not specify methods for obtaining voting representation for the District of Columbia. During the 109th Congress, Representative Davis introduced legislation (H.R. 2043) to provide voting representation to citizens of the District of Columbia without using methods like a constitutional amendment, retrocession, semi-retrocession, or statehood. The bill aimed to designate the District as a congressional district to grant voting rights in Congress. Proponents suggest that Congress has the power to define the District as a state for voting representation purposes. Opponents argue that the District lacks essential elements of statehood, such as an autonomous state legislature. During the 109th Congress, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and Senator Joseph Lieberman introduced bills (H.R. 398 / S. 195) for voting rights in congressional elections for District residents. The bills introduced during the 109th Congress (H.R. 398 / S. 195) aimed to grant the District voting representation in Congress, including one Representative with full voting rights, two Senators, and additional Representatives based on population. Questions arose regarding the legality of Congress granting voting rights to District residents. The District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007 aimed to provide voting representation in both the House and the Senate, designating DC as a congressional district and increasing the number of House members to 437. It included a controversial provision for a temporary at-large congressional district for Utah. The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee approved a bill to increase the number of House members to 437, with one seat for the District of Columbia and another for Utah based on the 2000 census. The bill was passed by a vote of 24-5, with only one amendment approved. The amendment sponsored by Representative Westmoreland, approved by voice vote, would prevent the District from being considered a state for Senate representation. Other amendments, such as ceding the District back to Maryland or requiring a constitutional amendment for voting rights, were rejected. The bill was marked up and ordered reported by the House Judiciary Committee, which also rejected amendments for expedited judicial review and partisan balance in added representation. The bill H.R. 1433 aims to provide voting representation in Congress for District residents, with provisions for Utah's additional representative to be elected at-large or by congressional district. Concerns were raised about creating an at-large congressional district for Utah during the House Judiciary Committee hearing. The bill H.R. 1433 aims to provide voting representation in Congress for District residents, with provisions for Utah's additional representative to be elected at-large or by congressional district. Concerns were raised about creating an at-large congressional district for Utah during the House Judiciary Committee hearing on March 14, 2007. The proposed creation of an at-large congressional district for Utah is not without precedent, as at-large districts were used in the past due to various reasons. The Utah legislature approved a redistricting map creating a 4th congressional district for the state on December 4, 2006. The House considered H.R. 1433 for voting rights in the District of Columbia during the 109th Congress. A vote was postponed after a motion to amend the bill regarding gun control laws. Delegate Norton introduced H.R. 157 in 2009, similar to a previous bill that passed the House but failed to gain final approval in the 110th Congress. H.R. 157, introduced in the House on April 19, 2007, aimed to increase the number of Members in the House of Representatives to 437, designate the District of Columbia as a congressional district for voting representation, and temporarily elect a representative from Utah until the 2012 apportionment process. The act includes a nonseverability provision that would void the entire act if any part is declared invalid. H.R. 157 did not include provisions from a Senate companion bill, S. 160, such as prohibiting the District from being considered a state for Senate representation. The House Judiciary Committee approved an amended version of H.R. 157 in 2009, increasing House seats by two in the 112th Congress, clarifying District entitlement to three electoral votes, and allowing for additional representatives if needed. The House Judiciary Committee approved amendments to H.R. 157 in 2009, increasing House seats by two in the 112th Congress and clarifying District entitlement to three electoral votes. The Committee rejected several Republican-sponsored amendments, including retroceding land back to Maryland and reforming the District gun-control law. The Senate bill, S. 160, was reported by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and approved by the full Senate. The bill passed in 2009 includes provisions for increasing House seats to 437 in the 112th Congress, allowing expedited judicial review, and permitting Members of Congress to file legal briefs. It also includes a provision for creating a fourth congressional district in Utah and repealing parts of the District of Columbia Delegate Act of 1970. The District of Columbia Delegate Act of 1970, P.L. 91-405, limits the District to one representative in the House and abolishes the office of the District of Columbia Statehood Representative. The bill includes amendments unrelated to voting rights, such as encouraging diversity in media ownership by the FCC and repealing provisions of the District's gun control law through Senate Amendment 575. The Senate amendment aims to repeal the District of Columbia's firearm registration scheme and restrictions on possession and storage. It would prevent the D.C. Council from enacting laws related to firearm regulation and prohibit the District from restricting possession by individuals not prohibited under federal law. The Senate amendment aims to repeal the District of Columbia's firearm registration scheme and restrictions on possession and storage, allowing possession of firearms not already prohibited under federal law. It would also repeal the District's semiautomatic handgun ban and restore the right of self-defense in the home. The Senate Amendment 575 aims to repeal the District of Columbia's firearm registration scheme and restrictions on possession and storage. It also removes criminal penalties for carrying a firearm without a license and allows federally licensed firearms dealers in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to DC residents. Additionally, it includes provisions to repeal the District's Firearms Registration Emergency Amendment Act of 2008 and the Firearms Registration Amendment Act of 2008. The Senate Amendment 575 aims to repeal the District of Columbia's firearm registration scheme and restrictions on possession and storage. It includes a Severability Clause to protect the gun amendments if other parts of the bill are deemed unconstitutional. District residents have sought voting representation in Congress, but the Supreme Court ruled they do not have a constitutional right to it. Congress can grant voting rights through the political process. The options outlined in this report for granting voting rights to District residents must withstand political and constitutional challenges. Statehood, achievable by statute, may raise constitutional issues, while a constitutional amendment or retrocession are more problematic. Conflicting provisions of the Constitution, such as Art. 1, Sec. 2 and Art. 1, Sec. 8, Clause 17, present obstacles. Given the District's unique status, fail-safe avenues for granting voting rights may be limited. The only fail-safe avenues for providing District residents voting rights in the national legislature are a constitutional amendment or statehood. A constitutional amendment requires approval from two-thirds majority in Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. The process of amending the Constitution to grant voting rights to District residents can be lengthy and challenging, as seen with the unsuccessful D.C. Voting Rights Amendment of 1978. Retrocession, the option of returning part of the District to Maryland, has not been fully tested in courts and would require approval from Congress, the President, Maryland, and potentially voters in the retroceded area. Retrocession, the option of returning part of the District to Maryland, would require some portion to remain a federal enclave in accordance with the Constitution. Semi-retrocession bills propose a unique arrangement allowing District residents to vote in Maryland congressional elections based on residual citizenship theory, which was rejected by the Supreme Court in Albaugh v. Tawes. The Supreme Court rejected the theory of residual citizenship in Albaugh v. Tawes, stating that District residents have no right to vote in Maryland elections. Statehood process is politically sensitive, with Congress having the power to admit new states into the Union without a prescribed method in the Constitution. The process of granting statehood to the District of Columbia is complex and has evolved over time. Congress could convey statehood to part of the District, but a federal enclave must be maintained as the \"Seat of Government.\" This option would require repealing the 23rd Amendment to avoid giving undue political power to a small number of residents. Bills have been proposed to grant voting rights to the District Delegate by defining the District as a state or congressional district. Advocates argue that defining the District as a state for voting rights may conflict with the Constitution, as Congress has never granted the Delegate from DC a vote in Congress. Courts have not favored the idea of DC being considered a state for representation in Congress, but some suggest Congress has the power to confer such representation. The District of Columbia's voting rights advocates argue that Congress has the authority to provide representation to the District, citing legal arguments and examples like the Uniform and Overseas Citizens Absentees Voting Act. Some commentators dispute this argument, but proposals have been made to recommend granting the District a Senator in the Senate and members in the House of Representatives. The District of Columbia is entitled to representation in Congress based on its population. It is restricted from lobbying for voting representation using federal or District funds. The P.L. 109-115 Act prohibits the use of federal and District funds for lobbying activities related to securing statehood or voting representation for the District of Columbia. It also prohibits the District government from providing assistance for any petition drive or civil action seeking voting representation in Congress. Additionally, the act prohibits the use of funds for the offices of Statehood Representative for the District of Columbia. In 2005, the District of Columbia passed legislation allocating $1 million for educational activities to raise awareness about the lack of voting rights in Congress for District residents, seen as a way to bypass Congress's restrictions on using funds for advocacy. The District of Columbia allocated $1 million in 2005 for educational activities to raise awareness about voting rights. The Mayor identified three entities to conduct voter education activities, including DC Vote, The League of Women Voters of the District of Columbia, and Our Nation's Capital. Congress considered provisions to relax restrictions on using District funds for lobbying efforts for voting representation. The District of Columbia allocated funds for voter education activities in 2005. Congress considered provisions to relax restrictions on using District funds for lobbying efforts for voting representation."
