    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Residential Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act\" and includes findings related to carbon monoxide poisoning prevention. Congress finds that carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless gas produced by burning fuel, can lead to poisoning and death. Each year, over 500 people die from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by fuel-burning appliances in residential homes. Research shows that installing carbon monoxide alarms near sleeping areas can help prevent fatalities, and Congress should promote their purchase and installation in homes. Congress aims to promote the health and public safety of all people in the United States by requiring the installation of carbon monoxide alarms in residential homes and dwelling units. SEC. 3. ADOPTION OF ANSI/UL 2034 AS CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY RULE. The Consumer Product Safety Act is amended to include a new section on residential carbon monoxide detectors. The Consumer Product Safety Act mandates the publication of the American National Standard for Carbon Monoxide Alarms as a mandatory safety standard within 90 days of the enactment of the Residential Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act. Manufacturers and distributors are prohibited from importing or distributing residential carbon monoxide detectors that do not comply with this standard. Beginning 1 year after the enactment of the Residential Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act, manufacturers must comply with the American National Standard for Carbon Monoxide Alarms when selling residential detectors. Failure to comply will result in penalties under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Non-standard carbon monoxide detectors are exempt from this requirement. After the enactment of the Residential Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act, manufacturers must comply with the American National Standard for Carbon Monoxide Alarms when selling residential detectors. Failure to comply will result in penalties under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Non-standard carbon monoxide detectors are exempt from this requirement. Any revisions to the ANSI/UL 2034-2008 standard must be notified to the Commission, which will then issue a notice of proposed action within 120 days. The Commission will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the product safety standard for residential carbon monoxide detectors within 180 days. Additionally, the Commission may amend the standard for such detectors to include any revisions reasonably related to their performance. The Act amends the product safety standard for residential carbon monoxide detectors to ensure safe operation. Sections 7 and 9 do not apply to amendments of the standard, and judicial review will follow specific procedures. A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents of the Consumer Product Safety Act. SEC. 4. FINAL PORTABLE GENERATOR RULE. The Consumer Product Safety Commission must issue a final rule within 18 months requiring portable generators to have an automatic shut-off feature if technologically feasible. SEC. 5. STATE GRANT PROGRAM FOR CARBON MONOXIDE ALARMS. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a grant program to assist eligible States in implementing a carbon monoxide alarm program. States must show they have laws or regulations mandating approved carbon monoxide alarms to qualify for the grant. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a grant program to assist States in implementing carbon monoxide alarms according to NFPA 720 in all residential units. Failure to comply will result in penalties. States can submit applications to the Commission through fire code officials. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a grant program to assist States in implementing carbon monoxide alarms in residential units. Grants will prioritize multi-State applications and States with higher than average carbon monoxide poisoning deaths. States can use grant funds to train fire code enforcement officials in enforcing State laws. The grant program will assist States in implementing carbon monoxide alarms in residential units by providing funds for training fire code enforcement officials, developing training materials, and educating the public on the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning. Administrative costs are limited to 10% of the grant award. The grant program aims to help States implement carbon monoxide alarms in residential units by funding training for fire code enforcement officials, developing educational materials, and raising public awareness about carbon monoxide poisoning risks. Up to 25% of the grant can be used for public outreach activities. Definitions for approved carbon monoxide alarm and carbon monoxide alarm are provided in the section. The curr_chunk defines terms related to carbon monoxide alarms, such as Commission, dwelling unit, fire code enforcement officials, and NFPA 720. The National Fire Protection Association issued standards for the installation of carbon monoxide alarms in dwelling units. $2,000,000 is authorized for the Commission annually from 2010 to 2014 for this purpose. Any unspent funds will be retained by the Commission for enforcement of the Consumer Products Safety Act. A report must be submitted by the Commission within one year of each fiscal year where grants are provided. For each fiscal year with grants, the Commission must report to Congress on the grant program's implementation."
