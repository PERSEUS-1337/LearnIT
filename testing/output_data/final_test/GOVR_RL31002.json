The Department of the Treasury's appropriations fund various law enforcement organizations and agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the Secret Service, and the Internal Revenue Service. Federal contributions also support the Executive Office of the President, covering salaries, expenses, and operations of various agencies within the EOP. The Treasury and General Government appropriation funds various agencies within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) and independent agencies like the Federal Election Commission and the General Services Administration. Specific funding for drug control initiatives is allocated by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP).

The House agreed to the conference language on October 31, 2001, extending specified dates to January 2, 2002. Funding differences between the two versions were discussed in the Budget and Policy Issues section. The conference report was approved by the Senate on November 1, 2001, with a vote of 83-15. President Bush signed P.L. 107-67 on November 12, 2001, which included appropriations for various government agencies. Continuing resolutions extended funding through October 23, 2001, with adjustments made by subsequent legislation. The Department of the Treasury performs various functions including formulating economic policies, serving as the financial agent for the government, enforcing financial laws, and producing currency. It consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus. Funding for the department was provided through various legislative acts, with the accounts no longer subject to continuing resolutions. The Treasury Department consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus. The bureaus handle financial duties and law enforcement, with the IRS being the exception performing both functions. The IRS, under P.L. 107-67, receives $15.042 billion in funding for FY 2002, an increase from FY 2001. It remains the largest account in the Treasury Department's budget, with other major accounts including Customs Service, Secret Service, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Significant funding increases are seen for FinCen, Customs Service, Secret Service, and Treasury Department Systems and Capital Investments Programs compared to the previous year. In FY 2002, funding for FinCen increased to cover expenses for security planning and operations for the 2002 Winter Olympics. Several Treasury Department accounts are funded at reduced levels compared to FY 2001, with significant cuts for programs like Expanded Access to Financial Services and Counterterrorism Fund. The Treasury Department plays a crucial role in federal efforts to combat terrorism through its statutory missions and law enforcement responsibilities. The Counterterrorism Fund is the only bureau with an appropriation account designated specifically for counterterrorism. It is intended to cover costs related to efforts to counter, investigate, or prosecute terrorism, and to rebuild operational capabilities after terrorist incidents. Approval from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees is required to use the Fund. The Treasury Department's budget for counterterrorism in FY 2002 is estimated to be at least $419 million. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the department's involvement in counterterrorism has expanded, with initiatives such as Operation Green Quest launched to investigate terrorist financing. President Bush signed the USAPATRIOT Act on October 26, 2001 to enhance counterterrorism efforts. The USAPATRIOT Act of 2001 signed by President Bush expands the Treasury Department's power to combat money laundering and investigate suspicious foreign financial transactions. Efforts to increase funds for counterterrorism in FY2003 may be requested. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) regulates alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives, with a focus on reducing crime, collecting revenue, and protecting the public. ATF's enforcement of laws related to firearms has been controversial. In FY1999, ATF collected $12,135,929,000 in taxes and revenues. Congress increased ATF's funding from $336,040,000 in FY1992 to $771,143,000 in FY2001. For FY2002, Congress provided $823,316,000 for ATF, including budget increases for various operations. The Senate-passed measure for ATF funding in FY2002 included a $821,421,000 budget with increases for various purposes, while the House-passed measure allocated $824,199,000 with additional funds for security at the 2002 Winter Olympics. The House measure for ATF funding in FY2002 included $10,523,000 for security at the 2002 Winter Olympics and $500,000 to improve recordkeeping. It also fully funded budget enhancements for various initiatives, totaling $183,700,000. The Administration's FY2002 budget request for ATF was $803,521,000, a 4.2% increase over the previous year. The Administration sought increased funding for ATF in FY2002 to fully fund newly authorized positions and maintain services. The Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative was highlighted as a best practice, with Congress providing funds to expand it to 12 additional cities. The Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) is set to hire 72 agents and 98 inspectors, bringing total funding to $76,400,000. The program aims to reduce youth firearm violence and trafficking by providing federal resources to law enforcement agencies in 50 cities. The House-passed measure proposed $85,000,000 for YCGII in FY2002, while the Senate-reported measure suggested a $5,000,000 increase. The Gang Resistance Education and Training program would remain funded at $13,000,000. The U.S. Customs Service is responsible for regulating revenue collection. The U.S. Customs Service, the federal government's oldest revenue collecting agency, regulates the movement of goods and people between the U.S. and other countries. In FY1999, Customs collected $22.4 billion in trade-related duties, taxes, and fees. Congress increased direct appropriations for Customs from $1.45 billion in FY1992 to $1.93 billion in FY2000, a 33% increase. For FY2001, Congress appropriated $2.28 billion, supporting 17,479 full-time positions, an 18% increase from FY2000. Additionally, COBRA fees and other receipts are expected to support an additional 1,988 full-time positions in FY2001, bringing the total to 19,467. In FY2001, Congress provided the U.S. Customs Service with $2,688,049,000, a 17.9% increase over the agency's FY2001 appropriation. This amount includes funding for salaries and expenses, air and marine interdiction, automation modernization, and harbor maintenance fee accounts. The Senate-passed measure would have provided Customs with $2,555,922,000, a 12.1% increase, while the House-passed measure would have provided $2,673,848,000 in total funding, a 17.3% increase. The House-passed measure for FY2002 would have provided Customs with $2,673,848,000 in total funding, including allocations for salaries, air and marine interdiction, automation modernization, and harbor maintenance fee accounts. Additionally, an amendment was adopted to prevent funding from being used to remove detention orders on imports due to forced or indentured child labor. This contrasts with the Administration's request of $2,385,233,000 for the Customs Service in FY2002. The FY2002 Customs funding included $1,961,764,000 for salaries and expenses, $162,637,000 for air and marine interdiction, $257,832,000 for automation modernization, and $3,000,000 from the harbor maintenance fee account. The Administration's request aimed to offset costs with reductions and increase funding to fully support new positions and additional full-time equivalents. This would bring the agency's total full-time equivalent level to 17,849 for FY2002. The Administration's request aimed to increase funding to meet FY2002 baseline requirements for Customs, allowing for the maintenance of services at FY2001 levels. Congress provided additional funding for salaries and expenses, including earmarks for non-pay inflation costs and pay adjustments. The Senate-reported measure included budget increases for non-pay inflation costs, additional staffing on the northern border, child labor efforts, an intellectual property law center, and various other projects. The House-passed measure included budget increases for non-pay inflation costs, security at the 2002 Winter Olympics, non-intrusive inspection technology, additional positions, Pulsed Fast Neutron Analysis inspection technology, and anti-tobacco efforts. Congress has allocated $800,000 for anti-tobacco smuggling efforts and $1,317,000 to assist African nations in trade compliance. Customs has received $177,860,000 for the air and marine interdiction program, a 33.8% increase over the FY2001 appropriation. Additionally, $427,832,000 has been provided for automation modernization, $170,000,000 more than the Administration's FY2002 request. The Senate measure for FY2001 appropriated $5,400,000 for the International Trade Data System and not less than $130,000,000 for the Automated Commercial Environment. Customs' Automated Commercial System has been inadequate and suffered from \"brownouts\" hindering international commerce. The General Accounting Office (GAO) testified that the current import processes handled by ACS are paper-intensive, error-prone, and out of step with just-in-time inventory practices. Congress has increased funding for Customs to upgrade ACS and develop its replacement, the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). Customs struggled with ACS upkeep and ACE development. Congress directed Customs to provide a revised blueprint, schedule, and budget for ACE in FY2000. For FY2001, Congress provided over $257,832,000 in direct appropriation, including funds for the International Trade Data System and ACE development. The development, operation, and maintenance of ACE will cost between $1.4 and $1.8 billion over 7 years. Customs would begin taking bids to develop the new system in FY2001. The Senate-reported measure allocated $230,000,000 for ACE in FY2002, while the House-passed measure allocated $300,000,000. The conference agreement matched the House amount. Customs also generates offsetting receipts from user fee programs established by various acts. The COBRA fee receipts, not appropriated by Congress, provide a substantial portion of funding for Customs. These receipts have funded permanent inspector positions and information technology costs, with surplus revenues carried over from year to year. In FY2000, there were reports of a drop-off in air passenger processing fee receipts, leading to a reliance on COBRA fee receipts to fund Customs positions. The House-passed measure allocated $15,000,000 for additional positions to address the decline. The authorization for COBRA fees expires in FY2003. The IRS administers various federal taxes and fees. The IRS is responsible for processing tax returns, collecting taxes, and providing services to taxpayers. In FY 2000, it collected $2.077 billion, with individual income tax revenue being the largest component. The IRS is funded at $9.437 billion in FY 2002, allowing for an increase in staff and allocation of funds for tax processing, enforcement, information systems, and compliance initiatives. The IRS is receiving $391.6 million for its Information Technology Investment Account (ITIA) until September 30, 2004, with funds allocated on a project basis. $128 million was released from the ITIA in June 2001 for modernizing the IRS information system. No additional funding is provided for the STABLE initiative in FY 2002. P.L. 107-67 also gives $123.7 million to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration in FY 2002. The IRS is directed to improve customer service and safeguard taxpayer information. Concerns are raised about coordinating spending on modernization projects. The agency has submitted a budget request for FY 2003, seeking an increase in funding and authority to hire more staff for customer service and information system modernization. The IRS Oversight Board plays a key role in reviewing and making recommendations on the IRS budget. The U.S. Secret Service is mandated to protect government officials, conduct criminal investigations, and enforce counterfeiting laws. The Secret Service is funded at $920,615,000 under P.L. 107-67, with additional funding for salaries and expenses. The agreement increased the salaries and expenses account by over $4 million, with the House-passed version funding the Secret Service at $3,457,000. The Senate approved $902,967,000 for the Secret Service, with $899,615,000 for salaries and expenses. Additional funding was allocated for repair and construction of facilities.

Further funding was allocated under the emergency supplemental for the Secret Service. The House Committee on Appropriations approved an appropriation of $947,234,000 for the Secret Service, including funding for security planning, staffing re-balancing, and support for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The President requested $857,117,000 for salaries, expenses, research, and vehicle purchases in FY2002. Total increases of $56,228,000 were offset by other adjustments. The FY2002 budget request for the Secret Service includes funding for investigations of exploited children and acquisition/construction costs. P.L. 106-554 funded salaries and expenses at $823.8 million in FY2001, with additional funding provided by P.L. 106-346. The U.S. Postal Service relies mainly on product sales for revenue, with Congress providing an appropriation for mail services for the blind and visually impaired. The U.S. Postal Service receives appropriations to cover revenue forgone in providing free and reduced rate mail for the blind and visually impaired. Congress is required to reimburse USPS $29 million annually until 2035 under the Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993. In FY2001, USPS received $96.093 million in appropriations, including $67.093 million for revenue forgone in FY2001. The funding includes advance appropriations for FY2002 and FY2003. The Senate approved $143.7 million for the Postal Service in FY2002, with $47.6 million unavailable until October 1, 2002.

The Senate Committee on Appropriations recently allocated an additional $500 to the U.S. Postal Service for semipostal stamps, including provisions to extend the Breast Cancer Research Stamp expiration date and exempt it from certain regulations. The USPS regulation was extended to allow for the issuance of additional semipostal stamps, including one to benefit families of rescue workers from the September 11 attacks and another for domestic violence programs. The Department of Health and Human Services administers domestic violence programs. The USPS can now require contract air carriers to accept day-old poultry as mail. Hawaii urged the Postal Service to develop a procedure for sorting mail on the same island it originates from. The conferees directed the USPS to conduct a 90-day study on introducing new products and services.

The President's FY2002 budget requested that $386,289,000 remain available from the $6,107,891,000 deposited in the Federal Buildings Fund. The President's FY2002 budget requests funding for construction and repairs in the Federal Buildings Fund. Congress directs the allocation of funds, with the conference agreement providing specific amounts for various purposes. The Senate version differs slightly in the allocation for construction and acquisition of facilities. The President's FY2002 budget proposed the establishment of an electronic government account with initial funding of $10 million to support interagency e-gov initiatives. Managed by OMB, the fund aimed to facilitate secure online communications and enhance the Administration's ability to implement digital signatures. The Bush Administration decided to double the e-gov fund allocation to $20 million, supporting interagency projects for expanding electronic activities. The Senate and House bills allocated $5 million each for innovative uses of the Internet and electronic methods. Both bills required a spending plan and justification for fund transfers to federal agencies. The final agreement retained the $5 million appropriation and spending plan requirement. The administration is working with government committees to clarify the status of its $20 million fund request until September 30, 2004. The Merit Systems Protection Board assists federal agencies in running a merit-based civil service system and has been allocated $30,555,000 in appropriation.

President Bush allocated additional funds from the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States. The Office of Government Ethics, a small agency within the executive branch, was established. The Office of Government Ethics, established in 1978, is a separate agency within the executive branch that aims to prevent conflicts of interest among government employees. It collaborates with other agencies to promote high ethical standards and public confidence in government operations. The agency is funded at $10,117,000 by P.L. 107-67, with an increase of $454,000 from the previous year. The Office of Government Ethics received $10,060,000 in funding for FY2001, with a slight increase from the previous year. Legislation was passed to reauthorize the agency through FY2006.

The report discusses general provisions such as BuyAmerica Act and drug-free federal workplaces, along with agency-specific provisions. The Administration's proposed language for general provisions in Title VI can be found in the Appendix. The amendments adopted and rejected during House consideration and passage of H.R. 2590 on July 25, and the Senate amendments considered and adopted on September 19, are detailed in the \"Status and Legislative History\" section of the report. Title V of P.L. 107-67 includes a new provision (section 515) regarding prohibiting the use of funds to any person or entity convicted of violating the Buy American Act. Title VI contains several new or significantly modified provisions as agreed to by the conferees, including sections on child labor and childcare in federal facilities.

The Bush Administration recommended eliminating a provision prohibiting payment to political appointees in certain roles. The provision in the bill, in place for at least twenty years, has been recommended for elimination by previous administrations. It prohibits the use of funds to enforce regulations disapproved by Congress. If eliminated, the executive could continue regulatory activities disapproved by Congress. Another section recommended for elimination requires that no funds be obligated or expended. The provision in the bill, section 621, prohibits funds for employee training not related to official duties or containing elements inducing emotional stress. Section 622 (FY2001) prohibits funds for non-disclosure agreements without whistle-blower protection. The Bush proposal aims to eliminate provisions in the bill that require employee non-disclosure agreements to include whistle-blower protection clauses. This includes sections 622 and 627 of the act, which also cover the release of \"non-public\" information and the use of official time by federal employees. Both the Bush and Clinton budget proposals seek to remove these requirements, arguing that existing ethics statutes already impose similar obligations on federal personnel. The President's budget proposes new sections, including extending franchise fund pilot programs, amending provisions related to utilities at the Vice President's residence, and authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to accept donations for official functions. The President's budget proposes new sections, including extending franchise fund pilot programs, amending provisions related to utilities at the Vice President's residence, and authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to accept donations for official functions.

The Office of Management and Budget allocates funding to various agencies for counterterrorism functions, with some receiving funds from the Emergency Response Fund. A supplemental appropriation authorized by P.L. 107-38 further supports these efforts. The Department of the Treasury plays a role in these activities. The Department of the Treasury plays a key role in counterterrorism efforts, with various agencies such as the Customs Service, Secret Service, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms leading different functions. The Department is responsible for supporting and securing the nation's financial structure, while the General Services Administration manages federal buildings and real property. Under the Government Information Security Reform Act of 2000, the GSA assists agencies in maintaining procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents through the Federal Computer Incident Response Center (FedCIRC). The Office of Management and Budget submits an Annual Report on Combating Terrorism, with the most recent report from August 2001 providing details on agency funding and suggested modifications to the Treasury Counterterrorism Fund. The President's FY2002 budget proposed modifications to the Treasury Counterterrorism Fund to allow for greater flexibility in managing counterterrorism programs. The Fund would be used for supporting counterterrorism activities, with expenditures requiring Congressional oversight. The Treasury Counterterrorism Fund allows for flexible fund expenditures in various circumstances. Funding amounts for the Fund correspond to those under Departmental Offices. The FY2001 enacted $54.9 million, President's request was $44.9 million, House passed version funded at $36.9 million, and Senate version at $44.9 million. Senate report recognizes varied responsibilities of Treasury bureaus and expects funds to be used for activities like travel and transportation. Table 2 provides funding information from the OMB report after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Congress enacted the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from Terrorist Attacks, allowing for up to $20 billion in funds for recovery, response, and national security activities. Six allocations have been made affecting Treasury and General Government Appropriations accounts. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from Terrorist Attacks allocated $20 billion for recovery, response, and national security activities. Congress made six allocations, with funds immediately available for some accounts and a 15-day review period for others. The largest allocations were $51 million to the President's Unanticipated Needs fund and $175 million to the Postal Service. P.L. 107-117 allocated $1,283.4 million to various accounts, including the President's Unanticipated Needs fund and the Postal Service. An additional $20 billion was authorized for emergency response and recovery purposes. The Administration detailed to Congress how the funds should be allocated on October 16. The Administration detailed to Congress how $315.2 million in funding proposed for the Treasury Department would be allocated. This includes funds for customs Service, Secret Service, other emergency expenses, and the Executive Office of the President in response to the September 11th terrorist attacks. A total of $200.5 million is requested for the Federal Buildings Fund [GSA] to increase security services nationwide at Federal buildings, for replacement space costs in New York City, for additional security equipment nationwide, and other security costs. Additionally, $7 million would be allocated to the National Archives and Records Administration. The total Administration allocations would have been $512.7 million for these accounts. Congress cleared H.R. 3338 for the President's approval, and Division B of P.L. 107-117 provides $1,283.4 million for accounts under discussion in this report. President addressed Congress on September 20, 2001, regarding the terrorist attacks on America. President George W. Bush announced the creation of the Office of Homeland Security after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge was appointed to lead the office, with a mission to develop a national strategy to secure the US from terrorist threats. $25 million was allocated for the office from the Emergency Response Fund. Tom Ridge resigned as Governor of Pennsylvania and was sworn in as Assistant to the President for Homeland Security on October 8, 2001. President George W. Bush appointed Tom Ridge to lead the Office of Homeland Security with a staff of 100 and a $25 million budget. Ridge will also serve on the Homeland Security Council. Funding and staff details are still being considered, with a mix of new and loaned staff from other departments. President George W. Bush appointed Tom Ridge to lead the Office of Homeland Security with his own budget and staff. Senators want the new office to have budget authority through legislation. Ridge began organizing and staffing the office before officially resigning as governor. The administration is working with Congress on legislation for independent budget authority. Congress is working on legislation to provide independent budget authority for the Office of Homeland Security led by Tom Ridge. The legislation is pending presidential approval as of January 2, 2002. Under the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1990, federal white collar employees are to receive annual adjustments based on changes in private sector salaries. The President's budget proposes a 3.6% federal civilian pay increase in January 2002, but it does not specify how the increase will be split between basic pay and locality-based payments. The FY2002 budget resolution expresses the sense of Congress regarding the pay increase. The Congress expressed the need for parity between military and civilian pay adjustments. President Bush recommended a 4.6% increase in military pay, while the General Schedule pay adjustment is set at 3.6%. Legislation provides for a 4.6% increase in the General Schedule. The House adopted an amendment for a $4.6% civilian pay raise and allocated funds for the increase. Senate bill S. 1398 would also fund the pay increase at 4.6%. Executive Order 13249, signed December 28, 2001, sets out the pay schedules with an average 4.6% pay increase for the General Schedule. All employees receive a 3.6% base pay adjustment, with locality-based comparability payments bringing net increases up by about 1% on average. The net adjustments range from 4.52% to 5.42%, with Washington, D.C. area General Schedule employees receiving a 4.77% increase. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers at rates prevailing in local wage areas for like occupations. The Congress has limited wage adjustments for Federal Wage System (FWS) workers based on General Schedule rates. In high-cost areas, FWS wages are capped to prevent exceeding General Schedule salaries. The House committee is concerned about wage surveys for Bureau of Prisons positions and requires a review by OPM. Additionally, OPM must report on a proposal to realign a wage area in California. P.L. 107-117 extends the Monroney Amendment out-of-area survey application to Department of Defense personnel and dictates pay adjustments for federal officials based on ECI calculations. Members of Congress and judges have their salaries adjusted based on ECI calculations, with a limit tied to the rate of adjustment for base pay of the General Schedule. Judges require specific authorization for annual pay increases. The authorization for the January 2001 pay increase for judges is in the Commerce, State, Justice and Judiciary appropriation. Judges have not received lower adjustments than other officials since the authorization was required. The mechanism for pay adjustments is automatic, so no bill language is needed for the January 2002 adjustment. There was brief discussion during the Treasury bill debate about a possible pay increase for Members, but the act is silent on Member pay. Since 2001, the President's salary is $400,000 per year, up from $200,000 since 1969. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to Cabinet Secretaries' pay rate. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program provides health coverage for federal employees and retirees. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) provides health coverage for federal employees and retirees. It is a contributory program with a selection of plans. The budget proposes eliminating the requirement for FEHBP to cover prescription contraceptives, but the House Committee on Appropriations voted to retain the coverage provision. Data from 1998 shows nearly 500 plans participating in FEHBP, including fee-for-service plans open to all federal employees and annuitants worldwide. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) offers a variety of health plans to federal employees and retirees, with around 10 options available depending on location. There are 4.1 million policy holders, including family members. The plans include fee-for-service and HMO options, with some plans not covering prescription contraceptives. Nationwide, sterilization is the most popular birth control method among mature women. The Senate passed a bill recommending a pilot project to help subsidize child care expenses for lower paid federal employees. The House passed bill H.R. 2590 on July 25, 2001, authorizing the use of funds for child care in federally owned or leased facilities for civilian employees to improve affordability for lower income personnel. P.L. 107-67 added language authorizing advance payment to licensed child care providers. The funding in the OPM accounts reflects the government's contribution to the Federal Employees' Retirement System and the Civil Service Retirement System, which require employee contributions. Additionally, there is a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) available for civilian federal employees under the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986. Employees can contribute a percentage of their pay to the TSP, with limits set by the Internal Revenue Code. Beginning in fiscal year 2001, employees covered by FERS can contribute up to 11% of pay to the TSP, while those under CSRS can contribute up to 6%. These limits will increase by 1 percentage point each year until reaching 15% for FERS and 10% for CSRS in fiscal year 2005. By fiscal year 2006, the percentage-of-pay limits on TSP contributions will be eliminated, and employees will be subject to contribution limits under IRC \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 402(g). Employees covered by FERS and CSRS can contribute up to 11% and 6% of pay to the TSP, respectively, with limits increasing annually. By fiscal year 2006, contribution limits will be subject to IRC \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 402(g), with restrictions on federal agency monitoring of personal internet use. Federal agency limitations on collecting personally identifiable information from individuals accessing government or nongovernmental internet sites, with exceptions for aggregate data, voluntary submissions, law enforcement actions, and specified purposes. Several agencies funded through the Treasury and General Government appropriations bill are supporting the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. The total funding for the games was $137,680,000 (FY2001 enacted) and $59,956,000 (FY2001 supplemental, PL. 107-20), with additional federal costs indirectly assisting the Olympics and Paralympics. The FY2001 funding supplemental was signed by the President on July 24. The FY2001 funding supplemental of $59,956,000 was signed by the President on July 24 to provide operational and perimeter security at the 2002 Winter Olympics. The funding would reimburse Department of the Treasury's bureaus and other federal agencies for security support, including overtime, travel, lodging, and equipment costs. No breakdown of funding allocation within Treasury was provided. The FY2001 funding supplemental of $59,956,000 was signed by the President on July 24 to provide operational and perimeter security at the 2002 Winter Olympics. A recent General Accounting Office study stated that total Olympic support spending from all federal sources was $1.3 billion through FY1999. The FY2001 Treasury Department and General Government appropriations for Olympic support funding levels are broken down, with funding designated for counter terrorism and law enforcement activities. Agencies within the department responsible for Olympics support include U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Customs Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, IRS-Criminal Investigation, and Departmental Offices. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concern about the President's initial funding request for the 2002 Winter Olympics, specifically the lack of $60.6 million for Treasury law enforcement. However, the President later submitted a request for these funds in the fiscal year 2001 supplemental appropriations bill. The Committee included funding for these efforts in fiscal year 2002, as the funds would not be spent until then. The House amended the reported version of H.R. 2590 by removing funding for security at the Olympics. Funds previously allocated for Olympics security were reallocated to various programs including Customs, intellectual property rights enforcement, law enforcement training, HIDTAs, GSA construction, and civilian employee pay parity. The Senate's position on this matter was not discussed during appropriations provisions. The Senate and House did not allocate new funding for security at the Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. The House conference report on H.R. 2590 also did not include funding for the Olympics. An additional $20 million was added from the President's Emergency Response Fund for Olympic security. Congress did not include a provision to ease the U.S. embargo on Cuba in the final report on H.R. 2590. During floor action on H.R. 2590, the House debated amendments to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba. One amendment, offered by Representative Flake, was approved to prohibit funding for administering Treasury Department regulations restricting travel to Cuba. Another amendment, offered by Representative Rangel, was rejected. The House debated amendments to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba during floor action on H.R. 2590. Representative Rangel's amendment to prohibit Treasury Department funds for enforcing the economic embargo of Cuba narrowly failed by a vote of 201-227. The House provision on Cuba travel restrictions was not included in the final conference report. Senator Dorgan had intended to offer a similar amendment but decided against it to avoid delaying the bill's passage. Ultimately, the House-Senate conference report did not include any provisions on Cuba travel restrictions. The House-Senate conference report on the bill did not include the Cuba provision due to changed congressional priorities after the September 11 attacks. The Bush Administration threatened to veto the Treasury bill if it included the Cuba travel provision. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved allocations to various subcommittees, with the House agreeing to a budget resolution on March 28, 2001, and the Senate on April 6, 2001. On October 12, the House Budget Committee reported H.R. 3084 to adjust the government-wide discretionary funding cap for FY2002. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated discretionary funding levels to subcommittees. The House Committee on Appropriations announced a FY2002 discretionary spending budget authority allocation of $16,880 million for the Treasury subcommittee, later revised to $17,021 million. The House further revised allocations on September 20, providing a discretionary budget authority allocation of $17,022 million. The House Committee on Appropriations revised the discretionary budget authority allocation to $17,022 million on September 20, while the Treasury allocation remained unchanged. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved a discretionary budget authority of $16,972 million on June 21, which was later changed to $17,118 million on September 19. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended a total of $17,021,000,000 in discretionary resources for accounts in H.R. 2590. The conference agreement provides $17,069,000 in discretionary funding according to data received on October 26.
