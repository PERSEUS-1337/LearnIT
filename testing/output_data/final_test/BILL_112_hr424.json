    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Leave Ethanol Volumes at Existing Levels Act\" or the \"LEVEL Act.\" Repeal of expansion of renewable fuel program. The Clean Air Act is amended to define \"cellulosic biomass ethanol\" as ethanol derived from renewable sources such as energy crops, wood, plants, grasses, agricultural residues, fibers, animal wastes, and municipal solid waste. The term 'renewable fuel' refers to motor vehicle fuel derived from animal wastes, poultry fats, municipal solid waste, and other waste materials, including ethanol produced in facilities displacing 90% or more of fossil fuels normally used in ethanol production. The term 'renewable fuel' includes motor vehicle fuel produced from various organic materials like grains, oils, sugarcane, and natural gas from biogas sources. It is used to replace or reduce fossil fuel usage. The term 'renewable fuel' includes cellulosic biomass ethanol, waste-derived ethanol, biodiesel, and blending components derived from renewable fuel for motor vehicles. The Clean Air Act is amended to define a small refinery as one with a crude oil throughput not exceeding 75,000 barrels per day. Additionally, regulations and applicable volumes of renewable fuel under the renewable fuel program are modified. The Clean Air Act is amended to define a small refinery as one with a crude oil throughput not exceeding 75,000 barrels per day. The applicable volume for calendar years 2006 through 2012 shall be determined according to a specified table. The Clean Air Act defines a small refinery as one with a crude oil throughput not exceeding 75,000 barrels per day. The applicable volume of renewable fuel for calendar years 2006 to 2009 is as follows: 4.0, 4.7, 5.4, and 6.1 billion gallons respectively. The renewable fuel volume for small refineries increased from 4.0 billion gallons in 2006 to 6.1 billion gallons in 2009, reaching 7.5 billion gallons in 2012. The Clean Air Act is being amended to change the applicable percentages for gasoline and cellulosic biomass ethanol. The renewable fuel volume for small refineries has been increasing over the years. The Clean Air Act is being amended to change the renewable fuel volume requirements. Cellulosic biomass ethanol will now be considered equivalent to 2.5 gallons of renewable fuel. Amendments are made to the Credit Program and waivers under section 211(o) of the Act. The Clean Air Act is amended by removing certain subparagraphs and paragraphs, including those related to biomass-based diesel, periodic reviews, savings clause, and regulations. Additionally, provisions regarding environmental and resource conservation impacts are repealed. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended by repealing Section 210, which includes the effective date, savings provision, and transition rules. SEC. 3. HIGHER ETHANOL BLENDS. Prohibition of authorization for ethanol-gasoline blends with over 10% ethanol for general use in vehicles. EPA to conduct a study on the effects of such blends on consumer products. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of an ethanol-gasoline blend on engine performance, emissions, materials compatibility, and consumer safety of various gasoline-powered vehicles and engines. It includes onroad and nonroad vehicles, nonroad engines like lawn mowers, and other applicable devices. Insufficient data or information may exist for some vehicles and engines regarding these issues. The curr_chunk discusses the ability of gasoline distribution infrastructure to introduce an ethanol-gasoline blend into commerce without misfueling by consumers."
