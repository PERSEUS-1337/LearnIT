    "content": "The variational autoencoder (VAE) has been successful in modeling natural images but faces challenges with text due to its discrete nature. Traditional sequence VAEs can learn disentangled representations to some extent, but struggle to properly decode manipulated latent codes. To address this, the posterior mean is constrained to a learned probability simplex for manipulation within this space. Our proposed method addresses the latent vacancy problem in unsupervised learning of controllable text representations by constraining the posterior mean to a learned probability simplex. It outperforms unsupervised baselines and competes with supervised approaches in text style transfer. The framework can complete sentences naturally when switching latent factors, a capability not seen in previous methods. Controllable text generation aims to manipulate text attributes like sentiment and topic, but it is more challenging than image manipulation. Existing models for image manipulation cannot be directly applied to text. Controllable text generation involves manipulating attributes like sentiment and topic. Existing models rely on supervised learning, but labeling large training corpora is costly and pre-existing annotations may not align with goals. Sequence VAEs face obstacles in unsupervised controllable text generation. To address the latent vacancy problem in text generation, a proposed solution involves constraining the posterior mean to a learned probability simplex and only manipulating within this space. Regularizers are added to enforce an orthogonal structure and to fill the simplex without holes, aiming to improve the quality of generated text. The proposed solution for addressing the latent vacancy problem in text generation involves constraining the posterior mean to a learned probability simplex and filling it without holes. This approach successfully enables unsupervised learning of controllable representations for text and outperforms unsupervised baselines in text style transfer experiments. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a key component in this framework, optimizing a variational lower bound for text generation. The VAE is trained to optimize a variational lower bound for text generation by minimizing reconstruction error and regularizing towards a chosen prior distribution. Input text is processed by recurrent neural networks, with the decoding network learning to decode conditioned on sampled latent variables. The VAE is trained to optimize a variational lower bound for text generation by minimizing reconstruction error and regularizing towards a chosen prior distribution. In this section, we delve into the aggregated posterior latent space of sequence VAE trained on text, highlighting the importance of regions of low density in the latent space. The motivation to apply VAEs on text is to enable sentence generation conditioned on extrinsic features by controlling latent codes, a challenge that previous methods have not successfully addressed. Conducting exploratory experiments on unsupervised sentiment manipulation using VAE on the Yelp restaurant reviews dataset reveals the need for a new solution proposed in Section 4. The study uses VAE for unsupervised sentiment manipulation on the Yelp restaurant reviews dataset. A latent dimension achieves over 90% sentiment classification accuracy, indicating its effectiveness as a sentiment indicator. This contrasts with findings in large-scale language models. However, direct influence on the generative process observed in other models does not apply to VAE. Manipulating this latent dimension for sentiment modification is explored. The study explores sentiment manipulation using VAE on Yelp restaurant reviews dataset. The decoding network fails to generate desired outputs when modifying latent dimension 2, possibly due to lack of training on manipulated codes falling outside the aggregated posterior latent space. This leads to unpredictable behaviors during decoding. The study empirically estimates the density of sentiment-manipulated codes under the aggregated posterior distribution of a trained VAE. The estimated distribution is a mixture of Gaussian distribution, and the negative log-likelihood sharply rises when moving away from the mean, indicating a vacancy in the latent space. The study proposes a method to address the vacancy in the latent space by constraining the posterior to a learned simplex, reducing low density holes. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this approach. The experiments in Sec. 3 validate the vacancy in the aggregated posterior latent space. To address this issue, one approach is to better match the aggregated posterior with the prior. Previous methods have not been successful in unsupervised learning of controllable representation for text. Another solution is to enforce that the aggregated posterior has no vacant regions by mapping the Gaussian mean to a learned probability simplex. This constrained latent space allows for manipulation within the simplex. To address the vacancy in the latent space, a mapping function is added to the encoding network to ensure a well-filled simplex. The latent space is split into relevant and irrelevant factors, with separate regularization terms introduced to prevent degeneracy. This approach decomposes the posterior distribution into two parts, capturing dominant factors and local information separately. The latent space is split into relevant and irrelevant factors, with separate regularization terms introduced to prevent degeneracy. The KL divergence term in Eq. 1 splits into two separate KL terms with diagonal covariances. An MLP encoding network is used to parametrize z(1) with sentence representations as input, while a LSTM encoding network is used for z(2). The mean of the Gaussian posterior for z(1) is mapped to a constrained latent space with a specific structure. The mean of the Gaussian posterior for z(1) is constrained to a K-dimension probability simplex in R N using a mapping function \u03c0. The constrained posterior is parametrized by \u00b5 and log \u03c3 as a Gaussian distribution N (\u00b5, diag(\u03c3)). The proposed VAE faces posterior collapse without this mapping function. The VAE model faces posterior collapse when the latent code z is ignored during training. To prevent this, orthogonality is enforced in the basis vectors, introducing a regularization term to the objective function. This helps capture relevant factors from raw text without collapse. In practice, the regularization term quickly decreases to around 0, ensuring that the KL term never fully collapses with the structural constraint. Controlled text generation can be achieved by choosing a vertex or desired point in the probability simplex. The constrained posterior does not match the isotropic Gaussian prior, potentially leading to poor uncontrolled generation from the prior. This issue could be addressed by selecting or learning a better prior. To prevent the constrained latent space from being empty after training, the probability distribution over relevant factors should cover as much of the space as possible. A reconstruction error is introduced to push the distribution away from uniformity. The goal is to make the raw latent code similar to the structured latent code while being different from negative samples' latent codes. The structured reconstruction loss is formulated as a margin loss, and the final objective function is defined accordingly. Learning disentangled representations is crucial for better representation learning and can benefit (semi-)supervised learning, transfer, and few-shot learning. Various variations of VAEs have been proposed to improve disentanglement, particularly in image domains. Previous methods for controllable text generation have relied on annotated attributes or multiple text datasets with different styles. The proposed framework for text generation does not require labeled data and aims to discover and disentangle relevant factors in the corpus through an unsupervised method. The approach is compared to traditional VAEs and supervised methods, showcasing finer-grained style discovery and transition capabilities not previously explored in the literature. The proposed framework, CP-VAE, introduces a novel approach for text generation without the need for labeled data. It aims to discover and disentangle relevant factors in the corpus through an unsupervised method. Experimental setup involves splitting the 80D latent code into 16 and 64 dimensions for z (1) and z (2) respectively, using GloVe embeddings for sentence representations, and selecting basis vectors for positive and negative sentiments based on encoder output. The CP-VAE framework uses basis vectors v p and v n for positive and negative sentiments, respectively. By fixing z (1) as the chosen basis vector, sentiment manipulation is performed. Linear interpolation between v p and v n shows stable NLL under the aggregated posterior distribution. The effectiveness of CP-VAE in resolving latent vacancy issues is validated, leading to improvements in unsupervised sentiment manipulation. CP-VAE outperforms \u03b2-VAE in accuracy, BLEU, and GLEU metrics. Mode collapse in \u03b2-VAE leads to lower perplexity. Latent vacancy hinders effective manipulation of latent codes. Removing certain terms from the objective affects results. The study demonstrates the importance of terms L REG and L S-REC in CP-VAE. L REG prevents posterior collapse, while L S-REC helps in disentangled representation learning by improving coverage of the probability simplex. Without these terms, the model loses transferring ability. The comparison is made with adversarially trained models SE and CP-G(loVe) and CP-B(ert). In comparison to adversarially trained models SE, MD, and CA, as well as D&R and B-GST, evaluation protocols include four automatic metrics to measure transferring quality. Transferring ability is assessed using pre-trained CNN classifiers with high accuracies on Yelp and Amazon test sets. Content preservation is measured using BLEU scores, while fluency is evaluated by finetuning OpenAI GPT-2. The fine-tuned language models achieved perplexities of 26.6 and 34.5 on Yelp and Amazon test sets respectively. GLEU score was calculated using the implementation provided by Napoles et al. Accuracy, BLEU score, and perplexity do not correlate well with human evaluations. The proposed approaches showed similar scores on these metrics with human reference sentences, indicating reasonable sentence generation. The proposed approach, CP-VAE, outperforms adversarially trained models on GLEU and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art models. Samples generated from the models show that B-GST, the current state-of-the-art, is more sturdy and preferred over other models. The CP-VAE approach outperforms adversarially trained models on GLEU and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art models. Samples generated from the models show that B-GST is more sturdy and preferred over other models. The generated outputs are diverse and of reasonable quality, with more samples available in Appendix E.

CP-VAE is used to train on the description field with K=10, automatically discovering four topics. Results are compared to standard baselines for unsupervised topic modeling. The model transitions between topics fluently within the same sentence, detecting name entities and switching topics without restriction. In this work, the CP-VAE model is used to address latent vacancy in unsupervised learning of controllable representations in text modeling. The model transitions between topics fluently and possesses a filled constrained latent space, making the latent code robust to manipulation across different time steps. The proposed approach constrains the posterior within a learned probability simplex, achieving success in controlled text generation without supervision. The \u03b2-VAE used for experiments employs LSTM networks for encoding and decoding, with specific input and hidden sizes. Additional samples are provided in Appendix F due to space limitations. The decoding network in the \u03b2-VAE model has an input size of 256, hidden size of 1,024, and applies dropouts with probability 0.5 after the embedding and LSTM layers. The latent code dimension is 80, \u03b2 is 0.35, and batch size is 32. SGD with learning rate 1.0 is used for parameter updates. Latent codes are normalized by subtracting the mean, and sentiment is classified based on polarity. Samples of generated sentences from \u03b2-VAE on Yelp show transitions from positive to negative sentiments. The \u03b2-VAE model in the study attempted various manipulation strategies on the latent factors but none were effective in generating desired results. The best-performing strategy involved fixing the relevant factor to \u00b5 + 2\u03c3 and \u00b5 \u2212 2\u03c3. The study reports the best-performing strategy using Adam with learning rate 0.001 for encoding and SGD with learning rate 1.0 for decoding. A batch size of 32 is chosen, with dropouts applied after the embedding and LSTM layers. The model is trained until the reconstruction loss stabilizes. For the structured part, \u03b2-VAE setting \u03b2 is 0.2, while for the unstructured part, different strategies are used for each dataset. The study compares L VAE, KL, and generated outputs on Yelp and AG-News datasets using beam search with a beam size of 5. A Lagrange multiplier \u03bb is introduced to minimize equation 5, ensuring all p i are equal. The experimental setup uses the AG news dataset with four topic categories and compares the approach to LDA for unsupervised topic modeling. Our approach is compared to LDA and k-means for unsupervised topic modeling. We achieve comparable results to LDA and significantly outperform k-means in all categories, showing the effectiveness of our approach beyond just clustering on pre-trained sentence representations.
