    "content": "The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a civil rights act that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The ADA Amendments Act expanded the definition of disability to provide broader coverage. The ADA Amendments Act expanded the interpretation of when an impairment substantially limits a major life activity and requires this determination to be made without considering mitigating measures. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued proposed regulations under the Act on September 23, 2009. The ADA Amendments Act rejects the Supreme Court's interpretation of disability language, specifically regarding mitigating measures. In Sutton v. United Air Lines, the Court determined that a disability exists only when an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, not when it 'might,' 'could,' or 'would'. The ADA Amendments Act clarifies that a disability exists when an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, not when it 'might,' 'could,' or 'would' be limiting without mitigating measures. The Act also emphasizes that not all uncorrected conditions amount to disabilities under the statute's protection. In Murphy v. United Parcel Service, the Court ruled that an individual with high blood pressure not meeting safety standards does not necessarily indicate a disability. The Court stated that an employee is regarded as having a disability if the employer mistakenly believes their nonlimiting impairment substantially limits their abilities. In Kirkingburg v. Albertsons, the Court ruled that a trucker with monocular vision compensating for the impairment was not disabled. In Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Williams, Justice O'Connor clarified that impairments must substantially limit major life activities to be considered a disability. The Court emphasized that the term \"substantially limits\" excludes minor impairments and that \"major life activity\" refers to essential daily activities. The Court held that strict interpretation is necessary to determine disability status. Lower courts have applied Supreme Court decisions on disability in various factual situations. For example, in Orr v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., a pharmacist with diabetes was not considered disabled because medication and diet controlled the condition. Similarly, in McClure v. General Motors Corp., an electrician with muscular dystrophy was not considered disabled. The Eleventh Circuit examined major life activities in Littleton v. Wal-Mart, where a man with mental retardation was not hired for a position. The court found that a man with mental retardation was not hired for a position at Wal-Mart, questioning if thinking, communicating, and social interaction are 'major life activities' under the ADA. Bills were introduced to amend the ADA to broaden the definition of disability on its 17th anniversary. The House Committees on Judiciary, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Energy and Commerce held hearings on H.R. 3195, now known as the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. The bill was significantly different from the original versions, aiming to keep the term \"substantially limits\" and define it as \"materially restricts.\" The House passed the bill on June 25, 2008, by a vote of 402 to 17. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008, signed into law on September 25, 2008, redefined the term disability to include physical or mental impairments that substantially limit major life activities. Senator Harkin introduced S. 3406, which passed the Senate and House, making significant changes to the original bill. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 redefined disability to include impairments that substantially limit major life activities. P.L. 110-325 contains new rules for interpreting the definition of disability, favoring broad coverage and considering episodic impairments as disabilities. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 redefined disability to include impairments that substantially limit major life activities, without considering the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures. The Act aimed to broaden coverage and address limitations imposed by previous court decisions. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 rejected previous court decisions on defining disability, reinstating broad protection under the ADA. Mitigating measures are no longer considered in determining if an impairment substantially limits a major life activity. The Act specifically rejects the substantially limits requirements of Toyota and EEOC regulations, stating that an impairment does not need to significantly restrict an individual. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 clarified that an impairment does not need to significantly restrict an individual from performing a major life activity to be considered a disability. The Senate rejected using the term \"materially restricts\" to define \"substantially limits,\" as it could lead to inconsistent interpretations. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 clarified that an impairment does not need to significantly restrict an individual from performing a major life activity to be considered a disability. The House debate indicated that the term \"materially restricts\" was not adopted, but the intent was the same as the Senate language. The Act lists examples of major life activities and includes the operation of a major bodily function. The House Judiciary Committee report emphasized the importance of considering the impact of an impairment on the operation of major bodily functions. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 clarified that an impairment does not need to significantly restrict an individual from performing a major life activity to be considered a disability. Judicial decisions have found that certain bodily functions were not covered by the definition of disability, such as in Furnish v. SVI Sys., Inc. where liver function was deemed not \"integral to one's daily existence.\" The House debate included a colloquy on the meaning of \"substantially limits\" in learning, reading, writing, thinking, or speaking, emphasizing that academic performance does not exclude someone from being considered disabled. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 clarified that an impairment does not need to significantly restrict an individual from performing a major life activity to be considered a disability. Representative Stark emphasized that specific learning disabilities, like dyslexia, substantially limit individuals in reading or learning. The proposed legislation aims to broaden the definition of disability and not consider the use of mitigating measures. The EEOC's regulations also highlight that individuals with learning disabilities who struggle with reading, learning, thinking, or concentrating are considered disabled. Individuals with disabilities, regardless of academic success, may still face challenges in concentrating or thinking. The EEOC proposed regulations address the determination of disability, stating that an impairment substantially limits working if it affects an individual's ability to perform or qualify for a specific job. This interpretation is meant to be broadly construed. The EEOC's interpretation of the definition of disability under the ADA includes individuals who are \"regarded as having such an impairment.\" This covers actions taken against individuals due to perceived physical or mental impairments, excluding transitory and minor impairments lasting six months or less. The ADA Amendments Act also provides rules for covered entities under Titles I and II. Title V of the ADA states that covered entities do not have to provide reasonable accommodations to individuals solely regarded as disabled. The Senate and House expressed confidence that individuals needing accommodations will still receive them. Individuals who need accommodations will receive them under the ADA Amendments Act, which clarified that qualification standards, tests, or selection criteria can be challenged if they result in disqualification based on an impairment. The Act aligns with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and emphasizes the need for accommodations for individuals with disabilities. The ADA Amendments Act aligns with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by prohibiting discrimination against qualified individuals on the basis of disability. It emphasizes the critical inquiry of whether a qualified person has been discriminated against due to disability and restricts the use of qualification standards based on uncorrected vision unless job-related and necessary for business. The ADA Amendments Act clarifies that it does not change eligibility standards for benefits under state workers' compensation laws or disability benefit programs. It also emphasizes the requirement for reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, unless it fundamentally alters the nature of the goods or services provided. This provision was added to ensure that academic institutions' obligations under the ADA remain unchanged. The ADA Amendments Act clarifies that it does not change eligibility standards for benefits under state workers' compensation laws or disability benefit programs. It emphasizes the requirement for reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, unless it fundamentally alters the nature of the goods or services provided. The Managers' Statement notes that a provision regarding reverse discrimination claims is unrelated to the legislation's purpose and should not impact the definition of disability. The Senate Statement of Managers clarifies that a person without a disability cannot bring a discrimination claim on the basis of disability. The rules of construction state that entities covered under Titles I, II, or III of the ADA are not required to provide reasonable accommodations to individuals who are only considered disabled under the \"regarded as\" prong. The Supreme Court in Sutton questioned the authority of regulatory agencies to define disability in the ADA, as the ADA itself does not grant any agency the power to interpret the definition of disability. The ADA Amendments Act specifically addresses this issue. The ADA Amendments Act grants regulatory authority to issue regulations implementing definitions of disability, ensuring uniformity with the Rehabilitation Act. The Senate emphasizes the importance of consistent standards for covered entities to protect the civil rights of individuals with disabilities. The Secretary of Education is expected to issue new regulations related to the definition of disability. The ADA Amendments Act, effective January 1, 2009, aligns disability definitions with the Rehabilitation Act. Judicial decisions post-ADAAA focus on pre-ADAAA events, with courts generally applying statutes enacted before the events in question. However, Jenkins v. National Board of Medical Examiners involved accommodations under the ADA. In Jenkins v. National Board of Medical Examiners, the plaintiff sought accommodations on the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination and the Sixth Circuit found that the ADAAA applied. The court reasoned that since the plaintiff was seeking prospective relief, there was no injustice to the defendant. The case was remanded for consideration without providing guidance on the substantive interpretation of the ADAAA. In Hoffman v. Carefirst of Fort Wayne, Inc., the district court addressed whether an individual in remission from cancer qualifies as a person with a disability under the ADA Amendments Act. The court found that cancer in remission qualifies as a disability under the ADA Amendments Act, citing the EEOC's regulations. More cases involving the new definition of disability are expected, with recent suits involving individuals with diabetes, cancer, and severe conditions. The court found that cancer in remission qualifies as a disability under the ADA Amendments Act, with recent cases involving individuals with diabetes, cancer, and severe arthritis."
