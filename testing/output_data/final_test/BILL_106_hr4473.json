    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Computers in Our Community Act\". The Congress finds a growing digital divide based on income and race, with higher-income households more likely to have internet access. Black and Hispanic households have less access compared to white households. The digital divide is a pressing issue that will harm the economy and society without immediate action. The e-rate program helps schools and libraries access discounted telecommunications services but is insufficient due to high demand for funding. Schools in high-poverty areas have fewer computers with internet access compared to schools in low-poverty areas. The computer industry is rapidly growing with a shortage of IT workers. All workers will need to be computer literate, so classrooms must have effective computer usage for teaching. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act is amended to include a new part focused on advancing computer skills for American workers and improving educational performance through computer technology. This includes establishing programs and grant programs for state educational agencies. The Secretary will make grants to State educational agencies for allocation among local educational agencies using 85 percent of the amount available under section 137. State allocations are based on the ratio of total allocations under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Each participating State educational agency allocates funds to local educational agencies based on the total amount allocated under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 for the fiscal year. To qualify, a State educational agency must submit a technology plan to the Secretary. The technology plan must identify student-to-computer ratios and Internet connectivity in school districts, comply with criteria set by the Secretary to ensure proper use of funds for advancing technology in schools, and improve student computer skills and educational performance. Local educational agencies must meet requirements to qualify for participation. To qualify as a participating local educational agency, a technology plan must be created or modified and submitted to the State educational agency to prove meeting the State's goals. Funds can be used for purchasing computers, electrical wiring for connectivity, and hiring technological assistants for training and maintenance. Funds can be used to hire technological assistants for training and maintenance in schools, with specific ratios for elementary, middle, and high schools. SEC. 133.

Grants under SEC. 134 aim to improve computer and internet access at community centers, libraries, and nonprofit organizations. Recipients must establish programs for this purpose and grants are awarded for 3 years. Priority is given to applications that show sustainability without Federal funding and target areas with low access to technology. To apply for a grant under SEC. 134, an applicant must submit a program description, demonstrate the need for technology access in the area, and specify the type of technology to be provided. \"SEC. 135.
