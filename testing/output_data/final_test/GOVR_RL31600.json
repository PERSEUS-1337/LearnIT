    "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Rasul v. Bush clarified that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions from Guantanamo Bay detainees. This decision established a role for federal courts in reviewing the validity of military commissions under President Bush's Military Order. Congress later passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, limiting federal court jurisdiction over habeas claims and creating jurisdiction for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to hear appeals of military commission decisions. The Supreme Court overturned a decision by the D.C. Circuit regarding military commissions, stating that they must follow procedural rules similar to courts-martial proceedings. Military commissions are set up by military commanders to try persons accused of offenses during war, different from military courts-martial for U.S. service members. Service members charged with war crimes can be tried in courts-martial, military commissions, or federal court. Military commissions are available to try certain persons for war crimes, applying international law without recourse to domestic criminal statutes. The President's Military Order establishing military commissions for suspected terrorists has sparked intense debate over potential violations of constitutional and international rights. The Military Order establishing military commissions for suspected terrorists has raised concerns about violating constitutional and international rights. The procedural rules released in March 2002 were seen as an improvement, but some argue they still lack necessary checks and balances. Critics also raised issues with restrictions on civilian attorneys and called for further modifications to the rules. The Pentagon released ten \"Military Commission Instructions\" to elaborate on procedural rules for military tribunals, addressing concerns about indefinite detention without charge and rigged proceedings. The rules, set forth in Military Commission Order No. 1, outline elements of crimes, guidelines for civilian attorneys, and provide clarity on the process. In August 2005, DOD amended M.C.O. No. 1 to make the presiding officer function more like a judge and other panel members like a jury. The presiding officer determines most questions of law, while panel members make factual findings and decide on the sentence. Other provisions clarify the accused's privilege to be present except to protect classified information. President Bush determined that twenty detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay are subject to military commissions. Six detainees eligible in 2003, including UK and Australian citizens, will not face the death penalty. Rules for trials of Australian detainees were modified, and UK citizens will be returned. The Administration agreed to return UK citizens, including two eligible for trial by military commission, to Great Britain. David Hicks, an Australian citizen, has been charged with conspiracy to commit war crimes. Salim Ahmed Hamdan of Yemen, accused of providing security for Osama bin Laden, challenged the validity of military commissions. Salim Ahmed Hamdan challenged the lawfulness of military commissions for alleged war crimes, arguing for prisoner of war status under the Geneva Conventions. U.S. District Judge Robertson ruled in his favor, stating the President lacked authority to create tribunals outside existing laws, and that the Geneva Conventions applied to all persons detained in Afghanistan. Judge Robertson ruled that Hamdan was entitled to be treated as a prisoner of war until his status was determined otherwise by a competent tribunal, in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. He found no congressional authority for Hamdan's trial under the DOD's rules for military commissions, stating they were inconsistent with the UCMJ. The government appealed the district court's decision regarding Hamdan's rights in military commission proceedings. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Geneva Conventions are not enforceable in court, Hamdan is not entitled to their protections, and the military commission is a competent tribunal for him to challenge his case. The appellate court found that the military commission is a competent tribunal for Hamdan to challenge his non-POW status, citing authority from the Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) and UCMJ arts. 21 and 36. The court clarified that military commission rules only need to be consistent with UCMJ articles specific to military commissions, not procedural rules for courts-martial. The issue of procedural rules did not affect jurisdiction and was left unresolved at the interlocutory stage. The court found it unnecessary to resolve the issue at the interlocutory stage regarding the Geneva Conventions. The D.C. Circuit referenced a footnote from the World War II Eisentrager opinion expressing doubt about granting relief based directly on the 1929 Geneva Convention. The agreement states that responsibility for enforcing rights lies with political and military authorities, with rights of alien enemies vindicated through protests and intervention of protecting powers. Judge Williams concurred with the government's view on the conflict with Al Qaeda but interpreted Common Article 3 to apply to any conflict with a non-state actor. Supreme Court nominee John G. Roberts also agreed. The Supreme Court reversed the decision, rejecting the government's argument that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 stripped the Court of jurisdiction over habeas corpus challenges by Guantanamo detainees. The Supreme Court rejected the government's argument that the petitioner had no rights under the Geneva Conventions that could be adjudicated in federal court. Congress incorporating the \"law of war\" into UCMJ art. 21 brought the Geneva Conventions within the scope of law to be applied by courts. Justice Scalia, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito, dissented, arguing that the DTA should preclude the Court's review. The Supreme Court ruled that even members of al Qaeda are entitled to protections under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, including a fair trial by a regularly constituted court. The military commissions established under M.C.O. No. 1 were found to not meet these criteria. The military commissions under M.C.O. No. 1 were deemed not \"regularly constituted\" by the Court as they deviate too far from the rules of courts-martial without a satisfactory explanation. The Court also disagreed with the government's position that Congress had authorized the commissions through the Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) or the DTA. The DTA does not specifically authorize military commissions but acknowledges a general Presidential authority to convene them. The UCMJ limits military commissions to trials of offenders and offenses consigned to such tribunals by statute or the law of war. Article 36 authorizes the President to prescribe rules for pretrial, trial, and post-trial procedures, applying principles of law and rules of evidence recognized in criminal cases in US district courts. The President has the authority to prescribe rules for military commissions, which must be uniform to the extent practicable. The Court ruled that the President has discretion to determine which federal court rules may not be applied due to impracticability, but must adhere to the uniformity requirement. The Court found that the President has discretion to determine rules for military commissions, but must adhere to the uniformity requirement unless impracticable. The government failed to show that courts-martial rules are impracticable for use in military commissions, and some rules in Military Commission Order No. 1 deviated substantially from courts-martial procedures. The Hamdan Court found that Military Commission Order No. 1 deviated substantially from courts-martial procedures, leading to insufficient standards for evidence admissibility and lack of independence in the review process. The rules also raised concerns about safeguarding sensitive government information during the military commission proceedings. The Hamdan Court found issues with Military Commission Order No. 1, leading to concerns about evidence admissibility and lack of independence in the review process. Other military orders require explicit congressional approval to remain valid, such as M.C.O. No. 3 for monitoring detainee communications. Various orders designate appointing officials and provide guidance for interpretation and issuance of new instructions. The President's Military Commission Order No. 1 outlines the authority of the Appointing Authority, General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and Presiding Officer of a military commission to take appropriate action against participants who fail to comply with instructions. Critics argue that the order's jurisdiction is overly broad and could extend to non-citizens unrelated to Al Qaeda or the 9/11 attacks. The lack of defined \"appropriate action\" and statutory authority raises concerns about the President's constitutional and statutory authority to establish military tribunals. The President's Military Commission Order No. 1 allows for the detention and trial of non-citizens involved in international terrorism. It clarifies that military commissions can try aliens designated by the President for violations of the law of war and other offenses. This order raises concerns about the President's authority to establish military tribunals. The President's Military Commission Order No. 1 allows for the detention and trial of non-citizens involved in international terrorism, including offenses triable by military commissions. The jurisdiction of military commissions is vague, with the Hamdan decision suggesting limitations on charges like \"conspiracy.\" The issue of redefining criminal statutes as \"war crimes\" for military trial remains unresolved. Military tribunals can be used to try offenders or offenses designated by statute or the law of war, including aiding the enemy and spying. They can also try civilians in occupied territory for ordinary crimes and for committing belligerent acts during war. These acts are not necessarily offenses against the law of war but are unprivileged under it. Military commissions have jurisdiction for belligerent offenses, not civilians unaffiliated with a state. Unprivileged combatants may be prosecuted under domestic law for belligerent acts, but not directly under international law of war. Offenders entitled to POW status under the Third Geneva Convention are subject to international law. Offenders entitled to POW status under the Third Geneva Convention are entitled to be tried by court-martial and may not be tried by a military commission offering fewer safeguards. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions protects non-POWs from sentences without a fair trial. M.C.I. No. 2 outlines crimes subject to military commission jurisdiction, with a draft version open for public comment. The final version of M.C.I. No. 2 clarifies the burden of proof on the prosecution, adds new war crimes, and distinguishes between war crimes and other offenses triable by military commission. It outlines crimes derived from the law of war without referencing international treaties, serving as an illustrative list of punishable acts. \"Aiding the enemy\" and \"spying\" are included, but not defined with statutory authority, similar to terrorism. The draft version of M.C.I. No. 2 clarifies the burden of proof on the prosecution and outlines crimes derived from the law of war without referencing international treaties. It suggests that offenses triable by military commissions could cover belligerent acts by unlawful combatants, even if not technically war crimes. The final version of M.C.I. No.2 clarified that Taliban fighters could not be charged with \"terrorism\" in connection with combat activities, but could still face charges under DOD rules. Under DOD rules, a fighter involved in combat could be charged with murder or destruction of property by an unprivileged belligerent if they did not have combatant immunity. The definition of \"lawful combatant\" is unclear, making it unlikely for combat immunity to be a defense for detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Other defenses like self-defense or duress may be available, but are presumed not to apply without evidence. The law of war traditionally applies within armed conflicts between belligerents, not in neutral territories or outside the zone of battle. The boundaries of the war on terrorism are unclear, leading to criticism of military commissions' jurisdiction exceeding customary law. The military commissions' jurisdiction is criticized for exceeding customary law, with a focus on the need for ample precedent or statutory definition to withstand court scrutiny. The conduct in question must be associated with armed conflict, requiring a nexus between the conduct and armed hostilities, which is broader than the traditional definition of war or armed conflict. Some commentators argue that expanding the definition of \"armed conflict\" for military commissions goes beyond customary law. The Supreme Court has shown a willingness to address the scope of the \"Global War on Terrorism\" rather than deferring to the President's interpretation. The definition of \"Enemy\" in M.C.I. No. 2 raises similar concerns, including entities engaged in armed conflicts or preparing to attack the United States. Some argue that expanding the definition of \"enemy\" for military commissions may subject international criminals to military jurisdiction. The distinction between war crimes and common crimes may be contentious during proceedings. Military commissions consist of a panel of military officers and alternate members deemed competent by the Secretary of Defense. The rules for military commissions allow for the appointment of temporary officers during a national emergency. The presiding officer, typically a judge advocate, has the authority to make evidentiary decisions, close proceedings, and discipline violators of commission rules. The presiding officer of military commissions has the power to include attorneys, witnesses, and punish contempt with fines or confinement. However, there are concerns about command influence and lack of specific safeguards in the rules. The military commission rules lack specific safeguards for impartiality, giving the President control over proceedings, including selecting panel members, prosecution, defense counsel, and review panel members. All commission personnel are supervised by the Secretary of Defense, with the Chief Prosecutor and Chief Defense Counsel originally reporting to the DOD General Counsel. The military commission rules lack impartiality safeguards, with the President controlling proceedings and selecting panel members, prosecution, and defense counsel. Initially, the Chief Prosecutor and Chief Defense Counsel reported to the DOD General Counsel, raising concerns about independence. Amendments were made so that the Chief Prosecutor now reports to the Legal Advisor to the Appointing Authority, but Justice Kennedy highlighted the concentration of authority in the Appointing Authority as a departure from Congress's structural safeguards in the military justice system. The procedural rules for military commissions under M.C.O. No. 1 provide some safeguards similar to general courts-martial but do not specifically adopt UCMJ procedures. The Military Commission Order (M.C.O.) outlines procedures exclusively for military commissions, excluding other laws like the UCMJ. It does not explicitly acknowledge the rights of the accused, with procedural safeguards listed in section 5. The accused must be informed of charges in advance and is presumed innocent until proven guilty by two-thirds of the commission. There is limited opportunity for the accused to challenge rules or seek redress for breaches. The accused, presumed innocent until proven guilty by two-thirds of the commission, has the right not to testify at trial, present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and be present at all stages of the proceeding. The trials are conducted openly unless closed for security reasons or to protect classified information. DOD allows press attendance at trials, but proceedings can be closed for various reasons. Counsel must seek permission to speak to the press, and the openness of military commission trials may be challenged due to public interest. The First Amendment right of public access extends to trials by court-martial, but is not absolute. Trials may be closed only where specific criteria are met, and procedures allowing exclusion of the press and public without meeting these requirements may implicate First Amendment rights. The First Amendment does not require the government to give the press special access to information not available to the public. Media access to military commission proceedings may be restricted for operational reasons, even if the accused lack certain trial rights. Military defense counsel is provided at no cost, with the option to request another JAG officer. The accused is provided with defense counsel at no cost, with the option to request another JAG officer. They cannot refuse counsel in favor of self-representation. Civilian attorneys can be hired at the accused's expense but assigned defense counsel must be present at all times. Critics argue that the rules may discourage civilian lawyer participation. The participation of civilian lawyers in military commissions is subject to strict qualifications. Initially, restrictions limited communication and case preparation, but later revisions allowed for collaboration with individuals possessing relevant knowledge. Civilian attorneys must prioritize their military commission representation and meet specific criteria for admission. The civilian attorney representing detainees before a military commission must be a U.S. citizen with a SECRET clearance and no disciplinary record. They must comply with all court rules and may not have guaranteed access to closed hearings or protected information. The requirement for monitored communications with the client has been modified. Some argue that the absence of attorney-client privilege could hinder communication between the attorney and the accused. The absence of attorney-client privilege could impede communications between civilian attorneys and military counsel, potentially affecting counsel effectiveness. Defense counsel must inform military counsel of information related to pending crimes that could impact national security. The criteria for identifying a \"significant impairment of national security\" is not provided in M.C.I. No. 5. All defense counsel are supervised by the Office of the Chief Defense Counsel to manage personnel and resources and prevent conflicts of interest. The Appointing Authority can revoke an attorney's eligibility to appear before any commission. Some attorney groups have opposed certain provisions. Some attorney groups oppose restrictions on civilian defense counsel appearing before military tribunals. The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers deems it unethical for lawyers to represent clients under current rules. The American Bar Association urges the Pentagon to relax communication monitoring rules. The National Institute of Military Justice shares concerns about commission rules. The accused has the right to view evidence presented by the Prosecution, including exculpatory evidence, in military tribunals. They are also entitled to documents related to the charges, evidence that negates guilt, and the ability to obtain witnesses and documents as determined by the Presiding Officer. The Appointing Authority must provide necessary resources for a fair trial, including access to other detainees for mitigating or exculpatory information. Access to potential witnesses for the accused or defense counsel may be hindered by restrictions on communication agreements that could compromise confidentiality. The need for secrecy overrides the access to information, with the presiding officer having the authority to restrict or summarize classified information. The presiding officer has the authority to restrict or summarize classified information, and may use various methods to protect witnesses during proceedings. Sworn or unsworn statements can be considered as evidence, even without meeting the requirements for authentication of depositions. The UCMJ articles 49 and 50 may apply to military commissions regarding hearsay rules, but the Supreme Court has not extended similar provisions to military commissions trying enemy combatants. The district court in Hamdan found the use of secret evidence and exclusion of the accused from hearings troubling, stating that such deviation from the confrontation clause is not acceptable in any American court. The right to trial 'in one's presence' is established in international humanitarian and human rights law. In court-martial proceedings, the accused has the right to be present except during deliberations. Evidence must have \"probative value to a reasonable person\" for admissibility, differing from the Military Rules of Evidence. This standard may allow for the consideration of rumors or hearsay, raising concerns about reliability and fairness in criminal trials. Defendants in military commissions may not have the right to exclude evidence based on reliability or fairness concerns. In 2006, DOD prohibited the use of statements obtained through torture. The accused must be provided with evidence for sentencing, and can present evidence and make a statement during proceedings. However, this right differs from the ability to make an unsworn statement in regular courts-martial. Possible penalties in military commissions include execution, life imprisonment, fines, or other lawful punishments. Detention as an \"enemy combatant\" does not count towards serving a sentence. Plea agreement sentences are binding, unlike in regular courts-martial. The death penalty can only be imposed under certain conditions. The death penalty in military commissions requires a unanimous vote of the Commission. The Pentagon announced it will not seek the death penalty in current cases. Criticisms include lack of appeal for the accused and potential for verdict changes by the Secretary of Defense. M.C.O. No.1 addresses some of these issues. The Bush Administration plans to commission four individuals to serve on the Military Commission Review Panels, including Griffin Bell, Edward Biester, William T. Coleman Jr., and Chief Justice Frank Williams. The accused have no opportunity to appeal a conviction in the ordinary sense, but the review panel may review written submissions from the prosecution and defense. The review panel may review written submissions from the prosecution and defense, and if a material error of law is found, the case is returned to the Appointing Authority for further proceedings. Charges may be dismissed if deemed necessary, and the case may be forwarded to the Secretary of Defense for a final decision. The M.C.O. does not specify the consequences of a \"disapproved\" finding, leaving uncertainty about whether it is vacated and reheard. The UCMJ prohibits rehearings or government appeals of Not Guilty verdicts unless there is a material error of law that prejudices the accused. The M.C.O. lacks explicit prohibitions but defines \"Material Error of Law\" to exclude minor deviations that would not impact the commission's outcome. The M.C.O. does not provide a route for convicted individuals to appeal to an independent authority. They are not allowed to seek remedies in federal or state courts, foreign courts, or international tribunals. However, a defendant can file a habeas corpus petition in federal court to challenge the military commission's jurisdiction. Once a commission's finding becomes final, the accused cannot be retried for the same charge by any military commission. Jeopardy does not attach until the final verdict is approved by the President or Secretary of Defense. If a charge is dismissed or there is a finding of Not Guilty, the trial is considered complete for jeopardy purposes. The accused cannot be retried for the same charge without their consent. If a finding of Guilty is changed, the Secretary of Defense or President can disapprove it, leading to further proceedings. Double jeopardy concerns may arise if a Not Guilty finding is sent back for rehearing. The lack of specific charges in M.C.O. No. 1 could allow for new trials under different descriptions. M.C.I. No. 2 outlines crimes triable by commissions but new crimes can be added. Transfer to another authority is also possible under the order. The M.O. allows for transfer of individuals to other governmental authorities for trial, potentially raising double jeopardy concerns if tried by both military commission and federal court for the same crime. The President can determine an individual's subject to the M.O., requiring state or federal authorities to turn over the accused to military authorities. The Bush Administration proposed the \"Military Commissions Act of 2006\" to Congress, similar to Senator Frist's \"Bringing Terrorists to Justice Act of 2006.\" The Senate Armed Services Committee approved a bill, \"Military Commissions Act of 2006,\" differing on jurisdiction and evidence rules. The House Armed Services Committee also approved H.R. 6054. The House Armed Services Committee approved H.R. 6054, known as the \"Military Commissions Act of 2006,\" which aligns with the Administration's proposal. Senator McConnell introduced S. 3930, also titled the \"Military Commissions Act of 2006,\" after reaching an agreement with the White House on certain provisions. These bills authorize trials of \"alien unlawful combatants\" by military commissions for specific crimes and grant the accused certain rights. They would add a new chapter 47a to the UCMJ in title 10, U.S. Code, expanding the President's authority to establish military commissions. The bills proposed amend article 36, UCMJ to exclude military commissions from complying with federal district court procedural rules. S. 3901 and S. 3930 clarify that UCMJ does not apply to military commissions, allowing exceptions in procedures and rules of evidence as needed for unique circumstances. The bills propose amendments to exclude military commissions from federal district court procedural rules and clarify that the UCMJ does not apply to military commissions, allowing exceptions in procedures and rules of evidence as needed for unique circumstances. The bills also declare that military commissions are regularly constituted, providing necessary judicial guarantees recognized by civilized peoples under common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, but state that the Geneva Conventions cannot be invoked as a source of rights in any U.S. court. The bills propose amendments to exclude military commissions from federal district court procedural rules and clarify that the UCMJ does not apply to military commissions. They define \"unlawful enemy combatant\" as an individual engaged in hostilities against the United States. The jurisdiction of military commissions would extend to any alien unlawful enemy combatant engaged in hostilities against the United States. The bills propose amendments to exclude military commissions from federal district court procedural rules and clarify that the UCMJ does not apply to military commissions. They define \"unlawful enemy combatant\" as an individual engaged in hostilities against the United States. Lawful combatants, such as prisoners of war, are excluded from the jurisdiction of military commissions. H.R. 6054 also excludes protected persons within the meaning of the Fourth Geneva Convention from the jurisdiction of military commissions. If the armed conflict is non-international in nature, then no person can qualify for POW status under the third Geneva Convention or \"protected person\" status within the meaning of article 4 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. All persons in captivity would be entitled to protected status within the meaning of Common Article 3. None of the bills defines \"hostilities\" or explains. The bills do not define \"hostilities\" or explain what conduct supports hostilities. It is unclear if the constitutional principle applies to aliens detained overseas, but the bills do not exempt permanent resident aliens captured in the US from military jurisdiction. Aliens in the US are entitled to the same protections in criminal trials as US citizens. The bills propose detailed lists of crimes for trial by military commission, with implications for constitutional questions regarding unlawful belligerents. Offenses must be committed in the context of armed conflict, and the bills claim to codify traditional military commission offenses without creating retroactively punishable crimes. In the context of an international armed conflict, some crimes may be considered new, such as conspiracy and \"murder in violation of the law of war.\" It is unclear if the same principles apply in non-international armed conflicts, where combatant immunity does not apply. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has found that war crimes in non-international armed conflicts include various offenses. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has found that war crimes in non-international armed conflicts include murder of civilians, but not killing of combatants. Bills allow more permissive rules for evidence admission, including hearsay evidence under S. 3901, with specific notification requirements and judge's discretion on admissibility. The bills S. 3901, S. 3930, H.R. 6054, S. 3886, and S. 3861 propose more permissive rules for evidence admission in non-international armed conflicts, allowing hearsay evidence unless deemed unreliable or lacking probative value. They also prohibit the use of statements obtained through torture. The bills prohibit the use of statements obtained through torture as evidence in a trial, except as proof of torture against a person accused of committing torture. S. 3901 also excludes statements elicited through cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, and statements obtained through coercive methods not rising to the level of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment as defined in the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) if deemed reliable and probative by the military judge. S. 3930 provides a different standard for the admissibility of statements obtained through coercion that does not amount to torture depending on whether the statement was obtained prior to or after the enactment of the DTA. The bills prohibit the use of statements obtained through torture as evidence in a trial, except as proof of torture against a person accused of committing torture. Statements elicited through cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, and coercive methods not rising to that level, may be admissible if deemed reliable and probative by the military judge. The admissibility of statements obtained through coercion depends on whether they were obtained before or after the enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA). The bills under discussion include provisions for protecting classified information during proceedings, allowing for redacted documents or unclassified summaries to be used. S. 3901 mirrors Military Rule of Evidence 505 for courts-martial, ensuring classified information is privileged from disclosure for national security reasons. The military judge may authorize the use of declassified evidence if certified by the original classification authority or agency head. The military judge may authorize the deletion or substitution of classified information in documents provided to the accused, ensuring privilege and confidentiality. S. 3901 guarantees the accused the right to examine and respond to all evidence considered by the military commission. S. 3930 includes provisions for the use of classified evidence at trial and allows the government to claim privilege over classified information without requiring declassification. The military judge may authorize deletion or substitution of classified information to ensure confidentiality. The military judge may authorize the deletion or substitution of classified information to protect confidential sources, methods, or activities by which the United States acquired evidence. The defense and commission members may view an unclassified summary of the sources, methods, or activities, as long as it is consistent with national security. The military judge can exclude the accused from parts of the trial to prevent disclosure of classified information, but only if it is necessary for national security, physical safety, or to prevent disruption. This exclusion must be limited and not deprive the accused of a fair trial. The bills provide defense counsel with the opportunity to obtain witnesses and evidence, including evidence in the possession of the United States. The military commission can compel witnesses to appear, and the military judge may authorize discovery of classified information in a redacted or summary form for the accused. The trial counsel must disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense, but classified information is only available to the accused in a redacted or summary form. The accused can access classified information in a redacted or summary form if it doesn't compromise national security interests. Defense counsel can receive this information if they have the appropriate security clearance. However, they cannot share this information with the accused, potentially hindering the defense's ability to refute evidence. The military judge may authorize substitutions for classified information. The military judge may authorize substitutions for classified information, allowing for the provision of exculpatory information only. Defense counsel and the accused are not permitted to view classified information directly, but may be allowed to view an unclassified summary. Proposed legislation also introduces an appellate mechanism. Proposed legislation introduces an appellate mechanism for limited review of Combatant Status Review Tribunal determinations and final decisions of military commissions. Appeals would be heard in the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, allowing for review of final decisions and interlocutory appeals related to military commission rulings. Defense would not have the opportunity for interlocutory appeals in unfavorable rulings. Proposed legislation introduces an appellate mechanism for limited review of Combatant Status Review Tribunal determinations and final decisions of military commissions. Appeals would be heard in the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, allowing for review of final decisions and interlocutory appeals related to military commission rulings. The government would not be permitted to appeal any ruling of a military commission that amounts to a finding of not guilty of any charge or specification. The scope of review would be limited to matters of law, and decisions could only be overturned if an error of law \"materially prejudices the substantial rights of the accused.\" Proposed legislation would establish the Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR) to handle appeals, with appellate military judges meeting specific qualifications. The CMCR approves final decisions of military commissions, allowing for appeals to the D.C. Circuit. Government can appeal adverse rulings to CMCR and then to D.C. Circuit. Accused cannot appeal interlocutory rulings. Comparison of military tribunals and general courts-martial procedures provided. The curr_chunk discusses the legal authorities and procedural safeguards for establishing military tribunals, comparing them to general courts-martial procedures. It also compares the proposed legislation to safeguards in federal court and international military tribunals."
