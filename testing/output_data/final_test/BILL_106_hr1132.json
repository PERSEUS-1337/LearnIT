    "content": "The \"Mammogram Availability Act of 1999\" recognizes breast cancer as a leading cause of death for women aged 40-49 in the US. It recommends that women in this age group should decide, with their healthcare provider, whether to undergo screening mammography. If they choose to do so, the costs should be covered by third-party payers or health maintenance organizations. SEC. 2. COVERAGE OF ANNUAL SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY UNDER GROUP HEALTH PLANS. This section introduces standards relating to benefits for screening mammography under the Public Health Service Act. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must provide coverage for annual screening mammography for women 40 years and older, with terms not less favorable than diagnostic mammography. Diagnostic mammography is defined as a medically necessary radiologic procedure for diagnosing breast cancer. The term 'screening mammography' refers to a radiologic procedure for early detection of breast cancer, including a physician's interpretation of the results. Group health plans and health insurance issuers are prohibited from denying coverage for annual screening mammography based on medical necessity or lack of referral, consent, or recommendation by a healthcare provider. Women must be provided with eligibility for enrollment or renewal of coverage under these terms. The section prohibits actions such as providing monetary incentives to women to accept less coverage, penalizing providers for following the rules, or giving incentives to providers to act against the regulations. The section mandates annual screening mammography for women in group health plans, with limitations on cost-sharing for diagnostic mammography. Women aged 40-49 should consult healthcare providers before screening mammography, but approval is not required. Group health plans must comply with notice requirements. Reimbursement negotiations for care provided are allowed. The requirements of this section do not apply to health insurance coverage in states with laws regulating coverage for annual mammography for women 40 and older. Section 2723(c) of the Act is amended to include sections 2704 and 2707. ERISA amendments are also mentioned. ERISA Amendments: Subpart B of part 7 of subtitle B of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended by adding a new section. \"SEC. 714. STANDARDS RELATING TO BENEFITS FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY.\" Annual screening mammography coverage must be provided by group health plans and health insurance issuers offering coverage for diagnostic mammography for women aged 40 and older, under terms not less favorable than those for diagnostic mammography. Diagnostic mammography is defined as a medically necessary radiologic procedure for diagnosing breast cancer, including a physician's interpretation of the results. The term 'screening mammography' refers to a radiologic procedure for early detection of breast cancer, including a physician's interpretation of the results. Group health plans and health insurance issuers cannot deny coverage based on medical necessity or lack of referral, consent, or recommendation by a healthcare provider. The section prohibits actions such as providing monetary incentives to women to accept less protection, penalizing providers for following the rules, or giving incentives to providers to act against the regulations. The section allows women to opt out of annual screening mammography and exempts group health plans that do not cover diagnostic mammography. It also permits cost-sharing for screening mammography benefits, but limits the amount to be no greater than other applicable cost-sharing. Women aged 40-49 can choose to consult healthcare providers before screening mammography, but it is not mandatory. The requirements of this section are considered a material modification in group health plans, necessitating notice within 60 days. The requirements for annual screening mammography for women aged 40 and older must be provided within 60 days of the first plan year. Group health plans can negotiate reimbursement levels with providers. State laws regulating coverage for mammography may exempt from these requirements if they meet certain criteria. Section 731 of the Act is amended to clarify that State laws described in subsection (b) are not superseded. Additionally, sections 731(c) and 732(a) are amended to include references to sections 711 and 714. The table of contents in section 1 of the Act is also updated to reflect these changes. Effective January 1, 1999, amendments to group health plans for screening mammography benefits apply, except for plans under pre-existing collective bargaining agreements which are exempt until the agreements terminate or January 1, 1999, whichever is later. Amendments to group health plans for screening mammography benefits are effective from January 1, 1999, except for plans under pre-existing collective bargaining agreements, which are exempt until the agreements terminate or January 1, 1999, whichever is later. Plan amendments made to conform to new requirements added by this section do not terminate collective bargaining agreements. SEC. 2753 establishes standards for screening mammography benefits under individual health coverage. The provisions of section 2706 apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market, with notice requirements similar to group health plans. Preemption exceptions exist for certain states. The amendments made by this section shall apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market for annual screening mammography for women aged 40 or older, with exceptions for State laws regulating such coverage. Section 2762(a) shall not supersede State laws, and a conforming amendment is made to section 2763(b)(2) of the Act. Effective January 1, 1999, these amendments apply to health insurance coverage offered, sold, issued, or renewed in the individual market."
