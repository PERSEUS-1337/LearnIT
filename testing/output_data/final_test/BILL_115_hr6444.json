    "content": "The Act titled \"Capital Gains Inflation Relief Act\" introduces indexing of certain assets for determining gain or loss under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This includes amending Part II of subchapter O of chapter 1 to include a new section 1023 for indexing purposes. The Capital Gains Inflation Relief Act introduces indexing of assets for determining gain or loss under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This includes substituting indexed basis for adjusted basis for assets held over 3 years, with exceptions for depreciation deductions. Written documentation of original purchase price is required for indexed assets. The Capital Gains Inflation Relief Act introduces indexing of assets for determining gain or loss under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Indexed assets include common stock in C corporations, tangible property, and stock in foreign corporations traded on established markets. The Capital Gains Inflation Relief Act introduces indexing of assets for determining gain or loss under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Indexed assets include common stock in C corporations, tangible property, and stock in foreign corporations traded on established markets. The Act also specifies the treatment of American depository receipts for common stock in foreign corporations. The indexed basis for any asset is calculated by adjusting the basis of the asset and applying the applicable inflation adjustment. The Capital Gains Inflation Relief Act introduces indexing of assets for determining gain or loss under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The applicable inflation adjustment for any asset is calculated based on the adjusted basis of the asset and the percentage difference in the gross domestic product deflator between the acquisition and disposal of the asset. The gross domestic product deflator for any calendar quarter is used to determine the inflation adjustment. The product deflator for a calendar quarter is the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product for that quarter. If a taxpayer reduces the risk of loss from holding an asset through a transaction, the asset is not considered an indexed asset for that period. Short sales of indexed assets exceeding 3 years have specific rules for amount realized. The amount realized from a short sale is increased by an inflation adjustment. The short sale period begins on the day the property is sold and ends on the closing date. Regulated Investment Companies and Real Estate Investment Trusts have adjustments at the entity level. The adjustment under subsection (a) is allowed for qualified investment entities, excluding corporate shareholders. Distribution by a qualified investment entity to a corporation is treated without regard to this section for determining if it is a dividend or gain. The adjustment for qualified investment entities excludes corporate shareholders and increases the gain from capital gain dividends based on net capital gains for the taxable year. Other adjustments are made to prevent corporate shareholders from benefiting indirectly from this section. The section excludes corporate shareholders of qualified investment entities and treats certain amounts as capital gain dividends. There are exceptions for qualification purposes and certain taxes imposed at the entity level. The tax amount under this section is increased by a determined percentage. A similar rule applies to amounts subject to tax under section 857(b)(1) related to net capital gain. The first sentence does not apply to amounts subject to tax under section 852(b)(3)(A) designated by the company. The section does not apply to determining taxes imposed by section 857(b) paragraphs (4), (5), or (6). Stock in a regulated investment company is considered an indexed asset based on fair market values. Real estate investment trusts are considered indexed assets based on the fair market value ratio of their assets held at the end of each quarter. If the ratio is 80 percent or more, certain provisions apply. Real estate investment trusts are classified as indexed assets based on the fair market value ratio of their assets at the end of each quarter. If the ratio is 80 percent or more, specific rules apply, such as a 100 percent ratio for that quarter. If the ratio would be 20 percent or less, the ratio for that quarter is zero. Additionally, qualified investment entities holding partnership interests are treated as holding a proportionate share of the partnership's assets. A distribution with respect to stock in a qualified investment entity that reduces the adjusted basis of the stock is treated as allocable to stock acquired by the taxpayer in the order of acquisition. A qualified investment entity includes regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts. In partnerships, adjustments under subsection (a) are made accordingly. The adjustment made at the partnership level is passed through to the partners. In the case of a transfer of an interest in a partnership with a section 754 election in effect, adjustments are treated as a sale of partnership assets for the transferor partner and affect the partnership's holding period for the transferee partner. Adjustments made at the corporate, trust, and partnership levels are passed through to shareholders, participants, and partners respectively. The adjustment disregards indexing when determining losses on the sale of an interest in an entity. When determining the adjusted basis of an interest in a partnership, S corporation, or common trust fund, any loss on a sale or exchange is not taken into account. The section does not apply to property sales between related persons unless the transferee's basis is substituted. Related persons are defined as those with specific relationships outlined in the tax code. The section discusses transfers made to increase indexing adjustments, allowing the Secretary to disallow adjustments if the transfer's principal purpose is to secure or increase an adjustment. Special rules apply to additions to the adjusted basis of tangible property or stock in a corporation. The section discusses adjustments to the basis of assets, with special rules for tangible property or stock additions. The inflation adjustment is reduced for periods when the asset was not indexed. The section addresses the treatment of distributions related to stock in a corporation, considering them as dispositions. It also prevents the creation or increase of a net ordinary loss, treating it as a long-term capital loss instead. Additionally, it specifies the acquisition date in cases where subsection (a)(1) has been previously applied to an asset held by the taxpayer. The section addresses the treatment of distributions related to stock in a corporation, considering them as dispositions and preventing the creation or increase of a net ordinary loss. It specifies the acquisition date in cases where subsection (a)(1) has been previously applied to an asset held by the taxpayer. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations to carry out the purposes of this section. Sec. 1023 states the indexing of certain assets for gain or loss determination. Sec. 1024 provides cross-references. The amendments apply to indexed assets acquired after December 31, 2018."
