    "content": "The expression \"most-favored-nation\" (MFN) status in international trade means equal treatment of all countries, as outlined in Article I of the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994. It denotes the reciprocal extension of concessions to all countries receiving MFN treatment. The term \"most-favored-nation\" (MFN) in international trade denotes equal treatment of all countries, with the term \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) being used interchangeably. Despite efforts to replace MFN with NTR in U.S. legislation, both terms are still used universally in trade relations. MFN status grants countries the principal benefit of receiving equal treatment from other countries. The MFN status grants countries the benefit of receiving concessional import duties, leading to lower costs and increased competitiveness in the importing country's markets. The U.S. accords general MFN treatment to trading partners through bilateral compacts or treaties. The United States grants MFN status through bilateral compacts or WTO membership, obligating reciprocal treatment. U.S. law allows concessions on tariffs agreed in negotiations with trading partners. There is no official list of countries with MFN status, except for those specifically denied by law. The United States grants MFN status through bilateral compacts or WTO membership, obligating reciprocal treatment. Countries not specifically denied by law have MFN status. The policy was modified in 1951 and 1952 to suspend MFN tariff rates for Communist countries, resulting in higher customs duties on U.S. imports. Countries initially denied MFN treatment included Albania, Bulgaria, and China under Communist domination. In 1962, Poland's MFN tariff status was restored by the President, while Cuba's was added to Section 5 suspensions by law. A list of \"Communist countries\" to which MFN tariff status was denied was included in the Tariff Schedules of the United States. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 amended the Tariff Classification Act, affecting MFN treatment for countries dominated by Communism. The law allowed countries with MFN status before December 16, 1963, like Yugoslavia and Poland, to retain it if deemed in the national interest. Restoration of MFN tariff status for countries under Section 5 suspension required legislation. The Trade Act of 1974 allows for the temporary restoration of MFN status to nonmarket economy countries through a specific procedure outlined in Title IV. This involves the President restoring \"nondiscriminatory\" status through a bilateral trade agreement approved by a joint resolution. The Trade Act of 1974 allows for the temporary restoration of MFN status to nonmarket economy countries through a specific procedure outlined in Title IV. This involves the President restoring \"nondiscriminatory\" status through a bilateral trade agreement approved by a joint resolution, and compliance with freedom-of-emigration requirements. The presidential determination of compliance with these requirements or a waiver does not require positive congressional approval initially. The Trade Act of 1974 outlines a fast-track procedure for congressional disapproval of waivers related to nonmarket economy countries. The disapproval resolution must be reported within 30 days and adopted within 90 days after the presidential determination is delivered to Congress. Failure to adopt the resolution denies trade benefits to the country in question. After the enactment of legislation approving the bilateral agreement, restorations of nondiscriminatory treatment are implemented by presidential proclamation. Temporary restorations enter into force on the date of the exchange of notices of acceptance of the agreement by the two countries. The continuation of an NME country's temporary MFN status depends on automatic triennial extensions of the underlying trade agreement and periodic renewal of the Jackson-Vanik amendment. The trade agreement allows for automatic three-year extensions without congressional approval, but can be terminated with 30 days notice. The agreement's continuation depends on maintaining a satisfactory balance of concessions and reciprocal reductions in trade barriers. The Jackson-Vanik amendment requires periodic renewal by the President based on compliance with freedom-of-emigration requirements. Renewal is automatic unless disapproved by Congress. The Jackson-Vanik amendment requires periodic renewal by the President based on compliance with freedom-of-emigration requirements. Renewal is automatic unless disapproved by Congress through specific fast-track procedures outlined in the Trade Act of 1974. The waiver provision has been used to extend MFN treatment to various countries on an annually renewable basis. In 1980, Czechoslovakia and Romania renounced their MFN tariff status. Poland's MFN status was suspended in 1982 but restored in 1987. Afghanistan's MFN status was suspended in 1986 with provisions for restoration. In 1989, the designation \"Communist countries\" was removed from the list of countries denied MFN tariff treatment in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) was updated to reflect post-World War II international border changes. The Baltic countries were listed individually due to their incorporation into the USSR not being recognized. East Germany's MFN tariff status ended with the unification of Germany in 1990. A bilateral trade agreement between the US and the Soviet Union was signed in 1990, but due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the agreement did not enter into force until later that year. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late December 1991, the Master Agreement for Most Favored Nation (MFN) treatment became the basis for extending MFN status to the 12 newly independent republics. MFN status was restored to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Czechoslovakia in 1991 and 1992. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late December 1991, MFN status was restored to several former constituent republics individually, including Armenia, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Azerbaijan was the only former Soviet republic whose MFN status remained suspended. Azerbaijan was the only former Soviet republic whose MFN status had not been restored under Title IV by the end of 1994. Albania and Romania regained MFN tariff status under Title IV waiver provision. Bulgaria and the Russian Federation had their MFN status continued by presidential determinations. President Bush intended to restore MFN status to Afghanistan in October 1992, but it was not restored until June 2002. In June 2002, the restoration of MFN tariff status to Serbia and Montenegro was enacted through legislation. The President could restore the status to either republic after certifying to Congress that warlike activities had ceased in the former Yugoslavia. Additionally, in the 104th Congress, MFN tariff status was extended to Azerbaijan and permanently restored to Bulgaria and Romania in late 1996. In late 1996, measures were introduced in the 104th Congress to restore MFN tariff status to various countries, including Cambodia. The Senate approved a bill to replace the term \"most favored nation treatment\" with \"normal trade relations.\" Other measures regarding MFN status of certain countries were not further considered. In 1996, the President renewed determinations of compliance with the Jackson-Vanik amendment for Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, and Mongolia. Trade agreements with 17 NME countries were extended for three years, with delays in some cases. Unconditional nondiscriminatory treatment was given to countries upon the lapse of initial agreements. During the 105th Congress, bills were introduced regarding MFN status for U.S. trading partners, including restoring MFN tariff status to Mongolia and Laos. Some bills aimed to grant permanent MFN status to countries like Kyrgyzstan, while others sought to withdraw MFN tariff treatment from certain countries. The President extended existing Jackson-Vanik waivers as needed. During the 105th Congress, the President extended Jackson-Vanik waivers and determined compliance with free-emigration requirements for most countries. Vietnam's waiver was approved despite attempts to disapprove it. No determinations of reciprocal concessions were made, affecting trade agreements with NME countries. The NTR status of countries has been maintained despite lapsed agreements, with China's MFN status being a controversial issue. Renewals of China's Jackson-Vanik waiver and MFN status faced opposition in Congress, but attempts to disapprove them were unsuccessful. Bills to impose additional restrictions on China's MFN status were vetoed by the President and upheld by the Senate. Legislation enacted in 1998 replaced the term \"most favored nation\" with \"normal trade relations\" in specific statutes, but the term continues to be used in international practice and U.S. trade agreements. In anticipation of Kyrgyzstan joining the WTO on December 20, 1998, the United States invoked Article XIII of the WTO Agreement to suspend certain provisions until then. This was necessary to comply with the MFN obligation towards Kyrgyzstan, which had nonpermanent and conditional MFN status at the time. Similar actions had been taken in the past in comparable situations. In the 106th Congress, legislation was enacted to extend permanent nondiscriminatory status to Mongolia, Albania, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, and China. The President made required reports on compliance with the Jackson-Vanik provision by former Soviet Union republics and renewed Jackson-Vanik waivers for Belarus, China, and Vietnam. Joint resolutions to disapprove the extensions for China and Vietnam failed to be enacted. Extensions of permanent nondiscriminatory tariff status were also enacted. Extensions of permanent nondiscriminatory tariff status were enacted for Mongolia, Albania, Kyrgyzstan, and Georgia in the 106th Congress. Mongolia's status was enacted on June 25, 1999, Albania and Kyrgyzstan on May 18, 2000, and Georgia on November 9, 2000. These extensions were implemented through Presidential proclamations. The Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-476) granted permanent NTR status to China, implemented by Presidential proclamation 7389 on December 29, 2000. The delayed entry into force of the law was due to China's accession to the WTO on December 11, 2001. The trade agreement between the US and China was negotiated outside the WTO but became part of China's protocol of accession. China's accession to the WTO required most-favored-nation treatment by the United States as a reciprocal obligation. The US could have avoided this obligation by invoking WTO Article XIII, which allows for nonapplication of obligations between current and acceding members. This would have limited the US benefits from trade with China to those in a less comprehensive bilateral agreement. The bilateral trade agreement with China was signed in 1999, leading to discussions in Congress for approval. Legislation approving the agreement was introduced in both houses in 2000. The U.S.-China trade agreement was approved by Congress in 2000, with H.R. 4444 passing in the House and Senate, signed into law as P.L. 106-286. S. 2277 was not voted on. The U.S. signed a trade agreement with Vietnam in July 2000, similar to the one with China, but it didn't take effect until December 2001. Presidential determinations of compliance with the Jackson-Vanik amendment were made, involving only nine former Soviet Union countries by the end of 2000. In 2001, the U.S. extended Jackson-Vanik waivers for Belarus, China, and Vietnam, but faced opposition in the House. Presidential determinations were made for compliance with the Jackson-Vanik amendment involving nine former Soviet Union countries by the end of 2000. During the 106th Congress, several trade agreements faced renewal determinations, with unconditional nondiscriminatory treatment restored to four NME countries. The nonapplication Article XIII of the WTO Agreement with Kyrgyzstan was rescinded, and permanent nondiscriminatory treatment was extended to Kyrgyzstan. In the 107th Congress, trade agreements with Vietnam and China entered into force as required by Section 101 of P.L. 106-286. During the 107th Congress, trade agreements with Vietnam and China entered into force as required by Section 101 of P.L. 106-286. The President transmitted reports to Congress on the equivalency of terms and conditions for China's accession to the WTO and extended permanent nondiscriminatory treatment to China. Legislation was introduced to approve the extension of nondiscriminatory status for Vietnam. During the 107th Congress, trade agreements with Vietnam and China were approved. The agreement with Vietnam was ratified by the U.S. Congress and Vietnam's National Assembly, entering into effect on December 10, 2001. The agreement with Vietnam remains in force through triennial extensions and Presidential determinations of trade concessions. Vietnam's nondiscriminatory status is conditional and subject to the Jackson-Vanik amendment. Legislation was introduced to extend permanent nondiscriminatory tariff treatment to several countries. President Bush restored nondiscriminatory status to Afghanistan by Proclamation. President Bush restored nondiscriminatory status to Afghanistan by Proclamation 7553 in 2002. Semiannual Presidential reports on the Jackson-Vanik amendment were issued for former Soviet Union republics. China's and Vietnam's Jackson-Vanik waivers were extended in 2001. Resolutions to disapprove the waivers were introduced but defeated in the House. In 2001, China's waiver for nondiscriminatory treatment was extended to maintain temporary NTR treatment. Legislation for a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement with China had already been enacted. Belarus' waiver was also extended by Executive Order 13220.

Vietnam's waiver extension was disapproved in July 2002. No action was taken on lapsed trade agreements with NME countries. Mongolia was granted permanent nondiscriminatory status. On January 8, 2001, the United States rescinded the recourse to Article XIII for Georgia upon granting permanent NTR status. Moldova's Article XIII invocation was made on May 2, 2001, due to pending WTO accession. The United States also invoked Article XIII for Armenia on December 9, 2002, as it was in the final stage of WTO accession. The United States imposed prohibitive import duties on Ukraine for failing to protect U.S. intellectual property rights. This action rescinded part of the nondiscriminatory treatment under the Trade Act of 1974 but did not affect the U.S. general MFN obligation under the WTO. Activity to restore PNTR to several countries occurred in the 108th Congress, with some NTR-adverse actions taken. Most proposed legislation died in committees, except for measures in favor of Armenia and Laos. The chairman of the House Trade subcommittee requested comments on extending PNTR to Armenia, Laos, and Moldova. Bills were introduced to extend nondiscriminatory treatment to Armenia before its accession to the WTO. PNTR-restoring legislation was introduced for several countries in the 108th Congress, including Armenia, Belarus, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Laos, and Russia.

NTR-adverse action was also initiated against Laos, with bills introduced to prohibit the US from entering a trade agreement with Laos for reciprocal extension of most-favored-nation treatment. Legislation providing for Laos' PNTR was in its final stages of enactment. Various bills listing sanctions, including increased tariffs, died in committees of referral. On January 29, 2003, the President transmitted the 2002 year-end report on full compliance with the freedom-of-emigration requirements of the Jackson-Vanik amendment for nine former Soviet republics. Waivers for Belarus and Vietnam were extended, maintaining their temporary nondiscriminatory tariff treatment by the United States.
