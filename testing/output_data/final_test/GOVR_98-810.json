    "content": "Most civilian federal employees hired before 1984 are covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), while those hired in 1984 or later are covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). Employees under FERS pay Social Security taxes and earn benefits, and may also contribute to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). Only FERS employees are eligible for employer matching contributions to the TSP. Congress passed the Civil Service Retirement Act of 1920 to provide pension benefits for federal employees, and in 1935, created the Social Security system for private sector workers. The Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-335) required all civilian federal employees hired into permanent employment on or after January 1, 1984, to participate in Social Security. This new retirement system was designed to include features of private-sector employer plans and aimed to avoid duplication of benefits. The Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-335) introduced the FERS, which includes Social Security, a basic retirement annuity, the FERS supplement, and the Thrift Savings Plan. It covers federal employees hired after January 1, 1984, and those who switched from CSRS. Former employees with at least five years of CSRS service could join FERS or the CSRS offset plan, where contributions are diverted to Social Security, reducing the CSRS annuity. The CSRS and CSRS offset program will end with the death of the last worker or survivor covered under the program, estimated to be around 2090. Employers establish retirement plans to attract skilled workers and enable older workers to retire with adequate income. Private-sector retirement plans must comply with federal laws such as ERISA, ADEA, and the Internal Revenue Code. Retirement programs are classified as defined benefit (DB) plans or defined contribution (DC) plans. In a defined benefit plan, a worker's retirement benefit is paid as a life annuity based on years of service and average salary. In a defined contribution plan, the employer and/or employee contribute a specific dollar amount or percentage of pay into an account, usually invested in stocks and bonds. The retiree receives the balance in the account upon retirement, which includes contributions, interest, dividends, and capital gains (or losses), net of fees and expenses. In a defined benefit plan, the employer bears the financial risk by promising retirement benefits in the form of a life annuity. The employer must make contributions to a pension fund to pay the benefits earned by employees. If the plan is underfunded, the employer must make additional contributions. In a defined contribution plan, the employee bears the investment risk. In defined contribution plans, employees bear investment risk. CSRS and FERS are retirement plans with different elements. Retirement annuity amount is based on years of service, accrual rate, and salary base. Under CSRS and FERS retirement plans, employees earn annuity based on years of service, accrual rate, and salary base. Workers can retire at different ages based on years of service. FERS minimum retirement age varies based on birth year, increasing to 57 for those born in 1970 or later. Employees with at least 30 years of service can retire with an immediate, unreduced annuity. Employees under CSRS and FERS retirement plans can retire at different ages based on years of service. Those with 20 or more years of service can retire with an unreduced annuity at age 60, while those with at least 5 years of service can retire at age 62. For FERS, employees can retire with a reduced benefit at the minimum retirement age with at least 10 years of service. The retirement benefit is permanently reduced based on the retiree's age at the time the annuity begins. A commonly used measure of retirement income adequacy is the replacement rate, which is the percentage of pre-retirement income replaced by pension income. Most pension analysts believe retirement income should replace at least 70% to 80% of pre-retirement income. Workers with low-wage jobs may need a higher replacement rate due to higher expenses on necessities. The retirement annuity under CSRS and FERS is calculated by multiplying salary base, accrual rate, and years of service. The pension amount under CSRS and FERS is calculated using the formula: Pension Amount = salary base x accrual rate x years of service. In FERS, the salary base is the average of the highest three consecutive years of basic pay, known as \"high-three\" pay. FERS workers accrue retirement benefits at a rate of 1% per year, increasing to 1.1% for those with at least 20 years of service who work until age 62. CSRS pension accrual rates increase with length of service, starting at 1.5% for the first 5 years. The pension formula under CSRS and FERS calculates the pension amount based on salary, accrual rate, and years of service. FERS accrual rates start at 1% per year, increasing to 1.1% for those with 20 years of service. CSRS accrual rates start at 1.5% for the first 5 years, with higher rates for certain groups like Members of Congress and law enforcement officers. Under CSRS, air traffic controllers accrue benefits at 2.5% for the first 20 years and 2.0% thereafter. For FERS, Members of Congress and staff accrue benefits at 1.7% for the first 20 years and 1.0% after. Law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers also accrue benefits at the same rates. After 20 years, the pension equals 34% of the salary base, increasing to 44% after 30 years. Members of Congress and staff under FERS since 2013 accrue benefits at 1% per year. The replacement rate for Members and congressional staff under FERS is the same as for regular FERS employees, with a rate of 1% per year. For regular federal employees with 30 years of service, CSRS provides a replacement rate of 56.25% of high-three average pay. Estimating replacement rates under FERS is complex due to varying income from Social Security and the TSP. A temporary supplemental benefit called the \"FERS supplement\" is provided to workers who retire before age 62, including those who retire at 55. The \"FERS supplement\" is a temporary benefit paid to federal workers who retire before age 62, with specific eligibility criteria based on age and years of service. It is equal to the estimated Social Security benefit earned while employed by the federal government and is paid until age 62. Cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) protect retirement benefits from inflation, with automatic COLAs in place since 1972 for Social Security and since 1962 for CSRS. Cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for FERS retirement annuity are based on the annual change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). COLAs are fully indexed if inflation is under 2% per year and partially indexed if inflation exceeds 2%. The increase in the FERS annuity depends on the CPI-W increase, with different percentages based on inflation levels. COLAs are only applied to annuities of retirees aged 62 or older, individuals who retired by reason of disability, and survivor annuitants under FERS. Non-disabled, non-survivor FERS beneficiaries under 62 receive no COLAs. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a retirement plan for federal employees, similar to a 401(k). It is important for FERS workers in the middle to upper pay scales who may not have enough retirement income from Social Security and the basic annuity. Employees can contribute up to $18,000 to the TSP, with an additional $6,000 for those aged 50 and older. Contributions can be pre-tax or made as qualified Roth contributions. COLAs are only given to retirees aged 62 or older, disabled retirees, and survivor annuitants under FERS. Non-disabled, non-survivor beneficiaries under 62 do not receive COLAs. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a retirement plan for federal employees. Qualified distributions from the Roth TSP plan option are tax-free for participants aged 59\u00bd or older. Federal workers under FERS receive employer contributions equal to 1% of their base pay and can also receive matching contributions up to 4% of pay. CSRS workers can contribute to the TSP but do not receive matching contributions. Participants are immediately vested in their contributions, federal matching contributions, and agency automatic contributions after three years. Participants in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) are fully vested in the agency automatic contribution after three years. The value of their TSP account at retirement depends on their contributions, investment earnings, and the number of years contributions were made. Participants can choose among five funds to invest in, including the \"C\" fund, \"F\" fund, \"G\" fund, and \"S\" fund. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) offers participants five funds to invest in, including the \"S\" fund for small to medium-sized U.S. companies, the \"I\" fund for international stocks, and the newly added Lifecycle Funds which provide professionally designed asset allocation models based on the participant's time horizon for withdrawing money from the TSP. The TSP offers Lifecycle Funds with target dates ranging from 2020 to 2050. When a fund reaches its target date, it is rolled into the \"L Income Fund\" for participants withdrawing soon. Withdrawal options include life annuity, lump-sum payment, or monthly payments. A retiree can choose to receive payments from their pension in a lump sum or monthly installments for a fixed period. There is a 10% tax penalty for early withdrawals before the age of 59\u00bd, but exceptions apply for retirees aged 55 or older. Both CSRS and FERS participants contribute towards their pensions through payroll taxes. Employees under FERS contribute a percentage of their pay to the CSRDF and Social Security taxes based on their hire date. Members of Congress also contribute to the CSRDF and pay Social Security taxes. Employers in the private sector are required to pre-fund retirement benefits under ERISA. The ERISA requires private-sector employers with defined benefit pensions to pre-fund future pension obligations to ensure retirees receive their benefits even if the firm goes out of business. Employers must pay premiums to the PBGC, which insures pensions of workers in case of plan termination with unfunded liabilities. The PBGC guarantees a maximum annual benefit of around $60,136 for workers retiring at 65 in 2015. The PBGC insures private-sector pensions, not government pensions. Government pensions are guaranteed by taxpayers. The federal government requires pre-funding of pension benefits to ensure funds are available in case of firm bankruptcy. The CSRDF provides budget authority for timely benefit payments and monitors future pension obligations. The rising trust fund balance indicates future obligations for higher pension payments. Prefunding pension obligations ensures full recognition of personnel costs by federal agencies. Contributions to CSRS and FERS are not based on individual employee accounts and only cover a small part of retirement annuities. Employee contributions to CSRS and FERS are essential for federal government revenues, reducing the burden on the public for pension costs. In FY2014, these contributions totaled $2.8 billion, accounting for 2.9% of the CSRDF income. Other revenue sources for the fund include agency contributions, U.S. Postal Service contributions, interest on federal bonds, and transfers from the U.S. Treasury. While CSRS costs are not fully covered by contributions, FERS benefits are fully funded by employee, agency contributions, and interest earnings. The normal cost of a pension plan is the percentage of payroll set aside each year to fund earned benefits. OPM estimates the current normal cost of CSRS to be 29.3% of payroll, with the government's share at 22.3%. Employees and agencies each contribute 7.0% of basic pay to the CSRDF, totaling 14%, which does not fully finance retirement benefits. The contribution of 14% of employee pay does not fully finance the retirement benefits provided by the CSRS. Employee and agency contributions totaling 14% of pay cover the static normal cost of CSRS benefits, but not the dynamic normal cost which includes future benefit increases from pay raises and COLAs. Employees and agencies meet about 48% of the normal cost, with the remaining 52% covered by interest earned on bonds held by the retirement fund. 52% of the cost of CSRS is paid from interest earned by bonds, special contributions by the U.S. Postal Service, and transfers from the U.S. Treasury. Federal agencies would contribute 22.3% of payroll for CSRS benefits if done on an accrual basis like FERS. OPM estimated the normal cost of FERS basic annuity to be 14.0% of payroll for employees hired before 2013 and 14.2% for those hired in 2013 or later. Agencies must contribute the normal cost of FERS minus employee contributions. Employees hired before 2013 contribute 0.8% of pay towards their FERS annuities. Under P.L. 112-96, FERS employees hired in 2013 contribute 3.1% of pay towards their annuity, with a cost of 11.1% of payroll. Employees hired after 2013 contribute 4.4%, with agencies contributing 11.1%. Additional employee contributions go towards reducing the CSRS unfunded liability. Other mandatory costs for FERS employees include Social Security, agency automatic TSP contribution, and agency matching TSP contributions. Social Security taxes are 6.2% of payroll for both employer and employee. The Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) requires employees hired before 2013 to contribute 1% of their pay to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), with a total cost of 20.4% of payroll. For employees hired in 2013 or later, the contribution is 18.3% of pay. Federal matching contributions to the TSP can increase these amounts by up to 4 percentage points. Employees enrolled in FERS who contribute 5.0% or more to the TSP have their employing agency finance retirement costs of 24.4% or 22.3% of pay, depending on their hire date. Under FERS, each federal agency must budget contributions towards employee pension benefits, including the full normal cost of the FERS basic benefit, employer share of Social Security payroll taxes, automatic TSP contributions, and employer matching contributions. CSRS requires agencies to budget a 7.0% contribution to the CSRDF, with additional costs covered by the U.S. Treasury. Government contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) are treated as a general obligation of the U.S. Treasury. Contributions for both CSRS and FERS programs are commingled in the CSRDF, where benefits for retirees and survivors are paid. In contrast, contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) are deposited into individual participant accounts managed by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. The TSP is not a trust fund of the government, and as of September 30, 2013, the CSRDF had $844.6 billion in net assets available for benefit payments. The Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) had an unfunded actuarial liability of $785.0 billion, with $751.4 billion attributable to CSRS and $33.6 billion to FERS. While the CSRDF has an unfunded liability, it is projected to grow over the next 75 years, reaching $9.6 trillion in 2080. OPM's actuaries project that the fund will be able to meet its financial obligations in perpetuity. The Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) is projected to grow over the next 75 years, reaching $9.6 trillion in 2080. The fund will be able to meet its financial obligations in perpetuity, with assets growing throughout the projection term. All federal employees hired since 1984 are enrolled in FERS, ensuring benefits are fully funded. The CSRDF operates similarly to the Social Security Trust Fund, with all monies used to purchase U.S. Treasury bonds in an intra-governmental transfer. This does not impact the government's budget surplus or deficit. The Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) assets are U.S. Treasury bonds that serve as a record of available budget authority for federal retiree benefits. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clarifies that these trust fund balances are only available for future benefit payments in a bookkeeping sense, as they are not assets of the Government that can be drawn down to fund benefits. Trust fund holdings cannot be sold for cash and are essentially claims on the Treasury. The trust fund balances are claims on the Treasury and not assets that can be used to fund benefits. The Government's ability to pay benefits is not increased by the existence of large trust fund balances. Trust fund balances are assets of program agencies and liabilities of the Treasury, netting to zero for the Government. Government trust funds can help ease future benefit payments by increasing national saving. The Government can prefund benefits by increasing saving and investment in the economy. Investment in the economy can be achieved by running trust fund surpluses equal to the actuarial present value of benefits while maintaining an unchanged Federal fund deficit. This would reduce Federal borrowing, increase national saving, and finance investment. State and local government pension funds invest in various assets. If Congress allows the CSRDF to acquire assets other than U.S. Treasury bonds, such as stocks and bonds from private corporations, it could further enhance benefits. The U.S. Treasury bonds could be sold to the public for cash as pension liabilities come due, representing a major change in public policy with effects on the federal budget and private businesses. Allowing the CSRDF to invest in private assets may displace purchases by private citizens, leading to a reallocation of assets where the government would own more private-sector stocks and bonds. The government owning more private-sector stocks and bonds would lead to a shift in asset allocation. Questions arise regarding the management and investment practices of the trust fund if it were to purchase private investment securities, including who would make investment decisions and the acceptable level of risk. Poor investment choices could result in the trust fund losing value over time, raising concerns about what assets to purchase and potential controversy over investing taxpayer-provided funds in certain companies, industries, or countries. Investing civil service retirement trust fund assets in private-sector securities would have implications for the federal budget. Currently, the trust fund receives agency and employee contributions, with outlays for annuitants and administrative expenses. Purchasing private assets like stocks and bonds would require immediate funds outlay. Investing civil service retirement trust fund assets in private-sector securities would lead to an immediate outlay of funds, partially covered by employee contributions diverted from the Treasury's general fund. The remaining purchase, financed by agency contributions, would replace intra-governmental transfers with direct federal funds. This shift would result in the Treasury borrowing from the public to make up for lost employee contributions, potentially increasing the government's budget deficit. Over time, these transactions could balance out, moving some outlays from the future. Investing civil service retirement trust fund assets in private-sector securities would result in immediate outlays, partly covered by employee contributions diverted from the Treasury's general fund. The remaining purchase, financed by agency contributions, would replace intra-governmental transfers with direct federal funds, potentially increasing the government's budget deficit. This shift would move some outlays from the future to the present."
