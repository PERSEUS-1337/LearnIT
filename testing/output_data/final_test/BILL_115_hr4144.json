    "content": "The \"Port Drivers' Bill of Rights Act of 2017\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to port drivers. Congress finds that the labor of drayage and intermodal truck drivers is crucial for the movement of goods and the nation's economy. Independent studies have highlighted low pay and worker misclassification in these industries. A hearing in 2010 discussed the negative impacts of port trucking, while a 2017 investigation revealed employer abuses, describing the work conditions as modern-day indentured servitude. The California Labor Commissioner has also made relevant decisions. The California Labor Commissioner has awarded over 400 port drivers $40 million in back pay for wage violations. Federal and State courts support the Commissioner's authority in these cases. Additionally, the Employment Development Department and the New Jersey Department of Labor have granted unemployment and disability benefits to 50 port drivers. The National Labor Relations Board has filed complaints against port trucking companies for unfair labor practices. Port drivers at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have gone on multiple strikes in the past 3 years due to being misclassified, leading to delays in cargo movement. Various stakeholders in the goods movement industry contribute to poor working conditions for these drivers. Government officials have a duty to improve the situation for port truck drivers. Congress recognizes the rights of truck drivers, including drayage drivers, to fair treatment, full-time work, legal protections, workplace safety, fair leasing practices, proper classification, and collective bargaining. The Truck Leasing Task Force, established by the Secretary of Transportation in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, consists of up to 15 members from various groups. The Task Force's duties include examining lease-to-own agreements for commercial truck drivers, with a focus on drayage drivers and agreements at the Port of Los Angeles. The Truck Leasing Task Force, established by the Secretary of Transportation, may conduct site visits and field hearings. The Task Force will create a report on the impact of truck leasing agreements on drivers' pay, compliance with laws, the need for legislation to protect drivers' wages, and potential regulatory changes. The Truck Leasing Task Force will create a report on the impact of truck leasing agreements on drivers' pay and recommend regulatory changes to protect drivers' wages. The report will be submitted to relevant congressional committees within a year of the Task Force's establishment. The Truck Leasing Task Force will terminate one month after submitting the report on the impact of truck leasing agreements on drivers' pay."
