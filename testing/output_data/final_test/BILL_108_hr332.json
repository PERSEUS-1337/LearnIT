The Penn School on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, was the first educational experiment of the Reconstruction Era and remains a significant African-American cultural and educational institution in the United States. The Freedmen's Bureau in Beaufort College was the chief policy arm of the Federal Government for matters related to emancipated slaves during the Reconstruction Era.
