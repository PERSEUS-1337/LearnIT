Congress finds that between December 2007 and October 2009, payroll employment in the United States fell by 8.2 million, the manufacturing sector lost 5.6 million jobs between January 2000 and October 2009, and as of October 2009, fewer than 12 million workers were employed in the manufacturing sector. Additionally, the United States had a trade deficit of over $695 billion at the end of 2008, including a record-breaking deficit with China. Preserving and increasing decent paying jobs is a top priority, and providing support for employees to buy their own companies can help achieve this goal. The United States Employee Ownership Bank is proposed to be established within the Department of the Treasury to preserve and expand jobs in the United States, similar to the creation of the United States Export-Import Bank during the Great Depression to increase jobs through exports. The Act defines key terms such as \"Bank\" as the United States Employee Ownership Bank, \"eligible worker-owned cooperative,\" \"employee stock ownership plan,\" and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Treasury. Additionally, it establishes the United States Employee Ownership Bank within the Department of the Treasury. The Secretary is required to establish the United States Employee Ownership Bank within 90 days to promote employee ownership and participation in company decision-making.

The loan or loan guarantee from the Employee Ownership Bank must bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary, with a maximum term of 12 years. SEC. 5.
