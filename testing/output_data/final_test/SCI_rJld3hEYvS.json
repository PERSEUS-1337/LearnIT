    "content": "Sample inefficiency in reinforcement learning is a persistent issue. The proposed ranking policy gradient (RPG) method aims to improve sample efficiency by learning the optimal rank of discrete actions. By establishing the equivalence between maximizing return lower bound and imitating a near-optimal policy, a general off-policy learning framework is introduced. RPG, when combined with this framework, significantly reduces sample complexity compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. One major challenge in reinforcement learning is the high sample complexity, leading to poor sample efficiency. Value function baselines in actor-critic methods aim to reduce variance and improve sample efficiency, but on-policy requirements make sample-efficient learning difficult. Off-policy methods offer a solution to this issue. Off-policy methods like one-step Q-learning and variants of deep Q networks are among the most sample-efficient algorithms, allowing learning from any trajectory in the same environment. However, they often require extensive searching over the state-action space and can lead to unstable learning due to the \"deadly triad\" of off-policy learning, bootstrapping, and function approximation. These issues limit their sample efficiency. In response to the limitations of sample-efficient reinforcement learning, a new approach focuses on learning optimal action ranks instead of estimating action values. The Ranking Policy Gradient (RPG) method is proposed to optimize the relative action values by learning pairwise relationships among actions to maximize long-term rewards. This method is a policy gradient approach that aims to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning. In response to the limitations of sample-efficient reinforcement learning, a new approach focuses on learning optimal action ranks instead of estimating action values. The proposed off-policy learning framework equips generalized policy iteration with supervised learning to reduce the variance of policy gradient and maintain optimality. There is a trade-off between optimality and sample-efficiency in this approach. The proposed approach combines RPG with off-policy learning to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning. It outperforms existing methods and utilizes Q-learning variants like DQN, Double DQN, Dueling networks, prioritized experience replay, and RAINBOW for better performance. The proposed approach combines RPG with off-policy learning to enhance sample efficiency in reinforcement learning, surpassing existing methods. It utilizes Q-learning variants like DQN, Double DQN, Dueling networks, prioritized experience replay, and RAINBOW for improved performance. Various algorithms such as DQN, supervised learning, and Entropy-Regularized RL are compared for sample efficiency. The curr_chunk discusses EM-based approaches, Entropy-Regularized RL, and Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) in the context of reinforcement learning. It highlights the differences and connections between these approaches, with a focus on IIL being closely related to the current work. The curr_chunk introduces an off-policy learning framework that combines online imitation learning with supervised learning to maximize return without requiring access to expert demonstrations. This approach can learn both deterministic and stochastic optimal policies for long-term reward, distinguishing itself from prior work in terms of objectives, oracle assumptions, and on-policy requirements. In this paper, a finite horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a discrete state space and action space is considered. The goal is to maximize the expected sum of rewards using value function estimation in reinforcement learning algorithms. The dimension of the action space can vary, and the maximal action dimension among all possible states is denoted as m. Various advanced RL algorithms utilize value function estimation to aid in the learning process. The on-policy requirement in actor-critic methods has made sample-efficient learning more challenging. Off-policy learning in DQN variants has proven to be more efficient. Decision-making in RL involves comparing actions to choose the best one for higher returns. Learning the optimal rank of actions is proposed as an alternative solution. Learning the optimal rank of actions is proposed as an alternative solution to maximize return without accurate estimation for optimal action value function. The optimal relative action values should preserve the same optimal action as the optimal action values. To learn the \u03bb-values, a probabilistic model is constructed to ensure the best action has the highest probability of being selected. Inspired by learning to rank, the pairwise relationship among all actions is considered to model the probability of an action being ranked higher than others. The pairwise ranking policy aims to maximize long-term rewards by optimizing the relationship between action pairs. It assigns probabilities to actions based on their relative values, with the goal of selecting the best action with the highest probability and \u03bb-value. This approach is inspired by learning to rank and ensures that the best action is more likely to be chosen. The ranking policy gradient method (RPG) aims to optimize the relationship between action pairs to maximize long-term rewards. The deterministic pairwise ranking policy \u03c0 \u03b8 selects the best action with the highest probability and \u03bb-value. However, RPG is not suitable for tasks with only optimal stochastic policies. To address this, the Listwise Policy Gradient (LPG) is introduced to optimize the probability of ranking a specific action on top for better stochastic policy learning. The Listwise Policy Gradient (LPG) method models the top one probability of choosing an action using the softmax function, equivalent to the REINFORCE algorithm. LPG offers a new perspective on learning optimal ranking and enables learning both deterministic and stochastic policies. The RPG and LPG methods belong to policy gradient methods but suffer from large variance and on-policy learning requirements. A new off-policy learning framework empowered by supervised learning is discussed, offering a sample-efficient way to accelerate learning and reduce variance. The main result is Theorem 2, which transforms the problem of maximizing return into a supervised learning problem under certain assumptions. The approach introduces a method to imitate near-optimal policies in RL tasks by collecting optimal trajectories and maximizing log likelihood. It focuses on discrete action MDPs with finite states and horizon, considering the stationary state distribution and state-action pairs under a near-optimal policy \u03c0*. The approach introduces trajectory reward shaping (TRS) to connect supervised learning with RL for sample-efficient off-policy learning. TRS defines a near-optimal trajectory reward threshold to balance sample-efficiency and optimality in exploration. The approach introduces trajectory reward shaping (TRS) to connect supervised learning with RL for sample-efficient off-policy learning. TRS defines a near-optimal trajectory reward threshold to balance sample-efficiency and optimality in exploration. It shapes the trajectory reward directly to enable a smooth transition from RL to SL, maximizing long-term performance. The optimality is preserved after trajectory reward shaping, ensuring the optimal policy for original MDP is also optimal for maximizing long-term performance. The use of trajectory reward shaping (TRS) in reinforcement learning connects supervised learning with RL for efficient off-policy learning. TRS filters out near-optimal trajectories to maximize long-term performance by maximizing the probabilities of these trajectories. This approach ensures that the optimal policy for the original MDP remains optimal for maximizing performance. The Uniformly Near-Optimal Policy \u03c0 * is the policy that maximizes the log-likelihood of near-optimal state-action pairs, a supervised learning problem. It is defined as a policy with a uniform distribution over near-optimal trajectories, ensuring optimal performance in terms of return and long-term performance. Assumption 2 is satisfied for certain MDPs with deterministic dynamics. The Long-term Performance Theorem connects supervised learning and RL by showing that maximizing the lower bound of expected long-term performance is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood of state-action pairs sampled from a uniformly near-optimal policy. This theorem does not require the near-optimal policy to be deterministic, only that it exists. Theorem 2 breaks the dependency between current policy and environment dynamics, allowing off-policy learning through supervised learning. There is a discrepancy between imitating UNOP by maximizing log likelihood and reinforcement learning, as the focus is on maximizing the lower bound of expected long-term performance. Theorem 2 enables off-policy learning through supervised learning, breaking the dependency between current policy and environment dynamics. Corollary 1 reduces ranking policy gradient to a classification problem, optimizing the lower bound of expected long-term performance. This approach can reduce variance in reinforcement learning by casting it as a supervised learning problem. The proposed off-policy supervised learning reduces the variance of policy gradient, as shown in Corollary 2. It assumes a bounded continuously differentiable policy and bounds the policy gradient norm. The corollary bounds the variance of regular policy gradient by the square of the time horizon and maximum trajectory reward, aligning with the intuition that longer horizons make learning harder. The off-policy supervised learning method reduces policy gradient variance by truncating rewards and focusing on exploration. It is more stable and efficient for training policies using supervised learning. The trajectory reward threshold is task-specific and crucial for performance. In cases where the reward function is unknown, the threshold is treated as a tuning parameter for balancing optimality and efficiency. The proposed two-stages off-policy learning framework reduces policy gradient variance by focusing on exploration. It allows for the collection of near-optimal trajectories using advanced RL agents, improving policy training efficiency. The two-stage algorithmic framework focuses on exploration to collect near-optimal trajectories for policy training efficiency. It provides a sample-efficient approach with stability, variance reduction, and optimality preservation. The framework can be incorporated in RPG and LPG algorithms to improve sample efficiency. The algorithm focuses on exploration efficiency and MDP structure, requiring near-optimal trajectories for supervised learning dataset. Despite potential sample-inefficiency, empirical observations show enough near-optimal trajectories are explored before convergence. Using value function for exploration and imitating UNOP is suggested. Using value function for exploration and imitating UNOP is a sample-efficient approach that avoids divergent optimization. By constructing a stationary target from near-optimal trajectories, imitation learning reduces the need for extensive exploration and sample estimation. This two-stage approach improves sample-efficiency through effective exploitation in MDPs like PONG. The text discusses improving sample-efficiency through effective exploitation in MDPs like PONG. It compares the proposed RPG method with state-of-the-art baselines in Atari 2600 games, focusing on exploration efficiency. Training curves are shown, and results are averaged over random seeds. The error bars represent a 95% confidence interval. The text discusses RPG method compared to baselines in Atari 2600 games for exploration efficiency. RPG explores using interactions with the environment and off-policy learning. EPG incorporates stochastic policy gradient with trajectory reward shaping, while LPG is deterministic. RPG explores the environment using a separate EPG agent in PONG and IQN in other games, conducting supervised learning by minimizing the hinge loss. The exploration agent can be replaced by any existing method. RPG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sample-efficiency and final performance at various tasks in Atari 2600 games. In reinforcement learning, RPG is consistently stable and effective across different environments, outperforming baselines in sample-efficiency and final performance at Atari 2600 games like ROB-OTANK, DOUBLEDUNK, PITFALL, and PONG. It simplifies the reduction from RL to supervised learning, showing effectiveness without complex exploration methods. In the PONG environment, ablation studies were conducted to compare off-policy learning methods EPG, LPG, and RPG. RPG, using pairwise ranking policy in off-policy learning, was found to be more sample-efficient than EPG/LPG. The proposed off-policy learning outperformed the on-policy method PPO, indicating that off-policy learning significantly improves sample-efficiency in reinforcement learning. The off-policy learning framework, particularly using pairwise ranking policy, significantly improves sample-efficiency in reinforcement learning. Comparisons with other off-policy policy gradient approaches show that the proposed framework is more sample-efficient. The trade-off between sample-efficiency and optimality is demonstrated empirically, with higher trajectory reward thresholds leading to better final performance. In this work, ranking policy gradient (RPG) methods are introduced to address RL problems from a ranking perspective. An off-policy learning framework is proposed for sample-efficient RL, utilizing generalized policy iteration for exploration and supervised learning for policy learning. The trade-off between sample efficiency and optimality is demonstrated in DOUBLEDUNK, BREAKOUT, and BANKHEIST, with higher trajectory reward thresholds requiring more samples for convergence but leading to better final performance. Ranking policy gradient (RPG) methods are introduced for RL problems, utilizing supervised learning for policy learning. RPG achieves unbiasedness, variance reduction, off-policy learning, and sample efficiency. Empirical results show superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art. Key notations include \u03bb ij for action value discrepancy and p ij for action ranking probability controlled by \u03b8. The trajectory in RL is controlled by \u03b8 from the environment and represents state-action pairs. The trajectory reward is the sum of rewards along one trajectory, bounded by R max. The probability of a specific trajectory is collected from the environment under a policy. |T| denotes the number of near-optimal trajectories, n is the number of training samples, and m is the number of discrete actions. In reinforcement learning, the data distribution is dynamic and determined by environment dynamics and the evolving learning policy. Training samples are not independently distributed due to policy changes, making RL algorithms unstable and sample-inefficient. Despite these challenges, RL algorithms eventually acquire a policy mapping from state to action, similar to supervised learning. In reinforcement learning, the data distribution is dynamic and determined by environment dynamics and the evolving learning policy. Training samples are not independently distributed due to policy changes, making RL algorithms unstable and sample-inefficient. Ultimately, there exists a supervised learning equivalent to the RL problem if optimal policies exist. Pioneers have developed insightful approaches to reduce RL into its supervised learning counterpart over the past several decades. In reinforcement learning, the data distribution is dynamic and determined by environment dynamics and evolving learning policy. Training samples are not independently distributed due to policy changes, making RL algorithms unstable and sample-inefficient. Pioneers have developed approaches to reduce RL into its supervised learning counterpart. In each episode, steps are taken with a specified exploration agent to collect experience and update the policy based on the hinge loss. The RPG agent is evaluated by greedily choosing actions at regular intervals. Recent advances in reinforcement learning have extended the EM framework to include episodic return and relative entropy objectives. Evaluation steps using Retrace can be unstable, even with linear function approximation. The estimation step in EM-based algorithms is a key focus. Off-policy learning in EM-based algorithms is motivated by the desire for sample efficiency. PGQ and Soft Actor-Critic connect policy gradient with Q-learning for faster convergence. Soft Actor-Critic optimizes long-term reward and policy entropy efficiently, modeling suboptimal behavior and learning a reasonable policy. The discrepancy between the entropy-regularized objective and original long-term reward has been discussed in previous works. While some focus on learning stochastic policy, the proposed framework is applicable for both deterministic and stochastic optimal policies. Similar to other studies, good samples are collected based on past experience for imitation learning. However, the theoretical approach differs, connecting self-imitation learning to lower-bound-soft-Q-learning in entropy-regularized reinforcement learning. There is a trade-off between sample efficiency and modeling suboptimal behaviors. The study analyzed the performance degradation when the learned policy fails to imitate the expert. The theorem is more applicable in interactive procedures, such as querying the expert during training. Table 2 compares prior work on reducing RL to SL, considering the goal of maximizing long-term reward and applicability to continuous and discrete action spaces. The study compares algorithms for both continuous and discrete action spaces, focusing on optimality, off-policy learning, and access to expert knowledge. It discusses supervised learning without expert labels, using exploration data for performance guarantees. Theorem 1 relates apprenticeship learning to classification, similar to prior work by Ross & Bagnell (2010). The authors reduce apprenticeship learning to classification, incorporating action costs with AGGREVATE and AGGREVATED methods. Hinge loss is used for pre-training and surrogate loss for optimal trajectories. Their method offers a new policy gradient approach to reducing RL to SL. The authors present a new perspective on reducing RL to SL by ensuring i.i.d. samples in the replay buffer. A comparison with the current best method is provided in Table 2. The proof of Theorem 1 is based on direct policy differentiation. The pairwise ranking policy in Eq (2) constructs a ranking policy gradient. The pairwise ranking policy gradient constructs a probability distribution over actions when m=2. For m>2, this conclusion does not hold. Introducing a dummy action helps form a probability distribution for RPG. The algorithm increases the probability of best actions and decreases the probability of the dummy action. If RPG converges to an optimal policy, the probability of taking the best action is 1. Introducing a dummy trajectory with trajectory reward forms a probability distribution. The proof shows that a valid trajectory probability distribution is formed by introducing a dummy action in RPG. The focus is on increasing the probability of optimal trajectories, with the condition that \u03bbm satisfies a specific range. The larger the action dimension, the less constraint there is on the \u03bb-values. By setting \u03c0(a = a \u2032 |s) = 1 \u2212 \u2211 i \u03c0(a = ai|s), a valid probability distribution over the action space is constructed. The Listwise Policy Gradient (LPG) method is introduced to optimize the ranking of actions based on return in RL. It aims to increase the probability of each action being ranked higher among all actions by using a softmax formulation. This approach simplifies the computation of probabilities for action rankings, making it more feasible than considering all permutations. The Listwise Policy Gradient (LPG) method optimizes action ranking in RL using a softmax formulation. Theorem 4 shows that the vanilla policy gradient with a softmax layer optimizes action probabilities. The vanilla policy gradient optimizes action probabilities with a softmax layer, aiming for the highest long-term reward. To maintain optimality in MDPs, trajectories need to cover all initial states. Reward shaping can help achieve this, but a more practical approach is dynamic trajectory reward shaping. Dynamic trajectory reward shaping is implemented by setting c(s) = mins\u2208S 1 r(\u03c4 |s(\u03c4, 1) = s), \u2200s \u2208 S1. During exploration, the best trajectory for each initial state is tracked to update c(s) with its reward. If Condition 2 is not met, additional prior knowledge is needed to construct the replay buffer. The practical implementation and theoretical study for general MDPs are not covered in this work. The RL objective is transformed into a supervised learning problem, linking the log probability of a trajectory to its state-action distribution. This approach is discussed in the context of UNOP trajectory probability. Theorem 2 is proven by connecting trajectory probability of UNOP with state-action distribution. Lemma 1 states that the averaged state-action pair log-likelihood over horizon T is a weighted sum over the entire state-action space. The proof involves maximizing a lower bound associated with a subset of trajectories determined by a threshold c. The lower bound of expected long-term performance is maximized by setting w(\u03c4) as an arbitrary positive constant. The existence of UNOP is used to establish Eq (44) based on state-action pairs. The optimal solution for the objective function is a uniformly (near)-optimal policy \u03c0*. The optimal solution of Eq (49) is also the (near)-optimal solution for the original RL problem. By contradiction, if \u03c0 is assumed to be optimal, a better policy \u03c0' can be found with higher probability on the optimal trajectory and zero probability on others. This contradicts the assumption, proving that such trajectories do not exist. The proof shows that if the probability of sampling a trajectory from a policy is zero, then that trajectory does not exist. The RPG policy is used in the proof to learn a deterministic optimal policy. The off-policy learning framework relates sample complexity to exploration and supervised learning efficiency in a specific MDP. The exploration efficiency of an exploration strategy in a specific MDP can be quantified by how frequently optimal trajectories are encountered. Supervised learning efficiency under the probably approximately correct framework is determined by the number of samples needed for good generalization performance. The sample complexity of the off-policy learning framework can be theoretically analyzed by considering efficiency in both stages. Improving exploration efficiency is not the focus, as it is highly related to MDP properties. The exploration strategy should be designed based on domain knowledge of the MDP. The exploration strategy in MDPs should be designed based on domain knowledge to improve efficiency. The frequency of encountering optimal trajectories is crucial for sample efficiency in RPG. The off-policy framework's benefit is limited in MDPs with small transition probabilities. Training details for ranking policy gradient are provided, using a convolutional neural network similar to DQN. The RPG network is updated every four timesteps with a minibatch size of 32. The replay ratio is set to eight for all baselines and RPG, except for ACER where the default setting from openai baselines is used for better performance."
