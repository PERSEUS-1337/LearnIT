    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Learning Opportunities With Creation of Open Source Textbooks (LOW COST) Act of 2014\". Congress finds that the average student at a 4-year university spent $1,222 per year on college books and supplies. The gross margin on new college textbooks was 25.6 percent in 2012. College textbook prices have risen at twice the rate of annual inflation over the last two decades, with new textbook prices increasing by 82 percent over the last decade. An open source material project could reduce college textbook costs and increase accessibility to educational materials. (5) College-level open source course materials in math, physics, and chemistry are a priority. (6) The scientific workforce in Federal agencies and research centers could contribute. (7) Federal oversight is needed for standard, publicly vetted textbooks to maintain quality and accuracy. SEC. 3. OPEN SOURCE MATERIAL PILOT PROGRAM. The Director is required to develop college freshman-level open source materials covering physics, chemistry, and calculus within 1 year of the Act's enactment. These materials must be posted on the Federal Open Source Material Website within 4 years. Screening procedures for accuracy must be established before publication on the website. The Director must develop open source materials for college freshman-level physics, chemistry, and calculus within 1 year. Procedures for checking accuracy and educational effectiveness of the materials must be established before publication on the Federal Open Source Material Website within 4 years. The Director will establish a Federal Open Source Material Website where materials can be freely accessed, downloaded, and modified by the public. Federal agencies are required to use open source materials. Federal agencies must collaborate to verify the accuracy of open source materials on the Federal Open Source Material Website. Agencies spending over $10,000,000 on scientific education must allocate 2% for this collaboration. The Director will create regulations for implementing the Act, including standards for redistribution and attribution of open source materials. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDirector - Director of the National Science Foundation.\nFederal open source material website - Website established under section 4(a).\nHigh quality - Tested for optimal student engagement, content consumption, editorial peer review, free of copyright violations.\nOpen source materials - Materials available free of charge, downloadable, redistributable, changeable by the general public. The Comptroller General must submit a report to Congress by July 1, 2018, detailing the open source materials created or adapted under the Act, their adoption, and the savings generated for students, States, and the Federal Government through their use."
