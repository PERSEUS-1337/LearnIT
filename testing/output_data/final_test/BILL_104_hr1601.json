    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Space Station Authorization Act of 1995\". The Congress finds that the development and operation of the International Space Station is in the national interest of the United States. NASA has restructured the project and private ventures will play a significant role in lowering costs and increasing benefits. Rescoping or redesigning the station will lead to costly delays and increased costs. The development and operation of the International Space Station is in the national interest of the United States. Total program costs have been identified and capped to ensure financial discipline. Mission planning and engineering functions should be coordinated to contain costs. Complete program authorizations promote stability and reduce cost growth. The International Space Station is a key component of a well-funded civil space program that balances human space flight with science, aeronautics, and technology. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the head of NASA, and \"cost threat\" is a potential cost change in the Space Station Program. Authorization of Appropriations for the International Space Station is limited to $13,141,000,000 for fiscal year 1996 onwards, with a cap of $2,121,000,000 per year. Funds cannot be allocated unless the Administrator certifies that program reserves exceed all known cost threats. The Administrator must certify that program reserves exceed all known cost threats and there are no foreseen delays in the International Space Station's development. If certification cannot be made, a report must be submitted detailing the circumstances and remedial actions taken or to be taken. The Administrator may purchase the Clear Lake Development Facility for $35,000,000, including the Sonny Carter Training Facility and surrounding land, using funds authorized by this Act. Any report submitted must include comments from involved parties. SEC. 5. COORDINATION WITH SPACE SHUTTLE. The Administrator will coordinate engineering functions of the Space Shuttle program with the Space Station Program Office to minimize overlapping activities and maintain complementary capabilities at one lead center for human spacecraft engineering and astronaut training. SEC. 6. COMMERCIALIZATION OF SPACE STATION. The Congress prioritizes economic development in Earth orbital space through the construction of the International Space Station. Utilizing free market principles and engaging commercial providers will reduce operational costs for all partners. The Administrator is required to deliver a market study to Congress within 60 days of the President's budget request for fiscal year 1997, focusing on commercial ventures for the Space Station. The Administrator is promoting commercial opportunities and cost savings through international partnerships and commercial approaches for Space Station operations. Commercial users will reimburse the United States Federal Government for their use of the Space Station. The Sense of Congress emphasizes the need for reforms in NASA programs, citing the cost incentive fee contract for the International Space Station and the consolidation of accountability. The Administrator is required to provide an annual report on all space station costs, including payments to Russia. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 28, 1995. Attest: ROBIN H. CARLE, Clerk."
