The findings of Congress highlight the mission to establish a sovereign, free, secure, and united Iraq at peace with its neighbors after the removal of Saddam Hussein. Despite democratic progress in Iraq, the government faces continuous attacks from insurgents and terrorists, leading to growing sectarian conflict that threatens regional stability and provides safe havens for terrorists. The National Intelligence Estimate for Iraq in 2007 emphasized the importance of Coalition forces in stabilizing Iraq. There are concerns that rapid withdrawal of these forces could lead to neighboring countries openly intervening in the conflict, with evidence of Syria and Iran supporting efforts to undermine stability in Iraq. Iran has provided arms, financial support, and training for militias in Iraq, potentially supplying improvised explosive devices to groups attacking US forces. Israeli Prime Minister Olmert warned of regional consequences if the US withdraws from Iraq prematurely, impacting neighboring Arab countries with moderate governments and stability against radical forces. Ayman al-Zawahiri and Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have expressed the desire to spread militant extremist Islam globally, beyond just expelling Americans from Iraq. Their commitment to establishing an Islamic state and defending it is a cause for concern regarding the potential consequences of a premature US withdrawal from Iraq.

Petraeus was confirmed as the new commander of United States and allied forces in Iraq in January 2007.

Despite policy disagreements, all Members of Congress support the United States Armed Forces who have served honorably in the mission to fight terrorism and protect national security. The sacrifices made by the Armed Forces and their families, including the ultimate sacrifice, must be acknowledged.
