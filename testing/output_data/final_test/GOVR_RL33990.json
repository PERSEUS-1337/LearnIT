    "content": "The FS was established in 1905 through the merger of the USDA Bureau of Forestry and the Forestry Division of the General Land Office. Its early focus was on preventing wildfires in national forests, with a belief that fast, aggressive control was efficient. The agency developed a 10-acre policy in 1926 and a 10:00 a.m. policy in 1935 to keep wildfires small. In 1935, the FS implemented the 10:00 a.m. policy for fires exceeding 10 acres, focusing on control before the next burning period. The goal was to suppress large fires during cooler, calmer conditions at night and early morning. By the 1970s, the effectiveness of aggressive fire control policies was questioned as research showed wildfires could benefit ecosystems. Budget challenges and a study suggested that fire control policies could lead to excessive expenditures. Following concerns raised after the 1988 fires in Yellowstone about high fuel loads leading to costly fires, the National Commission on Wildfire Disasters reported dangerously high fuel accumulations in 1994. The summer of 1994 saw severe fires, prompting calls for action to prevent future severe fire seasons. Additionally, there were worries about federal firefighting resources being diverted to protect private residences instead of federal lands. This led to a review of federal fire policy by the Clinton Administration, resulting in the release of the new Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy & Program Review in December 1995. The report in December 1995 recommended changing federal fire policy to prioritize equal protection for private property and federal resources. This change was implemented after being accepted by the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior. Concerns about wildfire threats persist, with the General Accounting Office issuing reports in 1999 and 2009 urging for a cohesive wildfire protection strategy. The Clinton Administration developed the National Fire Plan in response to the severe 2000 fire season, which was supported by additional funding from Congress in the FY2001 Interior appropriations act. The FY2001 Interior appropriations act provided increased funding for wildfire management, leading to the development of the Healthy Forests Initiative by the Bush Administration. Funding for federal fire programs has continued to rise over the past 15 years, with appropriations allocated to three categories: protection of federal lands, assistance for protection of non-federal lands, and other fire-related expenditures. The Forest Service and Department of the Interior utilize three fire appropriation accounts to fund various operations. The federal fire programs are funded through fire appropriation accounts, which include activities such as preparedness and suppression operations. The data from agency budget justifications have been rearranged to show consistent trends since 1999. Wildfire management funds are used to protect federal lands, with appropriations shown in Table 1 for FY1999-FY2007. More recent data is available in Table 2. Federal wildfire funding includes assistance to state and local governments, communities, and private landowners, as well as other fire-related activities. Funding for federal lands is predetermined for specific efforts like suppression or preparedness, while funding for non-federal lands allows more discretion in use. The BLM previously included fire research and facility funds in its preparedness budget. Tables show appropriations by fiscal year, with emergency funding noted for the year provided. Agencies could borrow from other accounts for fire suppression and emergencies. Total federal land fire management appropriations have increased significantly since FY2001, with fluctuations based on the severity of the previous fire season. Fire preparedness funding, which includes prevention, detection, equipment, training, and personnel, saw a substantial rise in FY2001, with a larger increase for DOI compared to FS. Funding remained stable from FY2004 to FY2011, but there was a notable increase in FS preparedness funding in FY2012. The law provided a substantial increase in FS preparedness funding and a modest decline in DOI preparedness funding. The increase in FS preparedness funding was due to a realignment of costs shifted to the suppression account in previous years. Wildfire fighting funds have fluctuated widely over the past decade, ranging from less than $430 million in FY1999 to $2.41 billion in FY2008, with variations based on the severity of the previous fire season. Appropriations for fire suppression for both the FS and DOI agencies doubled from FY1996 levels due to a severe season in 1996. Funding rose steadily from FY2002 to FY2008, then stabilized through FY2011. In FY2012, suppression appropriations were reduced significantly, but offset by increases in supplemental funds, including FLAME funds established by the FLAME Act in FY2010. FLAME funds were established by the FLAME Act in FY2010 to provide additional funding for wildfire suppression efforts. The FY2010 act allocated $413 million for the FS FLAME fund and $61 million for the DOI FLAME fund. Subsequent appropriations for FY2011 and FY2012 saw varying amounts allocated to the FS and DOI FLAME funds, with a total decrease in funds available for wildfire suppression in FY2012 compared to previous years. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $855 million for wildfire suppression efforts, with $539 million for the FS and $316 million for DOI. This is a decrease from previous years, with funding levels lower than FY2011 and FY2010. Wildfire site rehabilitation funds have been stable, mostly going to the BLM for treating burned DOI lands, with annual funds ranging between $20 and $25 million since FY2000. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $13 million for DOI site rehabilitation funding, a decrease of $20 million from FY2011. The FS received significant wildfire funds for site rehabilitation in FY2001, FY2002, and FY2008, accounting for 81% of FS wildfire appropriations since FY2000. No funding was provided for FS site rehabilitation in FY2012. Fuel reduction funding aims to protect lands from wildfire damages by lowering fuel loads on federal lands. Total fuel reduction funding has been stable at $20-25 million annually since FY2000. Total fuel reduction funding more than tripled in FY2001 and rose slowly through FY2007. Funding increased substantially in FY2008 and FY2009 due to the economic stimulus. However, appropriations declined significantly in FY2010 and FY2011. In FY2012, fuel reduction funding for DOI was 14% below FY2011, the lowest level since FY2000. The FS proposed shifting funding for areas outside the Wildland-Urban Interface into a new account. The FY2012 appropriations law directs the FS and DOI to spend fuel reduction funds on highest-priority projects in highest-priority areas, removing previous requirements. Funds have been used for wood energy programs and biomass grants. In FY2010, $10.0 million was allocated for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund to restore national forest landscapes through fuel reduction. The FY2012 appropriations law directs the FS and DOI to spend fuel reduction funds on highest-priority projects in highest-priority areas. These programs contribute to fuel reduction for national forests by providing markets for fuels to be removed. States are responsible for fire protection of non-federal lands, with federal assistance programs funded under the FS State and Private Forestry branch. The State and Private Forestry (S&PF) branch provides financial and technical assistance for fire prevention, control, and prescribed fire use. The FS transfers excess equipment to state and local firefighting forces and supports volunteer fire departments. Funding for fire assistance comes through wildfire appropriations and economic stimulus legislation. The 2002 farm bill created a community fire protection program to assist communities in protecting against wildfires. The 2008 farm bill created biomass energy grant programs to stimulate markets for fuel for wildfire protection. Wildfire funds were provided for economic assistance, including training and loans for local economies. Additionally, the FS and DOI received funding to aid communities recovering from severe fires. Funding for wildfire assistance programs in rural areas fluctuated widely from FY2001 to FY2012, with significant increases in some years and substantial decreases in others. Total assistance funds for protecting non-federal lands increased substantially in FY2001, reaching $148 million, but fell below that level in FY2010. The fluctuations in funding do not have a single explanation, and multiple factors likely contributed to the changes over time. Funding for wildfire assistance programs in rural areas varied significantly from FY2001 to FY2012. FS state and volunteer assistance programs saw increases and decreases in funding over the years, with notable spikes in FY2008 and FY2009. Funding for FS community assistance after the 2000 fires was a one-time allocation, while DOI rural assistance funds were provided annually until FY2010. No funds were allocated for FY2011 and FY2012 for DOI rural assistance. Funding for the Forest Service biomass energy programs has been minimal, with no funds provided for FY2011 and FY2012. Although discretionary funding was authorized for these programs, no appropriations were made through FY2012. However, the FS did receive $49 million in funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for wood-to-energy projects. Additionally, the appropriations committee reports for FY2010 and FY2011 directed $5 million in Hazardous Fuels to be used for biomass energy projects. The sustained level of funding authorized for fuel reduction on federal lands for wildfire protection and renewable energy production reflects some interest. The FY2012 appropriations law provided $5 million for biomass grants through the Woody Biomass Utilization Grant Program. Wildfire appropriations also cover research, fire facilities construction, and forest health management. Funding for the Forest Service biomass energy programs has been minimal, with no funds provided for FY2011 and FY2012, but received $49 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for wood-to-energy projects. The FS funding was reduced by 9%, with appropriations for wildfire research and development averaging over $22 million annually. Both DOI and the FS received funds to improve fire facilities, with fluctuating levels of funding for fire preparedness. FS wildfire funds for fire facilities declined after FY2001, except for emergency funds in FY2008. The FS received wildfire funds for forest health management, focusing on insect and disease control on federal lands. Funding increased from $12 million in FY2001 to $32 million in FY2011, but dropped to $24.3 million in FY2012. Congressional attention is on the high cost of wildfire management. The high cost of wildfire management on federal lands has received significant congressional attention. Issues include funding for fire protection to reduce fuel loads, federal role in protecting non-federal lands, and post-fire rehabilitation. Federal wildfire appropriations have substantially increased since the 1990s, averaging $1.1 billion for FY1994-FY1999 and $3.4 billion for FY2004-FY2009. The cost of wildfire management on federal lands has increased significantly, reaching $4.5 billion. Funding has fluctuated over the years, with higher costs in FY2008 and FY2009. Management costs have risen due to severe wildfire seasons, with an average of 3.32 million acres burned annually in the 1990s and 6.93 million acres burned annually in the 2000s. The threat of severe wildfires has grown due to high biomass levels and increased development in forested areas. The cost of wildfire management has increased significantly due to the rising number of homes and people in forested areas. Wildfire management funding has also increased, with a greater share of discretionary appropriations being spent on wildfire management in recent years. Concerns have focused on the high costs of wildfire management, especially fire suppression expenditures, and the indirect effects on agency programs. Recommendations include state/local governments paying a fair share, better fuel reduction efforts, and improved cost control accountability. Inconsistent cost-share agreements and unclear government responsibilities have led to increased reliance on federal fire protection. The 1995 federal fire policy review emphasized increasing local responsibility for wildfire protection and suppression on non-federal lands. Reports highlight the need for significant local cost responsibility to incentivize homeowners and local governments to take action. Better cost control and accountability are also necessary, with a focus on establishing clear goals, strategies, and performance measures to contain wildland fire costs. Cost containment goals for the wildland fire program are limited due to a lack of clear strategies and performance measures. Integrating wildfire management into land planning and maintaining local capacity for initial attack on new wildfires are key aspects. The high cost and lack of evidence led to the abandonment of the 10-acre policy in the 1970s. The high cost and lack of evidence led agencies to abandon the 10-acre policy for wildfire planning in the 1970s. The Strategic Issues Panel highlighted the challenges of fire suppression, including the reluctance to take risks, ineffective suppression techniques, and public expectations. Fire managers are not typically held accountable for excessive spending on fire control, but are blamed for insufficient efforts. The panel recommended better fire cost data and a benefit-cost measure for evaluating suppression cost effectiveness. Wildfire suppression appropriations have exceeded $1 billion annually since FY2001, reaching over $2.4 billion in FY2008. Agencies can borrow unobligated funds for emergency firefighting, leading to expenditures surpassing agency appropriations for over a decade. The FS historically had running balances in mandatory spending accounts funded by timber receipts. The decline in timber sales since 1990 has led to a decrease in the Knutson-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund balance, resulting in the need for the Forest Service to borrow funds from other accounts for firefighting expenses. Prior to FY2000, borrowing authority was not an issue due to more discretionary funds being available for borrowing. Since FY2001, fire management expenditures have averaged 47% of discretionary FS appropriations, totaling 56% in FY2008. Concerns arose about borrowing for firefighting affecting other programs, leading to legislation like the FLAME Act to establish a separate fund for major wildfire suppression efforts. The FLAME Act, enacted in Title V of P.L. 111-88, established separate FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Funds for the FS and DOI, funded from annual appropriations. The funds can be used for wildfires exceeding 300 acres or threatening lives, property, or resources. Annual reports on fund usage and estimated suppression costs are required. A \"cohesive wildland fire management strategy\" must be prepared and revised every five years as recommended by the GAO. The funds terminate if not used for three consecutive fiscal years. The FLAME funds insulate federal land management programs from financial impacts of wildfire suppression efforts, but do not address lost resource management time. There are no incentives for fire managers to reduce costs, leading to high fuel accumulation attributed to past land management practices and historic fire suppression. Fuel reduction efforts, such as prescribed burning and thinning, have increased since the mid-1990s to reduce the threat of significant damages by wildfires. Acreage treated from FY1995 to FY2004 saw a 400% increase, with activities aimed at lowering wildfire suppression costs and mitigating ecological damage from high fuel loads. Fuel reduction efforts have increased since the mid-1990s, with treated acreage seeing a 400% increase from FY1995 to FY2004. However, treatment acreage fell in FY2005 and FY2006, and has not returned to previous levels. Data on treatments post-FY2007 are not included in the analysis. Annual fuel treatment acreage has stabilized at less than 3 million acres annually, less than 1% of federal lands, making it a challenge to treat high-risk areas in a timely manner. The funding for fuel reduction activities on FS and DOI lands is insufficient, with appropriations below previous levels. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2000 aimed to increase fuel reduction but challenges remain due to environmental documentation and public participation requirements. The FS and DOI established expedited processes for environmental review and public involvement in fuel reduction activities, including categorical exclusions from NEPA. However, a court ruling in 2007 halted the use of one CE. Concerns exist about limited public oversight leading to potential commercial harvests and road construction under the guise of fuel reduction. Suggestions have been made to focus fuel treatment in the wildland-urban interface for better protection of structures. The proportion of fuel treatments in the WUI has increased since FY2001. Research has shown the importance of reducing fuels close to structures to protect them from wildfires. However, fuel reduction beyond a certain distance does not provide additional protection. Agencies need to develop a cohesive strategy with funding to address fuel reduction and wildfire issues. GAO emphasized the need for this strategy in 2005 and 2006, broadening the focus to better address the interrelated nature of fuel reduction efforts and wildfire response. The goal of fuel treatment is to lower fuel loads and eliminate fuel ladders. The belief behind fuel treatment is that reducing fuel loads and eliminating fuel ladders will decrease wildfire extent, damages, and control costs. Limited empirical research supports this presumption, with some studies showing that fuel treatments can moderate extreme fire behavior in frequent fire ecosystems. However, results vary, with some studies finding no evidence of resource benefits from prescribed burning in certain ecosystems. Overall, prescribed burning generally reduces fire severity, but mechanical fuel reduction may not consistently do so. Limited research has been conducted on the efficacy of fuel treatments in reducing wildfire severity. Increasing fuel treatment funding and efforts may not consistently reduce fire severity, and limited research has examined the impacts of mechanical fuel reduction with prescribed burning or commercial logging. Some suggest using biomass for renewable energy production, such as liquid transportation fuels or heat/electricity generation. This could help remove hazardous fuels from forests and potentially replace fossil fuels for energy production. Some FS fuel reduction funds have been allocated for wood energy programs. For FY2009-FY2011, $5 million annually was used for biomass grants under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. The Administration proposed $5 million for the Community Wood Energy Program and $15 million for the Forest Biomass to Energy Program in FY2011, but Congress did not fund them. These programs aim to reduce fuel in federal forests by creating markets for removed fuels, including woody biomass from non-federal lands. However, the funding is limited and other federal programs also support renewable energy production from biomass. Some federal programs support renewable energy production from biomass, but concerns exist about diverting federal woody biomass from traditional markets to renewable energy markets. Initial funding for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program was used for transporting wood waste from existing wood production facilities to energy production facilities, instead of stimulating removal of woody biomass waste from forests. Woody biomass from forests faces challenges in competing with other users like pulp mills and particleboard plants. The challenge with using woody biomass from forests is the high fuel loads scattered in diverse sizes, making collection and transport costly. Federal assistance for wildfire protection on non-federal lands has been debated and funding reduced in past administrations. The federal role in assisting states shifted after the severe fire season in 1994, leading to a change in federal fire policy prioritizing private property equally. The federal fire policy shifted to prioritize private property and federal resources equally, based on values at risk. Federal funding for state and volunteer fire assistance significantly increased, reaching $314 million in FY2009. The 2002 farm bill authorized the Community Fire Protection Program to assist local fire protection planning and activities. Questions remain about the role of federal firefighters in protecting structures and communities. States are responsible for fire protection on non-federal lands, with support from programs like FIREWISE to educate landowners on protecting their properties. The National Interagency Fire Center coordinates firefighting forces to areas with wildfires, providing excess personal property to state or local fire departments. Questions arise about the sufficiency of programs and federal financial assistance. Concerns exist about federal firefighting actions and the lack of training for fighting structure fires. The federal response to wildfire damages on private lands is also questioned. Response to wildfire damages on private lands and resources has been questioned, as recovery efforts may not always be covered by private insurance. Homeowners and landowners without adequate insurance may not receive compensation for their losses. Some suggest that the National Flood Insurance Program could serve as a model for federal wildfire insurance to address these concerns. The National Flood Insurance Program is proposed as a model for federal wildfire insurance for private landowners. Private insurance is seen as more efficient than government programs, but concerns remain about building in high-risk areas. Post-fire rehabilitation efforts have traditionally received modest funding, with increased attention since 2000. Post-fire rehabilitation efforts have increased attention since 2000. The Bush Administration authorized NEPA categorical exclusions for post-fire activities in 2003, but regulations were challenged and suspended. Legislation in the 109th Congress included a bill for forest recovery after catastrophic events. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Act, included in the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, provides a collaborative process for large-scale forest restoration projects. Other bills have proposed modified procedures for post-fire and forest restoration programs. The Obama Administration requested funding for the Integrated Resource Restoration program within the National Forest System account. Post-fire rehabilitation needs and funding have become a focus in the 112th Congress following a major wildfire in Arizona. The burned area emergency response program is under scrutiny for authorized activities, funding, and public involvement. Congressional consideration may be given to the program in the 112th Congress. The 112th Congress may consider a program for rehabilitation activities, but there is a lack of data on the adequacy of current activities. It is uncertain how often rehabilitation is needed or feasible, and whether environmental reviews have delayed these activities. Opponents fear changes could reduce oversight of salvage logging decisions, which can cause environmental damage. Proponents argue that timber salvage can aid in site rehabilitation and expedited processes are necessary. The data on acres burned annually in the United States since 1960 and total appropriations to the FS and DOI wildland fire management accounts are presented in Table A-1 and Table A-2 respectively, along with corresponding graphical representations in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Regrowth on the site is important, and expedited processes are necessary to utilize the timber before it deteriorates."
