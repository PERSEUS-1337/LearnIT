    "content": "The \"Immigration Reform Transition Act of 1997\" amends Section 240A of the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding deportation and adjustment of status. The changes apply to removal cases initiated on or after April 1, 1997. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-208, Division C, 110 Stat. 3009) is amended by removing paragraphs (5) and (7) from Section 309, subsection (c). Additionally, Section 240A of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended in various subsections. The Attorney General has the discretion to cancel removal and adjust the status of certain aliens covered by the settlement agreement in American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh if they meet specific criteria, including not being convicted of an aggravated felony and being a Salvadoran national who entered before December 19, 1990. Eligibility criteria for certain aliens covered by the ABC settlement agreement include being a national who entered the United States before specific dates and registered for benefits by certain deadlines. Aliens covered by the ABC settlement agreement must have entered the United States before specific dates and registered for benefits by certain deadlines. Aliens covered by the ABC settlement agreement must have entered the United States before specific dates and registered for benefits by certain deadlines. The alien must be Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, or Salvadoran who applied for asylum before April 1, 1990, and had no decision on their application by April 1, 1997. The alien must not fall under certain sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act and must be removable under US law. To qualify for benefits under the ABC settlement agreement, an alien must have been physically present in the United States for at least seven years, demonstrate good moral character, and show that their removal would cause extreme hardship to themselves or their family members who are US citizens. To qualify for benefits under the ABC settlement agreement, an alien must have been physically present in the United States for at least seven years, demonstrate good moral character, and show that their removal would cause extreme hardship to themselves or their family members who are US citizens. Additionally, an individual may be eligible if they have been physically present in the US for a continuous period of not less than 10 years following the commission of an act or assumption of a status that could lead to deportation. To qualify for benefits under the ABC settlement agreement, an alien must have been physically present in the United States for at least seven years, demonstrate good moral character, and show that their removal would cause extreme hardship to themselves or their family members who are US citizens. Additionally, an individual may be eligible if they have been physically present in the US for a continuous period of not less than 10 years following the commission of an act or assumption of a status that could lead to deportation. Subsection (d) of this section shall not apply to determinations under this paragraph, and an alien shall not be considered to have failed to meet the requirements if they prove good moral character and show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to their US citizen or lawful permanent resident family members. The Attorney General's determination of an alien's continuous physical presence in the US is final and not subject to court review. This does not limit the application of eligibility determinations for discretionary relief under the Act. Any alien eligible for suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal due to recent amendments can file one motion to reopen within a specified time period. The Attorney General will set a deadline for these motions to be filed, starting no later than 120 days after the enactment of this Act and lasting for 180 days."
