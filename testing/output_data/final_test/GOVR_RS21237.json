    "content": "The May 1998 nuclear tests by India and Pakistan ended almost 50 years of nuclear ambiguity. The 1999 Kargil conflict and 2002 Kashmir crisis challenged the belief that nuclear weapons could bring stability. South Asia remains a nuclear flashpoint with the potential for terrorists to access weapons of mass destruction. India began its nuclear program in 1947 after a border war defeat by China in 1962 and China's nuclear test in 1964. India developed a nuclear infrastructure for both civilian and military purposes. India's nuclear infrastructure supports both civilian and military purposes, including reprocessing capabilities for mixed oxide fuel and plutonium-based weapons. Estimates suggest India has around 30-35 weapons, stored in component form, with the ability to deploy them within days using fighter aircraft. There is consensus that India is expanding its stockpile, especially if it utilizes unsafeguarded reactor-grade plutonium. India's delivery capability is focused on two contingencies - China and Pakistan. India's air force, more advanced than Pakistan's, relies on aircraft for retaliatory strikes. With 35 Mirage 2000 fighters capable of carrying nuclear weapons, India also has short-range ballistic missiles. The use of ballistic missiles adds instability to the security equation due to their high-priority target status. India's Prithvi ballistic missiles, with ranges of 150km and 250km, are conventionally armed. The deployment of Agni-II missiles with a 1500 km range and the testing of an 800 km range version earlier this year enhance India's rapid response capability. India's nuclear doctrine, released in January 2003, commits to a credible minimum deterrent with a \"No First Use\" policy and the right to retaliate. Pakistan's nuclear program dates back to the 1950s, with a focus on the uranium route to weapons. The Nuclear Command Authority in Pakistan is composed of a Political Council chaired by the Prime Minister and an Executive Council chaired by the National Security Advisor. The decision to start a crash nuclear weapons program was reportedly triggered by the loss of East Pakistan in January 1972. Pakistan focused on the uranium route to weapons, seeking technology from various sources including China and North Korea. It is estimated to have enough nuclear material for 30 to 50 nuclear weapons and the capability to assemble them quickly. Pakistan can deliver its nuclear weapons using F-16s purchased from the United States, with the necessary modifications. Additionally, Pakistan has acquired ballistic missile capabilities. Pakistan has acquired ballistic missile capabilities, deploying short-range and medium-range missiles. The Ghauri missiles are seen as potential delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons, capable of reaching New Delhi. Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is crucial for military parity with India, as it rejects the doctrine of no-first-use. Pakistan rejects the doctrine of no-first-use and maintains ambiguity regarding the use of nuclear weapons. President Musharraf stated that the possession of nuclear weapons implies they will be used under certain circumstances. Pakistan has taken steps to refine command and control of its nuclear weapons, including establishing a strategic force command. The connection to civilian leadership remains unclear. Pakistan's National Command Authority (NCA) was established in 2000 to oversee nuclear capabilities and advise President Musharraf on nuclear weapons development. The ongoing Kashmir conflict has raised concerns about the potential use of nuclear weapons if hostilities escalate. Some suggest Pakistan may use a small nuclear weapon to stop Indian advancement, but others see this as a risky strategy. Media reports indicate that having small nuclear arsenals may increase pressure to use them. The uncertainty about intentions regarding nuclear weapons could worsen stability in the region. India and Pakistan have been integrating nuclear weapons into their security strategies since 1998, which may escalate tensions due to the logic of nuclear deterrence. The desire to make nuclear forces more credible may increase their usability, especially with the use of ballistic missiles. However, the short ranges of these missiles create a hair-trigger situation with flight times as short as 5 minutes. The separation of warhead components has been used for command and control purposes, but this approach becomes risky when facing short-range ballistic missiles without defense. Improving command and control of nuclear forces is crucial, as a nuclear exchange could result in the deaths of millions on both sides. A nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan could result in the deaths of 9 to 12 million people, with 2 to 6 million injured. Despite past rhetoric, there have been efforts towards confidence-building measures over the past 30 years, including hotlines between army commanders and agreements for troop notification. President Musharraf expressed reluctance towards nuclear conflict in a 2002 interview, emphasizing the need for responsible decision-making. In 1990, the Military Commission was created, and agreements were made for prior notification of troop movements and ballistic missile tests. Despite sporadic implementation, the Lahore Agreement in 1999 aimed to reduce the risk of unauthorized nuclear weapon use and enhance confidence-building measures between India and Pakistan. The Lahore process faced challenges after a military incursion in 2001 but resumed with confidence-building measures announced in 2004. The curr_chunk discusses various security-related meetings and agreements between India and Pakistan, including discussions on advance notification of missile tests, border security meetings, and talks on disengagement on the Siachen glacier. Congress has been involved in efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation by both countries since 1978. The U.S. is considering its leverage towards India and Pakistan in light of the global war on terrorism and limited Pakistani cooperation in nonproliferation. The U.S. is reevaluating its leverage towards India and Pakistan in light of global terrorism and limited Pakistani cooperation in nonproliferation. Questions arise about the need for new sources of leverage, focusing on averting nuclear use, providing cooperative threat reduction assistance, and the effectiveness of economic sanctions."
