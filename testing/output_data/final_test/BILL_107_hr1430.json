    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Building, Renovating, Improving, and Constructing Kids' Schools Act\". Congress finds that the average public school in America is 42 years old, with 29 percent in the oldest condition. Reports estimate it would cost $112 billion to improve the Nation's schools, with one-third needing extensive repair. Many schools lack the necessary infrastructure for technology. The Federal Government can assist State, regional, and local entities in addressing school construction needs by providing low-interest loans for paying interest on bonds and supporting State-administered school construction programs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"bond\" which encompasses any obligation, \"Governor\" which refers to the chief executive officer of a State, \"local educational agency\" as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and \"public school facility\" excluding certain athletic or non-government owned facilities. A qualified school construction bond is defined as a bond issued by a state or local entity for the construction, rehabilitation, or repair of a public school facility. A stabilization fund refers to the fund established under section 5302 of the Act. The term \"State\" refers to each of the several States of the United States, along with other territories and regions. SEC. 4. Loans for school construction bond interest payments and other support. Loans and state-administered programs under section 5(b) provide funds to States for making loans to entities for school construction bond interest payments. Fifty percent of the funds must be used for loans, and up to fifty percent can support State revolving funds. The funds support State revolving fund programs or other State-administered programs that assist entities in paying for construction, rehabilitation, repair, or acquisition. States with restrictions may use the funds to support programs if they have laws prohibiting certain loans. Governors of each State can make requests for funding. The Governor of each State must request assistance from the Secretary of the Treasury for funds under this Act. Priority should be given to entities with projects for schools in greatest need, considering factors like high costs per child. Children from low-income families living in areas with high concentrations of low-income families, sparsely populated areas, or areas experiencing high population growth, and schools with inadequate facilities and resources may qualify for assistance under this Act. States using funds for loans or programs must repay the stabilization fund. States receiving assistance under this Act must repay the stabilization fund, including the loan amount and interest at a 4.5 percent annual rate. Repayment begins after the 15th year of eligibility, with full repayment required within a 10-year period. Exceptions exist for interest accrual before January 1, 2007. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funding for fiscal year prior to 2007 is enough to fully fund each State at 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure for special education. The applicable interest rate for funds allocated to States under section 5(b) is 0 percent starting from January 1, 2007. The amount appropriated for Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act may not be sufficient to provide each State with at least 20 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure for special education services. If the funding is inadequate, the percentage allocated to each State increases to 2.5 percent for 30 percent of the expenditure and 3.5 percent for 40 percent. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Education are jointly responsible for ensuring proper distribution of funds under the Act. Funds must only be used for paying interest on school construction bonds or specific costs outlined in the Act. The Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury oversee fund distribution under the Act. Funds are designated for interest on school construction bonds or specific costs outlined in the Act. The authorities cannot approve school construction plans but ensure funds supplement rather than replace state funding for school facilities. The Act designates funds for specific costs outlined in the Act, overseen by the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury. The authorities ensure funds supplement state funding for school facilities. From $20,000,000,000 in the stabilization fund, $400,000,000 will be provided to Indian tribes. 50% of the assistance must be used for school construction bonds, while the remaining 50% can support tribal programs. The Secretary of the Treasury will allocate funds from the stabilization fund to assist tribal governments with construction, rehabilitation, repair, or acquisition projects. Each State submitting a request will receive an amount based on their previous funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Education Act of 1965 allocates funds to States based on previous funding under the Act. The Secretary of the Treasury disburses the funds annually from October 1, 2001, to September 30, 2018. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Education jointly notify States of the amount of funds they may receive for loans and support."
