    "content": "The federal government plays a significant role in mental health care through direct services, payment, and support. Policymakers focus on quality, access, and cost of mental health care, with workforce being a crucial factor. Quality is influenced by provider skills, access by availability of skilled providers, and cost by provider wages. The mental health workforce is crucial for quality, access, and cost of care. While federal initiatives impact training, most regulation occurs at the state level. State boards set licensing requirements and scope of practice for mental health professionals. This report defines the mental health workforce and discusses how licensure requirements and scope of practice influence care quality, access, and costs. The mental health workforce is essential for quality, access, and cost of care. Licensure requirements, scope of practice, estimated numbers, and average wages of providers are key factors. Different perspectives exist on the composition of the workforce, with some taking a broad approach and others a narrow one. The National Academy of Medicine defines the workforce broadly to include various provider types. The mental health workforce includes physicians, psychologists, nurses, counselors, care managers, and social workers. SAMHSA and HRSA provide definitions of the workforce, with SAMHSA including psychiatry, psychology, social work, nursing, therapy, and counseling. The mental health workforce, as defined by SAMHSA and HRSA, includes licensed psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, psychiatric social workers, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, and family therapists. Eligibility for federal programs targeting provider shortages is determined by the designation of Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (MHPSAs), which focus on extreme workforce shortages. This definition specifically includes highly trained mental health professionals. The mental health workforce includes licensed professionals such as psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, and family therapists. Licensure requirements and scope of practice vary among these professions, with some able to prescribe medication and others focusing on psychosocial interventions. The mental health workforce includes various licensed professionals like psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, and family therapists. Licensure requirements are set by state licensing boards and are necessary to obtain and maintain a license in a specific health profession. These requirements are common across many states and focus on independent clinical practice. The table outlines licensure requirements for independent clinical practice across different provider types, focusing on the minimum education level needed for licensure. It does not include maintenance requirements like continuing education. Graduate education is typically required for mental health professionals to practice independently. To enroll in a graduate program to become an advanced practice psychiatric nurse, an individual must first be a registered nurse with a bachelor's degree in nursing. Other provider types in this report have different requirements for specific undergraduate degrees or prior licensing. Licensure for independent practice typically requires a period of postgraduate supervised practice. Supervised practice is required for licensure in various healthcare professions, such as psychiatry for physicians. State licensing boards mandate passing a national exam, with some states offering their own exams. The timing of the exam varies by state, and the scope of practice is determined at the state level by statute. The scope of practice for different healthcare provider types is determined at the state level. Table 2 outlines elements related to diagnosing and treating mental illness. In addition to these activities, providers may also engage in preventive care, case management, and consultation with other providers. Access to mental health care is influenced by the number of mental health providers available relative to the population. Data on the mental health workforce availability for analysis is not consistently accessible. The availability of mental health workforce data for analysis is limited, with information collected from various sources but not systematically available. HRSA designates Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas based on specific ratios, but does not consistently collect the data used for designation. The AHRF compiles health workforce data from different sources, with some data being outdated or infrequently updated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects national workforce data, including mental health professionals like psychiatrists and MFTs. However, the data from the Occupational Employment Statistics program has limitations as it excludes the self-employed. Other sources of mental health workforce size estimates may be more useful to policymakers than the AHRF. The Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) and Current Population Survey (CPS) provide workforce data for mental health professionals, but may overestimate the workforce size due to lack of distinctions between specific categories like licensed clinical psychologists and other psychologists. The Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) combines data from OES and CPS, but also lacks specific distinctions for certain professions like psychiatrists and MFTs. The Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) includes specific categories for psychiatrists, MFTs, psychology (clinical, counseling, and school psychologists), and social work (mental health and substance abuse social workers). Estimates show that clinical social workers are the most abundant mental health profession, with 112,040 mental health and substance abuse social workers in 2017. The workforce size of mental health and substance abuse social workers decreased by 1.8% from 2016 to 2017. The number of mental health and substance abuse social workers decreased by 1.8% from 2016 to 2017. The exact number of mental health social workers is not publicly available, but estimates suggest they are more abundant than clinical psychologists. The American Psychological Association identified around 100,305 licensed psychologists with doctoral degrees in 2015. The American Psychological Association (APA) estimated around 100,305 licensed psychologists with doctoral degrees in patient care in 2015, which is likely the upper limit for psychologists in the mental health workforce. Other estimates in 2017 show an increase in the workforce size of clinical, counseling, and school psychologists, with varying numbers reported by different sources such as the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES), Current Population Survey (CPS), and Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH). The number of Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) is lower than social workers and psychologists but higher than psychiatrists or Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nurses (APPNs). The workforce size of Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) increased by 13.8% from 2016 to 2017, with an estimated 42,880 MFTs in 2017. There are fewer psychiatrists than clinical social workers, psychologists, or MFTs, with 25,520 psychiatrists in 2017. Psychiatrists outnumber Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nurses (APPNs), with an estimated 27,500 psychiatrists in 2016. The American Medical Association (AMA) gathers physician workforce information in the Physician Masterfile. The AMA estimated 37,938 self-designated psychiatrists in 2013. The American Nurses Credentialing Center estimated 15,911 APPNs in 2016. Wages of mental health providers are presented in Table 3 from the BLS. The BLS provides mean and median annual wages for mental health providers, but the data may either over- or understate wages due to excluding self-employed workers. This exclusion can lead to lower wage estimates for clinical psychologists and clinical social workers compared to HRSA-defined provider types. The BLS data illuminates relative wages of mental health providers, showing psychiatrists as highest earners, followed by psychiatric nurses and psychologists. Marriage therapists earn more than clinical social workers. Understanding the mental health workforce helps policymakers address quality, access, and cost issues. Policymakers can use licensure requirements and scopes of practice to guide federal initiatives for improving mental health care quality. Policymakers can influence the size and composition of the mental health workforce by focusing on training initiatives for different types of providers, such as paraprofessionals and primary care professionals. This can help expand the workforce and improve access to care for individuals with mental illness. Policymakers can influence the size of the mental health workforce through federal programs like grants for training programs and incentives for individuals to enter mental health occupations. Strategies may target specific provider types or locations, and consider relative wages to direct people into high-growth fields. The federal government is the largest employer of mental health providers, including clinical psychologists and social workers. Cost and scopes of practice are factors in determining staffing priorities. Additional resources are available for information on each provider type. Key organizations in the mental health field include the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry, American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, and Association of Social Work Boards. These organizations play various roles such as accrediting educational programs and setting standards for practitioners. Key organizations in the mental health field include Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), National Association of Social Workers (NASW), Social Work Policy Institute (SWPI), Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nurses, American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (AANP), American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC), American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA), National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists (NACNS), National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN), Marriage and Family Therapists, American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT), and Association of Marital and Family Therapy Regulatory Boards (AMFTRB)."
