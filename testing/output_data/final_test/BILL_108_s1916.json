Open enrollment period for Survivor Benefit Plan starting October 1, 2005. During the open enrollment period starting October 1, 2005, eligible retired or former members can elect to participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan and may also choose to enroll in the Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan. An eligible retired or former member of the uniformed services, not participating in the Survivor Benefit Plan the day before the open enrollment period, is entitled to retired pay or would be entitled under chapter 1223 of title 10, but is under 60 years of age. A person making an election under paragraph (1) by reason of eligibility under paragraph (3)(A) is treated as providing a standard annuity under the Survivor Benefit Plan. A person eligible for the Survivor Benefit Plan can elect to increase coverage during the open enrollment period by choosing a higher base amount or providing annuity coverage for a dependent child. The Survivor Benefit Plan allows for annuity coverage for a spouse or former spouse at a base amount equal to that provided for a dependent child. Eligible participants can elect to join the Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan during the open enrollment period. The Survivor Benefit Plan offers annuity coverage for a spouse or former spouse, with the option to increase participation to the maximum level during open enrollment. Eligibility for certain participants may be limited if the annuity of a spouse or former spouse is computed under a specific section, but they can waive this during the open enrollment period. An election under section 1451(e) is irrevocable and must be made in writing before the end of the open enrollment period. The election allows for the designation of beneficiaries and specification of base amount, similar to the Survivor Benefit Plan. Additionally, a person choosing to provide a reserve-component annuity must make a specific designation as outlined in section 1448(e) of title 10, United States Code. The effective date for elections is the first day of the month following receipt by the Secretary concerned. The open enrollment period starts on October 1, 2005, lasting for a year. If the person dies within two years of making the election, it becomes void, and any reduction in retired pay is paid in a lump sum to the designated beneficiary. Certain provisions of law apply to these elections. The provisions of sections 1449, 1453, and 1454 of title 10, United States Code, apply to elections made under this section. The Secretary of Defense may require an additional premium for these elections, not exceeding 4.5 percent of the person's base amount. The Secretary of Defense may require an additional premium for elections made under this section, not exceeding 4.5 percent of the person's base amount.
