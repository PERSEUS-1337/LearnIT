    "content": "The \"Safe Routes to School Program Reauthorization Act\" authorizes $600,000,000 for the safe routes to school program annually from 2010 to 2014. The Safe Routes to School Program defines \"vicinity\" as the area within 2 miles of a school. The Secretary will establish a program to promote walking and biking to school for children in kindergarten through twelfth grade. The program aims to encourage a healthy lifestyle and safer transportation options for students. The Safe Routes to School Program aims to promote walking and biking for students in kindergarten through twelfth grade to improve safety, reduce traffic, fuel consumption, and air pollution near schools. Funds for the program will be apportioned among states based on student enrollment. The Safe Routes to School Program apportions funds based on student enrollment, with a minimum allocation of 0.5 percent. The Secretary sets aside up to 10 percent of funds for a State Incentive Matching Fund to provide additional funds to states matching federal funds with state funds. The distribution of funds for the Safe Routes to School Program is based on the amount of matching funds provided by each state. Any remaining funds are then distributed among all states according to a specific formula. Additionally, a portion of the funds is set aside for administrative expenses, research, and evaluation. The Safe Routes to School Program allocates funds based on matching contributions from states. A portion is reserved for administrative costs and research activities. States must administer the funds and provide financial assistance to eligible recipients for infrastructure projects. The Safe Routes to School Program allows states to use allocated funds for infrastructure projects that enhance nonmotorized transportation options for students, such as sidewalk improvements, traffic calming measures, and secure bicycle parking facilities near schools. Infrastructure-related projects under this section can be carried out on public roads, bicycle or pedestrian pathways near schools. States can use up to 10% of allocated funds for infrastructure improvements to create safe routes to bus stops located outside school vicinity. Noninfrastructure-related activities under this section allow for the use of allocated funds to promote walking, biking, and other nonmotorized transportation to school through public awareness campaigns, outreach, and traffic education for children. The allocated funds under this section can be used for various activities to promote safe routes to school, including traffic enforcement, student sessions on safety, and funding for training and volunteers. Managers of local safe routes to school programs can also be paid using these funds. The maximum allowable amount for a State is between 10% and 30% of the apportioned funds for a fiscal year. Each State receiving funds under this section must ensure equitable distribution for infrastructure and noninfrastructure activities, including planning grants for safe routes to school. Each State receiving funds under this section must allocate a portion to fund a full-time safe routes to school coordinator and form a State advisory committee for program guidance and progress reports. The Secretary will provide grants to a national nonprofit organization to operate a safe routes to school clearinghouse, develop educational programs, provide technical assistance, conduct awareness campaigns, and maintain a national database. The Secretary will establish a national safe routes to school task force composed of leaders in health, transportation, and education to assess and make recommendations on program implementation and evaluation. Funding for this task force will come from amounts set aside for administrative expenses. The Secretary will submit reports to Congress on the implementation and evaluation of the safe routes to school program, including recommendations and guidance. Funding for this will come from amounts set aside for research and evaluation activities. The Secretary will submit reports to Congress on the safe routes to school program, funded by amounts set aside for research and evaluation activities. Noninfrastructure and infrastructure projects under this section will have specific regulations to expedite construction and encourage timely expenditure of funds. The Secretary will collaborate with various agencies to develop measures for evaluating safe routes to school effectiveness and ensure consistent implementation of regulations by States and Federal Highway Administration staff to avoid delays in project implementation and optimize Federal funds. The Secretary will collaborate with agencies to develop measures for evaluating safe routes to school effectiveness, including standardized data collection, impact evaluation, and best practices issuance. Independent research organizations will be designated to conduct research. The Secretary will collaborate with agencies to develop measures for evaluating safe routes to school effectiveness, including standardized data collection, impact evaluation, and best practices issuance. Independent research organizations or authorities will conduct research and issue reports for wide dissemination to benefit the safe routes to school program, including measures of nonmotorized transportation use and safety, a school travel safety index, and additional research determined by the Secretary. A working group will be assembled to address school siting issues. A working group will be formed to address school siting issues, including the impact on walking and biking to school. The group will develop recommendations and best practices for States and local governments. Funding for this initiative will be provided, with funds allocated for carrying out the program. Funds allocated for carrying out the school siting initiative will be available for obligation in the same manner as funds apportioned under title 23, United States Code. These funds are non-transferable, remain available for 3 years, and if allowed to expire by a State, will be redistributed among States that utilized the funds. During a 2-year period, obligated funds are available to States for safe routes to school projects. The Federal share of project costs is 100 percent, but States can contribute additional funds if desired. Supplemental funds may be considered for disadvantaged schools and higher-risk areas. Supplemental funds may be provided to disadvantaged schools and high-risk areas for safe routes to school projects to ensure fairness in the selection process."
