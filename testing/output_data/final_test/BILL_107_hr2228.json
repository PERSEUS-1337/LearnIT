The \"Maritime Disaster Family Assistance Act of 2001\" amends Chapter 63 of title 46, United States Code, by adding a new section (Sec. 6309) that requires the Secretary to provide assistance to families of passengers involved in maritime disasters within the United States. This includes designating a Coast Guard employee as a director of family support services and an independent nonprofit organization to assist the families. The Act designates an independent nonprofit organization to coordinate emotional care for families of passengers in a maritime disaster. The Secretary is responsible for investigating the disaster, facilitating recovery of fatally injured passengers, and communicating with families. The designated organization for a maritime disaster is responsible for communicating with families of passengers, coordinating with government agencies and vessel operators, and assisting in search and recovery efforts. They also provide mental health and counseling services to the families involved. The designated organization for a maritime disaster provides mental health services, arranges private grieving environments, meets with families, and organizes memorial services in consultation with the families. They also assist with passenger lists upon request. The director of family support services or designated organization for a maritime disaster can request passenger lists from the covered vessel operator involved in the disaster.

The text chunk discusses the definition of a covered vessel operator, which includes operators of passenger vessels, small passenger vessels, and fishing vessels. The term \"passenger\" is expanded to include employees of covered vessel operators. The term 'Secretary' in maritime disaster cases refers to the head of the department where the Coast Guard operates or the National Transportation Safety Board if they have primary responsibility for the investigation. The section vests authority in a board and limits statutory construction. It also includes conforming amendments to the chapter. The analysis for subtitle II of title 46, United States Code, is amended in the item relating to chapter 63 by inserting \"and responding to\" after \"Investigating\" for assistance to families of passengers involved in maritime disasters."
