It includes sections on the imposition of tax, windfall profit calculations, removal price, adjusted base price, and qualified investment, along with special rules and definitions. The text introduces a new chapter on Windfall Profits Tax in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, focusing on crude oil. It imposes an excise tax on integrated oil companies based on the excess windfall profit from taxable crude oil removed from the property, minus qualified investment. The tax is paid by the producer of the oil. The term \"windfall profit\" in this chapter refers to the excess of the removal price of taxable crude oil over the adjusted base price of the barrel. The removal price is determined by the amount for which the oil is sold, with specific rules for sales between related persons and oil removed from property before sale. The price for determining gross income from property under section 613 is the constructive sales price. If crude oil is refined on the property before removal, it is treated as removed on the day of refining, with the removal price being the constructive sales price. The term 'property' is defined by section 614. The adjusted base price for taxable crude oil is $40 per barrel plus an additional amount. The adjusted base price for taxable crude oil is determined by multiplying the base price of $40 per barrel by the inflation adjustment for the calendar year of removal, rounded to the nearest cent. The inflation adjustment is calculated based on the difference in implicit price deflator for the gross national product between the current year and 2005. The first revision of the price deflator is used for determining qualified investments, which include section 263(c) costs, qualified refinery property, qualified facilities under section 45(d), and alcohol production facilities for fuel. The term 'section 263(c) costs' refers to intangible drilling and development costs that can be deducted as expenses, excluding costs from drilling nonproductive wells. \"Special rules and definitions are outlined in SEC. 5898.\" The Secretary will establish rules for withholding and depositing the tax on taxable crude oil under section 5896. Taxpayers must maintain records, submit returns, and provide information as required. The Secretary will determine the filing requirements for the windfall profit tax under section 5896. Definitions for \"producer\" and \"crude oil\" are provided in this chapter. The term 'crude oil' includes condensates and natural gasoline, excluding oil produced from a well drilled after the enactment date, except for proven oil or gas properties. A 'barrel' is defined as 42 US gallons. The Secretary can adjust removal prices to reflect fair market value, and regulations will be prescribed. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to carry out the chapter's purposes. This section does not apply to taxable crude oil removed after 3 years from the enactment date. A clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code. Chapter 56 discusses windfall profit on crude oil. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 adds a deduction for the windfall profit tax imposed by section 5896. The effective date for these amendments applies to crude oil removed after the enactment date of the Act, for taxable years ending after that date. Transitional rules are prescribed for the administration of chapter 56 of the Internal Revenue Code until December 31, 2005. The administrative provisions in chapter 56 of the Internal Revenue Code (or subtitle F related to chapter 56) are in effect until December 31, 2005. Amounts equivalent to taxes received under chapter 56 of the Internal Revenue Code are appropriated for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981."
