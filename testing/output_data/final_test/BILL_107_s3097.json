The \"Maximum Economic Growth for America Through Innovative Finance Act or MEGA Innovate\" introduces a nonrefundable credit for holders of qualified highway bonds under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Taxpayers holding qualified highway bonds on credit allowance dates during the taxable year can claim a credit against the tax imposed, calculated as 25 percent of the annual credit determined for the bond. The applicable credit rate for qualified highway bonds is determined by multiplying the rate by the outstanding face amount of the bond. The credit allowance date is specified as March 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15, including the last day the bond is outstanding. The credit for qualified highway bonds is based on the outstanding face amount of the bond. A special rule applies for bonds issued or redeemed within a 3-month period ending on a credit allowance date. The credit allowed for any taxable year is limited by the excess of the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55 over the sum of the credits allowable under this. The credit for qualified highway bonds allows for carryover of unused credit to the next taxable year. Gross income includes the credit allowed to the taxpayer and is treated as interest income.
