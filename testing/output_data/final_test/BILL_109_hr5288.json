    "content": "The \"Small Business Health Plans Act of 2006\" may be cited as the Small Business Health Benefits Program (SBHBP). The Small Business Health Benefits Program (SBHBP) established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services allows small employers to offer health insurance coverage to employees and dependents. Small employers have access to qualified health pooling arrangements for self-only or family coverage, with premium assistance available to help with payment. Employers must pay at least 50 percent of premiums for employee health insurance coverage to be eligible for premium assistance. Employees can use this payment towards family health insurance coverage. The health insurance coverage offered must meet requirements such as being similar to the four largest health benefit plans under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, and complying with State laws and regulations for group health insurance coverage. The group health insurance coverage offered must not discriminate based on health status and must be coordinated according to regulations. The Secretary will promote participation by health insurers in the program, focusing on integrating health information technology tools, chronic disease management, preventive health care services, and evidence-based medicine considerations for prescription drugs and treatments. The Secretary will establish a program of premium assistance for small employers under the SBHBP, providing a sliding scale of assistance based on the number of employees. Employee enrollment in the program is limited to an annual open enrollment period, with exceptions for qualifying events specified by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish a program of premium assistance for small employers under the SBHBP based on the number of employees. Reinsurance coverage for catastrophic costs will be provided for health insurance issuers participating in a qualified health pooling arrangement. The program of premium assistance for small employers under the SBHBP will provide reinsurance coverage for catastrophic costs for health insurance issuers in a qualified health pooling arrangement. The minimum amount specified for subsequent years will be increased based on the average annual percentage increase in health insurance coverage with median premiums. The Secretary will determine if there is a qualified health pooling arrangement for employees in each state. A small employer is defined as an employer with 50 or fewer employees, unless otherwise specified. An employer with 50 or fewer employees, as defined by the Secretary, can participate in the SBHBP. If the employer later exceeds 50 employees, they can still be considered a small employer. For new employers, eligibility is based on the expected average number of employees in their first year of operation. The Secretary may waive size limitations for employers participating in SBHBP on a case-by-case basis if a compelling case is made. Definitions of \"employee\" and \"dependent\" are based on regulations and Federal employee health benefits program definitions. The terms \"health insurance coverage\" and \"health insurance issuer\" are defined in the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. SBHBP stands for the small business health benefits program. Grants are provided to States for establishing qualified health pooling arrangements. Authorization of appropriations is granted for carrying out this subsection. Establishment of National Health Pooling Arrangement. The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Labor, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, will establish a national health pooling arrangement for eligible small employers. This arrangement will be modeled after the Federal employees health benefits program to provide affordable and substantial coverage. The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Labor will establish a national health pooling arrangement for small employers, providing affordable and substantial coverage. Definitions include the term \"Secretaries\" referring to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Labor, and \"national health pooling arrangement\" as an arrangement for pooling health insurance coverage in states without existing arrangements."
