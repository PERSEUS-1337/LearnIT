    "content": "SNAP benefits can only be used for eligible foods at authorized retailers, which are approved based on inventory or sales. Retailers must apply for authorization and pass an inspection process. Authorized retailers include supermarkets, farmers' markets, and convenience stores. Inventory requirements are based on staple food categories like meat, bread, vegetables, and dairy products. While SNAP participants can buy non-staple foods, staple food inventory is a key factor in retailer authorization. In FY2015, the majority of SNAP benefits were redeemed at supermarkets and superstores, accounting for approximately 82% of redemptions. Despite convenience stores making up over 41% of authorized retailers, they only redeemed about 5% of benefits. Smaller retailers received the bulk of sanctions from USDA-FNS, including disqualifications from SNAP. Standards for SNAP retailer authorization under prior regulations required meeting specific criteria. Under prior regulations, SNAP-eligible retailers had to meet criteria A (based on store inventory) or criteria B (based on store sales). Specialty stores like fruit and vegetable markets typically applied under criterion B due to their limited staple food categories. Staple foods are defined as meat, poultry, fish, bread, cereals, vegetables, fruits, and dairy products, excluding accessory items. Foods with multiple ingredients were categorized based on the main ingredient. For example, macaroni and cheese could be classified as a variety within a staple food category. Macaroni and cheese, despite containing dairy, is classified as a staple food variety. Regulation specifies that a variety in a category refers to different types of foods, not different brands or nutrient values. Retailers must offer specific foods to qualify for SNAP, but participants can redeem benefits for any foods for home consumption. SNAP benefits can be used for home preparation and consumption of staple foods, excluding alcohol, tobacco, and hot prepared foods. Restaurants with more than 50% of sales in prepared foods are ineligible, except for those participating in certain state programs. The 2014 farm bill amended SNAP law, including changes to retailer authorization requirements. Retailers seeking authorization based on inventory must increase their offerings. The law was amended to require stores to stock at least seven varieties of staple foods in each of the four staple food categories and perishable foods in at least three categories. Retailers seeking authorization based on inventory must increase their variety of stock. The law also requires a review of retailer applications to consider limited access to food in the area. USDA-FNS stated that rulemaking would be needed to implement the 2014 farm bill changes to inventory requirements. The final rule includes changes to prior regulations and a comparison to the proposed rule. The USDA-FNS explained that the proposed rule was based on the 2014 farm bill's statutory changes and efforts to enhance SNAP retailer eligibility standards. They received over 200 comments from a diverse group in response to an August 2013 Request for Information on SNAP retailer eligibility and authorization. The final rule on SNAP retailer authorization policy was influenced by feedback from a diverse group of stakeholders, including retailers, academics, and government entities. The rule made changes in five key areas, including sales of hot, prepared foods and disclosure of retailer information, based on 1,260 comments reviewed by FNS. Some Members of Congress and stakeholders opposed aspects of the proposed rule. The final rule on SNAP retailer authorization policy, influenced by stakeholder feedback, made changes in key areas like sales of hot foods and disclosure of retailer information. USDA-FNS aimed to improve access to healthy foods and preserve program integrity, with discretionary regulatory changes in other areas. After the final rule on SNAP retailer authorization policy was influenced by stakeholder feedback, Congress directed USDA to substantially change its implementation, particularly regarding variety and breadth of stock requirements. The FY2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act required USDA to redefine \"variety\" and implement previous stock standards until regulatory amendments are made. For the latest updates on retailer standards, refer to USDA-FNS's website. The final rule on SNAP retailer standards, effective from January 17, 2017, was modified by USDA-FNS after P.L. 115-31. Hot, prepared foods are not SNAP-eligible, with a 50% sales limit on such items for Criteria A and B retailers. The rule clarified that the 50% threshold applies to foods cooked on-site by the retailer. The final rule on SNAP retailer standards, effective from January 17, 2017, was modified by USDA-FNS after P.L. 115-31. The rule did not adopt the proposed 85/15% threshold for cooked or heated foods on-site, expressing concern that it would make most convenience stores ineligible for SNAP authorization. Measures were also proposed to prevent businesses from splitting to circumvent SNAP rules. The final rule on SNAP retailer standards, effective from January 17, 2017, was modified by USDA-FNS after P.L. 115-31. It clarified that separate businesses sharing ownership, selling similar food products, and inventory will be considered as one entity. The implementation of hot, prepared foods provisions will start on October 16, 2017. The regulatory definition of staple foods was changed, maintaining that accessory foods are not counted as staple foods. The final rule expanded the definition of accessory foods to include specific items like coffee, tea, cocoa, drinks, candy, condiments, and spices. The final rule on SNAP retailer standards, effective from January 17, 2017, clarified the definition of accessory food items to include snacks, desserts, and items that complement meals such as coffee, tea, drinks, condiments, spices, salt, and sugar. It also specified that packaging size should not determine classification as an accessory food item. The USDA-FNS website announced that accessory food changes will be implemented for all stores on January 17, 2018. The final rule maintained the policy of counting foods with multiple ingredients in one staple food category based on the main ingredient. It rejected the proposed policy of not counting commercially processed foods and prepared mixtures in any staple food category for retailer authorization. The final rule on retailer authorization for SNAP eligibility will consider foods with accessory ingredients as non-staple foods. Changes will take effect for all stores on January 17, 2018, with increased flexibility in stocking required varieties. The final rule on retailer authorization for SNAP eligibility allows for increased flexibility in stocking required varieties, including plant-based sources counted as varieties for staple food groups. USDA-FNS will not implement the final rule's broader variety definition due to Section 765 requirements. The rule also mandates an increase in the minimum variety of foods in each staple food category for retailers applying for authorization. The final rule for SNAP retailer authorization increases the minimum variety of foods in each staple food category to seven varieties and requires three staple food categories to include perishable foods. It also specifies the depth of stock, changing the minimum stock requirement to 28 food items with seven varieties in each category. The final rule for SNAP retailer authorization requires a minimum of 84 staple food items with seven varieties in each of the four categories, including perishable requirements. The depth of stock policy was halved from six-item to three stocking units per variety. Documentation may be provided to show compliance with stocking requirements. USDA-FNS must maintain three varieties per staple food category, with three stocking units per variety. The final rule for SNAP retailer authorization now includes access factors to be considered when a retailer does not meet all requirements for authorization. Factors such as distance to nearest SNAP-authorized firm and stocking deficiencies will be taken into account by USDA-FNS. The final rule for SNAP retailer authorization includes factors such as stocking deficiencies and distance to nearest SNAP-authorized firm to be considered during the application process. Starting January 17, 2018, USDA-FNS will disclose specific information about retailers sanctioned for SNAP violations to combat fraud and provide valuable information to the public. The final rule for SNAP retailer authorization, effective January 17, 2017, includes a summary of the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) by USDA-FNS. The analysis estimated increased store inspection costs of $3.7 million in FY2018 and $15 million over five years. The RIA highlighted benefits like improved access to healthy food options for SNAP recipients and impacts on small businesses under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Opposition to the proposed rule criticized the analysis for underestimating the financial impact on small businesses. The final rule's analysis estimated that changes would impact 70% of small SNAP-authorized retailers, with an average cost per retailer of $245 in the first year and $620 over five years. Over 87% of currently participating small retailers may not meet increased variety requirements, but most would meet new perishable requirements. The final rule was published in December 2016. Implementation of new variety and stock requirements from the 2014 farm bill provisions is expected following the enactment of the appropriations law policy provision in May 2017. SNAP retailers will be implementing some new requirements while waiting for others to be proposed and implemented during the 115th Congress. Congress may consider changing the statute again in the formulation of the next farm bill."
