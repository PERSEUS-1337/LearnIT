    "content": "In the early 1990s, cultivated area in Iraq temporarily expanded to nearly 5.5 million hectares before returning to under 4 million. The government reported an expansion of irrigated area to 3.525 million hectares in 1990, but this appears unlikely and inconsistent with anecdotal reports. The curr_chunk discusses reclassification of government programs in Iraq related to draining marshlands and agricultural export programs. It references various sources and programs such as FAOSTAT, U.S. General Accounting Office reports, and the United Nations' Oil for Food program. The curr_chunk provides various sources on Iraq's cereal production per capita from the 1960s to the 1990s, showing a decline and then a slight increase in the later years."
