    "content": "In 1890, Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren published a groundbreaking article in the Harvard Law Review entitled The Right to Privacy, arguing for the protection of individuals' \"right to be let alone\" in response to technological advancements and intrusion from others. This marked a significant shift in the common law towards safeguarding privacy rights. In the century following Brandeis and Warren's influential article on the right to privacy, most states recognized privacy torts such as intrusion upon seclusion, public disclosure of private facts, false light, and appropriation. These torts aim to protect individuals' ability to lead a secluded and private life. However, some scholars argue that these torts, developed in the mid-twentieth century, are insufficient to address modern privacy and data protection issues. Additionally, some states have limited the applicability of these torts, reducing their effectiveness. State common law provides remedies and protections for data protection through tort and contract law, but the impact of judge-made doctrine may vary based on court application and precedents. Concerns about privacy at the time of the founding focused on government intrusion, with limited remedies in the Constitution's Bill of Rights. The Fourth Amendment protects individual privacy from government intrusion, while other provisions offer narrower protections. Over time, constitutional law has evolved to emphasize safeguarding personal privacy, with the Supreme Court playing a key role in shaping these protections. The Supreme Court has played a key role in protecting individual privacy from government intrusion, evolving the Fourth Amendment to guard against certain types of governmental intrusion, including digital privacy. In the 2018 case of Carpenter v. United States, the Court extended Fourth Amendment protection to some shared information, such as cellular provider records, maintaining individuals' expectation of privacy. In the 2018 case of Carpenter v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that individuals have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their cellular phone records. This decision requires the government to obtain a warrant supported by probable cause to access this information, providing a limited protection against government intrusion into digital privacy. Additionally, the Court has previously recognized a general right to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment, safeguarding individuals from government intrusion beyond just search and seizure situations. The Supreme Court has recognized a right to privacy in various contexts, including avoiding disclosure of personal matters and making important decisions. This right, known as \"informational privacy,\" has been upheld in cases like Whalen v. Roe. However, despite its broad expression, every Supreme Court case considering this right has rejected constitutional claims related to data protection. The Supreme Court has upheld the government program in cases like Whalen v. Roe, which involved a challenge to a New York law requiring the recording of certain drug information. The Court found that the law had protections in place to safeguard privacy, leading to the rejection of the constitutional claim related to data protection. The Supreme Court has upheld government programs like the one in Whalen v. Roe, which required recording certain drug information. Despite the lack of clarity on the right to informational privacy, most federal circuit courts recognize it to varying extents. This right focuses on public disclosure of private facts, limiting its influence on modern data privacy debates that extend beyond disclosure to data collection, protection, and use. The \"state action doctrine\" limits the constitutional right to privacy to government actions only, not private conduct. Common and constitutional law are insufficient for digital privacy threats, with statutory law providing the main data protection standards. Congress has enacted federal laws for individual data protection, creating a patchwork system in the US unlike Europe's comprehensive law. In the United States, federal laws create a patchwork system for data protection, with various laws governing different industries and types of data. The Stored Communications Act prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications, while the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair or deceptive practices related to personal data handling by companies. The FTC Act fills gaps in privacy statutes by prohibiting unfair or deceptive practices. The GLBA imposes data protection obligations on financial institutions regarding consumer nonpublic personal information. The GLBA imposes data protection obligations on financial institutions regarding consumer nonpublic personal information, including sharing NPI with third parties, providing privacy notices to consumers, and securing NPI from unauthorized access. Financial institutions must give consumers notice and an opportunity to \"opt-out\" before sharing NPI with non-affiliated third parties, and are prohibited from sharing account or credit card numbers for direct marketing. They must also provide clear and conspicuous privacy notices to customers, detailing the categories of NPI collected and disclosed, third parties with whom NPI is shared, and policies for protecting NPI confidentiality and security. GLBA and its implementing regulations require financial institutions to maintain safeguards for customer NPI to ensure security and confidentiality. Federal banking agencies enforce data security provisions and respond to unauthorized access of customer NPI. CFPB, FTC, and federal banking agencies share civil enforcement authority for GLBA's privacy provisions, but CFPB lacks enforcement authority over data security provisions. GLBA imposes criminal liability for knowingly obtaining or disclosing customer information through false statements. Criminal penalties include fines and up to five years' imprisonment. GLBA does not provide a private right of action for individuals to sue violators. HIPAA regulations protect medical information known as \"protected health information\" (PHI) under the Department of Health and Human Services. HIPAA regulations protect medical information known as \"protected health information\" (PHI) and apply to health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses. Covered entities must follow regulations regarding the use, sharing, disclosure, safeguards, and notification of consumers following a breach of PHI. Covered entities are generally prohibited from using or sharing PHI without patient consent, except for treatment, payment, or health care operations purposes. Additionally, covered entities must provide individuals with adequate disclosures. Covered entities must provide individuals with adequate notice of the uses and disclosures of PHI, including rights and legal duties. Notices must be provided upon request and prominently posted on websites. Individuals can request a copy of their PHI and information on specific disclosures. Covered entities must maintain safeguards for electronic PHI security. HIPAA regulations include data breach notification requirements, civil and criminal enforcement for privacy violations. HHS can impose civil penalties, while the Department of Justice can seek fines or imprisonment for knowingly disclosing health information. There is no private right of action under HIPAA. The Fair Credit Reporting Act covers certain aspects of privacy protection. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) governs the collection and use of consumer credit information by credit reporting agencies (CRAs), furnishers, and users. Unlike HIPAA or GLBA, FCRA does not have privacy provisions requiring notice or consent from consumers. FCRA focuses on ensuring accuracy and limited use of consumer information, rather than data security measures. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) regulates the accuracy of consumer credit information by CRAs and furnishers. CRAs must maintain procedures for accuracy and exclude adverse information after a certain time. Furnishers must ensure the accuracy of reported information and cannot provide inaccurate data to CRAs. Consumers have the right to review their information in CRAs' files upon request. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), consumer reports can only be used for specific permissible purposes such as credit transactions. CRAs and furnishers must ensure the accuracy of information in consumer reports, and consumers have the right to dispute any inaccuracies. Users must have a permissible purpose to access consumer reports, and must notify consumers of any adverse actions taken based on the report. The FTC and the CFPB enforce civil penalties for violations of FCRA regulations. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) allows for civil enforcement by the FTC and the CFPB, with consumers having a private right of action for negligent or willful violations. Damages for negligent violations include actual damages and attorney's fees, while willful violations can result in statutory damages, attorney's fees, punitive damages, and criminal liability for obtaining or providing consumer information under false pretenses. The Communications Act of 1934 established the FCC and includes data protection provisions for common carriers, cable operators, and satellite carriers. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 added data privacy and security requirements for entities acting as common carriers, primarily focused on telephone and telegraph services. Entities acting as common carriers are subject to requirements related to \"customer proprietary network information (CPNI),\" which includes details about telecommunications services subscribed to by customers. Section 222(c) of the Communications Act and FCC regulations outline carriers' obligations regarding CPNI, including rules on use and disclosure. Carriers must obtain customer approval before using or disclosing individually identifiable CPNI, with exceptions allowed. Carriers must notify customers of their legal rights regarding CPNI and implement safeguards for its proper use. They must also comply with data breach requirements, disclosing breaches to law enforcement within seven days. After notifying law enforcement, carriers must inform customers of CPNI breaches. The Communications Act includes provisions on protecting customer information, unjust practices, and discrimination by carriers. The FCC's 2016 rule, overturned by Congress, attempted to enforce these provisions. The FCC attempted to regulate customer proprietary information (customer PI) under the Congressional Review Act, relying on three provisions. However, Congress overturned the 2016 rule, prohibiting the FCC from using these provisions to regulate data privacy and security. The FCC is restricted by the CRA from reissuing or issuing a new rule similar to the overturned one without specific authorization from a new law. The FCC can enforce civil violations of the Communications Act, including imposing forfeiture penalties for willful or repeated violations. Criminal penalties apply to those who knowingly violate the statute. The Communications Act also allows for private legal action for violations of common carrier provisions. The Communications Act imposes data privacy and security requirements on common carriers, cable operators, and satellite carriers regarding the treatment of subscribers' personally identifiable information (PII). Covered entities must obtain prior consent before collecting or disclosing PII, with exceptions for service-related purposes. The Act also addresses data access, correction, destruction, privacy policy notification, and security measures. Covered entities must provide subscribers access to their personally identifiable information (PII) and allow them to correct any errors. They are also required to destroy PII that is no longer necessary and provide privacy policy notices at the time of service agreement and annually thereafter. The Communications Act requires covered entities to provide access to subscriber's PII, disclose information on data collection and security measures, and allows for legal action against entities violating these requirements. Violations may result in damages, penalties, and enforcement actions by the FCC. The Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) imposes penalties for disclosing consumer information without consent, with exceptions for certain situations. It does not mandate data security measures but focuses on protecting personal privacy in video rental services. The VPPA allows video tape service providers to disclose PII in certain situations, such as incident to business or with consumer consent. There are no criminal penalties for violations, but individuals can take legal action for damages. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects student education records by giving parents or students control over disclosure, review, and accuracy of the records. Covered entities must not release education records without consent. Covered entities under FERPA must obtain consent before disclosing education records, with exceptions for authorized representatives, school officials with legitimate educational interest, and organizations conducting studies. Disclosure without consent is allowed for directory information after providing notice. Additionally, covered entities must not prevent parents or adult students from inspecting and reviewing the records. Covered entities under FERPA must establish procedures for parents to review education records within forty-five days. They must also provide a hearing to challenge inaccurate information and allow for corrections or deletions with an explanation. Complaints of FERPA violations can be filed with the Department of Education. FERPA allows for complaints to be filed with the Department of Education, which can result in actions such as withholding federal education funds or issuing a cease and desist order. While FERPA lacks criminal provisions or a private right of action, federal securities laws may require companies to implement controls to prevent data breaches. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recommends that companies consider cyber-related threats when formulating accounting controls to prevent fraudulent transactions. Companies should pay attention to Section 13(b)(2)(B) obligations due to the risks of digital interconnectedness. Federal securities laws may also require companies to disclose data breaches when making required disclosures. The Exchange Act and Securities Act require companies to file disclosures with the SEC, including registration statements for public offerings and periodic reports for public companies. These filings must include risk factors and information on events likely to impact financial results. Companies must also disclose data breaches when required by federal securities laws. In February 2018, the SEC issued guidance indicating that companies may need to disclose cyber incidents like data breaches in their filings. The SEC can enforce violations of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act through civil actions or administrative proceedings, seeking penalties, disgorgement, and injunctive relief. Individuals affected by a company's misrepresentation or omission of material facts can take action under both acts. The Securities Act and the Exchange Act allow individuals to sue companies for misrepresentation or omission of material facts in connection with securities transactions. There is no private right of action for violations of the Exchange Act's accounting controls requirement. Criminal liability can be imposed for willful violations of these acts. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and FTC regulations govern the online collection of children's information by operators directed towards children or with actual knowledge of collecting personal information from a child. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and FTC regulations require covered operators to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children under thirteen. Operators must provide direct notice of their privacy policies and post a link to these policies on their website. Covered operators collecting information from children must establish procedures to protect confidentiality, security, and integrity of the information. They must comply with data retention and deletion requirements. Violations of FTC regulations will be treated as unfair or deceptive acts, with enforcement by the FTC and state attorneys general. COPPA allows state attorneys general to enforce violations affecting residents. ECPA, enacted in 1986, includes the Wiretap Act, Stored Communications Act, and Pen Register Act, offering privacy protections for electronic communications. ECPA applies to both governmental and non-governmental entities, but its impact on online privacy practices has been limited. The Wiretap Act under ECPA regulates wiretapping and electronic snooping, but applying it to online data collection has been challenging. It prohibits the interception of communications in transit, including electronic communications over the internet. To qualify as an unlawful interception, the communication must be acquired contemporaneously with its transmission and relate to the contents of the communication. The Wiretap Act under ECPA regulates wiretapping and electronic snooping, prohibiting the interception of communications in transit. The Act applies to information related to the substance of the communication, such as email content, but not non-substantive information like IP addresses. Exceptions include being a party to the communication or obtaining prior consent from one of the parties. Courts have often used these exceptions to dismiss suits alleging violations due to online tracking. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) prohibits improper access or disclosure of electronic communications in storage. Improper access includes obtaining electronic communications without authorization or exceeding authorization. Courts have debated whether personal computers are considered a \"facility\" under the SCA. Improper disclosure is also prohibited by the SCA. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) prohibits entities from disclosing the contents of electronic communications in storage without authorization. Exceptions include sender or recipient consent. The Pen Register Act requires court orders for installing pen registers or trap and trace devices. The Pen Register Act governs the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices to capture non-content information, excluding communication contents. It requires court orders for their use and includes exceptions for protecting rights or property. The Wiretap Act and the SCA allow for private rights of action for violations, with damages including actual damages, statutory damages, and profits made by the violator. Violations can result in criminal prosecution, fines, and imprisonment. In contrast, the Pen Register Act does not provide for a private right of action, but knowing violations can still lead to consequences. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) prohibits unauthorized intrusions into computers, with liability for intentionally accessing a computer without authorization. Violations can lead to criminal prosecution, fines, and imprisonment. The CFAA also allows for a private right of action for aggrieved parties. The CFAA allows for a private right of action for individuals seeking damages and equitable relief for unauthorized access to their computers. Despite being theoretically more generous than ECPA, claims have been dismissed due to plaintiffs failing to meet the damages threshold of $5,000. The FTC Act, enacted in 1914 and amended in 1938, gives the FTC jurisdiction over most individuals and entities, with exemptions for common carriers, nonprofits, and financial institutions. To bring a private right of action, a plaintiff must show damages exceeding $5,000 or specific types of damages like physical injury. The Act prohibits unscrupulous practices harmful to consumers and has made the FTC a key agency for privacy issues. The FTC Act, Section 5, prohibits \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" in commerce. An act is \"unfair\" if it causes substantial unavoidable harm to consumers. Deceptive acts involve misleading representations. The FTC can define specific UDAPs through TRRs but must follow certain procedures. The FTC can define specific unfair or deceptive acts through TRRs, but must follow additional procedures not required under the APA. This includes publishing an ANPRM, providing an opportunity for an informal hearing, and issuing a statement on the prevalence of the acts or practices treated by the rule. As a result, the FTC rarely uses its TRR rulemaking authority and instead relies on enforcement actions to address impermissible data protection practices. The FTC enforces actions against companies for deceptive or unfair data protection practices, leading to consent decrees requiring specific measures. These decrees, though not legally binding on non-parties, set standards for privacy practices. The FTC emphasizes companies' accountability to their data privacy and security promises. The FTC enforces actions against companies for deceptive data practices, such as gathering personal information contrary to their privacy policy or making false representations to obtain information. Companies are held accountable for inadequate protection of personal data despite promises. The FTC enforces actions against companies for deceptive data practices, such as failing to disclose monitoring software's extent. They also consider retroactively applying revised privacy policies and certain default privacy settings as unfair. The FTC enforces actions against companies for deceptive data practices, such as failing to disclose monitoring software's extent. They also consider retroactively applying revised privacy policies and certain default privacy settings as unfair. Immediately upon installation, the application would share personal files stored on users' devices unless users unchecked pre-checked boxes. The FTC has maintained that a company's failure to safeguard personal data may be \"unfair,\" even if not contradicting its privacy policy. LabMD v. FTC case suggests that any FTC cease and desist order based on a company's \"unfair\" data security measures must allege specific data failures and remedies. The court in LabMD v. FTC found that an order imposing an indeterminable standard of reasonableness on a company's data security measures was unenforceable. The court suggested that penalizing a company for not meeting an imprecise standard could constitute a denial of due process. This decision could limit the FTC's ability to address violations of the FTC Act related to data security. The case also contributes to the limited case law on the Act's \"unfair or deceptive\" prohibition. The FTC may take enforcement actions against alleged violators through administrative proceedings or civil litigation, seeking remedies like injunctions or disgorgement. Civil penalties are only pursued if a party violates a cease and desist order, consent decree, or a TRR. The CFPA also prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts by covered entities. The CFPA, enacted in 2010, created the CFPB to prevent unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts in consumer financial products or services. The CFPB's UDAAP authority is similar to the FTC's UDAP authority but includes \"abusive\" practices. The UDAAP prohibition under the CFPA includes \"abusive\" practices, in addition to unfair or deceptive ones. Abusive conduct is defined as actions that interfere with a consumer's understanding of a financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of the consumer. This standard applies to consumer financial products or services offered primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. The CFPA applies to \"covered persons\" or \"service providers\" offering consumer financial products or services. The CFPB has been inactive in data privacy and security enforcement, with only one enforcement action taken against Dwolla, Inc. for deceptive data security practices. The CFPB has procedural advantages over the FTC in enforcing UDAAP violations, including the ability to enact rules and seek civil penalties. However, there is no private right of action for individuals under the CFPA, and no criminal penalties for UDAAP violations. The complex federal patchwork of data protection statutes is further complicated by state laws. The state laws play a significant role in regulating privacy and data protection through tort and contract law. These laws provide avenues for businesses to be held accountable for data security issues and failure to protect customers. State statutory frameworks also impact data protection and the use of data by private entities. The state laws impact data protection and privacy, with consumer protection laws and data breach response laws in place. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a notable example, applying to any business regardless of industry or data collection method. The CCPA applies to any for-profit company that collects Californians' personal information and does business in California, with low thresholds that could reach even small businesses. It regulates all personal information broadly defined as any data that can be associated with a consumer, not requiring individual identifiers like names or addresses. The CCPA defines personal information as data that can be linked to a consumer and provides rights to consumers, including the right to know what information businesses have collected about them. This includes electronic network activity and inferences drawn from it. The CCPA gives consumers the right to opt out of the sale of their information, request deletion of collected information, and allows enforcement through actions by the California Attorney General for non-compliance with the law. Businesses must inform consumers of their opt-out right and delete requested information within 30 days to avoid civil penalties. Businesses found to be in violation of the CCPA face civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation, with penalties collected going to the Consumer Privacy Fund. The CCPA allows for private lawsuits if nonencrypted personal information is exposed due to inadequate security measures, with consumers required to give businesses a chance to remedy the violation before taking legal action. The CCPA allows for civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation for businesses. Consumers can seek damages of $100 to $750 per incident or actual damages, along with injunctive relief. The law's significance has been noted in Congressional hearings, with some suggesting it may be preempted by future federal legislation. The CCPA could influence future privacy laws and industry practices nationwide. The CCPA, a significant California law, may influence future federal legislation and serve as a model for data protection regulations. European GDPR and other foreign nations' data protection laws also play a role in shaping global privacy regulations. The EU's GDPR aims to protect personal data while allowing its free flow within the EU. European countries started enacting data protection laws in the 1970s, leading to the harmonization of national privacy laws through the 1995 Directive on the Protection of Personal Data. The EU's GDPR replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive to address fragmentation and update laws to reflect technological advancements and globalization. The EU's GDPR, effective since May 25, 2018, regulates the processing of personal data, including collection, use, storage, and disclosure. Personal data is any information relating to an identifiable person. The GDPR applies different requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. The GDPR applies to organizations with an \"establishment\" in the EU that process personal data. The concept of establishment implies real activity through stable arrangements. Entities meeting this requirement are subject to the GDPR, even if processing occurs outside the EU. Non-EU entities offering goods/services to EU individuals or monitoring behavior in the EU are also covered. The GDPR applies to businesses with an online presence offering goods/services to EU individuals, even if outside the EU. It outlines seven principles for data processing and requires lawful bases such as consent, contract performance, legal obligations, vital interests, public interest tasks, and legitimate interests. The GDPR requires organizations to implement data processing based on legitimate interests or consent, with specific requirements for sensitive data. Individuals have rights and controllers have obligations under the GDPR, with exceptions allowed. The GDPR requires organizations to implement measures to ensure compliance, such as data protection policies, GDPR-conforming contracts with data processors, maintaining records of processing activities, conducting impact assessments, appointing a data protection officer, and implementing technical and organizational measures for data protection. The GDPR requires organizations to implement data security measures appropriate to the risk presented by data processing. Security measures depend on the nature, scope, and context of processing, with encryption being a consideration. The GDPR requires organizations to implement security measures such as encryption and pseudonymization to protect personal data. In case of a breach, controllers must notify the EU authority within 72 hours, unless the breach poses no risk to individuals' rights and freedoms. Reporting is necessary for high-risk data breaches, while less significant breaches may not require notification. Organizations must report high-risk data breaches to the EU authority within 72 hours, describing the breach and measures taken. Data processors must inform controllers promptly. Controllers must also notify individuals if the breach poses a high risk to their rights and freedoms. This notification is necessary when individuals need to protect themselves from the breach's effects. According to the UK data protection authority, a hospital disclosing patient records due to a breach poses a high risk, while a university recreating a deleted alumni database may not require individual notification. Notification must be clear and contain necessary information. Individual notification is not needed if encryption is used, risks are mitigated, or efforts for notification are disproportionate. The GDPR requires controllers to document all data breaches for verification by supervisory authorities. International data transfers are restricted, with non-EU countries needing to offer equivalent data protection levels. Adequacy decisions made under the Data Protection Directive remain valid under the GDPR. Under the GDPR, the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield framework allows U.S.-based organizations to self-certify compliance with data protection requirements. The European Commission deemed the Privacy Shield framework adequate under the Data Protection Directive, a determination that continues under the GDPR. The GDPR permits data transfers outside the EU under certain conditions, including when appropriate safeguards are in place and legal remedies exist for data privacy rights enforcement. U.S. companies not in Privacy Shield often use standard contract clauses for EU data transfers. The GDPR also outlines exceptions for data transfers outside the EU without safeguards or adequacy decisions. The GDPR allows data transfers outside the EU under specific conditions, such as informed consent, contractual necessity, or public interest. It also imposes high fines for serious violations, up to 20 million euros or 4% of global revenue. Individuals can file complaints with regulatory authorities and pursue legal action against non-compliant data processors. The GDPR allows individuals to pursue legal action against non-compliant data processors for damages. U.S. companies have adapted data protection practices to comply with GDPR, with some withdrawing from the European market. This regulation directly impacts the data protection practices of some U.S. companies. The GDPR has influenced data protection legislation in other countries like China's Personal Information Security Specification and California's CCPA. There is a trend towards more GDPR-like laws internationally, with some suggesting the U.S. should consider similar federal legislation. However, critics argue that the GDPR is overly prescriptive and could have negative unintended consequences. The GDPR has sparked debate over the need for a comprehensive data protection policy in the United States. While some advocate for legislation similar to the CCPA or GDPR, the Trump Administration criticizes such approaches as creating overly complex and ineffective privacy policies. They propose a more flexible model for data protection rules. The Trump Administration advocates for an outcome-based approach to data protection rules, focusing on organizational practices' outcomes. The NTIA is seeking public comments on developing user-centric privacy outcomes to address consumer concerns about losing control over personal information and the fragmented regulatory landscape. The NTIA's proposed policy focuses on privacy outcomes and goals sought by the Trump Administration, including elements similar to GDPR and CCPA. However, the specific methods to achieve these outcomes are not described in the request for public comments. The NTIA's proposed policy focuses on privacy outcomes and goals sought by the Trump Administration, with considerable work needed to achieve the objectives. Over 200 individuals and entities provided input during the comment period. The debate on federal legislation for data protection involves various legal variables and options, encompassing data privacy and security. Existing laws vary in their approach to data protection, with some focusing on data security or specific concerns like data breach notifications. Recent data protection laws like the CCPA and GDPR suggest a trend towards combining data privacy and security in unified legislative initiatives. These laws typically outline statutory rights for individuals regarding their personal information and impose legal duties on entities that possess this information. There is a push for federal legislation to introduce new rights that are not covered by existing state or foreign laws. At present, there is no agreed-upon menu of data protection rights and obligations that could be included in federal legislation. Some frequently discussed legal rights include the right to know, control, review, delete, obtain a copy, object, and be informed of data breaches. Commonly discussed obligations for companies include collecting, using, and disseminating personal data. The debate over federal data protection legislation includes discussions on rights and obligations for companies collecting personal data, enforcement mechanisms, and potential legal and constitutional implications. The debate over federal data protection legislation includes discussions on legal considerations such as the internal structure of data protection-related rights and obligations, as well as external legal constraints. There is a debate on whether to use a prescriptive or outcome-based approach in data protection laws, with examples like the GDPR and CCPA using a prescriptive approach. Legislation proposed in the 116th Congress may consider these approaches. The Trump Administration argues against a prescriptive approach to data protection legislation, favoring an outcome-based approach instead. They believe that focusing on the outcomes of organizational practices is more effective than defining specific practices. The Administration has not provided details on how they plan to achieve data protection goals without prescribing rules. The NTIA is considering additional direction for federal data protection policy, including defining the data to protect and the entities to regulate. Existing data protection laws vary in how they define protected information, such as HIPAA and GLBA, while GDPR and CCPA regulate all personal information. Some federal proposals aim to apply a similar scope. Some federal data proposals aim to create broad data protection laws similar to GDPR and CCPA, potentially leading to multiple layers of federal data protection requirements. Legislative proposals are seeking to avoid dual regulations by exempting individuals or entities covered by existing federal privacy laws. Agency enforcement is a key issue, with multiple federal agencies responsible for enforcing statutory protections. The FTC is seen as the primary enforcer of national data protection legislation, but it has limitations in issuing fines for first-time offenses. They can only issue civil penalties in specific circumstances, such as violating a consent decree or cease and desist order. This leads to the FTC often entering into consent decrees to address various conduct, like data security practices, to seek penalties for violations. The FTC faces constraints in imposing penalties based on imprecise legal standards, lacks jurisdiction over certain entities, and has limited authority to issue rules under the APA's notice-and-comment process. These legal limitations may impact federal enforcement provisions in data security legislation. Legislation could address limitations on FTC authority by allowing penalties for first-time violations, expanding jurisdiction, and providing notice-and-comment rulemaking authority. Private causes of action and enforcement by state attorneys general may be considered as supplements to FTC enforcement. Privacy legislation may propose allowing individuals to seek remedies in court for violations. Congress may establish a private right of action for individuals to sue third parties for violations. Congress could potentially provide for specific remedies beyond compensatory damages in a data protection statute, such as statutory or treble damages for individuals harmed by privacy violations. However, proving harm from data breaches may be challenging as victims often do not experience immediate financial or reputational harm, which could limit their ability to seek monetary relief in federal courts. This obstacle may also raise concerns about the courts' judicial power under Article III of the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court requires Article III standing for cases in federal courts, necessitating a concrete, traceable, and redressable injury. The requirement of \"imminence\" poses challenges for data protection lawsuits, demanding a certainly impending injury-in-fact. Courts dismiss data breach claims when plaintiffs cannot show actual misuse of data, only speculate about future harm. Constitutional requirements for standing limit Congress' use of private rights of action. Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins case illustrates this limitation in a Federal Credit Reporting Act lawsuit. Robins alleged that Spokeo's information about him was incorrect, violating FCRA's accuracy requirement. The Supreme Court disagreed with the lower court, stating that Robins lacked standing to seek statutory damages as his injury was not specific enough. The Supreme Court disagreed with the lower court's decision, stating that a plaintiff must demonstrate a concrete injury separate from a particularized injury. The Court remanded the case to determine if the alleged injury was both particularized and concrete, emphasizing that intangible injuries must be \"real\" and not \"abstract\" to establish standing. Spokeo clarified that while Congress can influence the determination of concrete harm, not all privacy violations can be elevated to a concrete injury. The lower courts have been resolving standing disputes in privacy lawsuits, questioning the concreteness of injuries under Article III. Congress may address some disputes by recognizing intangible injuries as concrete, but there may still be privacy violations without a judicial remedy. This raises legal considerations for Congress regarding federal legislation. Congress may need to consider how to balance federal data protection laws with state laws, as federal law can preempt state law. States like California have enacted aggressive privacy laws like the CCPA, which could have a national impact. Unless Congress fully occupies the field of data protection law, state laws will likely continue to play a role. Preemption will be a significant issue in the debate over future federal legislation. Preemption will be a significant issue in the debate over future federal privacy legislation. The Supreme Court has outlined three forms of preemption: conflict, express, and field. Conflict preemption invalidates state laws that conflict with federal laws. Express preemption occurs when Congress specifies which state laws are displaced. Field preemption happens when federal law comprehensively regulates an area, leaving no room for state laws. The preemptive scope of federal data protection legislation will depend on its purpose. The preemptive scope of federal data protection legislation depends on Congress's purpose and the specific language used. Congress can preempt state laws by including a specific provision in the statute. This can create a more uniform data privacy scheme by displacing all state laws in the digital data privacy sphere. Alternatively, Congress could take a more modest approach by enacting a data protection framework that expressly addresses certain issues. Congress could enact federal data protection legislation that preserves certain state laws while preempting others. This approach would allow states to maintain parallel or narrower schemes than the federal law, such as providing additional liability or different remedies for violations. By using statutory language, Congress can ensure the protection of state law provisions it seeks to preserve in the realm of data protection. Several approaches to regulate the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information online may face limitations due to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Scholars are divided on whether data should be considered speech and regulated skeptically, or if an expansive approach would hinder government regulation of commercial activity. The Supreme Court has not interpreted the First Amendment as prohibiting all communication regulation. The First Amendment does not prohibit all communication regulation. Courts ask specific questions to determine if a law violates the First Amendment. Simply because an activity involves communication does not mean it is protected by the First Amendment. The government can regulate activities where speech is just a component without First Amendment scrutiny. For example, disclosing defense secrets to the enemy violates a law against treason but does not trigger First Amendment scrutiny. The First Amendment does not cover all communication regulation. Different levels of scrutiny are applied to regulations based on the type of speech involved. Political and ideological speech receive strict scrutiny, while commercial speech is subject to a lower level of scrutiny known as the Central Hudson test. This test requires the government to show that its interest is substantial. The First Amendment requires the government to show that its interest is \"substantial\" and that the regulation \"directly advances the governmental interest asserted.\" Lower courts struggle to balance First Amendment interests with data protection regulations, as seen in cases like Trans Union Corp. v. FTC where restrictions on selling marketing lists were deemed to have \"reduced constitutional protection.\" The court in Trans Union Corp. v. FTC determined that restrictions on selling marketing lists were subject to \"reduced constitutional protection\" as they were not considered a public issue. This ruling was based on defamation case law and the concept that speech solely in the private interest of the speaker receives lower First Amendment protection. Other courts have used similar reasoning to uphold data protection laws under the commercial speech test. In U.S. West v. FCC, the Tenth Circuit struck down FCC regulations on the use and disclosure of Consumer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) for limiting carriers' ability to engage in consumer marketing. The court found that the government's interest in protecting consumer privacy was not sufficient to justify the regulations, as they did not advance a substantial state interest and could have been achieved through a narrower regulation like consumer opt-out. After the Tenth Circuit's decision in U.S. West v. FCC, the FCC made minor changes to its regulations regarding the use of CPNI, maintaining elements of the opt-in procedure. The D.C. Circuit later upheld these modified regulations in a 2009 case, showing disagreement with the Tenth Circuit on the importance of privacy interests. The Supreme Court's 2011 case Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc. was a significant examination of the First Amendment in relation to data protection legislation. In Sorrell v. IMS Health, the Court considered the constitutionality of a Vermont law restricting sales, disclosures, and uses of pharmacy records. Pharmaceutical manufacturers and data miners challenged the law, arguing it violated their First Amendment rights. Vermont claimed the law regulated conduct, not speech, but the Court acknowledged that information creation and dissemination are forms of speech. Ultimately, the Court did not fully embrace the idea that prescriber identifying information is speech for First Amendment purposes. The Court in Sorrell v. IMS Health did not fully embrace the idea that prescriber identifying information is speech for First Amendment purposes. Vermont's law was deemed to regulate the content of speech by targeting pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain types of pharmaceutical marketing. The Court disagreed with Vermont's argument that its regulations passed the lower level of scrutiny applicable to commercial speech. The Court in Sorrell v. IMS Health found that Vermont's law targeted certain types of pharmaceutical marketing, raising concerns of viewpoint discrimination. The law failed to meet the standard of scrutiny, as its justification in protecting physician privacy was not supported by its reach in allowing prescriber-identifying information's use. The Sorrell v. IMS Health case raised concerns of viewpoint discrimination in Vermont's law targeting pharmaceutical marketing. Lower courts have varied interpretations on the impact of Sorrell on privacy regulation, with no consensus on its effects. Some believe it will have a significant impact on future privacy regulation. The Sorrell v. IMS Health case may have a significant impact on future privacy regulation by applying First Amendment principles to the regulation of personally identifiable information as speech. Policymakers will need to ensure any restrictions on information are justified by a substantial interest and no more extensive than necessary. Congress can regulate data protection as long as it avoids the pitfalls of the law in Sorrell. The legal landscape governing data protection in the United States is complex and technical, creating challenges for legislators as data privacy legislation evolves. The \"right to privacy\" offers limited safeguards for internet users, and proposals for a unified federal data protection policy raise intricate legal issues. Congress has enacted laws to address data protection, but the balance between privacy and government access to personal data remains a contentious issue. The legal landscape governing data protection in the United States is complex, with Congress enacting laws to address data protection. However, there is a patchwork of federal laws limited to specific industry participants and data practices. Some governments, like California and the EU, have enacted comprehensive data protection laws. The 116th Congress may consider a federal data protection program, with various decision points and legal considerations to address. The scope of any legislative proposal on data protection issues includes deciding on approaches, defining protected information, enforcement by federal agency, and addressing standing requirements for individuals to enforce laws in court. Complex legal questions arise regarding federal preemption and the form it should take. The legislative proposal on data protection raises complex legal questions about federal preemption and the First Amendment's implications on privacy regulations and protected speech."
