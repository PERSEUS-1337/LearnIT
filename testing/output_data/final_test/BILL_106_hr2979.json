The \"Medicare Hospital Outpatient Payment Equality (HOPE) Act of 1999\" aims to refine the Medicare prospective payment system for outpatient hospital services by introducing a special payment adjustment for certain visits, such as emergency room visits or clinic visits. This adjustment factor is calculated based on the amount of payment determined under paragraph (4) for services classified within specific ambulatory patient classification groups. The adjustment factor for covered OPD services within ambulatory patient classification groups for emergency room visits is determined based on estimating the total payable amount for services furnished in 2000 if payment was based on reasonable costs incurred. The Secretary estimates total payments for covered OPD services in specific groups in 2000. Adjustment factor determined by dividing total payments by estimated payable amount. Adjustment factor for clinic visits also calculated. Adjustment factor for clinic visits in covered OPD services is determined by substituting 'clinic' for 'er' and 'emergency room', and '94.2 percent of reasonable costs' for 'reasonable costs'. This factor relates to deductibles in subsection (b) for a covered service. The adjustments required for covered OPD services are not subject to budget neutrality requirements and do not affect copayment amounts or the Medicare OPD fee schedule. The adjustments required for covered OPD services, including Medicare OPD fee schedule amounts, pre-deductible payment percentages, and compliance with volume control mechanism, shall be taken into account in applying temporary limits on payment reductions. The elimination of reduction in market basket is also addressed in the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act is amended to remove a percentage point reduction for services provided in 2000, 2001, and 2002.
