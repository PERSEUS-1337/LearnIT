    "title": "AB 1296",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 9114 of the Elections Code is amended to require the elections official to examine a petition within 30 days of filing to determine if it has the required number of voter signatures. The official may use duplicate affidavits or facsimiles of signatures to verify the signatures. Proponents of the petition will be notified of its sufficiency. If a petition is deemed insufficient, no further action will be taken. However, the lack of enough signatures does not prevent a new petition on the same subject from being filed later. If the petition is found sufficient, the elections official will place the initiative measure on the election ballot and certify the results to the board of supervisors. The measure will remain on the ballot unless the board adopts it without changes or a court orders its removal. The initiative measure will be placed on the election ballot unless a court orders its removal. Section 9115 of the Elections Code is amended to allow for random sampling verification of signatures on petitions with more than 500 signatures. The random sample must include at least 500 signatures or 3 percent of the total, whichever is greater. If the statistical sampling shows that the number of valid signatures is within 95 to 110 percent of the required amount, the elections official will verify the signatures within 60 days. If enough qualified voter signatures are found early, the verification process may be stopped. (c) The elections official may use duplicate files or facsimiles of voters' signatures to determine the number of valid signatures on the petition. A certificate showing the examination result will be attached to the petition, and the proponents will be notified of sufficiency or insufficiency. If found insufficient, a new petition can be filed later. If the petition is deemed sufficient, the elections official will place the initiative measure on the election ballot and certify the results to the board of supervisors. The measure will be placed on the earliest legally possible date unless the board of supervisors chooses a different date. It cannot be removed from the ballot unless the board adopts it without changes or a court orders its removal. The initiative measure will be placed on the election ballot by the elections official unless a court orders its removal. Section 9211 of the Elections Code is amended to specify that the elections official will handle petitions in the same manner as county petitions, with references to the board of supervisors treated as references to the city's legislative body. Section 9308 is also amended to outline the process for district petitions, with similar provisions. Section 9309 of the Elections Code is repealed. Section 9309 of the Elections Code is repealed. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts shall be made according to the Government Code."
