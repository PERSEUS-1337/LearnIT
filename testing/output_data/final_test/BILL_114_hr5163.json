The \"Territorial Economic Growth and Recovery Act of 2016\" repeals limitations on cover over of distilled spirits taxes and provides for payments to United States territories and possessions. Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include provisions for payments to possessions with mirror code tax systems. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay possessions of the United States without a mirror code tax system estimated amounts equal to benefits residents would have received under this section if a mirror code tax system was in place. This does not apply unless the possession has an approved plan by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury will distribute payments to residents of possessions of the United States under an approved plan. No credit is allowed for individuals eligible for payments under this plan. Definitions and special rules apply for possessions of the United States. The term 'possession of the United States' includes Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. A 'mirror code tax system' refers to the income tax system of a possession that mirrors the US tax laws, with a similar tax credit. The Secretary will make annual payments to the Virgin Islands and Guam to compensate for revenue losses due to changes in the tax code. The payments will be determined based on information provided by the territories. The amendments made by this section will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2015. The Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries will report on recommendations for sustaining Virgin Islands public pension plans for the next 20 years."
