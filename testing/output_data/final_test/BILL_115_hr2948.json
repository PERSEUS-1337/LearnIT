    "content": "The S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 is amended to include a new section on employment transition for loan originators. The S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 is amended to allow loan originators moving from depository to non-depository institutions temporary authority to originate loans in an application State under certain conditions. The S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 allows loan originators to have temporary authority to originate loans in an application State if they meet certain conditions, including not having a felony conviction that would prevent licensure, submitting an application to be a State-licensed loan originator, and being registered in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry as a loan originator in the preceding 12 months. The S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 grants temporary authority to State-licensed loan originators to act in an application State under certain conditions, including submitting an application and being listed on the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. The S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 allows State-licensed loan originators to temporarily work in an application State if they meet specific requirements, including being employed by a State-licensed mortgage company in the application State and being licensed in a different State within the 30-day period before submitting the required information. The S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 allows State-licensed loan originators to work temporarily in an application State under certain conditions. The connection with the application ends when the State-licensed loan originator withdraws the application, the application is denied, a State license is granted, or 120 days after the application submission if listed as incomplete on the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. Any person employing an individual with temporary authority to act as a loan originator in an application State must comply with federal and state laws as if the individual was a State-licensed loan originator. Individuals with temporary authority engaging in mortgage loan origination activities are also subject to the same requirements. In this section, definitions for \"State-licensed mortgage company\" and \"application State\" are provided. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 is amended to include these definitions in the table of contents. The S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 is amended to include provisions regarding the employment transition of loan originators. The effective date for this Act and its amendments is set to be 18 months after enactment."
