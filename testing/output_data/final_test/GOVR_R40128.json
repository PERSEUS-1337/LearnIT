    "content": "The President's authority to issue pardons is outlined in the Constitution, limited to offenses against the United States and excluding Cases of Impeachment. This power allows pardons to be granted at any time, even after conviction and during the serving of a sentence. A pardon may be issued after conviction to restore civil rights, and the President can pardon a group of offenders. The power of pardon was established in the Constitution based on English custom, allowing for mercy in unique cases. The Framers believed the President was best suited to grant mercy, with minimal limitations on the power. The Framers rejected proposals to limit the President's pardoning power, as established in the Constitution. Courts have upheld that Congress cannot restrict the President's ability to pardon offenders, as seen in Ex Parte Garland and other cases. The power of pardon is solely entrusted to the executive without legislative control. The President's pardon power, as established in the Constitution, cannot be restricted by Congress. While Members of Congress have expressed opinions on the President's use of pardons, the power remains solely with the executive branch. Pardons are typically granted for a wide range of offenses, with some attempts to limit this power through proposed constitutional amendments. The President's pardon power is broad and cannot be restricted by Congress. Pardons can completely absolve individuals of their crimes, as seen in cases like President Nixon's pardon for the Watergate Scandal and President Bush's pardons in the Iran-Contra Affair. However, pardons can also be limited or conditional, such as in the commutation of sentences. The judiciary recognizes this flexibility as inherent in the President's pardon authority. The Supreme Court has affirmed the broad scope of the President's pardoning power, stating that the power to pardon includes the authority to commute sentences. However, the legal effect of executive clemency is still debated, with courts disagreeing on whether a pardon only erases the punishment or also the guilt of the offender. In United States v. Wilson, Chief Justice Marshall stated that a pardon exempts an individual from punishment for a crime. However, in Ex Parte Garland, Chief Justice Field declared that a full pardon not only removes punishment but also blots out the guilt of the offender, restoring them to innocence in the eyes of the law. The pardoning power removes penalties and disabilities, restoring civil rights and giving a new credit and capacity. However, the Supreme Court narrowed this interpretation in the early 20th Century. In Carlesi v. New York, the Court approved of using past offenses as aggravating circumstances for sentencing, even after a presidential pardon. The Supreme Court has upheld a restricted view of the effect of pardons, stating that pardons do not overturn convictions or remove indictments from criminal records. This was reinforced in cases related to the Iran-Contra affair, where pardons did not prevent penalties or the recovery of attorneys fees. The Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, ruled that a pardon does not prevent disciplinary action for professional misconduct. Recent decisions suggest a shift away from the broad language in Garland, indicating that a pardon only cancels the punishment for an offense while the guilt remains. Pardons must be physically delivered to be legally effective, as stated in United States v. Wilson by Chief Justice Marshall. \"A pardon is a deed that requires delivery and acceptance for validity. It must be pleaded before a court, and its automatic effect upon issue was rejected. A pardon can be refused, revoked before acceptance, and may involve consequences of greater disgrace. In re De Puy addressed the revocability of a pardon.\" In In re De Puy, a pardon issued by President Johnson was revoked by incoming President Grant before delivery. Similarly, President George W. Bush revoked a pardon for Isaac R. Toussie after it was discovered that his father had made a large donation to the Republican National Committee. The Pardon Attorney reviewed the Toussie case, which had not been reviewed according to Department of Justice regulations. The Office of the Pardon Attorney accepts and reviews applications for clemency, preparing recommendations for the President. Department of Justice regulations require a formal petition for executive clemency to be submitted to the President through the Pardon Attorney in Washington, D.C. The regulations for executive clemency require a waiting period of at least five years after release from confinement or conviction. No petitions should be submitted by individuals on probation, parole, or supervised release. An investigation is conducted by government agencies like the FBI, and the Pardon Attorney presents the petition to the Attorney General for a final decision. The Pardon Attorney makes a recommendation on petitions for clemency, which is then submitted to the President. Regulations allow limited access to documents related to the petition, with the Attorney General having the authority to disclose them if required by law or justice. These regulations are advisory and do not rigidly restrict the Pardon Attorney's ability to consider pardon petitions. The regulations for clemency petitions are advisory and do not bind the President's power to grant pardons."
