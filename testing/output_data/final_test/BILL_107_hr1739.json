    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Urban Sprawl and Smart Growth Study Act\". The Congress finds that urban sprawl destroys open space, wildlife, and resources, leading to costly public expenditures. Smart growth can prevent these issues and improve quality of life. Federal agencies can benefit from guidance on using environmental impact statements to address urban sprawl. Environmental assessments are crucial for considering the effects of proposed actions on urban sprawl and smart growth. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. SMART GROWTH STUDY.\" is a concise statement about a study on smart growth. The Council on Environmental Quality will conduct a study on urban sprawl and smart growth, updating previous studies. They will analyze environmental impact statements from at least 15 Federal agencies post-1995, focusing on land management, transportation, and development programs. Public participation will be encouraged through meetings in 5 selected cities. The Council on Environmental Quality will conduct a study on urban sprawl and smart growth, analyzing environmental impact statements from 15 Federal agencies. They will focus on land management, transportation, and development programs, holding discussions with government personnel and Indian tribes. A report will be submitted to Congress within 18 months detailing the study's findings. The Council on Environmental Quality will analyze the economic, environmental, and land use effects of urban sprawl, providing recommendations for improving environmental reviews and nonregulatory actions by Federal agencies to promote smart growth and minimize adverse effects. The Council on Environmental Quality will analyze the economic, environmental, and land use effects of urban sprawl, seeking participation from other Federal agencies. $300,000 is authorized for the Council to carry out this section. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must address the impact of any proposed legislation, Federal project, or regulation on urban sprawl in written comments prepared under the Clean Air Act. Additionally, before deciding whether to prepare an environmental impact statement, notification, consultation, and consideration of effects must be conducted. In preparing an environmental assessment for a proposed Federal action, the head of a Federal agency must publish notice of the action, notify affected parties, conduct discussions, and address concerns. If requested, consideration for an environmental impact statement must be given by the Governor of a State or the head of a local government or Indian tribe. When a tribe submits a written statement to a Federal agency stating that a proposed action will cause urban sprawl affecting the environment, the agency must consider preparing an environmental impact statement. If the agency determines that an environmental impact statement is not required, an environmental assessment for the action must be included. The Federal agency must include an analysis of the environmental effects on urban sprawl in an environmental impact statement for each alternative under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The agency must also provide public notice of the assessment's availability and transmit a copy to the Council on Environmental Quality. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms including \"Council\" as the Council on Environmental Quality, \"environmental assessment\" as defined in regulations, \"environmental impact statement\" as a detailed statement under NEPA, and \"Indian tribe\" as any recognized eligible group or community. The Native Claims Settlement Act recognizes eligible Indian tribes for special programs and services provided by the United States. Urban sprawl is defined as a dispersed form of development outside urban centers that may result in loss of open space and high public costs for infrastructure. Smart growth refers to policies that recognize and mitigate the environmental, economic, and social costs of new growth and development to avoid or reduce negative effects on infrastructure and public facilities in urban or suburban areas."
