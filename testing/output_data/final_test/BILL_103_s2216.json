The Congress finds that there are approximately 100,000,000 unexploded antipersonnel landmines in over 60 countries, with millions more in stockpiles. Landmines are compared to chemical and biological weapons for their indiscriminate killing and maiming. Following a US moratorium on landmine exports, the UN General Assembly and several countries have also called for international moratoriums on such exports. Despite export moratoria announced by several countries, the use of antipersonnel landmines continues to result in numerous casualties, with innocent civilians, including women and children, being the most affected. International cooperation is crucial to limit the production, possession, transfer, and use of these deadly weapons to prevent further loss of innocent lives. The Conventional Weapons Convention, including the Landmine Protocol, is scheduled for 1995. Meetings are underway to prepare for the conference, emphasizing the need for United States leadership to address the landmine crisis. The sense of Congress is that the President should actively seek international agreements to prohibit the production, possession, transfer, and use of antipersonnel landmines. Additionally, interim measures should be pursued to limit further the production, possession, transfer, and use of these landmines. A moratorium on the production and procurement of antipersonnel landmines is also recommended. (a) Sense of Congress: A moratorium on the purchase and production of antipersonnel landmines by the United States would set an example for other nations to follow.\n(b) Moratorium: The US Government will stop purchasing or producing antipersonnel landmines 90 days after this Act is enacted.\n(c) Period of Moratorium: The prohibition will last for one year from the date of enactment.\n(d) Actions by Other Nations: The President is urged to encourage major producers of antipersonnel landmines to adopt a similar moratorium. The President may extend the moratorium on antipersonnel landmines for major producers like Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Authorization of $10,000,000 for humanitarian demining activities and $10,000,000 for landmine detection and neutralization efforts. The Administrator of the Agency for International Development and the Secretary of State must submit a joint report to Congress within 180 days of this Act, analyzing the social, economic, and environmental impacts of antipersonnel landmines in at least three countries. The report will rely on various governmental and nongovernmental sources. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense is required to report the total number of military personnel. The Secretary of Defense must report the total number of US Armed Forces members killed or wounded by antipersonnel landmines in various conflicts, including World War II, the Korean conflict, the Vietnam era, and the Persian Gulf War. The report is to be submitted concurrently with another required report to Congress. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.
