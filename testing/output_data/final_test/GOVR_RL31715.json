    "content": "The report provides information and analysis on the buildup to the 2003 war with Iraq and the war itself. It includes a background on the conflict evolution after September 11, 2001, U.S. policy analysis, congressional actions, and various issues raised for Congress. The report will not be further updated since the combat phase has ended. The report discusses the buildup to the 2003 war with Iraq, including concerns about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs raised by the Bush Administration after 9/11. Vice President Cheney accused Saddam Hussein of seeking weapons of mass destruction to dominate the Middle East and threaten U.S. oil supplies. This fueled speculation of potential unilateral action by the United States. Contact information is provided for congressional readers seeking additional information. Text boxes list CRS products for more in-depth information on related topics. Additional sources of information on the Iraq crisis are also linked. President Bush pledged to work with the U.N. Security Council to address the challenge posed by Iraq. H.J.Res. 114 authorized the use of force against Iraq and endorsed efforts to ensure Iraqi compliance with U.N. resolutions. Resolution 1441 gave Iraq a final opportunity to comply with disarmament obligations, leading to a military buildup in the Persian Gulf in anticipation of a potential attack in early 2003. In early 2003, officials expressed dissatisfaction over Iraq's compliance with disarmament demands. President Bush and Secretary of State Powell warned that time was running out for Iraq to disarm, with the possibility of military action being taken either alone or with a coalition of allies. President Bush condemned Iraq in his State of the Union Address, warning of the potential threat posed by Saddam Hussein's weapons programs. Secretary of State Powell later detailed Iraq's deception to the United Nations. Bush emphasized the importance of removing Hussein's regime to disrupt terrorist networks. President Bush condemned Iraq in his State of the Union Address, emphasizing the need to remove Saddam Hussein's regime to disrupt terrorist networks. Despite limited international support for armed confrontation, President Chirac of France criticized the U.S. approach, questioning the evidence presented by Secretary of State Powell. President Chirac of France, along with France, Germany, and Russia, advocated for strengthened inspections in Iraq instead of immediate armed conflict. The United States, United Kingdom, and Spain introduced a resolution authorizing the use of force to disarm Iraq, which Chirac vowed to veto. Russian officials indicated they would likely follow suit. President Bush, after a meeting with the prime ministers of Britain and Spain, announced the withdrawal of the proposed Security Council resolution. He gave Saddam Hussein 48 hours to flee Iraq before military conflict would commence. The war against Iraq began on March 19, 2003, with an aerial attack targeting Saddam Hussein. U.S. and British troops entered Iraq on March 20, facing resistance but gaining control of Baghdad by April 9. President Bush declared Saddam's regime over on April 15. Public opinion shifted towards supporting the war after initial reluctance. Public opinion in the United States shifted in favor of the war against Iraq after key events such as the State of the Union message, Secretary Powell's presentation to the Security Council, and President Bush's speech on March 17. Polls consistently showed strong support for the war, even if no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq. Many Americans opposed the war in Iraq despite strong support for it in the United States. Anti-war demonstrations occurred in several cities, leading to a rise in anti-Americanism overseas, particularly in western Europe and the Middle East. Large protests were reported globally after the fighting began. Efforts to launch boycotts of U.S. products were reported in many cities worldwide after the fighting began. Rising anti-Americanism could complicate U.S. diplomacy in the future. Secretary of State Powell stated that the U.S. will seek to change foreign perceptions by supporting the United Nations in post-war Iraq, restarting the Arab-Israeli peace process, and reaching out to difficult allies. European opposition to the war may be moderating due to the successful overthrow of the Iraqi dictator, but concerns remain about disorder in Iraq. President Bush announced military operations against Iraq on March 19, 2003, after an ultimatum expired. By April 11, 2003, two days after Iraq's regime fell, President Bush awaited confirmation of U.S. victory from military commanders. As of April 22, combat had subsided, and U.S. forces focused on restoring security. As of April 22, U.S. forces shifted focus to restoring security and searching for members of Iraq's former regime and banned WMD programs. The Bush Administration justified confronting Iraq by citing Saddam Hussein's regime as a potential threat with active WMD programs that could be used against the U.S. or transferred to terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. Waiting for Iraq to make progress on WMD was deemed risky. The Bush Administration revived claims of Iraq's ties to Al Qaeda and support for terrorist groups, citing past assistance in constructing chemical weapons. Ansar al-Islam, linked to Al Qaeda, had contact with Iraq. Experts suggest limited cooperation in the early 1990s, but it trailed off after Osama bin Laden was expelled from Sudan. In the 1990s, Iraq-Al Qaeda cooperation dwindled after bin Laden was expelled from Sudan in 1996. Bin Laden expressed solidarity with Iraq but criticized Saddam Hussein's regime. The Bush Administration claimed Iraq breached U.N. resolutions on WMDs, leading to diplomatic tensions with allies opposing military action. Diplomatic negotiations to avert war between the United States and Britain failed due to insufficient support for a proposed U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force if Iraq did not comply with WMD disarmament mandates. The Bush Administration shifted focus from regime change to disarmament to appease critics, emphasizing the need for a friendly government in Baghdad to ensure WMD elimination. The Bush Administration emphasized regime change as a goal of the U.S.-led war against Iraq, with some arguing that WMD concerns were secondary. There were divisions within the Administration on launching the war and post-war issues, such as the role of the United Nations in reconstruction. Secretary of State Powell believed in a long-term program of weapons inspections to contain the WMD threat from Iraq. Secretary Powell believed in using weapons inspections to contain the WMD threat from Iraq, but after January 2003, he acknowledged that war might be necessary if Iraq did not cooperate. Vice President Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld were in favor of military action, believing it would lead to democracy in Iraq and the Middle East. President Bush believed that overthrowing Saddam Hussein could lead to democracy in the Middle East and resolve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Congress overwhelmingly supported Operation Iraqi Freedom, expressing strong backing for U.S. military forces and their families. The House and Senate passed resolutions showing appreciation for the President and armed forces involved in the operation. After Congress overwhelmingly supported Operation Iraqi Freedom, they approved a large supplemental appropriations bill for military operations in Iraq, economic aid for foreign governments, and homeland security support. Congress had been actively involved in supporting U.S. foreign policy objectives since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, including calling for the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime and the establishment of a democratic Iraqi state. In 2002, Congress authorized the President to use military force against Iraq to defend national security and enforce UN resolutions. The resolution granted broad authority to the President and required periodic reports to Congress. Congressional support was expressed for prompt action by the Security Council to ensure Iraq's compliance with resolutions. In the aftermath of the authorization for military force against Iraq in 2002, Congress continued to influence U.S. policy towards Iraq. Some members supported President Bush's efforts to enforce UN resolutions, while others urged more transparency and international coalition-building. Concerns were raised about the urgency of the Iraq situation compared to other global issues. Members who opposed the authorization sought alternatives to prevent the use of force. During the diplomatic phase of the confrontation with Iraq, bills introduced ranged from measures that would forestall military action to calls for punitive action against European nations that did not support the use of military force against Iraq. Many analysts suggested that these proposals were mostly symbolic gestures and had insufficient support for passage. The Senate did pass S. 205, which would have granted visas and admission of residency to Iraqi scientists willing to cooperate. The Senate passed S. 205, granting visas to Iraqi scientists for cooperation on weapons of mass destruction. S.Con.Res. 4 welcomed European support for UN Resolution 1441. H.Con.Res. 118 condemned Iraq's treatment of prisoners of war, while H.Res. 153 recognized the need for prayer and fasting during the conflict in Iraq. The Senate passed resolutions of gratitude to nations supporting the US in Iraq, and a bill providing free phone time to troops. Congress also passed a tax relief bill for armed forces. Proposed resolutions include urging debt forgiveness for Iraq and public disclosure of reconstruction contracts. Congress became more vocal in requesting specific information from the Bush Administration on post-war plans for Iraq, particularly regarding reconstruction costs. Chairman Richard Lugar mentioned on \"Meet the Press\" that it could take at least five years to create a stable infrastructure in Iraq. Many analysts believe that creating a functioning democracy in Iraq could take at least five years and require additional funds from Congress. Andrew S. Natsios stated that supplemental funding for Iraq's reconstruction will not last into fiscal year 2004. International organizations and foreign governments are urged to contribute to the rebuilding effort, with some Members suggesting a wider role for the international community in post-war reconstruction. After the downfall of Saddam Hussein's regime, Iraq will need humanitarian aid, police, and military forces for civil order. Congress questions the duration and extent of U.S. assistance needed. All Iraqi military resistance has ceased, and coalition forces are restoring public order and basic services. In post-war Iraq, efforts are focused on establishing public order, restoring basic services, tracking down former regime members, and locating weapons. CENTCOM has divided the region into three command regions. Retired Army Major General Jay Garner is leading reconstruction efforts in the south. The strategy involved rapid advance, securing oilfields, port facilities, and air bases. Iraqi resistance was sporadic and uncohesive. In northern and western Iraq, there were no widespread environmental sabotage despite a few oil wells being set afire. Over 6,500 Iraqis were taken prisoner, with many more deserting their positions. Iraqi paramilitary forces engaged in guerrilla attacks but did not cause significant damage. Attention was focused on protecting supply lines and securing urban centers, particularly in an-Nasiriyah, Najaf, Umm Qasr, and Basra. Cooperation from the Shiia population was slow but is now emerging, despite some factional fighting and popular opposition. In northern Iraq, despite some factional fighting and popular opposition, Special Operations forces, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, and air-lifted U.S. armor, operating with Kurdish irregulars, seized Mosul and Kirkuk. Cooperation with Kurdish militias has been excellent, even after a mistaken airstrike against a Kurdish vehicle convoy. The Turkish military may augment their troops in Kurdish-held territory to block potential Kurdish refugees, but they have stated no additional forces will move into Iraq at this time. The United States has assured Turkey that Kurdish forces in Mosul and Kirkuk will be replaced with U.S. troops. Coalition forces are facing challenges in restoring public order and infrastructure in the cities. Criticism towards U.S. forces for not preventing looting is present, as they transition from combat to police roles. The situation is further complicated by small-scale attacks on coalition troops in secure areas. Increased patrols, Iraqi police returning to duty, and civilian \"watchgroups\" are helping reduce looting in secure areas. Coalition forces must prevent factional violence and retribution. The U.S. is deploying new ground units to the Persian Gulf while withdrawing air and naval units. Approximately 340,000 U.S. personnel are deployed in the region. The 1st Armored Division, 1st Mechanized Division, 4th Mechanized Infantry Division, 101st Airborne Division, 173rd Airborne Brigade, and 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment have deployed to Iraq. The U.S. has withdrawn two carrier battle groups, ceased Operation Northern Watch, and redeployed Air Force units. British forces include an armor Battle Group, naval Task Force, and Royal Air Force units in the region. The United States has deployed approximately 47,000 personnel, including Royal Marines and Royal Air Force units. Australia has sent around 2,000 special operations forces to western Iraq, while Poland has 200 special operations troops supporting British forces in Basra. Over 223,000 National Guard and Reservists have been called to active duty. The U.S. has personnel and equipment stationed in Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The United States, Australia, and Poland offered combat force contributions in support of U.S. military operations in Iraq. Other countries like Germany, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine have military NBC defense teams in Kuwait but will not enter Iraq. The U.S. is seeking military forces from additional countries for post-conflict stabilization efforts. The United States, Britain, and Spain announced on March 17, 2003, their willingness to participate in post-conflict stabilization efforts in Iraq. Other countries like Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, Poland, Romania, and Turkey have also shown interest. The key issues include determining the number of ground forces needed for maintaining order during the reconstruction of Iraq and the duration of the operation, with estimates ranging from 75,000 to over 200,000 troops and several months to a decade for the operation. The willingness of the Iraqi population to cooperate with coalition forces and among themselves remains unpredictable. The United States, Britain, and Spain withdrew their proposed \"second resolution\" at the United Nations Security Council on March 17, 2003. President Bush gave Saddam Hussein an ultimatum to flee or face military conflict. This marked the end of a diplomatic effort to gain Security Council support for action against Iraq, leading to bitter aftermath among U.S. officials and European opponents. Russia's Prime Minister and German Chancellor criticized the military action as unjustified and a bad decision. The decision for war over peace was criticized by European leaders initially, but as the war progressed, rhetoric softened to avoid further rift with the United States. French President Chirac expressed satisfaction with Saddam's overthrow and offered to cooperate on postwar reconstruction. US leaders also reached out to ease tensions with Europe, with President Bush and Putin agreeing to continue dialogue on Iraq. The United Nations role in post-war Iraq remains a point of contention between the US and UK, with Prime Minister Blair advocating for a major UN role while US officials prefer a focus on humanitarian relief operations. Diplomatic complications could arise, potentially affecting US-British relations. The British government had supported the appointment of a UN special coordinator for Iraq to oversee the creation of an interim authority and eventual handover to an Iraqi government. The US and UK differ on the UN's role in post-war Iraq, with US officials preferring to orchestrate events themselves. European critics advocate a central UN role in administering Iraq and transitioning to democracy. European leaders support the overthrow of Saddam but stress the importance of UN involvement in Iraq's future. The European Union and critics of the war advocate for a central UN role in rebuilding Iraq and transitioning to self-government. Many in Europe see UN administration as crucial for legitimizing the new government and ensuring European participation in the recovery efforts. France, Russia, and Germany support extending the Oil-for-Food Program under UN administration, while some in the Bush Administration prefer US control. President Bush called for lifting all U.N. sanctions against Iraq, potentially ending the Oil-for-Food Program and weapons inspections. European governments may oppose this, as the program gave them a voice in Iraq through the U.N. Debate continues on improving U.S. relations with Europe. Debate continues on the value of improving U.S. relations with European allies, with some questioning the benefits of compromising with critics of the war. Concerns exist that President Chirac may aim to balance and constrain U.S. power, potentially damaging U.S. interests. The controversy over Iraq has strained international institutions like the United Nations, NATO, and the European Union. Healing relations with European critics of the United States can reduce tensions within these organizations and help them recover. Improved US relations with Germany and France could lead to a major EU financial contribution to global issues. Many European countries with significant Muslim populations are closely watching developments in the region. Many European countries with significant Muslim populations closely monitor developments in the Middle East for security reasons. During the war, the US requested countries to close Iraqi embassies, freeze assets, and expel diplomats. Responses varied, with some countries complying fully, while others only expelled suspected spies. President Bush later issued an executive order to use frozen Iraqi assets for humanitarian purposes. Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the United States requested other countries to freeze Iraqi assets for humanitarian purposes. Concerns about Turkey sending troops into northern Iraq were addressed diplomatically to prevent conflict with Kurdish separatists. An agreement was reached allowing Turkey to send a small monitoring team into northern Iraq to ensure stability. President Bush warned Turkey against military intervention on March 24, and Secretary of State Powell visited Turkey on April 2, 2003. Turkey agreed to send a small monitoring team into northern Iraq to prevent potential intervention. Nonlethal supplies for U.S. troops in Iraq were allowed to transit through Turkey. U.S. officials pressured Russia and Syria to stop supporting the Iraqi war effort by selling military equipment. The U.S. warned against the threat of armed Iraqi opposition forces crossing from Iran into Iraq, particularly the Badr Brigade. Tensions with Syria escalated as accusations of harboring Saddam regime leaders and allowing mercenaries to attack U.S. troops were made. However, tensions eased as President Bush expressed confidence in Syrian cooperation. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow is leading efforts to promote Iraq's recovery through diplomatic means. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow is leading international efforts to support Iraq's rebuilding, with a preliminary agreement reached by G-7 nations pending U.N. authorization. Challenges exist in convincing governments to forgive Iraq's debt, particularly with Russia's resistance due to its own financial struggles. Iraq's weapons programs and alleged support for terrorism were cited as reasons for disarmament. The justifications for forcibly disarming Iraq included allegations of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), but no WMD were found during the war. General Amir Saadi denied Iraq's possession of WMD, but doubts remain. The need to find evidence of WMD to justify the invasion is debated, with some suggesting public support does not hinge on this. International verification may be required if WMD are discovered. Iraq's Deployable Weapons of Mass Destruction? U.S. intelligence reports suggested that Hussein had chemical and biological weapons ready to be fired, with established command and control. Some believed that U.S. forces toppled Iraq's military command structure, limiting the authorization to use such weapons. Iraq had limited delivery options and using WMD would turn world opinion against them. The threat of WMD use was expected to increase as U.S. forces approached Baghdad. Many expected U.S. forces to quickly find Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Despite misleading reports of chemical weapons discoveries, U.S. forces have not located Iraq's weapons of mass destruction or related sites. Tests revealed that exposure at an Iraqi military compound was to chemical pesticides, not nerve agents. Claims of medium-range missiles containing sarin and mustard gas were unverified. Interviews with former weapons experts may hold the key to uncovering Iraq's WMD past. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld expressed doubts about finding anything, emphasizing the importance of finding individuals with knowledge. General Saadi surrendered to U.S. forces, followed by the location of Dr. Jaffar Jaffar, head of Iraq's nuclear program. Dr. Jaffar Jaffar, head of Iraq's nuclear program, was found in an undisclosed country. U.S. forces raided the home of Iraq's head biological weapons scientist, Dr. Rihab Taha. A scientist involved in the chemical weapons program stated that Iraq had destroyed chemical weapons and biowarfare equipment before the war. The Army's 75th Exploitation Task Force, with former UN inspectors, is searching for WMD at 36 priority sites out of a potential 1000. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is negotiating contracts with private companies to destroy WMD stocks found in Iraq. This contrasts with the 1991 Gulf War where air strikes and ground forces destroyed Iraq's WMD capabilities, including chemical weapon warehouses. The task force, part of the Iraq Survey Group, will consist of civilian scientists, technicians, intelligence analysts, and other experts led by a U.S. general. Inadvertent destruction of WMD could pose environmental and safety issues. The Department of Defense investigation concluded that up to 100,000 U.S. personnel could have been affected by environmental releases of chemical warheads, including at the Khamisiyah site. NBC units have made advancements since the Persian Gulf War, but challenges remain in detecting WMDs. The impact of inadvertent destruction of WMDs depends on the type of weapon, storage conditions, and environmental factors. The role of U.N. inspectors in monitoring WMDs was discussed from November 2002 to March 2003. The United Nations Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) conducted around 750 inspections at 550 sites in Iraq, uncovering empty chemical weapon shells, undeclared documents on uranium enrichment, and cluster bombs that could be used with chemical or biological agents. Iraq destroyed 70 Al-Samoud-2 missiles as a result of the inspections. UNMOVIC's Executive Chairman Dr. Hans Blix expressed disappointment at the unfinished job of the inspectors. The U.N. has not been asked to help verify any WMDs U.S. forces might uncover, but the White House is considering international verification. The White House is considering international verification of findings in Iraq, excluding U.N. inspectors. UN officials aim to revive a role for inspectors post-war. The IAEA will inspect Iraq's nuclear facilities, and there may be inspections for chemical weapons under the Chemical Weapons Convention. There are no current international inspection regimes for biological weapons or missiles. Some suggest the U.S. may be obligated to allow international inspections of chemical weapons if acquired from Iraq. The Bush Administration had concerns about post-war fragmentation and instability in Iraq, fearing chaos among Sunni Muslims, Shiites, and Kurds, with potential influence from neighboring countries. Confidence in Iraq's disarmament under the Chemical Weapons Convention may rely on verifiable disarmament and assurances from future Iraqi leaders. The Bush Administration had concerns about post-war fragmentation and instability in Iraq, fearing chaos among Sunni Muslims, Shiites, and Kurds, with potential influence from neighboring countries. Some observers believed that post-war Iraq might be governed by a military or Baath Party figure not necessarily committed to full democracy but compliant with U.N. resolutions. The Administration aimed to establish a stable and democratic successor regime in Iraq, with plans to transition to an Iraqi interim administration within six months. The Bush Administration aimed to establish a stable and democratic successor regime in Iraq, with plans to transition governance to an Iraqi interim administration within six months. The duration of the U.S. military occupation and troop numbers depended on Iraqi resistance, U.S. casualties, and the speed of choosing a successor regime. General Eric Shinseki suggested 200,000 troops might be needed for postwar occupation, while Lt. Gen. Jay Garner led civilian reconstruction efforts in Iraq. The Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, led by Jay Garner, was created to oversee post-war efforts in Iraq, including eliminating WMD and terrorist cells, economic reconstruction, and rebuilding the oil industry. Discussions between the U.S. and European allies focused on a potential U.N. role in post-war Iraq. Senior U.S. officials want to limit the U.N.'s role in post-war Iraq to humanitarian relief and economic reconstruction, while reserving decisions about the Iraqi power structure for the United States and Britain. They seek a new U.N. Security Council resolution to endorse a new government, despite potential objections from countries that opposed the war. The U.N. appointed a coordinator, Rafeuddin Ahmed, to oversee operations in Iraq. Iraqi groups opposed to Saddam Hussein generally oppose a U.S.-backed interim administration. The opposition groups, including the U.S.-backed Iraqi National Congress, fear that the Administration might yield substantial power to former Baath Party members. They named a six-man council to prepare for a transition government after meeting in northern Iraq in late February 2003. These leaders appeared to be competing for power after the fall of the regime. After the fall of the regime, leaders in post-war Iraq competed for power. The Bush Administration airlifted opposition fighters, led by Ahmad Chalabi, into Nasiriyah, endorsing them for key roles in an interim government. SCIRI and Shiite clerics in southern Iraq also sought authority. Shiite clerics in southern Iraq boycotted a meeting, calling for an Islamic state and the withdrawal of U.S. forces. Recent violence in Shiite areas may be linked to power struggles within the community. Iraq's oil reserves are expected to fund reconstruction efforts, with only a few oil wells set on fire during the conflict. The United States and Britain are working on getting Iraqi oil workers back to work and establishing a successor government to manage Iraq's oil sales. Fadhil Othman is being considered as an interim oil minister. There are concerns about the long-term development of Iraq's oil industry and which foreign energy firms will be involved. Russia, China, and others fear that the U.S. will control Iraq's oil industry with minimal participation from other countries. Before the war, 60% of Iraqis relied on the U.N.-supervised Oil-for-Food Program for food supplies. The program, exempt from the U.N. embargo on Iraq, began in 1996 but was suspended during the conflict. The U.N. Security Council restarted the program with Resolution 1472 on March 28, 2003, to deliver humanitarian goods worth $9 billion. Resolution 1472 restarted the Oil-for-Food Program under U.N. control for 45 days. President Bush called for lifting U.N. sanctions on Iraq, potentially phasing out the program. Congress granted the President authority to suspend most U.S. sanctions against Iraq. In November 2002, the U.S. contacted 50 countries for assistance in a war with Iraq. The Administration released a list of countries supporting U.S. efforts in Iraq, with only three supplying ground combat troops. Enlisting allies was crucial to show global endorsement for the use of force. Some Islamic countries supported the Bush Administration's aims but had to consider their populations' hostility towards U.S. actions. Analysts noted that nations backing U.S. policy were a mix of the convinced, concerned, and co-opted. Some governments asked to be removed from the coalition list. Active allied participation was not crucial from a military standpoint, as the U.S. mainly relied on its own military resources during the war in Afghanistan. The Bush Administration mainly relied on its own military resources during the war in Afghanistan, with only small contingents of special forces from other countries. Analysts speculate that this decision was due to the unique U.S. strategy of using special forces ground units for immediate air strikes. The Bush Administration primarily used U.S. forces for operations in Iraq due to their advanced military capabilities. Other countries like Britain, Australia, Poland, Denmark, South Korea, Spain, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine also made contributions in terms of troops, air and naval forces during the campaign. Several countries, including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine, pledged specialists in anti-chemical and -biological weapons. Romania sent non-combat troops, while Japan assisted in disposing of chemical and biological weapons and reinforced its naval fleet in the Indian Ocean. Other countries provided support such as granting overflight rights and back-filling for U.S. forces redeploying to Iraq. Canada planned to send troops to Afghanistan, freeing up U.S. soldiers for Iraq. Launching air strikes from countries near Iraq reduced the need for mid-air refueling and allowed for quicker re-arming of aircraft. Several countries near Iraq allowed the use of their airbases and seaports, reducing the need for mid-air refueling and enabling quicker response to ground force calls for air strikes. Hungary approved the use of its Taszar airbase for training Iraqi dissidents, but the program was suspended after training 100-150 individuals. The United States requested assistance from NATO allies, including AWACS aircraft and refueling, which was deferred. France, Germany, and Belgium vetoed requests to bolster Turkish defenses. France, Germany, and Belgium vetoed U.S. and Turkish requests to bolster Turkish defenses, fearing it would endorse an attack on Iraq. A compromise was reached to provide defensive missiles and AWACS crews solely for Turkey's defense. Despite the agreement, there are concerns about lasting consequences for NATO. NATO later announced the return of defensive missiles and surveillance aircraft as Turkey no longer felt threatened. The Bush Administration sought permission to use Turkish bases and ports for military operations. The Turkish parliament rejected a deal to allow 62,000 U.S. troops in Turkey in exchange for $6 billion in aid. Despite Prime Minister Erdogan's urging to wait, U.S. military vessels moved to the Gulf after the deal was rejected. Turkey later authorized overflight rights and sent troops into Iraq, against the wishes of the United States. After Secretary Powell's visit, Turkey agreed to allow the transshipment of nonlethal military supplies to U.S. forces in Iraq. Turkey's concerns about the Iraq conflict included economic losses from the 1991 Gulf War, opposition to war by 90% of the population, and fears of Kurdish separatist movements. They also sought assurances for the post-war role of Iraq's ethnic Turkmen. Jordan acknowledged the presence of U.S. military personnel on its soil for Patriot missile defense systems and search-and-rescue missions. Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait were involved in supporting the U.S. military during the 1991 Gulf War, allowing the use of airspace, military bases, and assistance in search-and-rescue operations. Saudi Arabia also increased oil production to offset any decrease from Iraq. Additionally, five U.S. aircraft carriers were deployed in the region. After the 1991 Gulf War, countries like Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Germany provided monetary contributions for post-conflict assistance. U.S. policymakers hope for international support in caring for refugees and reconstructing Iraq. Several countries expressed willingness to participate in humanitarian efforts and peacekeeping. U.S. diplomats approached 65 governments for assistance, with 58 countries responding positively. Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz emphasized the Bush Administration's push for contributions from allies. The U.S. is pressuring allies for contributions to assist in Iraq post-conflict. Japan and Canada have pledged funds, Rome will send troops, and Denmark proposes a peacekeeping force. The U.S.-led military campaign in Iraq could increase its influence in the Middle East but also lead to backlash. The U.S. military campaign in Iraq may lead to backlash in the Middle East, with regional governments feeling constrained in accommodating future U.S. policy goals. Allegations of Syria's involvement in Iraq could make it a potential target for U.S. military action, prompting other Middle Eastern countries to cooperate with U.S. policy goals to avoid reprisals. U.S. warnings about interference in Middle East affairs may lead to resentment. Some believe the war in Iraq will spark democratic revolution in the region. Efforts are being made to enhance economic development and education in the Middle East. Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has proposed an \"Arab Charter.\" Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has proposed an \"Arab Charter\" to promote wider political participation, economic integration, and mutual security measures in the Middle East. Critics question the effectiveness of U.S. Middle Eastern policy in supporting democratization and development, citing concerns about autocratic regimes and minimal assistance efforts. Some fear Islamic fundamentalist groups could take over in more open political systems in the Middle East. Lack of democracy experience may hinder democratic institution growth. A U.S.-installed government in Iraq may struggle for acceptance in the Arab world. Resolving the Iraq crisis could improve conditions for Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. The first Bush Administration facilitated a peace conference in Madrid in 1991 after dealing with the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. The current Bush Administration aims to pursue an Arab-Israeli peace settlement post-Iraq threat elimination. President Bush expressed commitment to implementing a peace roadmap. However, resentment over the U.S. campaign against Iraq may hinder Arab and Muslim cooperation. Large U.S. troop deployment in the Middle East for Iraq war and continued military presence may strain the region's security arrangements. A continued major U.S. military presence in the Middle East may lead to pressure on regional governments to align with U.S. policies in the short term. However, concerns exist that prolonged U.S. military commitments could fuel resentment from Islamic fundamentalists and nationalists, potentially resulting in long-term terrorism against U.S. interests. Even friendly Middle East countries may eventually seek a reduction in U.S. military presence, as indicated by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah's reported plan to request the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Saudi territory after Iraq's disarmament. In the altered post-Saddam Hussein environment, senior U.S. Defense officials are considering reducing military presence in the Middle East. Large-scale humanitarian and reconstruction assistance programs are planned by the United States in Iraq, with $560.7 million allocated for FY2003, including $43 million for reconstruction activities. The FY2003 Supplemental Appropriations (P.L. 108-11) provides $2.48 billion for Iraq's reconstruction efforts, covering sectors like water, sanitation, food, electricity, education, and rule of law. The President has control over the fund but must consult with Appropriations Committees before allocation. Tensions between the State Department and DOD persist, but USAID emphasizes a coordinated delivery system for aid. The Oil-for-Food Program (OFFP) in Iraq was suspended briefly in 2003, with $10 billion earmarked for humanitarian supplies. The UN Security Council approved Resolution 1472 to prioritize humanitarian needs for Iraqi civilians. The program depends on Iraq's cooperation and the security of UN personnel. Several agencies plan to use the OFFP system for aid distribution. The OFFP system is planned to be used for aid distribution, but coordination among donors is still uncertain. The Director, Benon Sevan, mentioned political obstacles hindering the release of funds. President Bush urged the UN to lift sanctions on Iraq to allow for the sale of oil for reconstruction purposes. President Bush urged the U.N. to lift sanctions on Iraq to allow for oil sales. U.S. officials believe sanctions may be lifted by April 21. The future of the OFFP is in question as it was created to ease sanctions. The U.S. is working on Iraq debt relief and has seized Iraqi assets for reconstruction, with an estimated $1.74 billion available. Additionally, efforts are being made to locate more assets controlled by Saddam Hussein for relief and reconstruction purposes. The U.N. issued a $2.2 billion appeal for humanitarian aid in Iraq, with $1.2 billion in pledges received. The U.S. sought assistance from over 65 nations for relief and reconstruction efforts. The EU allocated 100 million euros for humanitarian aid, while Japan pledged $100 million. Other international donors have also contributed funds for Iraq and neighboring countries. The U.S. Aid Policy Structure in Iraq was established to prepare for aid distribution, with the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) playing a key role. Led by General Tommy Franks, the ORHA is responsible for planning and implementing U.S. assistance efforts in Iraq, with civilian coordinators overseeing reconstruction, civil administration, and humanitarian relief. Plans were formulated before the war for three regional coordinators. Plans were formulated before the war for three regional coordinators in north, south, and central Iraq, staffed by \"free Iraqis\" living in democratic countries. General Garner sent advance teams to assess relief and reconstruction needs, with U.S. armed forces initially leading efforts before transitioning to Iraqi ministries, NGOs, and international organizations. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has deployed Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) in Iraq, but some U.S. humanitarian groups are concerned about the military taking charge of relief efforts. NGOs prefer U.N. leadership for legitimacy and wider participation in aid operations. The Oil-for-Food Program (OFFP) used Iraqi oil revenue to provide food and medicine to civilians. Sixty percent of Iraq's population received monthly food distributions. Food security is uncertain, and aid organizations prepared emergency supplies for post-war humanitarian needs. The borders of countries neighboring Iraq have remained quiet, allowing more time for preparation for potential population movements. Concerns exist about the absorptive capacity of neighboring countries and the impact of refugee flows on regional stability. Iran, Turkey, Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait have stated they will prevent refugees from entering, but are making preparations for assistance within Iraq or at border crossing points. NGOs and international organizations are also preparing for humanitarian assistance. NGOs are working on relief plans in Iraq, but the absence of experienced organizations raises concerns about implementation. The war is damaging infrastructure, disrupting services, and affecting the humanitarian situation. While widespread hunger and massive population movements have not yet occurred, lack of basic necessities like electricity and medical care is creating hardships. The United Nations predicts that nearly 40% of the Iraqi population may need food assistance. The United Nations anticipates that around 40% of the Iraqi population may require food aid soon due to security concerns hindering humanitarian assistance distribution. Despite challenges like looting and lawlessness, some private humanitarian groups are operating in southern Iraq independently from the military and ahead of the full return of U.N. staff. In southern Iraq, around 18 NGOs have formed the NGO Coordination Committee in Iraq (NCCI) to improve assistance efforts. Despite chaos and violence, deliveries of water, food, and medical supplies are slowly progressing. The overall situation still lacks consistent aid provision, with non-military flights into Baghdad pending approval. The U.N. urges coalition forces to protect essential infrastructure and enable full-scale aid efforts in Iraq. Iraq. Coalition troops are patrolling cities, controlling looting, and assisting with the restoration of public services. Signs of normal life are emerging in places like Baghdad with traffic jams, gas station lines, and food stalls. The United States is focusing on post-war relief priorities to bring law and order and humanitarian aid. Security and logistical challenges persist in delivering aid throughout the country. Aid agencies in Iraq are facing challenges with delivery routes, availability of trucks, and distribution in cities. They plan to establish bases but fear increased security risks. The EU is concerned about the independence of aid delivery. Water supply is a major challenge, with tanker deliveries to towns. Bitterness towards coalition forces hinders humanitarian efforts. The lack of electricity and fuel shortages in Iraq are major issues, with many sewer treatment plants not functioning properly. The International Committee of the Red Cross and a few NGOs are providing medical assistance in hospitals, which are struggling with varying levels of capacity and security. Staff are working tirelessly under difficult conditions to treat casualties. The ICRC and NGOs are providing medical assistance in hospitals in Iraq, where staff are working tirelessly under difficult conditions. Civilian casualties have been reported due to hostilities and unexploded ordinance. Concerns about epidemic diseases are rising due to summer heat, poor sanitation, and lack of electricity. The WHO is planning a full assessment of hospital situations, while a large U.S. Army hospital south of Baghdad is treating wounded and sick Iraqis. Food supplies are currently adequate, with increased deliveries from the WFP. The WFP is expanding humanitarian aid efforts in Iraq, planning to open corridors in Iran and dispatch food through Syria and Jordan. Security concerns cause delays in transportation. The WFP aims to provide food for 27 million people, but faces challenges in securing warehouses and activating distribution systems. Limited access hinders confirmation of population movements by the UN and aid agencies. Limited access by the United Nations and aid agencies hinders confirmation of population displacement reports in Iraq. There is an increase in people leaving Baghdad for the countryside and small towns, with movements mainly in the north. Emergency supplies are provided to aid agencies assisting Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), with the ICRC monitoring and providing aid to displaced families in northern Iraq. Arab families are pressured to leave by Kurds, while few refugees are moving out of Iraq. Some individuals were gathering near the Iraq/Iran border in the south after the fall of Baghdad. Approximately 30,000 displaced Iraqis have gathered near the Iraqi border close to western Iran. UNHCR is providing assistance to these individuals who do not plan to cross into Iran. Additionally, around 1,000 people have fled to a no-man's land on Jordan's border, where Jordanian authorities are requiring them to sign waivers agreeing to return to Iraq. Syria has sealed its border to all except those with visas, and some Iraqi refugees have been sent back to Iraq from a Syrian refugee camp. Third Country Nationals make up the majority of individuals leaving Iraq, with reports of asylum seekers at various border areas. The coalition-controlled port of Umm Qasr in Iraq is being prepared for large cargo ships, but delays are occurring for Australian cargo ships carrying food aid. There are concerns about slow offloading and inefficiency once the port is operational. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Sir Galahad has arrived with humanitarian supplies, which will be stored in a warehouse until distribution can resume under the OFFP. A team of port management specialists and engineers are assessing the damage to the port of Umm Qasr in Iraq to make it operational for humanitarian aid distribution. Transition initiatives for reconstruction are underway, including reopening schools, rebuilding infrastructure, and promoting democratic governance. United States military force against Iraq has raised concerns. The use of United States military force against Iraq raised legal issues regarding its legality under the Constitution, War Powers Resolution, and international law. Congress has the power to declare war, while the executive branch has the power to execute it. The President's authority to use military force without congressional authorization has been a subject of controversy, especially regarding offensive actions like in Iraq. The War Powers Resolution imposes specific procedural mandates on the President's use of force. The War Powers Resolution (WPR) imposes procedural mandates on the President's use of military force, requiring reports to Congress and termination of force use within a specified timeframe unless authorized by Congress. Legal requirements were met regarding the use of force in Iraq. The President used the Armed Forces of the United States to defend national security against Iraq and enforce UN resolutions. President Bush communicated his determination to Congress, stating that diplomatic means were insufficient and force was consistent with the fight against terrorism. The statute waived time limitations under the War Powers Resolution. The War Powers Resolution waived time limitations and required the President to report periodically to Congress. Congressional support was expressed for prompt action by the Security Council regarding Iraq's compliance with resolutions. Authorization for the use of force did not have a time limit and was not conditioned on Security Council approval. Subsequent to the authorization, a lawsuit was filed against President Bush seeking to enjoin military action against Iraq. The lawsuit filed against President Bush sought to enjoin military action against Iraq, arguing it exceeded Congress' authority or unconstitutionally delegated war powers. The trial court dismissed the suit as a nonjusticiable political question, and the appellate court ruled the separation of powers issues were not ripe for judicial review. The court also stated that Congress can confer substantial discretionary authority on the President. The First Circuit ruled that Congress can give the President substantial authority in foreign affairs, including the power to declare war. Those opposed to war with Iraq were advised to seek recourse through the political branches. The use of force against Iraq raised questions about its legitimacy under international law, particularly regarding self-defense rights. The right of States to use force in self-defense, including preemptive action, is recognized in international law. The concept of imminent threat has evolved with the rise of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, leading to debates on the legitimacy of preemptive self-defense. The Bush Administration expanded the parameters of preemptive self-defense in response to modern threats. The Bush Administration justified the use of force against Iraq by expanding the concept of preemptive self-defense to include preventive war. Critics argue that Iraq did not pose an imminent threat, making the military action more of a preventive war than traditional self-defense. Critics argue that the military action against Iraq has weakened international legal constraints on the use of force since World War II, potentially setting a precedent for similar actions against other states. The use of force against Iraq has raised questions about the violation of international legal standards governing preemption and the need for reformulation. The Charter of the United Nations aims to prevent war by prohibiting the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. It establishes a system of collective security through the Security Council, which can impose sanctions and authorize military action in certain situations like Korea, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and the Balkans. The Charter of the United Nations prohibits the use of force against states' territorial integrity or political independence. The Security Council can authorize military action in situations like Korea, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and the Balkans. The US, Great Britain, and Spain abandoned efforts to obtain new authorization for the use of force against Iraq in 2003. They argued that earlier resolutions provided sufficient authority for the use of force, citing Resolution 678 from 1990. The US and Great Britain argued that previous UN resolutions authorized the use of force against Iraq to remedy breaches of disarmament obligations and restore the conditions of the cease fire. The Attorney General of Great Britain and the White House asserted that a breach of Resolution 687 revived the authority to use force under Resolution 678. However, some members of the Security Council disagreed, stating that the decision to authorize the use of force should be made by the Security Council, not individual member states. They emphasized that Iraq's agreement to the cease-fire conditions was with the Security Council, not individual member states. Resolution 1441 imposed an enhanced inspections regime on Iraq to give them a final opportunity to comply with disarmament obligations. It did not authorize the use of force, stating that another resolution would be needed for that. The legal debate on the legitimacy of military action lacked a final resolution. The debate surrounding the legality of military action against Iraq under the U.N. Charter continued even after the House and Senate passed funding for the war with Iraq in April 2003. The legal framework of the U.N. Charter was still relevant despite pronouncements of its demise. The FY2003 supplemental appropriations for the Iraq Conflict, Afghanistan, Global War on Terrorism, and Homeland Security are being discussed. The adequacy of the $62.6 billion provided may depend on the number of troops remaining in Iraq. The size of troop deployments needed for security and stability is debated, but the planned deployments are not publicly identified. DOD Comptroller Dov Zakheim suggested that the supplemental funding level for FY2004 looks adequate, but concerns exist about a too rapid drawdown. A supplemental next year is likely due to occupation costs not included in the FY2004 appropriation request. DOD may have a major role in Iraqi relief and reconstruction efforts, with $2.4 billion appropriated for these tasks in FY2003. Long-term costs of occupation and reconstruction will be debated in Congress. The conference version of H.R. 1559 provides $62.6 billion for the Department of Defense for the war in Iraq, presence in Afghanistan, security at military bases, postwar occupation costs, and equipment repair. Concerns were raised about the Defense Emergency Response Fund (DERF) where funds could be moved at DOD's discretion. The conference version of the bill distributes most of the funds, leaving $15.7 billion. The conference version of the bill allocates $15.7 billion to a new Iraq Freedom Fund for DOD's flexibility in spending, blending House and Senate approaches. This fund can be used in FY2003 or FY2004 for occupation costs if needed. The request for funds included various expenses related to war, deployment, equipment repair, and reserve mobilization. It also proposed controversial measures for military assistance to countries like Pakistan and Jordan, as well as funding for foreign military forces cooperating in the global war on terrorism. The Secretary of Defense would need the concurrence of the Secretary of State for aid to foreign military forces. Congressional oversight would be limited, with reporting of expenditures after the fact. The conference version requires 15-day advance notifications for $1.4 billion in support, eliminates $150 million for irregular forces, reduces funding for regular foreign military forces to counter terrorism training. The Administration requested $2.4 billion for an Iraqi Relief and Reconstruction Fund, with flexibility on spending and management agency. Controversy arose over the potential management of funds by DOD instead of USAID and the State Department. The State Department's foreign assistance program created controversy due to military control of civilian operations. The new Relief and Reconstruction Fund is under the president's control, allowing funds to be transferred to DOD. DOD may have a major role in managing these funds. The FY2003 supplemental included aid requests for 22 countries supporting the U.S. in Iraq or the global war on terrorism. The FY2003 supplemental aid request for countries supporting the U.S. in Iraq or the global war on terrorism totaled $4.7 billion, with major recipients including Jordan, Israel, Turkey, Afghanistan, Egypt, and Pakistan. The request addressed costs for the war, initial occupation, and equipment replenishment. The Administration's request did not specify assumptions about troop deployment in Iraq post-war. The FY2004 budget resolution included a $100 billion reserve fund for the war in Iraq, funded by reducing tax cuts. DOD Comptroller Dov Zakheim stated that the FY2003 supplemental request costs for Iraq and Afghanistan seem accurate. The estimated costs for Iraq, Afghanistan, and the global war on terrorism in FY2003 range from $55.4 billion to $65.0 billion, with a midpoint of $61.1 billion. This is close to the $62.6 billion provided by Congress in the supplemental. The Department of Defense estimates that the cost of Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism is about $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion per month. The estimated costs for Iraq, Afghanistan, and the global war on terrorism in FY2003 range from $55.4 billion to $65.0 billion, with a midpoint of $61.1 billion. The Department of Defense estimates that the cost of the global war on terrorism is about $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion per month, with additional funding allocated for military personnel and fuel costs. Estimates of the total cost of war and war-related costs for Iraq varied widely due to uncertainties about the war's course and post-war needs. Concerns were raised about the potential high costs for the United States, as allies were unlikely to contribute financially. The Administration hoped for contributions from other countries for postwar reconstruction, but Army officials were worried about the strain on U.S. forces if a large occupation force of 50,000-75,000 troops was needed for one to two years. Estimates for the total cost of war in Iraq varied widely, ranging from 50,000-75,000 troops needed for occupation to over 200,000 proposed by General Eric K. Shinseki. Concerns were raised about war costs impacting the deficit, with projections indicating war costs in FY2003 would not exceed $100 billion. This sparked debate on the FY2004 budget resolution. The estimated total cost of war in Iraq varied widely, with concerns about war costs impacting the deficit. The full costs could include aid to allies, post-war occupation costs, reconstruction costs, and humanitarian assistance. Direct war costs could range between $33 billion and $60 billion, while other costs could range between $35 billion and $69 billion in the first year. Estimates for the total cost of the war in Iraq in the first year ranged from $68 billion to $129 billion, with initial estimates by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld at $50 billion. The Office of Management and Budget had estimated costs of $50-60 billion, while a previous estimate by Larry Lindsey of $100 billion to $200 billion was dismissed. The Administration dismissed Larry Lindsey's estimate of $100 billion to $200 billion for the cost of the war in Iraq. The estimates for the first year cost of the war ranged from $68 billion to $129 billion, with different factors influencing the costs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) revised its estimates of the costs of a war in March 2003. A one-month war would cost $33 billion, a two-month war $41 billion. Adding the $19 billion cost of an occupation force of 100,000 to a one-month war would bring the estimate to about $51 billion. The House Budget Committee estimated a two-month war with 250,000 troops would cost $53 billion to $60 billion. The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA) also provided an estimate. The estimated costs of a two-month war range from $35 billion to $85 billion, with additional costs for aid to allies and post-war occupation. The FY2003 supplemental includes $12 billion for stabilization costs, but troop levels are unclear. The estimated costs of post-war occupation range from $25 billion to $105 billion over 5 years, depending on troop levels and contributions from Allies. General Eric Shinseki suggested several hundred thousand troops might be needed initially, but Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz disagreed, advocating for a smaller U.S. force. The post-war occupation cost in Iraq is estimated to be between $25 billion and $105 billion over 5 years, depending on the size of the occupation force. The initial peacekeeping forces could range from 150,000 troops declining to 10,000 by the third year. If the role is shared with the U.N. or other nations, costs to the U.S. would be lower. Reconstruction costs are estimated to be at least $30 billion in the first 3 years. Nobel prize-winning economist William D. Nordhaus suggests reconstruction could cost between $30 billion over 3 to 4 years. D. Nordhaus estimates that reconstruction in Iraq could cost between $30 billion over 3 to 4 years or $75 billion over 6 years. Observers suggest that oil revenues could cover the costs, but most of Iraq's oil revenues have been used for imports or domestic consumption. Additional revenues may not be available for some time. The cost of post-war humanitarian assistance for emergency food and medical supplies in Iraq is estimated at $2.5 billion in the first year and $10 billion over 4 years. Economic repercussions of the conflict include concerns over oil supply disruptions leading to a potential recession and increased costs for the U.S. economy. Oil prices have fluctuated during the war. The armed conflict in Iraq has raised concerns over the supply and price of crude oil in world markets. Iraq holds 112.5 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, second only to Saudi Arabia. Despite its large reserves, Iraq's pre-war oil production is below its potential. The Oil-for-Food Program (OFFP) was suspended, causing fluctuations in Iraq's oil exports. Fighting in southern Iraq, a major oil-exporting region, further impacted the oil market dynamics. Exports from Iraq's southern oil fields at Umm Qasr have halted due to fighting, while exports from the Kirkuk field in the north have also been affected. Tanker loadings at the port of Ceyhan have stopped, and storage facilities are full. The northern oil fields near Kirkuk have minimal damage. Prior to the conflict, Iraq was exporting 1.7 million barrels per day under the OFFP, with an additional 400,000 barrels supplied to neighboring countries outside the program. Iraq's oil exports have been disrupted due to the conflict, with exports from southern and northern fields affected. The country supplied an additional 400,000 barrels to neighboring countries outside the U.N.-run program. Despite the interruption, Iraq's oil supply played a significant role in global oil prices and supplier-consumer arrangements. Iraq, accounting for 10% of OPEC's average oil production, is not part of the cartel's quota program due to U.N. control over its exports. The U.N. aims to restart the Oil-for-Food Program, authorized until May 12, but the timeline for Iraqi exports resuming remains uncertain. Iraq's oil exports have been disrupted due to the conflict, affecting global oil prices. Recent supply difficulties in Venezuela and tribal violence in Nigeria have added to the international oil supply shortfall situation. War jitters about crude supply continue to fluctuate, with uncertainty surrounding when Iraqi exports might resume. War jitters about crude supply ebb and flow, with Iraq, Venezuela, and Nigeria facing export disruptions. Prices have fallen from March highs to the mid-to-upper $20s. OPEC members struggle to offset supply shortfalls, and any further disruptions could lead to a significant oil shortfall with a dramatic impact on prices. Oil markets are volatile, and prices can fluctuate depending on global events. The potential for Iraq to become a major oil producer under a future government could impact global oil supply and prices.
