    "title": "AB 1934",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The development of affordable housing is a statewide concern, not a municipal affair. Section 65915.7 of the Government Code applies to all cities, including charter cities. It grants a development bonus to commercial developers who contribute affordable housing through joint projects. The development bonus for commercial developers includes incentives such as increased intensity, floor area ratio, height requirements, reduced parking requirements, elevator accessibility, and exceptions to zoning ordinances. For partnered housing agreements, the commercial developer must contribute affordable housing in one of three ways: building units directly, donating land for affordable housing, or making a cash payment towards construction costs. The agreement must be approved by the city, county, or city and county. To qualify for a development bonus, a commercial developer must partner with a housing developer to provide a percentage of units for low-income or very low-income households. If affordable units are not constructed within agreed timelines, the local government can withhold certificates of occupancy for the commercial development. Additional allowances or incentives may be offered by local governments to developers. (i) Affordable housing developers can still seek density bonuses, concessions, waivers, or reductions under Section 65915.\n(j) Development bonuses cannot include waivers of fees for affordable housing.\n(k) Cities or counties must report commercial development bonuses to the Department of Housing and Community Development, including agreement terms and the number of affordable units built. For the purposes of this section, \"partner\" refers to a partnership, LLC, corporation, or other recognized entity where the commercial development applicant and affordable housing developer are involved. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2022, and then repealed. No reimbursement is required by this act as local agencies can levy charges to cover mandated services."
