    "content": "The \"Learn to Earn Act of 2011\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Congress acknowledges the importance of small businesses in job creation and economic growth, as highlighted in the 2010 Small Business Economy report. The World Economic Forum also recommends integrating entrepreneurship education into educational systems to foster innovation and economic development. \"Entrepreneurship education is crucial for developing human capital for the future. Skills like problem-solving, economic principles, and negotiation are essential in the competitive 21st-century global economy. Models include lessons in financial literacy, economics, marketing, and accounting, leading to improved proficiency in math and language arts.\" Entrepreneurship education equips individuals with tools to set and achieve high personal goals, apply knowledge and skills to real-world scenarios, and think and act like entrepreneurs. This prepares them for success in college and beyond. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, terms such as \"local educational agency\", \"highly qualified\", and \"secondary school\" are defined according to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. An \"entrepreneurship partner entity\" is an organization specializing in entrepreneurship that partners with a local educational agency designated as an entrepreneurship community. A \"high-quality entrepreneurship education program\" is a program that meets specific standards. A high-quality entrepreneurship education program teaches entrepreneurial skills through high standards in mathematics, curriculum delivered by trained teachers, hands-on activities like negotiation simulations, financial literacy, and interactions with entrepreneurs and small businesses. Interactions with entrepreneurs and small business owners inspire students to set high personal goals. Partnerships between educators and the business community members involve volunteering as guest speakers, teachers, mentors, and judges in business plan competitions. The Secretary of Education will designate local educational agencies as entrepreneurship communities if they meet the requirements of carrying out a high-quality entrepreneurship education program for secondary school students. An application process will be established for this designation, including details of the proposed program and partner entities. SEC. 5. Preferences for entrepreneurship communities: The Secretary of Education will prioritize local educational agencies designated as entrepreneurship communities in awarding grants under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n\nSEC. 6. Preferences for entrepreneurship partner entities: The Small Business Administration, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce, and Secretary of Energy will prioritize entrepreneurship partner entities in granting funds related to small business, workforce, community, and economic development."
