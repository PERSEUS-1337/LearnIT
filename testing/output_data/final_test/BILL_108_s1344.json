    "content": "The Money Wire Improvement and Remittance Enhancement Act of 2003, also known as the Money WIRE Act of 2003, amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to include a new section requiring disclosure of exchange rates in connection with international money transfers. The Money Wire Improvement and Remittance Enhancement Act of 2003, also known as the Money WIRE Act of 2003, defines terms related to international money transfers, money transmitting services, and money transmitting businesses. The Money Wire Improvement and Remittance Enhancement Act of 2003, also known as the Money WIRE Act of 2003, requires financial institutions and money transmitting businesses to disclose exchange rates for international money transfers initiated on behalf of consumers. The Money WIRE Act of 2003 mandates financial institutions and money transmitting businesses to disclose exchange rates, commissions, fees, and the exact amount of foreign currency to be received by the recipient before an international money transfer is completed. Prominent disclosure is required inside and outside the business where the transfer is initiated. The Money WIRE Act of 2003 requires financial institutions and money transmitting businesses to prominently display information on exchange rates, commissions, fees, and the amount of foreign currency to be received by the recipient at the location where an international money transfer is initiated. This disclosure must also be included on all forms and receipts used for such transfers. The Money WIRE Act of 2003 mandates that financial institutions and money transmitting businesses must include required disclosures in advertisements related to international money transfers, whether in print, broadcast, electronic media, or outdoor displays not on their premises. Additionally, disclosures must be provided in English and the language primarily used by the institution or its agents for advertising or solicitation. The Money WIRE Act of 2003 requires financial institutions and money transmitting businesses to include necessary disclosures in advertisements for international money transfers. The amendments made by this Act will take effect three months after its enactment. The Federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury will conduct a study on fees and fee disclosures for money wire transmissions. The study will compare disclosures provided by depository institutions with those provided by money transmitting businesses. A report on the study must be submitted to Congress within one year. Additionally, there will be an amendment to the Federal Credit Union Act. The Federal Credit Union Act is amended to allow credit unions to sell negotiable checks, money orders, and other money transfer instruments, as well as cash checks and money orders for a fee to members."
