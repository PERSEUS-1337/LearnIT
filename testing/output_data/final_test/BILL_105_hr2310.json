    "content": "Section 1 amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude gain from the sale of a principal residence. The Internal Revenue Code excludes gain from the sale of a principal residence if owned and used by the taxpayer for at least 3 years within a 5-year period. Special rules apply for property held jointly by spouses. Special rules apply for property held jointly by spouses or by an unmarried individual whose deceased spouse met the holding and use requirements within a 5-year period. Additionally, special considerations apply for tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations. For tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations, holding and use requirements apply to the stock and the house or apartment occupied. Involuntary conversions are treated as property sales. Property used partially as a principal residence has specific rules within a 5-year period. For property partially used as a principal residence within a 5-year period, the gain from the sale or exchange is determined based on the portion used by the taxpayer. Marital status is determined at the time of sale or exchange, including legal separation under a divorce decree. The sale or exchange of property under a divorce decree does not consider the spouse as married. Involuntary conversions are subject to specific rules regarding the amount realized and basis of property acquired after conversion. Holding and use of converted property is treated as holding and use of the property sold or exchanged. During periods of out-of-residence care, a taxpayer who becomes physically or mentally incapable of self-care and uses their property as a principal residence for at least 1 year within a 5-year period will be considered as using the property as their principal residence. This applies even when the taxpayer resides in a licensed facility such as a nursing home. The taxpayer can elect to have a section not apply to a sale or exchange. Section 1034 regarding gain on the sale of a principal residence is repealed. Various provisions in the Internal Revenue Code are amended to replace references to section 1034 with section 121. The text chunk discusses amendments to various sections of the Internal Revenue Code, including defining \"extended active duty\" and making changes related to gain recognition on the sale of a principal residence.

Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code involve changes to sections 1250(d), 6012, 6212(c), and 6504.
