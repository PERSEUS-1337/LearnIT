    "content": "The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) of 1986 guides the creation and siting of memorials and monuments in the District of Columbia on NPS or GSA land. It aims to preserve the design of the L'Enfant and McMillan plans, ensure public use of open space, protect limited open space, and appropriately design future commemorative works. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) guides the creation of memorials in DC without federal funds. Congress considers issues of interpretation, enforcement, and precedent. The report addresses proposed exemptions from the CWA, including memorial siting, American materials use, deadline alterations, and new museum siting. The report discusses exemptions from the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) for memorial siting, American materials use, deadline alterations, and new museum siting. The National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission (NCMAC) provides advice on establishing monuments and memorials. Since the CWA's enactment, 33 commemorative works have been authorized, with numerous others proposed. Several sponsor groups have sought exemptions from certain provisions of the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) for monument siting, building material origin, and completion deadlines. The National Museum of African American History and Culture was granted an exemption from the CWA. The CWA has been amended three times to extend completion time, make technical corrections, limit monument placement on the National Mall, and designate specific areas in the District of Columbia. The Commemorative Works Act designates three areas in the District of Columbia for monument construction, including the National Mall. Area I is reserved for significant historical works, bounded by various landmarks in the city. The Commemorative Works Act designates three areas in the District of Columbia for monument construction. Area I is reserved for significant historical works, while Area II is for subjects of lasting historical significance to the American people. The Reserve area is considered a completed work of civic art, where new commemorative works and museums are prohibited. The CWA was amended during the 113th Congress to allow donor recognition within ancillary structures associated with the commemorative work. The Commemorative Works Act allows donor acknowledgment for commemorative works dedicated after January 1, 2010, to be paid for by the sponsor and subject to approval. The acknowledgment must be displayed for up to 10 years, follow specific guidelines, and not be affixed to any landscape feature or museum object. Legislation must authorize sponsor groups to raise funds for commemorative works. The Commemorative Works Act prohibits siting new monuments around the National Mall and considers existing monuments as completed. It also protects open space, public use, and cultural resources. The Commemorative Works Act prohibits new monuments around the National Mall and considers existing monuments as completed. Despite this, sponsor groups still request exemptions. The CWA created a two-step approach for site selection, involving various agencies. If a monument is deemed of significant historical importance, it may be placed in Area I with approval from the Secretary of the Interior or Administrator of General Services. The Administrator notifies NCMAC, House Committee on Natural Resources, and Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources when an Area I site is warranted. An act of Congress is needed within 150 days to place a memorial in Area I. If not recommended or acted upon, the memorial can be placed in Area II. Some legislation allows for direct site designation, bypassing the usual process. For example, H.R. 222 (113th Congress) proposed a World War I Memorial in D.C. The bill authorizes the placement of new elements at existing commemorative works sites in the District of Columbia, exempting them from certain restrictions. Congress has authorized four new elements to be added at existing monuments and memorials since the 106th Congress. Congress has authorized the addition of four new elements at existing monuments and memorials in the District of Columbia, including plaques honoring veterans of the Vietnam War, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech, Senator Robert J. Dole's leadership in creating the World War II Memorial, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's D-Day Prayer. Legislation in previous Congresses aimed to add supplementary elements to existing commemorative works, such as renaming the District of Columbia War Memorial as the \"National and District World War I Memorial.\" The legislation authorizing commemorative works typically does not specify locations or allow for additional elements to be added to existing monuments. Site selection is usually determined by the sponsor group in consultation with various organizations, followed by approval from Congress if necessary. The Commemorative Works Act requires new monuments to avoid interfering with existing works, requiring exemptions from Congress to add elements to existing memorials. Congress has authorized new elements to existing monuments and memorials, and additional legislation has been introduced to further that practice. Options for Congress to be more involved in site selection or adding new elements include amending the Commemorative Works Act, granting exemptions, or retaining the existing process. If Congress desires more involvement, the CWA could be amended to require an act of Congress for all commemorative works or to remove the prohibition against adding elements. The Commemorative Works Act could be amended to involve Congress in the approval of all monument and memorial sites, not just those in Area I. This could include requiring congressional action for siting in Area II and providing more specific information about the location of future monuments and memorials. The Commemorative Works Act could be amended to involve Congress in approving monument and memorial sites, providing more specific location details. This change could allow for additional elements to be added to existing commemorative works, altering the nature of commemoration in the District of Columbia. The Commemorative Works Act could be amended to involve Congress in approving monument and memorial sites, providing more specific location details. Potential additions to existing works may alter the nature of commemoration in the District of Columbia. Congress may consider limitations on design for new elements to complement the original work. The Commemorative Works Act could be amended to involve Congress in approving monument and memorial sites, providing more specific location details. Individual exemptions to the siting clause would allow Congress to be involved in siting a monument or memorial when necessary. Granting exemptions on a case-by-case basis for additions to existing commemorative works would continue past practice of congressional review. Creating individual exemptions to 40 U.S.C. \u00a78905(b)(2) could undermine the planning processes for monuments and memorials, compromising their original design approved by the NCPC and CFA. Instead of amending the CWA or providing exemptions, Congress could consider halting new monuments in Area I and denying requests for additional elements on existing commemorative works. The federal planning agencies can guide sponsor groups through the site selection process for monuments and memorials in Area I. NCPC and CFA can provide a holistic view of placement. Maintaining the status quo may not prevent individual groups from requesting exemptions for specific sites. Consider prohibiting monument or memorial legislation with specific site locations. Congress could choose to prohibit additions to existing commemorative works instead of providing individual exemptions. A new element added to a completed monument or memorial may be seen as a new commemorative work. The House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs in 1986 discussed prohibiting new commemorative works from encroaching on open space or other monuments. Considerations for site alternatives should include conflicts with other activities, visual impact on adjacent works, and effects on parking, transportation, and open space. The committee reiterated that new commemorative works should not interfere with existing ones or encroach on open space. Prohibiting additions to existing works may not deter groups from proposing them in restricted areas. If additions are prohibited, new proposals would be treated as separate works, potentially causing confusion and detracting from existing memorials. Multiple monuments or memorials on the same topic could be authorized, leading to duplication. Duplicative monuments or memorials may detract from existing commemorative works in the District of Columbia. Congress authorizes sponsor groups to work with NCPC, CFA, and either the Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of the GSA to choose a site and receive design approval for the memorial. Criteria evaluated include surroundings, location, material, and landscape features, with a focus on durability for outdoor environments. Recent proposals suggest using materials mined or produced in the United States for all memorials. The proposal suggests using materials mined or produced in the United States for all memorials in the District of Columbia. Congress could mandate the use of American materials for commemorative works through various options. Mandating the use of American materials in the construction of national memorials in Washington, DC could provide economic and symbolic benefits. However, it may not be suitable for all commemorative works, especially those sponsored by foreign governments or inspired by non-American materials. Mandating the use of American materials for national memorials in Washington, DC could have economic and symbolic benefits. However, it may not be suitable for all commemorative works, especially those sponsored by foreign governments or inspired by non-American materials. Design elements for memorials may need to be reviewed by NCPC and CFA, and using American materials could have cost implications. Matching materials to existing memorials, regardless of origin, may be necessary, and exemptions to the American-made requirement could be requested. If Congress chooses not to amend the CWA, the decision would remain with federal planning bodies. In 1986, the CWA gave sponsor groups five years to complete a memorial or receive a construction permit. Only one out of eight authorized memorials met the deadline by 1991. P.L. 102-216 extended the expiration period to seven years for legislative authority on construction of commemorative works in DC. Several recent memorials have faced issues with their authorizations lapsing or being granted statutory extensions. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced H.R. 2297 (113 th Congress) to amend 40 U.S.C. \u00a78903, allowing recommendations to Congress by the Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of GSA to terminate a sponsor group's authorization for a commemorative work. The Secretary or the Administrator may recommend terminating the legislative authority for a commemorative work if the sponsor lacks the capacity to complete it before the expiration date. H.R. 2297 was introduced but did not progress in Congress. This raises questions about completing memorials within seven years and the impact of termination recommendations on congressional decisions. The Secretary or the Administrator may recommend terminating a memorial's authorization if it fails to meet completion requirements within seven years. This could prevent the need for multiple extensions, as seen with the John Adams Memorial. Congress has granted several extensions for this memorial since its initial authorization in 2001. If a memorial is not progressing, termination recommendations could save legislative time. Providing explicit power to recommend the termination of a memorial's authorization could prevent the need for multiple extensions, as seen with the John Adams Memorial. Some memorials may take longer to complete due to site selection, fundraising, and approval processes. If the Secretary or Administrator determines that a sponsor group lacks the capacity to complete the project, Congress may face pressure to either extend the authorization or terminate the project. This recommendation could also serve as a warning to the sponsor group if the project is not on track. In 1846, Congress accepted James Smithson's gift to create the Smithsonian Institution, which has since expanded to include 17 museums in the District of Columbia. Recent legislation has been introduced for new Smithsonian museums, such as the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The CWA applies only to land administered by the NPS or GSA in DC, so museums on other land are not subject to it. The CWA does not apply to museums on non-NPS or -GSA administered land in DC. Museums are not included in the CWA's definition of commemorative works. The CWA prohibits museums in Area I or East Potomac Park. Congress exempted the National Museum of African American History and Culture from the CWA prohibition against creating museums on NPS- or GSA-administered land. This exemption raises questions about whether the CWA applies to museums in any District location. Standardizing the process for creating museums in DC by applying the CWA could streamline the museum-creation process and codify congressional intent. Standardizing the process for creating museums in DC by applying the CWA could streamline the museum-creation process, set guidelines for museum placement, and clarify the role of third-party organizations. This could potentially burden the commemorative works process and require evaluation of authorized museums similar to monuments and memorials. The current guidance lacks direction on museums and interior spaces, but the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center could serve as a precedent for evaluating museum spaces. The report suggests that the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center could set a precedent for evaluating museum spaces under the Commemorative Works Act. Congress faces choices on how to commemorate events and individuals, with proposed exemptions including siting commemorative works, use of American materials, deadlines for completion, and museums. Congressional options include providing exemptions for individual monuments, amending the CWA for all new works, or continuing the current process. Congress has various options for proposed exemptions under the Commemorative Works Act, such as granting a one-time exemption or amending the CWA for future monuments. They could also choose to be more involved in the commemorative works process or delegate authority to relevant organizations."
