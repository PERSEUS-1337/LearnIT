    "content": "Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training (TAACCCT) grants are competitive grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) to support career training programs targeting workers affected by international trade. The program is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) and was created as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-152) provided four years of annual mandatory funding through FY2014 for TAACCCT grants. The program aims to develop, offer, or improve educational or career training programs for TAAW-eligible workers. The most recent SGA issued in April 2014 clarifies program elements and applicant requirements, focusing on increasing employment-related credentials and implementing innovative training curricula. The TAACCCT grants aim to improve employment outcomes by developing innovative training curricula and offering programs for TAAW-eligible workers. Grantees must partner with local stakeholders, and all intellectual property created under the grants is openly licensed for free use. Eligible institutions include public, private not-for-profit, and private for-profit institutions that offer programs that can be completed in no more than two years. Private for-profit institutions can apply for TAACCCT grants as part of a consortium with other local stakeholders. The lead institution in the consortium will have fiscal and administrative responsibility over the grant. Institutions in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories are eligible to apply for TAACCCT grants. U.S. territories other than Puerto Rico may face challenges in the application process due to the limited eligibility of TAAW workers in those regions. The SGA intends to award $150 million to single-institution applicants and $300 million to consortium applicants from the $450 million available for grants in FY2014. At least 0.5% of total funds (approximately $2.25 million) must be allocated to institutions in each state. TAACCCT funds can be used for developing, improving, and expanding education and career training programs, including personnel and non-personnel costs. Grant funds can also be used to hire and train staff for new curricula or program components. Grant funds can be used for developing, improving, and expanding education and career training programs. Non-personnel costs include purchasing supplies or technological investments. Capital expenditures may be allowable with DOL approval. Non-allowable activities include payments to training participants. TAACCCT funds must supplement existing sources. Grants have a 48-month period, with programs developed in the first 36 months and outcome data reported in the final 12 months. Basic requirements for grant proposals are established by statute, with DOL guidelines for submission. The law specifies that DOL will provide guidelines for grant proposals, issued through SGAs, detailing project descriptions, meeting TAAW-certified workers' needs, previous training experience, community outreach, and employer engagement. DOL will consider proposal merits for developing training programs when awarding grants. The recent SGA outlines six core elements for TAACCCT projects, with 55% of the evaluation criteria focused on the project's approach. One key element is evidence-based design, where proposed programs must show improvements in educational and employment outcomes. Applicants must provide evidence of effectiveness for existing strategies or cite preliminary research for new strategies. Applicants for TAACCCT projects must develop a curriculum with a clear sequence of coursework focused on industry sectors, offer advanced online and technology-enabled learning, and provide evidence of effectiveness for existing or new strategies. The SGA also expressed interest in technology that will customize content to the student's prior knowledge or expand upon technology developed in prior TAACCCT projects. Strategic alignment with the workforce system and other stakeholders is required, including partnering with local Workforce Investment Boards and demonstrating alignment with the state's Economic Development and Workforce Investment Act-Wagner Peyser integrated workforce plans. Coordination with private sector and philanthropic entities is encouraged. Applicant institutions must also engage in sector strategies and employer partnerships. Applicant institutions must partner with employers and industry representatives for each targeted industry, supporting curriculum development and work-based training. Alignment with previous TAACCCT projects is required to avoid duplication and strengthen project reach. DOL reports annually on grant impact. The TAACCCT grant recipients must adhere to reporting requirements, including quarterly financial, progress, and annual performance reports. Single institution grantees submit data directly to DOL, while consortiums submit reports to the lead institution for compilation. Each application must include a budget and evaluation plan. Grantees participate in impact and implementation analysis, as well as a national evaluation. TAACCCT grant recipients must adhere to reporting requirements, including financial, progress, and performance reports. Grantees participate in impact and implementation analysis, as well as a national evaluation conducted by a contractor on behalf of DOL. The program was created by the Trade Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act of 2009 and received funding through the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 provided $500 million in funding for TAACCCT over four years. Funding levels were reduced in FY2013 and FY2014 due to sequestration. The first and second SGAs for TAACCCT funding were issued in 2011 and 2012 respectively, with grantees announced in September of each year. The third and final round of TAACCCT grants under the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 was issued in April 2014 and closed on July 7, 2014. The grants were announced on September 18, 2013, with 23 awards to individual institutions and 20 awards to consortia. 14 states and territories that were not awarded funds were contacted to develop qualifying projects for a grant of approximately $2.5 million."
