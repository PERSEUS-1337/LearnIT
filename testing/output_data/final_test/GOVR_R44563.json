    "content": "Increased terrorist activity by groups like Boko Haram in Nigeria has raised the international profile of African-based Islamist terrorist groups. In the 19th century, local insurgent leaders fought to establish Islamic states in areas that are now in Nigeria, Guinea/Mali, and Sudan. Algeria fought a decade-long war against Islamist insurgents in the 1990s, resulting in as many as 200,000 deaths. Sudan hosted foreign extremists, including Osama bin Laden, in the 1990s. Al Qaeda's bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 demonstrated the group's reach in recruiting from Muslim communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. Extremist groups in Algeria and Somalia later affiliated with Al Qaeda. Religiously inspired terrorism in Africa is diverse, with groups like Al Qaeda in Algeria and Somalia, and the Lord's Resistance Army in Central Africa. Foreign fighter flows from North Africa to conflict zones like Afghanistan, the Balkans, Iraq, Syria, and Libya have been a concern. While most fighters come from the Maghreb, smaller numbers come from countries like Somalia, Sudan, and Kenya. Foreign fighter flows to Somalia, including from Western countries, have decreased since 2012 but remain a security challenge. Terrorist incidents in Africa have intensified in recent years, with attacks ranging from bombings to kidnappings. Foreign governments are concerned about the security of their citizens in Africa, especially with the rise of assaults on soft targets like the Westgate Mall in Kenya. Suicide bombings, particularly by groups like Boko Haram, are becoming more common. U.S. citizens have also been victims of these attacks. In recent years, terrorist incidents in Africa have intensified, with attacks ranging from bombings to kidnappings. Foreign governments are concerned about the security of their citizens in Africa, especially with the rise of assaults on soft targets like the Westgate Mall in Kenya. Suicide bombings, notably by Boko Haram, are becoming more common, with women and children frequently used as attackers. A Somali-American man was the first known American suicide bomber in 2008 for Al Shabaab in Somalia. Al Shabaab demonstrated its ability to conceal a bomb in a laptop computer that was detonated by a suicide bomber onboard a Somali airliner in February 2016. U.S. officials warn of growing fragmentation within the terrorism landscape, with an increasingly diverse array of groups in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. In Africa, diverse extremist groups have emerged, some affiliating with Al Qaeda or ISIS. Transnational groups view Africa as an opportunity for expansion, with some targeting Western interests. Despite focusing on local concerns, some African groups have attacked the West. In Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a growing concern about violent Islamist extremism, with groups like Al Shabaab posing a potential threat to Western interests. Despite a regional focus, these groups have the capability to inspire or carry out attacks globally. The region has seen a rise in political violence in recent years, following a period of relative stability after the Cold War. This report aims to provide context on terrorism trends in Sub-Saharan Africa and highlight key issues for Congress to consider. In recent years, political violence has been on the rise in Africa, with violent Islamist extremist groups being among the most deadly perpetrators. Eleven groups based on the continent are designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the State Department, with some affiliating with the Islamic State or Al Qaeda. The Islamic State's tactics may have influenced rival groups to conduct high-profile attacks in West Africa. The Global Terrorism Index 2015 shows that violence by non-state actors in West Africa is increasing and becoming more deadly. Nigeria's Boko Haram was the deadliest terrorist group for civilians in 2014, surpassing the Islamic State. Together, they were responsible for half of global deaths from terrorist acts in 2014. Somalia also saw a significant increase in attacks since 2011, with Al Shabaab being one of the deadliest terrorist groups. The rise in Islamist extremist violence in Africa coincides with an increase in overall conflict fatalities since 2011. 2014 was the deadliest year for violence in Africa since 1999, driving mass displacement of almost 17 million people. Conflict-related fatalities are surging in countries plagued by civil war, such as Sudan and South Sudan. Political protests in Africa occasionally turn violent. Political protests in Africa can turn violent, with repressive responses from state security forces. Intercommunal conflicts over resources and political representation are prevalent in the Sahel region, particularly in Nigeria, Sudan, Mali, and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Despite economic progress, African countries dominate the Fragile States Index, with the most fragile states being Somalia, South Sudan, Central African Republic, and Sudan. Over half of African countries have seen worsening state fragility indicators in the past decade. The Global Peace Index ranks South Sudan, Somalia, Central African Republic, Sudan, and Libya among the top 10 least peaceful countries. Religious extremism overlaps with political violence in some African countries. DNI Clapper explains that terrorists may become involved in insurgencies through various means, such as working with local militants or instigating violence themselves. Groups like ISIL and al-Qa'ida have incited insurgencies, while others like Boko Haram pose a primary threat to homeland security. Al-Shabaab benefits from insurgencies started by others, and core al-Qa'ida exploits safe havens in areas controlled by insurgent groups. Al Qaeda and other extremist groups have utilized safe havens in East Africa to build alliances and capabilities without taking on a primary leadership role in local conflicts. Al Shabaab, a predominantly Sunni Muslim group in Somalia, emerged in the early 2000s and drew support across clans with a vision of creating an Islamic caliphate in the region. Some of its founding members trained with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, and the group held significant territory in south-central Somalia. Al Shabaab, a Sunni Muslim group in Somalia, held significant territory in south-central Somalia in the late 2000s. A U.S.-backed African Union military force gained momentum against the insurgency in 2011-2012. Al Shabaab continues to wage a violent campaign against the Somali government, the AU mission, and international targets in Somalia. They have also threatened countries participating in the AU Mission in Somalia and conducted deadly attacks in Djibouti, Kenya, and Uganda. Al Shabaab's activity in Kenya has increased significantly in recent years, with hundreds of Kenyans killed in attacks since 2012. Al Shabaab has killed hundreds of Kenyans in attacks since 2012. The group's ties with terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and its threats against international targets have made it a target of direct counterterrorism operations by the United States and other Western countries. The U.S. has increased air strikes in Somalia to combat the group, citing threats to U.S. interests in the region. The increase in armed Islamist groups in North and West Africa since 2011 has led to security crises in Libya, Mali, and Nigeria. Some groups target U.S. and foreign interests in the region, while others have international aspirations. AQIM, a transnational Islamist terrorist group, has ties to Al Qaeda and operates in the Sahel region. North Africa also serves as a source of foreign fighters for Al Qaeda-linked groups and the Islamic State in Iraq, Syria, and Libya. The Sahel region has seen the rise of extremist groups like Al Qaeda in recent years, leading to offshoots and splinter movements. The countries in the Sahel face security challenges due to ethnic conflict, separatism, and organized crime, exacerbated by poor governance. While most residents do not embrace violent Islamist ideology, marginalized populations may be influenced by groups like AQIM due to financial resources. Libya has become a hub for regional terrorist actors, and Tunisia has also faced security threats. Reports indicate that Libya is a hub for regional terrorist actors, with Tunisia experiencing large-scale attacks by individuals trained there. Algeria and Morocco have stable political institutions but have dismantled terrorist cells. Libya and Algeria have groups pledging allegiance to the Islamic State. Northeast Nigeria has Boko Haram, responsible for high levels of violence due to intercommunal tensions, disparities in development, and frustration with corruption. Boko Haram's rise in northeast Nigeria and northern Cameroon is fueled by popular frustration with elite corruption and state abuses. The group exploits tensions exacerbated by the shrinking Lake Chad and rejects Western influence, democracy, and moderate forms of Islam. Boko Haram's expansion beyond Nigeria's borders is facilitated by safe havens in Lake Chad, Sambisa Forest, and Mandara Mountains. The group recruits members from neighboring countries and faces challenges due to corruption, lack of coordination in Nigerian security agencies, and slow judicial processes. Boko Haram has expanded beyond Nigeria's borders, drawing members from neighboring countries. The group has operated in northern Cameroon since 2013 and launched cross-border attacks into Chad and Niger in 2015. The election of Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 helped ease tensions among affected countries. Donors support an integrated regional force to counter the group, but challenges remain due to mutual distrust, lack of military interoperability, and a focus on military rather than civilian governance initiatives. The presence of IS supporters in Libya is a growing concern for regional and international security. IS supporters in Libya have become a significant concern for regional and international security officials. The conflict in Syria has attracted thousands of young Libyans since 2012, with some linking the rise of IS-affiliated groups in Libya to the return of these fighters in 2014. U.S. military officials estimated around 3,500 IS fighters in Libya in late 2015, but by mid-2016, this number had grown to 5,000 to 8,000. Reports indicate that Sub-Saharan Africans are among IS-Libya's fighters, drawn by financial incentives or ideological motives. CIA Director John Brennan highlighted Libya as a crucial theater for ISIL outside of Syria-Iraq. Intelligence indicates that Libya is a significant theater for ISIL, with several thousand members and absorbed groups like Ansar al Sharia. Military operations by Libyan forces have pushed back ISIL's gains. Political disputes and hostility to foreign intervention limit options for the US and other outsiders. Radicalization paths in African Muslim communities vary, influenced by socioeconomic factors, state bias, security responses, recruitment efforts, and individual characteristics. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has identified factors affecting conflict and violent extremism, including structural \"push\" and \"pull\" factors, along with environmental factors like weak governance. Studies emphasize the importance of individual messaging, social networks, and person-to-person contacts in radicalization. Conflict is driven by key actors mobilizing resources based on grievances, such as exclusion from political and economic life. Illegitimate institutions can lead to fragility and stress. The State Department's top Africa official testified before Congress about violent extremist groups targeting areas with economic, political, and social alienation, poor governance, and corruption. More inclusive and accountable governance is needed to counter extremist recruitment. Poverty alone does not explain recruitment or group strength; individual decision-making and ideology play a significant role. Extremist groups exploit weaknesses to spread their propaganda. Extremist groups exploit economic hardship and societal discrimination to recruit members. They manipulate perceptions of victimization and disparities in access to jobs and government investments. Feelings of marginalization, deprivation, and lack of job opportunities in African countries make youth susceptible to extremist recruitment. Extremist groups thrive in impoverished countries with weak state control, where lack of services and corruption create grievances for recruitment. Somalia and Mali are examples where state failure has allowed extremists to flourish, deepening isolation and violence. Corruption and impunity across Africa fuel the growth of extremist groups. Extremist groups like Al Shabaab gain support in Africa by providing social services and justice, exploiting grievances of corruption and impunity. The perception of the West attacking Islam drives some towards extremism, with Al Qaeda and Islamic State capitalizing on this narrative. Muslims in East Africa view counterterrorism efforts as Western intervention. Some East African Muslims view domestic counterterrorism efforts as part of a Western conspiracy against Muslims. AQIM and Al Murabitoun in North and West Africa focus on anti-French messaging, appealing to post-colonial sensitivities. Political factors like repression, human rights violations, and government corruption may fuel grievances that lead to support for violence. Abuses by Nigerian security forces in the northeast could contribute to recruitment and radicalization. In the northeast, forces may have driven recruitment and acceptance of Boko Haram. Al Shabaab incites insurgency among Kenyan Muslims due to historic grievances and anti-terrorism abuses. Kenyan government's counterterrorism strategy led many to join Al Shabaab. Violent extremist groups provoke government responses to gain support. The U.S. may be seen as enabling government actions, complicating its relationship with local communities. African countries have established multinational mechanisms to address regional extremist threats, including AMISOM, RCI-LRA, military interventions in Mali and Algeria, MNJTF to counter Boko Haram, and efforts to create joint military forces in West Africa. Eleven countries participate in the AU-backed Nouakchott Process on Security Cooperation. The AU's African Center for the Study and Research on Terrorism (ACSRT) in Algiers coordinates information on terrorist activity and supports African counterterrorism strategies in the Sahelo-Saharan region. African-led responses to terrorist threats face challenges such as limited resources, institutional weaknesses, conflicting political agendas, corruption, and regional rivalries. The African Union faces challenges in implementing anti-terrorism efforts, with key countries like Kenya, Nigeria, and Somalia yet to ratify protocols. Limited engagement and resources hinder continental initiatives, including the 2014 Protocol on Prevention and Combating of Terrorism. Only nine countries have signed the 2014 Convention on Cross Border Cooperation, with Niger being the sole ratifier. The AU has also developed a Model Anti-Terrorism Law to guide domestic legislation in line with AU policy. Various donor initiatives, including the European Union's African Peace Facility (APF), aim to address African resource and capacity constraints in counterterrorism efforts. The EU has provided over \u20ac2 billion for initiatives since 2004, supporting AMISOM, regional security responses in Mali and against the LRA, and military and police training missions in Mali, Niger, and Somalia. The United Kingdom also contributes to these efforts. Various countries, including the UK, France, the US, Turkey, Morocco, and Algeria, provide training and equipment bilaterally to African partners for counterterrorism efforts. Examples include the UK deploying military personnel to Nigeria to counter Boko Haram, Turkey planning a military training center in Somalia, and France transitioning to Operation Barkhane in the Sahel region. The African Union, United Nations, and various donors are also involved in these efforts. The African Union, United Nations, and donors are discussing ways to enhance sustainability of African-led peace support operations, including counterterrorism. AU Member States aim to cover 25% of peace and security budget by 2020. The United States is involved in military and civilian efforts to prevent terrorism in Africa. The Obama Administration's National Security Strategy highlights the threat of violent extremists in Africa and aims to disrupt and defeat Al-Qa'ida and its affiliates in the region by strengthening civilian bodies and building African military capacities. This is part of the broader goal of advancing peace and security in Africa. The Obama Administration's counterterrorism strategy in Africa focuses on building partner capacity to deny terrorists safe havens and recruitment opportunities. Efforts include the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP) and the Partnership for Regional East Africa Counterterrorism (PREACT), which involve military and police training, border security initiatives, justice sector support, and public diplomacy. The State Department's Africa Bureau leads the counterterrorism efforts in Africa, with USAID and the Department of Defense (DOD) playing a role in strategic guidance. PREACT, a smaller initiative modeled on TSCTP, focuses on counterterrorism assistance in East Africa through bilateral programs and regional cooperation. DOD conducts regional operations to improve intelligence, coordination, logistics, and targeting. Other U.S. security initiatives like the Regional Strategic Initiative (RSI) complement these efforts in the Lake Chad Basin. The United States provides significant security assistance to Africa to counter terrorism, with a focus on supporting African forces fighting groups like Al Shabaab in Somalia and Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin. Funding for these efforts has totaled billions of dollars, primarily through programs like AMISOM and the Peacekeeping Operations account. Training and support for African law enforcement entities are also provided to enhance counterterrorism capabilities. The United States provides significant security assistance to Africa to counter terrorism, primarily through programs like AMISOM and the Peacekeeping Operations account. Training and support for African law enforcement entities are provided to enhance counterterrorism capabilities, funded under various accounts including NADR and INCLE. Some African partners have also sought assistance through the Foreign Military Sales program and received U.S. excess defense articles. DOD funding for security assistance in Africa surpassed that provided by the State Department in FY2014 and has continued to rise. In the past decade, DOD has notified Congress of over $1.7 billion in planned counterterrorism training and equipment for African countries, with Kenya, Uganda, Niger, and Tunisia being the top recipients. The Administration's Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF) is contributing to AFRICOM's capacity-building programs, with almost $80 million allocated in FY2015 for efforts in the Sahel-Maghreb, Lake Chad Basin, and East Africa regions. Planned CTPF funding for Africa in FY2016 is $375 million, with a requested $450 million for FY2017. The Administration has requested $450 million for FY2017 for DOD counterterrorism funds likely to be allocated to African countries. Implementing State Department and DOD \"partner capacity-building\" programs in Africa faces challenges due to host-government preferences and postcolonial sensitivities. Extremist groups operate in areas with ineffective host-government counterparts, and political elites in some countries prioritize other security threats over violent Islamism. The House Armed Services Committee has expressed concern with African countries' ability to manage equipment provided through train-and-equip programs. DOD is urged to invest in building partner forces' institutional capacity, which could complement the Administration's Security Governance Initiative. The six SGI partner countries face varying degrees of terrorism threats. The Administration's African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership aims to build rapid response capabilities. The new African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership (APRRP) aims to enhance the contributions of top African counterterrorism partners like Uganda and Ethiopia to stability operations in Somalia or elsewhere. U.S. Africa Command's Theater Campaign Plan for FY2016-FY2020 focuses on neutralizing Al Shabaab, degrading violent extremist organizations in the Sahel-Maghreb, containing Boko Haram, interdicting illicit activity in the Gulf of Guinea and Central Africa, and building African peacekeeping capacities. The U.S. Africa Command's approach emphasizes counterterrorism cooperation with African partners and international allies, as well as direct military action against terrorist threats in Somalia and Libya. The Administration broadened its justification for military action in Somalia in 2015. The United States supports Somali, AMISOM, and U.S. forces in Somalia against Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab. U.S. military advisors provide training, equipment, and intelligence support to African partners in the region, including French military operations in the Sahel. Operation Enduring Freedom-Trans-Sahara focuses on building partner capacity to counter terrorist threats in Africa. Operation Enduring Freedom-Trans-Sahara (OEF-TS) supports TSCTP with a focus on overall security and cooperation in the region. Operation Enduring Freedom-Horn of Africa (OEF-HOA) has a different scope, supporting activities in Djibouti, Special Operations Command operations, and ISR operations in East Africa. Other ongoing operations include deployments to Niger and Cameroon for ISR operations. The Department of Defense (DOD) has provided support to African forces in Cameroon and Niger for ISR operations in the Lake Chad Basin region. DOD also supports African forces, including irregular groups, in counterterrorism operations with funding up to $85 million globally. Some U.S. development aid programs in Africa focus on counter-extremism to prevent radicalization and undermine extremist ideologies. Counter-extremism programs aim to prevent radicalization and undermine extremist ideologies by raising awareness, promoting community-led interventions, and addressing specific drivers of violent extremism. These programs should be tailored to country and community-specific contexts, with a focus on creating opportunities for at-risk youth and promoting political and economic inclusion for minorities and marginalized groups. Counter-extremism programs in Africa focus on political and economic inclusion, spreading tolerant religious interpretations, and geographic-specific initiatives. USAID and the State Department emphasize community involvement and African government participation in countering violent extremism efforts. CVE summits have been hosted in Kenya and Mauritania, with support for strengthening African law enforcement capacity. USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives oversees CVE programs funded through TSCTP and PREACT. The USAID and State Department fund CVE programs in Africa, with a focus on Nigeria. The White House allocated $40 million for CVE in East Africa in 2015. The FY2017 budget includes over $43 million for CVE efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa, with a quarter dedicated to Nigeria. Additionally, Africa may benefit from the $75 million in global CVE funds requested by the State Department. U.S. public diplomacy initiatives aim to counter extremist narratives and undermine terrorist groups' credibility among local populations. Efforts to counter terrorist narratives include targeting key influencers and vulnerable populations. Voice of America's services provide news programming and discussions with Muslim scholars. The Obama Administration established the Global Engagement Center to coordinate U.S. government communications against terrorist messaging. The Treasury Department leads efforts to detect and prosecute individuals involved in terrorism. The Treasury Department leads U.S. efforts to detect and prosecute those involved in terrorist financing, coordinating with international partners in Africa. State Department coordinates assistance to strengthen foreign partners' ability to combat terrorist financing through the CTF program. Financial intelligence units have been established across Africa with support from the CTF program. Resident Legal Advisors at U.S. embassies in Africa provide training and technical expertise to countries in the region. The State Department aims to increase capacity-building for law enforcement and criminal justice institutions in Africa through FY2016 CTPF funding. The U.S. government maintains watch lists like the Terrorist Screening Database and the No Fly List to restrict terrorist mobility. Assistance is provided to improve foreign governments' watch listing capabilities through the Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP), which includes providing countries with the PISCES computer system for identifying and apprehending suspects after a terrorist attack. The PISCES system, used for immigration processing and exchanging information on suspected terrorists, is operational at seaports and airports in Africa. U.S. security assistance for counterterrorism in Africa has increased significantly, with a focus on military train-and-equip programs. Members of Congress may need to assess the allocation of resources for military, law enforcement, and justice sector assistance to address the growing terrorist threats in the region. The current U.S. counterterrorism approach in Africa is being questioned for potentially over-focusing resources on security responses that could further destabilize some countries and exacerbate regional instability. Critics argue that there should be a balance between security and development spending in vulnerable countries. Additionally, there are concerns about the training and equipment of African police, investigators, and prosecutors to respond to increasing terrorist attacks on soft targets. Members may also consider allocating resources to other efforts such as enforcing travel and financial sanctions against terrorist actors. The U.S. counterterrorism approach in Africa is criticized for potentially destabilizing countries and exacerbating regional instability. There are concerns about the insufficient allocation of intelligence assets and disagreements over direct military interdiction versus building African partner countries' security capacity. The Administration has applied both approaches in dealing with Al Qaeda's affiliates in Africa. The U.S. has deployed military forces to African countries to counter terrorist threats, focusing on Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and Syria, and the Islamic State. Direct strikes have been carried out in Somalia and Libya, with concerns about the legal implications and resource requirements of this approach. The U.S. has deployed military forces in African countries to counter terrorist threats, focusing on Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and Syria, and the Islamic State. Direct strikes in Somalia and Libya raise legal questions and require significant resources. Strikes may degrade capabilities but need follow-up efforts on the ground for lasting impact. Partner capacity-building aims to empower other governments to counter terrorism with less U.S. risk, but may lack control over operations and effectiveness in the short run. The success of U.S. counterterrorism partnerships in Africa depends on various factors, including alignment of interests with partner governments. Recent statements from Ugandan officials suggest potential limits to relying on partners for success, highlighting risks to long-term stability. Factors such as diverging objectives and actions of Somalia's neighbors, who are AMISOM troop contributors, can also undermine U.S. aims in the region. The U.S. faces risks in its capacity-building efforts in Africa due to various factors, including political sensitivity of train-and-equip programs and negative local perceptions of partner forces leading to civilian casualties. In Somalia, negative perceptions of AMISOM have increased, partly due to misconduct and civilian casualties, as well as suspicions of neighboring countries using AMISOM for their own agendas. The Administration uses AMISOM to advance its counterterrorism objectives in Africa, without recognizing geographic limitations on its authority. Legal debates persist over U.S. strikes in Somalia for \"self-defense\" and \"in defense of\" partner forces. Questions arise about the legal basis for such strikes without explicit congressional authorization as the U.S. military increasingly deploys personnel as trainers and advisors on the continent. The Obama Administration has interpreted African groups allied to Al Qaeda or the Islamic State as legal targets for U.S. military action under the 2001 AUMF. Interagency coordination challenges exist in counterterrorism funding, with shortcomings in programs like TSCTP limiting effectiveness. Country-specific spending figures for regional security assistance programs are not routinely reported to Congress. The Obama Administration has interpreted African groups allied to Al Qaeda or the Islamic State as legal targets for U.S. military action under the 2001 AUMF. Interagency coordination challenges exist in counterterrorism funding, with shortcomings in programs like TSCTP limiting effectiveness. Funding and responsibilities for CVE programs are spread among multiple offices, including the State Department's Counterterrorism (CT) and Africa Bureaus and USAID. Coordination points within the State Department and USAID are identified in a new Joint Strategy on Countering Violent Extremism released in May 2016. The strategy identifies coordination points within the State Department and USAID for U.S. engagement and assistance in Africa. The lack of country-specific funding data may hinder oversight and examination of U.S. efforts to counter terrorism and extremism on the continent. Limited access to funding data may obscure U.S. policy dilemmas, such as in response to Burundi's political crisis. The Administration has suspended some security assistance programs due to human rights abuses by Burundian military forces, but they still receive U.S. support for their deployment to AMISOM in Somalia. Experts believe this support gives the U.S. leverage over the Burundian government. Congress has mandated reports on countering terrorist groups in Africa, including through the FY2015 NDAA. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act mandated a report on US counterterrorism strategy against radical Islamist groups in North Africa, West Africa, and the Sahel. The House version of the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act requires a strategy for US defense interests in Africa, with a focus on concerns regarding BPC programs and support to Somali armed forces. The Senate version of the FY2017 NDAA aims to streamline DOD's security cooperation authorities for counterterrorism aid, focusing on global train-and-equip programs. It does not address State Department authorities or funding balance. Several U.S. counterterrorism partners in Africa have poor human rights records, raising concerns about security force abuses. African countries are seen as security cooperation partners, with local militaries playing significant roles in politics in countries like Ethiopia, Mauritania, and Uganda. The United States has implemented measures to prevent security assistance from being linked to abusive foreign governments and forces. There is debate over whether continued engagement or human rights concerns should take precedence in security assistance, especially in countries where security force abuses may contribute to radicalization. Abuses identified as push factor for radicalization, debate complicated if U.S. prioritizes counterterrorism cooperation. \"Leahy laws\" restrict security assistance to units implicated in human rights violations. Congress prohibits aid to governments involved in military coups, enacts country-specific provisions. Child Soldiers Prevention Act restricts military assistance. The Child Soldiers Prevention Act restricts military assistance for countries implicated in the use of child soldiers, particularly in Africa. U.S. security assistance in Africa is debated in relation to state fragility and democracy, as concerns rise over incumbent leaders extending their terms and security forces responding violently to protests. Executive branch officials argue that military professionalization programs promote democracy and human rights, but measuring their impact is challenging. The impact of U.S. security assistance in Africa on democracy and human rights is debated, especially in countries like Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. There are discussions on whether withholding assistance can incentivize political change, but it may vary case by case. Fragile states in Africa may struggle to absorb and sustain U.S. security assistance, presenting a policy dilemma for U.S. officials. The study highlights a policy dilemma in Africa where countries in need of assistance may struggle to utilize it effectively. U.S. policymakers face challenges in balancing near-term objectives like countering terrorism with longer-term goals of stability and development in key counterterrorism partner countries. Congressional focus on violent Islamist extremism in Africa is expected to continue. Congressional attention to violent Islamist extremism in Africa is expected to continue, with debates on shaping U.S. counterterrorism policies. Congress may consider allocating foreign aid for security capacity building, countering extremist propaganda, stabilizing liberated areas, and promoting governance. Legislation may prioritize certain activities and establish benchmarks for success. Future discussions may also involve limits or expansions of military force authorization. Future congressional deliberations may consider limits on or expansions of military force authorization."
