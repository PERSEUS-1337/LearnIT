The Landmine Elimination Act of 1997, also known as the official title, highlights key findings regarding the Senate's vote to impose a moratorium on anti-personnel landmines, retired military officers urging a ban on production and use of landmines, and the significant casualties suffered in Vietnam from landmines. The Landmine Elimination Act of 1997 highlighted the significant casualties caused by landmines, with 20 soldiers killed and 204 injured in Bosnia under United Nations command, and 9 soldiers killed and 55 injured under NATO command. President Clinton declared aggressive pursuit of an international ban on landmines, and various organizations declared goals for landmine-free zones in the Western Hemisphere and Africa. The Government of Canada announced negotiations for a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines in 1996. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution in December 1996 to pursue a treaty banning landmines. Formal negotiations for the Ottawa treaty began in Oslo in September 1997. Princess Diana, a strong advocate for a total ban on landmines, was remembered during the negotiations. The United States could use its international influence to secure support for a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines, which would enhance security and humanitarian interests by deterring their use against US Armed Forces and civilians. SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON NEW DEPLOYMENTS OF ANTI-PERSONNEL LANDMINES. Beginning on January 1, 2000, no funds may be used for new deployments of anti-personnel landmines. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report within 180 days detailing alternative proposals for such deployments on the Korean Peninsula. The President can delay the restriction if reports are submitted annually certifying the need for new landmine deployments. Congress certifying that new deployments of anti-personnel landmines on the Korean Peninsula in the event of a war in Korea or a period of emergency declared by the President would be indispensable to the defense of the Republic of Korea. The report must include efforts to implement proposals for such deployments and any similar proposals prepared subsequently by the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"anti-personnel landmine\" refers to munitions designed to detonate by person contact, excluding command-detonated Claymore munitions."
