The western parcel was returned to the Municipality of Vieques in 2001, while the eastern parcel continued to be used for training purposes. The Vieques Training Range in Puerto Rico, owned by the Department of the Navy, included an 11,000-acre Eastern Maneuver Area for Marine Corps ground exercises and a 900-acre Live Impact Area for live ordnance targeting. The range was used for integrated live-fire exercises by U.S. Atlantic Fleet aircraft carrier battle groups and amphibious ready groups preparing for deployments. The Navy argued that Vieques was essential for such training operations until 2001. Puerto Rican discontent and opposition to U.S. military activities in Vieques increased after the Department of the Navy withdrew from Culebra in 1975. This withdrawal led to the consolidation of live-fire training operations at Vieques, causing dissatisfaction among Puerto Ricans due to lost economic development opportunities, disruptions to local fishing operations, and hindrance in developing the island. The impact of Department of the Navy (DON) activities on Vieques includes economic loss, environmental damage, health concerns, noise pollution, safety risks, and insensitivity towards the community. The April 19, 1999 bombing accident further strained relations between the Navy and the Vieques community. The April 19, 1999 bombing accident on Vieques killed a Puerto Rican civilian and injured four others, leading to a temporary suspension of Navy activities. This incident sparked strong opposition from Puerto Rican political leaders and the public, demanding the Navy to withdraw from the island immediately. Demonstrators entered the range to protest, hindering the Navy's training activities. President Clinton later addressed the issue on June 9, 1999. On June 9, 1999, President Clinton asked Secretary of Defense William Cohen to establish a special panel chaired by Frank Rush to study the situation at Vieques. The Rush panel recommended ceasing all training activities at Vieques within five years and transferring resources to alternative locations. President Clinton announced an agreement with Puerto Rico on January 31, 2000. President Clinton announced an agreement with Governor Rossello on a plan for Vieques, calling for a referendum to decide on the future of Navy activities. The referendum offered two choices: cease training by May 1, 2003, or continue with funding for infrastructure projects. Prior to the referendum, the Navy could conduct limited exercises on the range using non-explosive ordnance. The plan for Vieques included limited Navy training for up to 90 days a year with non-explosive ordnance, a $40 million funding request for community projects, and transferring DON lands for civilian use. Federal agents removed protestors on May 4, 2000, allowing training to resume. Congressional hearings were held in 1999 and 2000 regarding the situation on Vieques. In October 1999, the Senate Armed Services Committee discussed the situation in Vieques. Congress debated and approved $40 million in community assistance funding for Vieques as part of the FY2001 military construction appropriation bill. In October 1999, the Senate Armed Services Committee discussed Vieques. Congress approved $40 million for community assistance projects in Vieques as part of the FY2001 military construction appropriation bill. The legislation included land-transfer terms modified from the Clinton-Rossello plan and other implementing measures in Title XV of P.L. 106-398 (H.R. 4205). Governor Calderon, who took office in January 2001, did not support the Clinton-Rossello plan and took actions that seemed to break the accord. The Clinton Administration warned Puerto Rico of consequences if obligations were not met. The Bush Administration initially supported the Clinton-Rossello plan for Vieques, but canceled training operations on March 1, 2000. President Clinton issued directives concerning Vieques, including examining a study on vibroacoustic disease and finding an alternative to live-fire training. Governor Calderon was warned by the Administration about fulfilling obligations under the plan. On April 11, 2001, the Navy notified Puerto Rican government of plans to resume training operations at Vieques using inert ordnance starting April 27. Governor Calderon introduced legislation to tighten noise restrictions, accused the Defense Department of violating agreements, and passed a bill to prohibit ship-to-shore gunfire. Puerto Rico filed a federal lawsuit to halt the Navy's exercise on April 24. On April 24, Puerto Rico filed a federal lawsuit to halt the Navy's exercise at Vieques, arguing that it would threaten public health and violate noise-restriction laws. The court dismissed the lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds, stating that Congress did not intend to create a private action for violations by federal entities. The Bush Administration announced plans to end military training operations at Vieques by May 1, 2003, with the Defense Department seeking alternatives and relief from training requirements. The Bush Administration announced plans to end military training operations at Vieques by May 1, 2003, with the Defense Department seeking relief from training requirements. Supporters of the military criticized the plan, while some opponents welcomed it but others felt it didn't go far enough. Governor Calderon welcomed the Bush Administration's plan to end military training operations in Vieques by May 1, 2003, but she still wanted operations to cease immediately. She organized a referendum on July 29, 2001, where 68% of voters favored an immediate cessation of training operations. On January 7, 2002, the Secretary of the Navy denied a request to continue operations beyond May 1, 2003. The Secretary of the Navy denied a request for a Navy battle group to train at Vieques in November 2001. Legislation in 2001 and 2002 authorized the Secretary of the Navy to close the Vieques range if alternative training facilities were available. The Secretary of the Navy denied training on Vieques and was authorized to close the range if alternative facilities were available. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Secretary to report on plans for joint task force training in FY2003, including locations, munitions use, and military capabilities. The Secretary of the Navy ceased training operations at Vieques in February 2003 and closed the range in April 2003, transferring the land to the Department of the Interior for use as a wildlife refuge. The Live Impact Area will be designated as a wilderness area. The Secretary certified to Congress that training operations on the island had ceased in accordance with Section 1049 of [ P.L. 107-107 ]. The Navy ceased training operations on Vieques in February 2003 and closed the range in April 2003. Alternative training sites were identified to replace Vieques. Congress may consider if these alternatives provide equivalent training. The closure of Vieques could impact access to overseas training ranges with local opposition. The Senate Armed Services Committee strongly supported the Navy's plan to reduce its presence at Roosevelt Roads and directed the Navy to report to Congress on cleanup-related actions for Vieques. The committee expects the Secretary of the Navy to complete all environmental cleanup actions on Vieques Island promptly. The FY2004 Defense Appropriations Bill directed the Navy to close Roosevelt Roads naval station within six months and dispose of the property according to the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990. A different provision was added by floor amendment in the House-passed version of the bill."
