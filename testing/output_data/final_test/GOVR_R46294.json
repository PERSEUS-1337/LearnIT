    "content": "Poverty is a key concern for Congress, impacting funding allocation and eligibility for assistance programs. The poverty rate decreased to 11.8% in 2018 from 12.3% in 2017, lower than the pre-recession level of 12.5% in 2007. Despite improvements, the rate remains higher than the record-low of 11.1% in 1973. Policymakers are examining economic and social factors driving poverty and the effectiveness of policy responses. The report provides a snapshot of who was poor in 2018 by selected demographic, economic, and social characteristics, showing that people in poverty are a diverse group. Special attention is given to the role of work in the lives of those who are poor, highlighting the importance of income from work for economic well-being. The report provides a snapshot of who was poor in 2018 by selected demographic, economic, and social characteristics, showing that people in poverty are a diverse group. Attention is also paid to living arrangements and factors influencing individuals' attachment to the labor market. The snapshot looks at the composition of people in poverty rather than poverty rates among different groups, providing a different perspective on poverty. Poverty is a lack of resources to meet basic needs, with official measures used by the U.S. Census Bureau to identify individuals as \"poor.\" The size of a population can affect its representation in the poverty population, with different demographic groups having varying poverty rates. For more information on poverty rates and trends, refer to CRS Report R46000, Poverty in the United States in 2018: In Brief by Joseph Dalaker. The poverty status of an individual is determined by their money income and the income of family members they live with. The poverty threshold varies based on family composition, with income below the threshold indicating poverty. The official poverty measure has been in use for about 50 years and is widely utilized. The official poverty measure, in use for 50 years, has limitations such as only considering pre-tax income and not accounting for government taxes and non-cash benefits. It also does not factor in assets or living cost differences across geographical areas. The Census Bureau has introduced a supplemental poverty measure (SPM) that addresses these issues by considering taxes, transfers, housing costs, and modern resource-sharing arrangements. In 2018, an estimated 38.1 million people had pre-tax income below the poverty threshold, with 11.8% of the population considered poor. About 45.3% of those in poverty were living in deep poverty, defined as having income below 50% of the poverty threshold. Poverty affects individuals of all ages, sexes, and racial/ethnic groups. In 2018, 38.1 million people had pre-tax income below the poverty threshold, with 11.8% of the population considered poor. Children made up 31.1% of those in poverty, working-age adults 55.4%, and the aged 13.5%. These groups were either over-represented or under-represented compared to the overall population. In 2018, the poverty population composition by race and ethnicity showed that non-Hispanic whites were the largest group overall (60.2% of the total population) and represented 41.2% of the poverty population. Hispanics were the second largest group (18.5% of the total population) and made up 27.6% of those in poverty. Non-Hispanic African-Americans were the third largest group in both populations, representing 12.3% and 21.9% respectively. Minority groups were over-represented in the poverty population compared to the total population. In 2018, the poverty population composition by race and ethnicity showed that non-Hispanic whites were the largest group overall (60.2% of the total population) and represented 41.2% of the poverty population. Hispanics were the second largest group (18.5% of the total population) and made up 27.6% of those in poverty. Non-Hispanic African-Americans were the third largest group in both populations, representing 12.3% and 21.9% respectively. Minority groups were over-represented in the poverty population compared to the total population. Groups included Hispanics, non-Hispanic African-Americans, and non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives, while under-represented racial/ethnic groups were non-Hispanic whites and Asians. Children (under age 18) were more racially and ethnically diverse than adults, especially the aged (age 65+), with minorities over-represented in the poverty population for all age groups in 2018. Women slightly outnumbered men in the overall population, but represented an even larger share (56.0%) of the population in poverty. In Figure 5, women represented 56.0% of the population in poverty, possibly due to higher likelihood of heading single-parent households and lower earnings compared to men. Poverty poses different policy considerations for children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Children are dependents, working-age adults are expected to work and support themselves and their children, while aged adults may retire from work. The report explores poverty among children, working-age adults, and aged adults, highlighting the central role of work as the primary means of economic support. Children made up slightly less than one-third of all people in poverty in America in 2018, despite comprising less than a quarter of the total population. In 2018, children in America had the highest poverty rate of 16.2%, relying on their parents or adult caretakers for support. Among children in the total population, 93.0% lived in families with at least one adult worker, with 51.4% in families with two or more adult workers. In 2018, 51.4% of children in America lived in families with two or more adult workers. Among poor children, over two-thirds lived in families with at least one worker. 57.1% of poor children lived in families with one worker, while 11.0% lived in families with two or more workers. Children in female-headed families made up 57.5% of all poor children, a higher proportion compared to the total population. Despite a low poverty rate for children in married-couple families in 2018, they still accounted for nearly one-third of all poor children. Larger families are more likely to have children in poverty due to higher income needs, but most children live in families with earnings not determined by family size. Married-couple families were underrepresented among children in poverty compared to the overall population. In 2018, larger families are more likely to have children in poverty, with 24.7% of poor children in families with four or more children. Working-age adults (18-64 years old) make up the majority of people in poverty, representing 55.4% of all individuals in poverty. In 2018, among working-age adults who were poor, the majority did not work. Only 36.8% of them were working in some capacity, with 12.0% working full-time all year. Reasons for not working included being ill or disabled, taking care of family members, going to school, being retired, or unable to find a job. Among working-age adults who were poor in 2018, a significant proportion were not working. Reasons for not working included being retired, unable to find a job, or being ill or disabled. Educational attainment was found to be linked to success in the workforce, with higher levels of education leading to higher earnings and more stable employment. The largest group of poor working-age adults had a high school diploma but no post-secondary credential. In 2018, 24.2% of poor working-age adults had no postsecondary credential, compared to 10.2% in the overall population. Family living arrangements were more prevalent among the overall population (77.8%) than among the poor (56.4%). 43.6% of all working-age adults in poverty lived outside of a family. In 2018, 43.6% of all working-age adults in poverty lived outside of a family, including those living alone, with cohabiting partners, or other unrelated adults/roommates. The poverty status of individuals living with others is based on each individual's income, with no pooling of resources assumed. Aged adults are the least likely to be living below the poverty line, with a poverty rate of 9.7% in 2018. In 2018, 76.4% of adults aged 65 and older did not work, but income from past work, family members, and those who still work is crucial for their economic well-being. Social Security benefits, pensions, and other job-related income sources are common among aged persons. In 2018, most aged adults received income from pensions, benefits, and earnings from work. 51.6% of all aged persons received retirement, disability, or survivor pensions, while 41.4% received earnings from work. Only 10.4% of aged persons in poverty received these benefits. In 2018, almost three in four aged adults lived in families with income derived from work, even among those who were poor. A significant portion of aged adults in poverty lived alone, with a lower likelihood of living in families compared to the overall aged population. This report provides basic information about the 38.1 million people in America with income below the poverty line in 2018. The report highlights that individuals below the poverty line in 2018 are a diverse group, including children, working-age adults, and aged adults, with varying circumstances such as full-time work, caretaking, or being outside the workforce. Certain groups like women, minorities, children, and those living alone are over-represented among the impoverished. Income from work plays a central role in determining poverty status, with children relying on family members' work, working-age adults on their own work, and aged adults often retired. In 2018, two-thirds of children in poverty were in families with at least one working adult, while over 7 out of 10 poor aged persons had some form of work-based income. The complexity of circumstances leading to poverty warrants further exploration for federal policy interventions."
