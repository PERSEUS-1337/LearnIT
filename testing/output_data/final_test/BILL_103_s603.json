The Congress finds that overall unemployment in Northern Ireland exceeds 14 percent, with some neighborhoods of religious minorities experiencing unemployment rates over 70 percent. The British Government Fair Employment Commission reports that minority community members are two and a half times more likely to be unemployed than majority community members. Additionally, there are twenty-five firms in Northern Ireland controlled by United States persons. The Investor Responsibility Research Center lists forty-nine publicly held and nine privately held US companies operating in the region. The MacBride Principles are a set of guidelines for fair employment in Northern Ireland, aimed at addressing discriminatory hiring practices by US businesses in the region. These principles promote equal access to employment opportunities for the religious minority population without requiring disinvestment, quotas, or reverse discrimination. SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON IMPORTS: An article from Northern Ireland cannot be imported into the US customs territory without documentation proving compliance with fair employment principles. SEC. 4.
