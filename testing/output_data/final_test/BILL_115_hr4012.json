Congress finds that Hizballah is active in Syria, supporting President Bashar Al-Assad, and has significantly increased its missile arsenal in Lebanon with the help of Iran. Additionally, Iran is suspected of building missile production facilities in Lebanon for Hizballah. The National Intelligence Estimate will assess Iranian support of proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon, focusing on the threat to Israel and US regional allies. It will include details on arms transfers to Hizballah since March 2011, including the method of transfer and financial aspects. The National Intelligence Estimate will assess Iranian support of proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon, focusing on the threat to Israel and US regional allies. It will include details on arms transfers to Hizballah since March 2011, including the method of transfer and financial aspects. The assessment will cover land, sea, or air transfers, technological capabilities transferred by Iran to Hizballah, Iranian-controlled personnel in Syria, Hizballah's operational lessons learned in Syria, and rocket-producing facilities in Lebanon for non-state actors. The analysis focuses on Iranian and Hizballah leadership, supply chains aiding missile production facilities, goods and technology transferred by Iran to Hizballah, foreign facilitators of financial support and arms to Hizballah, Russia's collaboration with Iran and Hizballah in Syria, and the threat posed to Israel and other countries. The National Intelligence Estimate will assess the threat posed by Iran's support to Hizballah in the Middle East, particularly in terms of arms transfers. The Director of National Intelligence will submit the estimate to relevant congressional committees. \"Arms or related material\" includes nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological weapons. The definition of \"material\" includes nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological weapons, ballistic or cruise missile weapons, destabilizing advanced conventional weapons, defense articles or services, defense information, and items designated by the President for the United States Munitions List. The President must submit a strategy to Congress within 60 days of the National Intelligence Estimate completion to prevent Iran from expanding its influence in Syria and Lebanon. This strategy includes limiting Iranian presence in Syria and Lebanon, working with allies to restrict their access to liberated areas."
