Requirements for Operation of Micro Unmanned Aircraft Systems include operating below 400 feet, at a speed under 40 knots, within visual line of sight, between sunrise and sunset, and at least 5 statute miles away from airports with air traffic control towers. Operators of micro unmanned aircraft systems must provide notice to the airport operator and receive approval from the air traffic control tower before operating within 5 statute miles of an airport with an operational air traffic control tower. Exemptions are provided for operators of micro unmanned aircraft systems. According to regulations, individuals can operate micro unmanned aircraft systems without needing to pass a knowledge test, meet age or experience requirements, or obtain airman or medical certificates. Additionally, these systems are exempt from meeting airworthiness certification standards or obtaining an airworthiness certificate. Exemptions from operational regulations for micro unmanned aircraft systems include not needing a certificate of authorization or waiver from the FAA and future regulations for operation. The Micro Drone Safety and Innovation Act of 2016 exempts operators of micro unmanned aircraft systems from additional requirements. Micro unmanned aircraft can be operated under alternative regulations without needing an airman or medical certificate. A micro unmanned aircraft system is defined as weighing not more than 4.4 pounds. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 is amended to exempt operators of micro unmanned aircraft systems from additional requirements, allowing them to operate under alternative regulations without needing an airman or medical certificate.
