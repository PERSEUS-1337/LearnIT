The lack of reliable information on sweatshop working conditions hinders consumers' ability to make informed choices when purchasing garments. Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act are necessary to ensure free consumer choice and promote fair competition and working conditions.

The apparel manufacturer must maintain records of regular and overtime hours worked, wages, benefits, and piece rates paid. They must also disclose the names and addresses of all financially invested persons in the manufacturer and contractors. Prior to placing a production order, an apparel manufacturer must contract with a contractor to provide records of labor law compliance for the past 5 years. An apparel manufacturer must enforce contracts diligently, submit records to the Secretary for public access, and comply with specific data categories set by regulations. The Secretary must ensure data categories for a searchable database by apparel manufacturer and contractor details, production run dates, job categories, violations, and other specified information. Submission of data must be done electronically and freely accessible to all manufacturers and contractors. An apparel manufacturer or contractor can be sued by consumer organizations, labor unions, or contractors for violating obligations.

Apparel refers to garments for men, women, children, or infants intended for sale. The term 'apparel' includes various clothing items for sale, but excludes premanufactured items like buttons or zippers. 'Manufacture' involves designing, sewing, and finishing apparel. An 'apparel manufacturer' is someone who sells or produces apparel, while a 'contractor' is a person who directly contracts for manufacturing.

Civil penalties for violations of recordkeeping under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 have been amended to include a $5,000 penalty for failing to maintain or submit required information, records, or contracts. Willful failures incur this penalty for each pay period. Additionally, submitting fraudulent information incurs a $10,000 penalty for the first act and $15,000 for subsequent acts."
