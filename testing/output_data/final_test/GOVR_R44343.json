    "content": "The Federal Perkins Loan program is part of the campus-based student financial aid programs, providing low-interest loans to students with exceptional financial need. It is authorized under Title IV, Part E of the Higher Education Act and supersedes previous loan programs. Perkins Loans are available to undergraduate and graduate students, with priority given to those with exceptional financial need. The Federal Perkins Loan program provides low-interest loans to eligible students with exceptional financial need. Interest is fixed at 5% per year, and part or all of the loan can be cancelled for individuals in public service roles. Institutional revolving loan funds are capitalized through federal and institutional contributions. The Secretary of Education can make new contributions through FY2015. The Federal Perkins Loan program, which provides low-interest loans to students with financial need, had an automatic one-year extension under GEPA. A limited grandfathering provision allowed funds to be appropriated through FY2020 and FY2021 for IHEs to make loans to continuing students. Despite the expiration of authorization for new Perkins Loans in 2015, IHEs continued to disburse loans from their revolving funds. In 2013-2014, 1,500 IHEs issued $1.2 billion in new Perkins Loans to 539,000 students.

It no longer aims to stimulate the establishment of institutional Perkins Loan funds or assist graduate and professional students. The Extension Act allows institutions of higher education to award new Perkins Loans to eligible students for specified time frames, with priority given to students with exceptional financial need. ED provided guidance for participating institutions if the program was not extended before the end of FY2015, stating that new Perkins Loans should not be extended to new borrowers after September 30, 2015. However, if a first disbursement was made before October 1, 2015, remaining disbursements could still be made on that loan.

It also prohibits new Perkins Loans beyond FY2015 but does not affect reimbursement for cancelled loans used for public service jobs. The Act makes the automatic one-year extension of the Perkins Loan program inapplicable. Under GEPA Section 422, the Perkins Loan program was automatically extended for an additional year through FY2015. However, Section 2(c) specifies that this extension does not apply to making new Perkins Loans beyond September 30, 2017. The Extension Act does not automatically extend the authority to make new Perkins Loans beyond FY2015. Section 2(b) of the Act amends provisions related to the timing and distribution of assets of IHEs' Perkins Loan funds after the program expires. The Extension Act does not extend the authority to make new Perkins Loans beyond FY2015. HEA Section 466 specified dates for returning federal share of Perkins Loan funds after program conclusion.

Beginning October 1, 2017, each participating IHE must return the federal share of its Perkins Loan funds. The Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015 requires participating IHEs to return federal share of borrower payments, late collections, and excess capital to the Secretary. The amendments made by the Act are summarized in Table 1. The Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-105) outlines the provisions of the Perkins Loan program before and after the enactment of the Extension Act. Any Perkins Loan provisions not mentioned in the Act remain unchanged."
