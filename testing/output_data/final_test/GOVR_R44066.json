    "content": "Preemption under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution involves conflicts between state and federal law. Congressional intent determines if state actions are preempted. Federal statutes on environmental and public health vary in their approach to preemption. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) takes an intermediate stance on preemption. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) establishes a chemical regulatory program allowing EPA to review new chemical substances before they enter U.S. commerce, regulate chemicals presenting unreasonable risks, and require testing on chemicals that may pose risks. EPA also mandates reporting of substances in U.S. commerce. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) authorizes EPA to regulate chemicals, require reporting by manufacturers, maintain an inventory of chemicals, protect trade secrets, and coordinate with other federal agencies. TSCA's core provisions have not been significantly amended since 1976 and apply to \"chemical substances\" defined in the law. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) excludes certain categories of materials and substances from its scope, such as pesticides, foods, personal care products, and firearms. TSCA's preemption provisions are based on actions taken by EPA regarding specific chemicals, preempting duplicative testing requirements and non-identical state regulations. TSCA Section 18(a) prohibits states from imposing their own testing requirements on chemical substances if EPA has already mandated testing under TSCA Section 4. EPA's testing rules for hundreds of chemicals preempt state testing requirements, but there are no known cases of EPA preempting state testing rules. Additionally, if EPA issues a rule under TSCA Section 5 or 6 to protect against health or environmental risks associated with a chemical substance, states are also restricted from imposing their own regulations. Since 1976, EPA has imposed restrictions on chemicals to protect against health or environmental risks under TSCA Sections 5 and 6. These rules do not preempt many state or local requirements, except for testing requirements mandated by EPA under TSCA Section 4. State regulations on chemical disposal methods are also not preempted by EPA rules or orders. State regulations on chemical disposal methods are not preempted by EPA rules. States can enforce requirements identical to federal ones and adopt regulations under other federal laws. States can also prohibit certain chemicals' use within their jurisdiction, but not in manufacturing or processing other substances. TSCA Section 18(b) allows states to apply for exemptions for more stringent regulations, granted by EPA if they provide higher protection without violating federal requirements. The lack of express authority for EPA to share trade secret information with states under TSCA Section 18 affects the division of federal and state authority over chemicals. Compliance with TSCA could potentially serve as a preemption defense in lawsuits related to chemical exposures under common law. Legislative efforts to revise TSCA's chemical regulations are ongoing. Legislative efforts to revise TSCA's chemical regulatory framework have been ongoing since at least 2005. Proposed changes would maintain the basic structure of TSCA Title I but include significant operational modifications. In the 114th Congress, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697) was introduced in 2015, with hearings held before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. In March 2015, a hearing was held on the bill before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. An amended version of S. 697 was approved on April 28, 2015, with bipartisan support. S. 697 was reported with an amendment on June 17, 2015, and placed on the Senate legislative calendar. Another proposal, S. 725, has not progressed in committee. In the House, a discussion draft titled the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015 was released in April, with a hearing held on April 14, 2015. The TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, H.R. 2576, was introduced and approved by the House on June 23, 2015, addressing similar topics as S. 697. S. 697, in the 114th Congress, takes a comprehensive approach to amending TSCA by adding new definitions and requiring EPA to establish a risk-based screening process for chemicals. EPA would conduct assessments on high priority chemicals to ensure they meet safety standards. S. 697 proposes changes to TSCA, including new duties for EPA to review chemicals against safety standards and identify inactive chemicals. H.R. 2576 makes fewer changes, not altering new chemical provisions or adding a detailed prioritization scheme. EPA could continue existing prioritization efforts under H.R. 2576. H.R. 2576, similar to S. 697, would mandate EPA to conduct risk evaluations based solely on health and environmental factors, remove \"least burdensome requirements\" language, and require cost-effective chemical rules. It would also expand EPA's testing authority, impose scientific standards, and modify TSCA's confidentiality provisions. EPA would need to initiate at least 10 risk evaluations per year, contingent on funding availability. The curr_chunk discusses proposed changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), including modifications to confidentiality provisions, fee provisions, and other sections of the law. It compares the preemption provisions and state-federal relationship in two bills, noting similarities and differences in scope and timing of preemption based on EPA actions. The curr_chunk compares preemption provisions in two proposed changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA, S. 697 and H.R. 2576), highlighting differences in scope and timing based on EPA actions. It also discusses new waiver provisions and other provisions related to the federal-state relationship under TSCA."
