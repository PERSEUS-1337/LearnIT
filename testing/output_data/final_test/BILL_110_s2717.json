    "content": "The \"Effective Immigration Enforcement Partnerships Act of 2008\" defines the term \"State\" and affirms the role of states and political subdivisions in enforcing immigration law. Law enforcement personnel of a State or political subdivision have the authority to enforce immigration laws and transfer aliens to Federal custody. This State authority is not overridden by Federal law. Additionally, the Act includes provisions for listing immigration violators in the National Crime Information Center database. The Commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection must provide the National Crime Information Center with information on aliens with final removal orders, voluntary departure agreements, overstayed visas, or revoked visas within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The National Crime Information Center must enter information on aliens with final removal orders into the Immigration Violators File, regardless of whether the alien received notice of removal, has already been removed, or sufficient identifying information is available. Amendments to Section 534(a) of title 28, United States Code include updating the NCIC database with this information. Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act allow for the acquisition and preservation of records of immigration law violations. Section 240B is updated to replace \"Attorney General\" with \"Secretary of Homeland Security\" and change the time frame for voluntary departure from 120 to 30 days. Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act include a new section allowing for the transfer of illegal aliens from state to federal custody. The new section in the Immigration and Nationality Act allows for the transfer of illegal aliens from state to federal custody upon request by the head of a law enforcement entity. The Secretary of Homeland Security must take the illegal alien into federal custody within 72 hours of apprehension or request temporary detention by state or local law enforcement. The new section in the Immigration and Nationality Act allows for the transfer of illegal aliens from state to federal custody upon request by the head of a law enforcement entity. The Secretary of Homeland Security must reimburse states for expenses incurred in the detention and transportation of criminal or illegal aliens. The new section in the Immigration and Nationality Act allows for the reimbursement of states for costs related to detaining and transporting criminal or illegal aliens. This includes the average cost of incarceration per day and transportation expenses from apprehension to detention or custody transfer points. The Secretary of Homeland Security must ensure appropriate security for illegal aliens in federal facilities. A regular circuit and schedule for transferring apprehended illegal aliens to federal custody must be established, with the option to enter into contracts with state and local law enforcement officials. The term 'illegal alien' is defined in this section. The term 'illegal alien' is defined as an alien who entered the United States without inspection, failed to maintain nonimmigrant status, failed to comply with immigrant status requirements, or failed to depart as required. Authorization of $500,000,000 for detention and removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act for fiscal year 2009 and subsequent years. SEC. 6. Immigration law enforcement training for state and local law enforcement personnel. The Secretary of Homeland Security must publish a training manual and pocket guide for State and local law enforcement personnel on investigating, apprehending, and transferring aliens in the United States, including identifying fraudulent documents. The Secretary of Homeland Security will provide training resources for State and local law enforcement personnel on handling aliens in the United States, including fraudulent document detection. The training materials will be easily accessible and the costs will be covered by the Secretary. Training flexibility will be offered through various methods, including residential training. The training resources for State and local law enforcement personnel on handling aliens in the United States, including fraudulent document detection, will be provided through various methods such as residential training at designated centers, onsite training at police agencies, online courses, and DVD recordings. Additionally, online training will be available through a secure distributed learning system. The Act requires a distributed learning system with servers in the US, sealable and survivable, with a portal within 30 days. Federal personnel training cannot displace State and local law enforcement training. Immigration-related training is not a requirement for State and local law enforcement officers. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to limit training for law enforcement officers to 14 days or 80 hours. SEC. 7. IMMUNITY. Immunity is granted to law enforcement officers and agencies at the state and local levels when enforcing immigration laws, similar to federal officers. Personal immunity protects officers from personal liability, while agency immunity shields law enforcement agencies from money damages related to civil rights laws during immigration law enforcement incidents. The curr_chunk states that law enforcement officers are immune from personal liability when enforcing immigration laws, unless they violate criminal laws in the process. The Criminal Alien Program is outlined in Section 8. The Criminal Alien Program, outlined in Section 8, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to identify and remove removable criminal aliens from Federal and State correctional facilities, ensuring they are not released into the United States. The program will be expanded to all States within 9 months of the Act's enactment. States receiving Federal funds for incarceration have specific responsibilities. States receiving Federal funds for the incarceration of criminal aliens must cooperate with Federal officials, identify these aliens in their prison populations, and promptly share information with the officials. State and local law enforcement officers are authorized to detain illegal aliens for up to 14 days after completing their state prison sentence for transfer purposes. The Secretary of Homeland Security utilizes technology, like videoconferencing, to expand the Criminal Alien Program to remote areas. Mobile access to federal alien databases and live scan technology is also employed. The Criminal Alien Program under the Department of Homeland Security utilizes live scan technology and authorizes appropriations of $40-80 million annually from 2009 onwards to support State and local law enforcement agencies in remote locations. SEC. 9. CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not require State or local law enforcement to report victims or witnesses of criminal offenses to Homeland Security for immigration enforcement, arrest them for immigration violations, or enforce immigration laws."
