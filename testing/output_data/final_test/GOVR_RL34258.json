    "content": "The current world oil reserves are estimated at 1.292 trillion barrels, with the Middle East holding 58% and OPEC holding 70%. The United States has 22.7 billion barrels, just 1.8% of the world's total. US crude oil production is expected to decrease, while Canadian oil sands may play a larger role in US oil imports. Since 2004, Canada has been ranked second in oil reserves behind Saudi Arabia, with oil sands accounting for 46% of its total oil production. Canadian crude oil exports to the United States were 1.82 million barrels per day in 2006, making up 18% of U.S. net imports. Infrastructure is in place to transport oil from Canadian oil sand reserves to the U.S., with production expected to increase from 1.2 to 2.8 million barrels per day by 2015. However, infrastructure expansions and skilled labor are needed to boost oil flow from Canada. Canada's oil industry faces challenges such as regulatory permitting for new refinery capacity, environmental concerns like water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and high energy costs. Despite high oil prices, some projects are economically unviable due to capital and energy input costs. Canada ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2002 but will not meet its emission reduction goals by 2012. The oil sands industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions growth in Canada. Major U.S. oil companies are involved in the industry. Major U.S. oil companies are heavily investing in developing Canada's oil sand resources, committing billions of dollars to projects. While U.S. pilot projects on \"tar sands\" were not successful, the focus has now shifted to Canada due to its extensive reserves. Oil sands development expertise and resources are now primarily concentrated in Canada. The CRS report examines the oil sands resource base in the world, history of oil sands development in the United States and Canada, production technology, costs, and environmental impacts. Canadian oil sands hold about 14% of world oil reserves and 11% of technically recoverable oil resources, with over 80% of recoverable bitumen in North America. Oil sands are mixtures of organic matter, sand, and bitumen. Oil sands are mixtures of organic matter, sand, bitumen, and water that can be mined or extracted using thermal recovery techniques. Bitumen is a heavy crude with high density, viscosity, and metal concentration. It needs to be upgraded with hydrogen or carbon removal before processing. Oil sand products are sold as raw bitumen blended with a diluent for transport or as synthetic crude oil after upgrading. The USGS study in 1984 estimated 53.7 billion barrels of oil sands in the United States, with 11 billion barrels potentially recoverable. Major deposits exist in Utah and Texas, with smaller ones in Kentucky, Alabama, and California. 85% of the deposits would require in-situ production. In the 1980s, oil sand deposits in Kentucky, Alabama, and California were not economically recoverable. Canadian oil sand resources in Alberta are estimated to have 1.6 trillion barrels in place, with 11% recoverable. Mineable reserves account for 35 billion barrels at the surface and 141 billion barrels in-situ. The ultimate discovered amount is projected to be 2.5 trillion barrels, with 314 billion barrels expected to be recovered. Canada's oil sands are estimated to have 314 billion barrels expected to be recovered, with current production at 1.1 million barrels per day. Production is projected to reach 2.0 mbd by 2010 and 3.0 mbd by 2015. The International Energy Agency predicts production could exceed 5.0 mbd by 2033 with a $90 billion investment required. 44 new oil sands projects are planned in Alberta between 2004 and 2012, requiring an estimated C$60 billion for construction. The National Energy Board projects C$81.6 billion being spent between 2006 and 2016, with 82% directed towards the Fort McMurray/Woods Buffalo Region of Alberta. A total of C$29 billion was spent on oil sands development between 1996 and 2004. Interest in U.S. oil sand deposits dates back to the 1930s, with pilot projects in the 1960s and 1970s. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a public lands leasing program for oil sands and oil shale R&D. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a public lands leasing program for oil sands and oil shale R&D. Commercial success in mining oil sands depends on the ratio of overburden to oil sand thickness, with only about 15% of the U.S. resource base meeting the ideal ratio. Major development obstacles include remote locations, scattered deposits, and technology limitations for extracting oil from U.S. deposits. Oil sands deposits in the U.S. have faced challenges in commercial production due to viscosity issues, feasibility concerns, and economic viability. Some oil sands have been quarried in Utah for asphalt, with limited production in California. Since the 1980s, there has been minimal production for road material and no government funding for oil sands research. A 2006 conference at the University of Utah highlighted renewed interest in U.S. oil sands but acknowledged development challenges and mentioned new technologies being tested in Utah. The conference at the University of Utah discussed the need for long-term funding and capital for U.S. oil sand development. A recent report recommends economic incentives, regulatory framework, technology R&D, and collaboration with Alberta for understanding oil sands. The report estimates U.S. oil sand production could reach 340,000-352,000 barrels per day by 2025. Canada began producing oil sands in 1967 after years of research and development dating back to the early 1900s. Dr. Karl Clark pioneered a hot-water flotation process to separate bitumen from sand, leading to a patented process by 1929. Dr. Karl Clark pioneered a hot-water flotation process to separate bitumen from sand, leading to a patented process by 1929. The technology was demonstrated in 1949 and 1950 at a facility in Bitumont, Alberta. Sunoco established Great Canadian Oil Sands (GCOS), Ltd. in 1952 and invested $250 million in its oil sands project. Cities Services purchased a controlling interest in the Bitumont plant in 1958 and formed the Syncrude consortium in 1964 with Imperial Oil, Atlantic Richfield (ARCO), and Royalite Oil. Suncor began construction of pilot projects during the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, Suncor started commercial oil sands production using hot water extraction. Syncrude's proposal for a $1 billion plant was approved in 1978, with federal and provincial governments buying shares to cover costs. ARCO pulled out of the project as costs rose towards $2 billion. In the late 1970s, Syncrude's ownership structure changed with Alberta, Ontario, and a consortium of companies purchasing shares to cover costs. The Alberta government agreed to a profit-sharing arrangement instead of royalties. Syncrude invested $1.6 billion to increase production to 50 million barrels per year from 1983 to 1988. Alberta introduced a new royalty structure for oil sands producers in 1984, and in 1985, existing operations were exempt from taxes. Syncrude's cash operating costs were around $18 per barrel during this period. In the mid-1990s, Syncrude's cash operating costs were around $18 per barrel, while the market price of oil fluctuated under $20 per barrel. Oil sands producers lobbied for royalty relief and tax deferrals until project expansions were completed. The National Oil Sands Task Force was created in 1994 to boost production and trim costs. By 1996, the Task Force recommended consistent royalty and tax terms for oil sand projects. The ARC has partnered successfully with the private sector in oil sands research and development, thanks to favorable royalty and tax terms. Alberta's $700 million R&D investment from 1976-2001 has led to billions of dollars in private sector investment. Oil sands production may increase to 4.1% of total world production by 2025, providing access to North American oil reserves and enhancing energy security. Oil sands can be surface-mined or produced in-situ, with mining being optimal for deposits with overburden less than 75 meters thick. Mining in Alberta's oil sands requires a hydraulic or electric shovel to load sand into trucks for crushing and mixing into a slurry. The slurry is then hydro transported to an extraction facility to recover about 90% of the bitumen. In 2005, mining accounted for 52% of production, while in-situ accounted for 48%, with the Cold Production method being used for one-third of in-situ production. The largest production projects are in the Fort McMurray area operated by Syncrude and Suncor. The extraction process in Alberta's oil sands involves separating bitumen using warm water and chemicals. After slurrying, the bitumen is separated in a primary vessel and treated in a froth tank to recover it. The bitumen is then treated with a solvent to settle solids, resulting in a cleaner product. The oil can be sold as raw bitumen or upgraded to SCO. In-situ thermal recovery involves drilling wells and injecting steam to heat the bitumen for easier flow. Various techniques like the Cyclic Steam Stimulator are used for in-situ production. The Cyclic Steam Stimulator (CSS) is a widely used in-situ technology for extracting bitumen from oil sands. A newer technology, steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), has shown to recover up to 70% of bitumen in-place, compared to CSS which only recovers 25%-30%. SAGD uses a more efficient process with a lower steam to oil ratio, resulting in less natural gas usage. The emerging Vapor Extraction Process (VAPEX) technology operates similarly to SAGD but uses ethane, butane, or propane to mobilize hydrocarbons, eliminating the need for steam generators and natural gas. VAPEX requires no water, processing, or recycling, with 25% lower capital costs and half the operating costs of SAGD. The VAPEX technology uses ethane, butane, or propane to extract oil sands, eliminating the need for steam generators and natural gas. This process co-produces sand with bitumen, allowing oil sands to flow without heat. Imperial Oil utilizes this method at its Cold Lake site. Oil sand produced through in-situ techniques is sold as natural bitumen blended with a diluent for pipeline transport. Technology advancements have reduced operating costs from over $20/barrel in the early 1970s to $8-12/barrel in 2000. Upgrading bitumen involves coking for carbon removal or hydro-cracking for hydrogen addition. The coking process extracts bitumen using heat and catalysts, producing light oils, natural gas, and coke. Hydrocracking also cracks the oil into light oils but produces no coke byproduct. Hydrocracking requires natural gas for conversion to hydrogen and better handles aromatics. Partial upgrading raises the API of the bitumen to 20-25 degrees for pipeline quality crude, while a full upgrade raises it to between 30-43 degrees. Integrated mining operations include mining and upgrading, with companies like Suncor and Syncrude having on-site upgrading facilities. Suncor uses the coking process for upgrading, while Syncrude uses both methods. The oil sands processing chain involves upgrading methods such as coking and hydrocracking. Integration of upgrading with refineries is a major trend to reduce costs. Challenges include cost overruns, reducing sulfur content in SCO, and dependence on natural gas for hydrogen production. The heavy oil/light oil price differential incentivizes upgrading efforts. In early 2006, crude oil prices dropped to $12 per barrel, limited by refinery capacity and its use in asphalt. The NEB's June 2006 report discussed proposals for building upgraders, with cost overruns plaguing mining projects due to poor management and engineering issues. Operating costs have decreased significantly since the 1970s, with innovations like power shovels and hydrotransport driving down supply costs. Operating costs for oil sands projects include removal of overburden, mining, primary extraction, treatment, and tailings removal. Factors such as recovery rate, overburden volumes, energy costs, transport distances, and infrastructure maintenance impact operating costs. Supply costs encompass operating costs, capital costs, taxes, royalties, and a 10% ROI. Oil sands projects may have operating costs over 30% higher than conventional new oil production starts, but lower total costs per barrel due to minimal royalty and tax charges. NEB estimates suggest that $30-$35 per barrel is needed to achieve a 10% ROI, with mining bitumen costs estimated at around C$9-$12 per barrel. Supply costs for mining bitumen were estimated at C$9-$12 per barrel in 2005, with integrated mining/upgrading operations costing between C$36 and $40 per barrel for SCO. Operating costs for SAGD in-situ production increased to C$10-$14 per barrel in 2005. SAGD operations have lower recovery rates of 40%-70% but are less risky and require a smaller workforce compared to mining operations. The supply costs for Athabasca oil sand using the CSS recovery technique have increased to between C$20-$24/barrel, compared to C$13-$19/barrel for SAGD. Cost fluctuations in in-situ operations are influenced by reservoir quality and natural gas prices. SAGD supply costs are less affected by capital costs than mining projects due to lower capital investment. Natural gas is a significant input and cost factor for mining, upgrading, and in situ recovery processes. Natural gas is a major cost factor in thermal in-situ projects like SAGD and CSS, accounting for 15% of operating costs in mining operations and 60% in SAGD. Reducing the steam-to-oil ratio is crucial for lowering natural gas use. Canadian oil sand producers are exploring energy options to reduce or replace natural gas, such as gasification technology, cogeneration, coal, and nuclear power. In 1997, the Alberta government introduced a \"Generic Oil Sands Royalty Regime\" for new investments in oil sands projects. Producers pay a 1% minimum royalty based on gross revenue until all capital costs are recovered, then a 25% royalty on net project revenues or 1% of gross revenues, whichever is greater. Royalty payments may be based on bitumen or SCO value if an upgrader is involved. Currently, 51% of projects under this regime pay the 25% royalty rate. Royalty regime in Alberta includes a 25% royalty rate for oil sands producers. Suncor and Syncrude have \"Crown Agreements\" allowing them to pay royalties based on SCO production value. Royalties on bitumen, valued lower than SCO, would decrease government revenue. Royalty revenues from oil sands fluctuated widely between 1997 and 2005, with forecasts of $2.5 billion in 2006/2007 and $1.8 billion in 2007/2008. The Alberta government forecasts royalties of $2.5 billion in 2006/2007 and $1.8 billion in 2007/2008, with oil price fluctuations causing revenue swings. A Royalty Review Panel was established to assess if Alberta was receiving a fair share of energy sector royalties. The panel's September 2007 report concluded that Albertans were not receiving their fair share compared to other oil-producing countries. The Royalty Review Panel recommended maintaining the \"pre-payout, post-payout\" framework with a 1% pre-payout royalty rate and a higher net revenue royalty rate of 33% in the post-payout phase. The Alberta Government agreed to this framework but implemented a sliding-scale rate structure starting at 1% and increasing for every dollar above US$55 per barrel. The Government of Alberta has initiated negotiations with Suncor and Syncrude to include them under the new oil sands royalty framework by 2009. Oil sand firms pay federal and provincial income taxes, with differences in tax treatment compared to conventional oil industries. Both mineable and in-situ oil sand deposits are classified as a mineral resource for Capital Cost Allowance purposes, receiving higher cost deductions than conventional oil and gas operations. The provincial government of Alberta has agreed to eliminate the CCA deduction for oil sands in the 2007 federal budget proposal. The federal government of Canada reduced the general federal corporate income tax rate from 22.1% to 15% in 2012 to balance the change. Oil sand producers export the majority of their products to the United States, with 75% delivered to PADD II in the Midwest. U.S.-based refinery expansions announced between 2007-2015 will accommodate larger volumes of Canadian nonconventional oil. If Canada reaches its optimistic oil sands output level of 5 mbd in 2030 and maintains its export level to the United States at around 90%, it would be exporting about 4.5 mbd to the United States, reaching nearly 30% of all U.S. crude oil imports. U.S. refinery capacity is forecast to increase to nearly 19.3 mbd in 2030, a 2.4 mbd increase, but may not be enough to accommodate larger volumes of oil from Canada. Canada is pursuing additional refinery capacity for its heavier oil, with oil sands currently moved by two major pipelines to processing facilities in Edmonton. After reaching refineries in Edmonton, synthetic crude or bitumen is moved by pipelines to the United States. The Athabasca pipeline has a capacity of 570,000 b/d, while the Corridor has less than 200,000 b/d. Plans are in place to increase Corridor's capacity to 610,000 b/d by 2010. New pipeline projects are proposed to increase oil flow from Canada to the United States. Some U.S. pipelines have reversed their flow to carry Canadian heavy crude to Cushing Oklahoma and Southeast Texas. NEB predicts excess pipeline capacity by 2009. The oil sands industry in western Canada has seen significant investment in pipeline projects, with the Federal Government classifying it as a major air pollution emitter. Despite a 29% reduction in emission intensity between 1995-2004, the industry is expected to contribute significantly to Canada's greenhouse gas emissions. Alberta's GHG reduction goals are not likely to be met, posing a challenge for the industry according to the Pembina Institute. According to the Pembina Institute, greenhouse gas emissions intensity from oil sands is three times higher than from conventional oil production. The industry aims to reduce energy use to lower emissions. Total GHG emissions are projected to rise through 2020 due to increased oil sands production. Water supply and waste water disposal are major concerns, with oil sands projects currently diverting 150 million cubic meters of water annually from the Athabasca river. Oil sands projects divert 150 million cubic meters of water annually from the Athabasca River, approved for up to 350 million cubic meters. Concerns arise over the river's flow, impacting freshwater aquifers. Freshwater is used for various operations, with 90-95% recycled in SAGD operations. Saline water is used to minimize freshwater use, but generates large volumes of solid waste. The disposal of wastewater tailings in large ponds poses serious environmental threats, including seepage into groundwater and soil contamination. Efforts to manage the 1 billion cubic meters of tailings by 2020 are ongoing, with criteria established in 2005. Research by CONRAD focuses on tailings consolidation. The Canadian Oil Sands Network for Research and Development (CONRAD) is working on consolidating wastewater tailings, detoxifying tailings water ponds, and reprocessing tailings. Research is also being done on cleaning up and reclaiming tailings using bioremediation and electrocoagulation. The National Research Council of Canada (NRC) is researching ways to treat wastewater tailings and recover byproducts like residual bitumen, heavy metals, and fertilizers. A pilot project is sorting and recovering metals from tailings. Surface disturbance and land reclamation are major concerns in the oil sands industry, with operators responsible for restoring disturbed land. The Alberta Energy Utility Board directive has expanded the Upstream Oil and Gas Reclamation and Remediation Program. The Alberta Upstream Oil and Gas Reclamation and Remediation Program has expanded industry liability for reclaiming sites, requiring a site-specific liability assessment. The government of Alberta has established a Regional Sustainable Development Strategy to address regional cumulative environmental impacts. Oil sands industry is regulated under various acts at both provincial and federal levels. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 recognizes U.S. oil sands as strategically important. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 recognizes U.S. oil sands as strategically important for reducing dependence on foreign oil imports. It questions the appropriate federal investment for reaching energy policy goals and discusses the potential of U.S. oil sands compared to other unconventional fuels. The oil industry is investing in oil sands projects, particularly in Canada with its large reserves. U.S. oil sands may not be as attractive due to smaller reserves. Environmental and social issues like water usage and carbon emissions are concerns. Refinery and pipeline expansions are needed for Canadian oil sands development. The expansion of Canadian oil sands developments will have environmental impacts but could strengthen oil flow. This increased capacity may lead to more investment in Canada. Congress will face regulatory matters whether U.S. oil sands are developed. Oil imports from Canada are likely to rise, and permitting new refineries remains an issue balancing environmental concerns with energy security. Government involvement in oil sands development has been crucial during low oil prices, fostering a partnership for industry expansion. The expansion of the oil sands industry in Alberta over the last 100 years has been supported by ongoing R&D efforts, high oil prices, and favorable tax treatment. Planned pipeline and refinery expansions are underway to accommodate increased production. Despite favorable prospects, challenges such as water availability, waste disposal, air emissions, and infrastructure demands may slow expansion. U.S. markets will continue to be a major growth area for Canadian oil sands production. The commercial development of U.S. oil sands faces uncertainty due to high capital investment and a small resource base. Oil sands make up only 0.6% of U.S. fuel resources, while oil shale accounts for 25%."
