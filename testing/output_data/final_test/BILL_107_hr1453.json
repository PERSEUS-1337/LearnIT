    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Smokeless Tobacco Warning Label Act\" and amends the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 to include warning labels and advertising warnings for smokeless tobacco products. The \"Smokeless Tobacco Warning Label Act\" mandates warning labels on smokeless tobacco products sold in the US. Labels must include warnings about mouth cancer, gum disease, addiction, and cancer-causing chemicals. The warnings must cover 20% of the package's main display panel and include the word \"WARNING\" in capital letters. The label statements required by the \"Smokeless Tobacco Warning Label Act\" must include the word \"WARNING\" in capital letters and be clear, conspicuous, and legible. The warnings should contrast with other printed material on the package and be introduced into the distribution chain by tobacco product manufacturers, packagers, importers, distributors, or retailers. The Smokeless Tobacco Warning Label Act prohibits advertising smokeless tobacco products in the US without specific warning label statements. This applies to manufacturers, packagers, importers, distributors, and retailers. The Smokeless Tobacco Warning Label Act requires specific warning statements in smokeless tobacco advertising, including the word 'WARNING' in capital letters, comprising at least 15% of the advertisement area, and using clear and conspicuous type in contrasting colors with other printed material. The Smokeless Tobacco Warning Label Act mandates warning statements in smokeless tobacco advertising, with specific requirements for packaging and advertising display of the warnings. The Smokeless Tobacco Warning Label Act requires plans for displaying warning labels on smokeless tobacco products to be reviewed and approved by the Secretary and the Federal Trade Commission. Plans must ensure all required labels are displayed simultaneously and provide for equal distribution and rotation on packaging and in advertising. Advertising smokeless tobacco through electronic media is prohibited. It is illegal to advertise smokeless tobacco on electronic media under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to adjust smokeless tobacco product warning label statements to enhance public understanding of the associated risks."
