Special trade treatment, like SDT for developing countries, allows for preferential programs reducing tariffs to support export development strategies. The multilateral trading system, based on non-discrimination and the MFN principle of the GATT/WTO, aims to prevent protectionist policies. Special trade treatment, such as SDT for developing countries, allows for preferential programs that reduce tariffs to support export development strategies. Developing economies aim to diversify trade away from traditional commodity exports to attract more investment, create jobs, and achieve stability and growth. Developed countries have established unilateral trade preference programs, including the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and regional programs like the Andean Trade Preference Act (APTA). The regional programs, including the Andean Trade Preference Act (APTA), Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA), Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA), African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and Haitian Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act, offer more targeted and generous access to the U.S. market for eligible developing countries. These unilateral trade preference programs do not require reciprocal trade concessions and are periodically revised by Congress. Eligibility criteria vary by program, and beneficiary countries must meet certain requirements to qualify for duty-free U.S. market access. Preference programs, integral to U.S. trade and foreign policy, have varying requirements such as enhancing rule of law and supporting counternarcotics policies. Supporters include beneficiary countries, U.S. importers, and producers in joint production. Stakeholders opposed to these programs include U.S. manufacturers of competing products and some labor groups. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is a U.S. trade preference program established in 1974, providing duty-free status to imports from beneficiary developing countries and least-developed country beneficiaries. It currently benefits 128 countries and has received broad support in Congress, although some lawmakers have concerns about its design and operation. Labor groups and manufacturers of competing products are among the stakeholders with varying opinions on the program. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program provides duty-free status to imports from eligible developing countries, with conditions such as market access, worker rights, and support for U.S. policies. The Trade Policy Staff Committee oversees the program, and products must meet certain criteria to qualify for GSP status. The President can designate eligible products, but some categories like agricultural and textile goods face restrictions. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program provides duty-free status to imports from eligible developing countries, with conditions such as market access, worker rights, and support for U.S. policies. Eligible products are designated by the President, but some categories like agricultural and textile goods face restrictions. Countries may lose eligibility for certain products due to competitive need limitations (CNLs) if import thresholds are exceeded. Graduation from the GSP program can occur if a country becomes a \"high income\" nation. In 1983, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) was created to provide duty-free entry for select Caribbean exports in response to economic challenges in the region. The program was expanded in 1990 with the Caribbean Basin Economic Expansion Act (CBI II) and further extended in 2000 with the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA). The CBTPA, enacted in 2000, extended benefits to eligible Caribbean countries similar to NAFTA, including apparel goods with U.S. or Caribbean fabrics. The CAFTA-DR in 2006 shifted imports treatment to a reciprocal FTA, excluding Haiti. Haiti's exclusion was due to not being part of CAFTA-DR. The HOPE Act, including HOPE I, HOPE II, and the HELP Act, provided generous preferences to Haiti's apparel sector, allowing duty-free treatment for exports made from limited amounts of third-country fabrics. Eligibility criteria are based on GSP provisions, with UN monitoring of Haitian firms to ensure compliance. The United States extended duty treatment to imports from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia in the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) in 1991. It was renewed and expanded in 2002 with the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA), including additional products like petroleum, textiles, apparel, footwear, and tuna. Congress has provided short-term extensions since then, with the most recent in 2011. The U.S. extended duty treatment to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia under the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) in 1991. ATPA was renewed for Colombia and Ecuador until July 31, 2013, but Colombia was removed as a beneficiary country when the U.S.-Colombia free trade agreement took effect on May 15, 2012. Peru also has a free trade agreement with the U.S. and no longer receives trade preferences under ATPA. Bolivia's beneficiary status was terminated due to failure to meet eligibility criteria in December 2008. President George W. Bush suspended Bolivia's status as an ATPA beneficiary country for not cooperating in counternarcotics efforts, a decision later extended by President Barack Obama. Reinstating Bolivia requires congressional approval. ATPA aims to provide preferential duty treatment to promote economic growth and job creation as alternatives to drug trafficking. This is part of broader U.S. efforts in the Andean region, including drug crop eradication and counter-narcotics activities. The AGOA program, part of U.S. efforts to promote economic integration with sub-Saharan Africa, was extended until September 30, 2015. AGOA provides duty-free access for apparel assembled in lesser-developed SSA countries. AGOA provides special access for designated \"import sensitive\" textile and apparel products. It also offers technical assistance and trade capacity building through regional trade hubs in four African countries. 40 countries are eligible for AGOA benefits, subject to criteria including progress towards a market-based economy and respect for human rights. The GATT and WTO agreements emphasize non-discriminatory treatment of products from other Members. The GATT and WTO agreements emphasize non-discriminatory treatment of products from other Members, while special trade preferences for developing countries were established through the Enabling Clause in 1979. Developed countries like Canada, the European Union, Japan, and Australia also offer special trade preferences for developing nations. Some developed countries, including the European Union, Japan, and Australia, provide tariff concessions to developing nations. These preferences exempt eligible countries from duties on certain products, with variations in product coverage and treatment. For example, Australia offers a five percentage point margin of preference on products from beneficiary countries. The tariff is reduced by 5 percentage points for products of beneficiary countries. Preferential rates are zero when the GT rate is 5% or less. Developed countries offer regional preferences based on additional eligibility criteria like anti-corruption measures, environmental sustainability goals, and core worker rights provisions. The European Union provides duty-free access under the \"Everything But Arms\" preference and GSP+ for vulnerable countries. GSP+ beneficiaries must comply with 27 specified international conventions. In the WTO, developed and developing countries agreed to provide duty-free and quota-free market access for products from least-developed countries. The agreement is part of the Doha Round of trade negotiations and will not be implemented until the round is concluded. Stakeholders have varying responses to trade preferences. Many stakeholders, including beneficiary developing countries, producers, workers, and exporters, support trade preferences due to increased employment and economic growth. Concerns exist that if preferences are not renewed, countries like China would benefit. U.S. manufacturers importing products through trade preference programs also back these preferences, with some U.S. producers in industries like textiles and apparel utilizing them to stay competitive. Trade preferences benefit businesses through predictability in import contracts and investment decisions, reflecting economic development and foreign policy goals. Eligibility criteria incentivize beneficiary countries to support U.S. objectives such as worker rights and intellectual property rights enforcement. Regional preferences, like the Andean trade preference program, align with specific U.S. policy goals. Organized labor supports trade preferences for worker rights provisions. Labor generally supports trade preferences due to improvements in labor rights, but some workers may be negatively affected by increased imports. Stakeholders opposed to preference programs include U.S. manufacturers of competing products, like those in the textile and apparel industry. The goal of all preference programs is to promote export-driven growth in less developed countries, but they raise economic and political concerns. Preference programs in less developed countries raise economic and political issues, with key factors including targeting productive capacity, flexible rules of origin, managing domestic interests, and attracting foreign investment. Eligibility requirements and the possibility of preferences being unilaterally cut off also pose opportunity costs. The value of trade preferences lies in increasing exports from developing countries, particularly diversifying away from traditional commodities, with exporting countries benefiting from the preference margin. The preference margin, defined as the difference between MFN and preferential tariffs on exports, can contribute to export growth by reducing import costs in the United States. Evaluating the benefits of preference programs through export growth shows that U.S. imports under these programs were $78.4 billion in 2011, $78.4 billion in 2010, and $60.5 billion in 2009. Despite a rise to $78.5 billion in 2010, imports remained stable at $78.4 billion in 2011, with a significant drop in imports from all countries during the Great Recession. In 2009, U.S. imports under preference programs fell dramatically due to the Great Recession, with a key trend being the decline in U.S. consumption of petroleum products. The dramatic decline in AGOA-eligible imports in 2009, mainly petroleum products, highlights concerns about dependence on volatile commodity exports and the limited impact of preference programs on export diversification. Only 4% of $2.2 trillion in U.S. imports entered duty-free under preference programs in 2011, while 16% entered duty-free under free trade agreements. The majority of U.S. imports enter under most-favored-nation rates, with an average tariff rate of 3.5%. Preference margins are small, providing limited benefits to developing countries. Certain products like apparel offer greater benefits, while petroleum exports have smaller preference margins. Continuing to rely on petroleum exports does not promote economic diversification for development. Tariff preferences come with costs, such as extensive administrative procedures and rules of origin that diminish their use. Preferences may benefit U.S. importers more than exporters, leading to trade diversion and reduced production of competing goods in the importing country. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to beneficiary countries from preference programs increased significantly between 2000 and 2009, with GSP countries receiving over $350 billion in FDI in 2008. AGOA countries also saw steady FDI growth during this period. AGOA countries and ATPA countries experienced slow but steady FDI growth from 2000 to 2008. FDI flows to Latin American and Caribbean beneficiaries of CBERA and CBTPA remained stable. Total U.S. imports from GSP-eligible countries increased significantly over an eleven-year period. The GSP program affects a small portion of developing country exports due to restrictions on key exports like textiles and apparel. The impact of Caribbean programs on economic development varied depending on their structure. The original CBERA program had limited incentives for major exports like apparel. However, the CBTPA, passed in 2000, provided duty-free treatment for apparel, leading to a significant increase in U.S. imports from Central America. Despite this growth, U.S. imports of apparel under CBTPA eventually decreased as a percentage of total apparel imports. U.S. imports of apparel under CBTPA decreased as a percentage of total apparel imports, indicating the limits of preferential tariff treatment in a competitive global market. With the implementation of CAFTA-DR, apparel concessions shifted to the free trade agreement, reducing exports under CBTPA. The total amount of U.S. merchandise imports under CBERA and CBTPA now only account for 0.5% of total U.S. imports, with only 0.15% entering duty-free. Three-quarters of these imports are energy-related products from Trinidad and Tobago. The Haiti HOPE I Act saw minimal use due to complex rules of origin. The passage discusses the evolution of preference programs for textiles and apparel, highlighting the changes made to make them more flexible and widely used. The preferences for Haitian products were enhanced in the HELP Act of 2010, leading to an increase in imports from Haiti. The impact of the ATPA on the economies of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru has been small but positive. The ATPA has had a positive impact on job opportunities in the flower and asparagus industries in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. After including textile and apparel articles, these countries saw growth in output and employment, especially in Peru and Colombia. The textile and apparel sectors have provided legitimate economic activity and employment in the Andean regions. Concerns have been raised about losing ATPA preferences due to the importance of the US export market. The removal of Bolivia as a beneficiary has affected long-term investment and FDI in the country. Investment in Bolivia has contributed to volatility in FDI flows and potential ATPA-related investment. AGOA preferences, along with macroeconomic reforms, have positively impacted economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the footwear industry. African exports remain less diversified, making economies vulnerable to external shocks from reliance on primary commodity exports like oil. The question arises whether preferences help countries exploit comparative advantages in trade or artificially induce investment in uncompetitive industries. Preferences such as the GSP and ATPA programs have supported comparative advantage in emerging markets like India and Brazil, leading to expansion in international markets. For example, India's high utilization of the GSP program has boosted jewelry exports, while the ATPA program has contributed to the growth of the flower industry in Colombia and Ecuador. These preferences have also helped developing countries diversify their exports, particularly in the apparel sector. Trade preference programs, like AGOA, aim to expand export diversification in developing countries by providing flexible rules of origin for apparel goods. However, supply constraints and difficult business environments can hinder the benefits of tariff preferences. USTR officials claim that AGOA is helping to diversify trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa. These programs may not help poor countries achieve development goals without a shift towards exporting non-primary goods. According to a 2009 report, U.S. imports under AGOA are diversifying, with growth in jewelry, fruit products, plastic products, and cocoa paste. However, the program's heavy reliance on oil and petroleum products hinders Africa's economic development. Aid may be needed to help African countries fully benefit from trade preferences and reconsider program incentives. The diminishing preference margin due to decreasing tariff levels in trade agreements, especially affecting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) participating in preference programs. LDCs may be disincentivized to support trade liberalization if it reduces the benefits of their preference programs, particularly impacting apparel-producing countries like Cape Verde, Haiti, Malawi, Mauritania, and Sao Tome and Principe. Since the 1994 Uruguay Round, preference erosion has increased due to bilateral and regional trade agreements and the 2005 WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. Developing countries view the Doha Round as a continuation of this trend, with preference benefits decreasing. While preference erosion is small compared to the benefits of MFN trade liberalization, it can be costly for certain countries. U.S. preference programs are utilized mainly by a few countries, with the top 25 beneficiaries accounting for 95% of imports. Some debate surrounds the design of U.S. preference programs, focusing on broadening their use, especially by less developed countries lacking energy exports or apparel manufacturing capabilities. Countries with preferential access to developed economies aim to maintain this advantage, while large developing nations lobby to protect their benefits. AGOA beneficiaries are concerned about potential changes that could affect their duty-free, quota-free access. Some beneficiaries are worried that extending duty-free, quota-free access to all LDCs may harm Africa's apparel industries by increasing competition with countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia. There are debates on overhauling preference programs to graduate advanced developing countries like India and Brazil from the GSP. Critics suggest focusing preference programs on the poorest developing countries and addressing the opportunity costs of eligibility criteria. The United States acknowledges foreign policy concerns in their preference programs, which some argue politicizes trade. There are costs to the recipient country, including increased competition for domestic industries from lower-cost imports. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) protects U.S. import-competing manufacturers through various means, such as designating some products as \"import sensitive\" and ineligible for duty-free treatment. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) protects U.S. import-competing manufacturers by designating some products as \"import sensitive\" and ineligible for duty-free treatment. Competitive need limits are triggered if imports of a product reach a certain threshold, and U.S. producers can petition for GSP treatment to be withdrawn. Regional programs include preferences for additional \"import-sensitive\" products like textiles and apparel, but measures are in place to mitigate negative effects on U.S. producers. For example, rules of origin are carefully written to minimize impacts on domestic producers. AGOA preference requires no more than 10% of fiber and yarns in a product to originate outside AGOA beneficiary countries or the U.S. Some U.S. apparel producers benefit from integrated production chains with Central America and the Caribbean, reducing costs compared to global competitors like China. This has helped U.S. producers maintain market share post-WTO Agreement expiration in 2005. U.S. manufacturers using imported inputs also benefit from lower costs under preference programs. U.S. demand for products like jewelry, leather, and aluminum is strong. U.S. demand for jewelry, leather, and aluminum is significant. Consumers benefit from lower prices of duty-free imported products under preference programs. Some injury to U.S. producers occurs, such as displacement of growers of certain products. Losses in tariff revenues are relatively small, with estimated revenue loss from GSP provision in P.L. 112-40 at $980 million in FY2010 and $503 million in FY2011. The impact of preference programs on the U.S. economy is relatively small, with imports under the GSP program in 2011 totaling about $19 billion compared to total U.S. imports of $2.2 trillion. Imports from all preference programs only made up about 4% of all U.S. trade in 2011. The debate in Congress over trade preferences includes viewpoints on leaving the programs as they are or revising them to address specific issues like compliance with eligibility criteria and the role preferences play in trade negotiations. Policy discussions on preference programs focus on renewal period, harmonization, country and product coverage, and eligibility criteria. These programs are time-limited and require Congressional reauthorization. Program beneficiaries advocate for continued support to establish a predictable trade environment for long-term investment. Extended preference horizons support stable sourcing relationships, improved working environments, and long-term investment. Investors are more likely to commit when preferences are not subject to short-term extensions, reducing uncertainty in business planning. The 111th Congress extended some preference programs, but some Members believe renewal should be conditioned on other program changes. The 112th Congress extended three trade preference programs: GSP, ATPA, and AGOA, with different expiration dates. The focus has been on reviewing and potentially simplifying these programs. The 112th Congress extended trade preference programs like GSP, ATPA, and AGOA with different expiration dates. Efforts are being made to simplify and harmonize program features such as eligibility criteria and rules of origin, which could be challenging due to the complexity of rules. Harmonization is seen as crucial for efficient program operation and customs officials' work at the U.S. border. Trade capacity building (TCB) is also important for improving capability. Trade capacity building (TCB) is crucial for improving the competitiveness of the textile and apparel industry in sub-Saharan Africa. Congress designates which countries are eligible to receive preference programs like AGOA, with the President having the authority to determine country eligibility based on specific criteria. Congress can expand or contract country coverage at any time. Congress has the power to expand or limit country coverage for trade preference programs. Some bills aim to restrict Vietnam from receiving GSP status due to worker rights issues. There are debates on whether trade preferences should focus only on LDCs in need. New preference programs may be created to include LDCs not covered in existing programs like AGOA. Bills in Congress propose a new trade preference program for duty-free treatment of apparel from the Philippines. Other bills propose trade preferences, such as creating a new program for selected Asian and South Pacific countries. Options include reducing coverage for advanced developing nations or requiring more reciprocity. Mandatory country \"graduation\" could limit participants, based on income criteria or a comprehensive review of industries and economy. Importers and NGOs suggest amending preference programs. Some importers and NGOs advocate amending preference program eligibility criteria to be clear and achievable. Differences exist in criteria selection, with objections to intellectual property protection requirements. Business proponents support including such criteria to preserve product value. Alternatives include adding incentives beyond tariff reductions or creating a new program for countries meeting additional U.S. objectives, similar to the EU's \"GSP-plus\" program. The European Union has a \"GSP-plus\" program for vulnerable developing countries that have ratified core international conventions. Congress could re-evaluate product coverage in preference programs. Some products are deemed \"import-sensitive\" in GSP. AGOA provides broad access for textiles and apparel products. The AGOA program offers broad access for textiles and apparel products, with some restrictions in place. Congress may consider expanding product coverage in preference programs and implementing caps on preferential access to protect import-competing U.S. industries. Congress could consider implementing tariff reductions for certain import-sensitive products in preference programs, similar to the Australian GSP program. Preferences also vary in terms of cumulation, allowing inputs from multiple beneficiary countries to be combined for substantial transformation. For example, apparel articles under the ATPA can be sewn or assembled in multiple beneficiary countries or the United States. The Haiti HOPE Act provisions allow for regional cumulation and limited use of third-party materials to meet the value-added requirement for preferential access. Congress could modify these provisions to include a greater or lesser percentage of inputs from other beneficiary countries, or permit a larger percentage of third-party inputs. The 111th Congress considered amending trade preference programs to harmonize preferences provisions and ensure effective assistance to developing countries. Program design is crucial for serving countries in need effectively. Evaluating complex programs like GSP and ATPA is challenging. The 113th Congress may consider renewing these programs and trade preference reform options. Eligible countries and products for preference programs are listed in Appendix A."
