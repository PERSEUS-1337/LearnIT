    "content": "The \"Parental Consent Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title. The Act includes findings. The Congress finds that the USPSTF and Canadian Preventive Services Task Force recommend against screening for suicide, citing limited evidence on the accuracy of screening tools. The Surgeon General's 1999 report acknowledged conflicts in defining mental health and illness. The challenge of defining mental health has hindered the development of mental health programs. A 2005 report highlighted problems in infant mental health screening, including lack of baseline, agreement on diagnosis, defined criteria for referrals, and longitudinal outcome studies. The lack of longitudinal outcome studies in infant mental health screening hinders appropriate assessment and treatment, which requires input from multiple informants. Broad parameters for determining socioemotional outcomes are not clearly defined, with a focus on school readiness. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual acknowledges the vagueness of diagnostic criteria for mental illness. Efforts to standardize behavioral characteristics in DSM-IV remain subjective. Psychiatric diagnosis subjectivity can lead to labeling political disagreements as mental disorders. There are discussions to include \"extreme intolerance\" as a diagnosis in the DSM, with prisoners in California being medicated for it. (7) A school violence prevention program suggests that children with traditional values may instigate violence. (8) The 1998 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference stated that further research is needed to establish ADHD as a brain disorder, similar to other psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. The prescription rates of psychiatric drugs in children have significantly increased, with over 2.5 million children receiving antipsychotic medication and 2.2 million children on multiple psychotropic drugs simultaneously. More money was spent on psychiatric drugs for children than on antibiotics or asthma medication in 2003. In 2003, a FDA hearing revealed that most studies on antidepressants for depressed children were no more effective than placebos, with only positive trials being published by the pharmaceutical industry. The FDA has been aware of the lack of effectiveness of antidepressants in pediatric populations since at least 2000. The FDA issued Black Box Warnings in 2004 for newer antidepressants due to their link to suicidal thoughts in children. A review by Columbia University in 2006 confirmed the association between antidepressant use in children and suicide attempts. The FDA received over 2000 reports of completed suicides from 1987 to 1995 related to Prozac alone, which is just a fraction of the actual number. Other possible side effects of psychiatric medications in children include mania, violence, dependence, weight gain, insomnia, cardiac toxicity, growth suppression, psychosis, and diabetes. Parents are being pressured to put their children on psychiatric medications, leading to some children dying. The President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health recommends universal mental health screening and treatments, but some families have faced child abuse charges for refusing psychiatric medications. The United States Supreme Court has affirmed parents' right to direct their children's upbringing, which is violated by mandatory mental health screening. Federal funds should not support programs that could lead to over-medication, stigmatization, or invasion of privacy through mandatory mental health screening without consent. Prohibition against federal funding of universal or mandatory mental health screening. Prohibition against federal funding for universal or mandatory mental health screening programs, including refusal to consent as a basis for child abuse or education neglect charges. The program refers to any mental health screening program that automatically screens individuals without prior indication of need for treatment. It includes State incentive grants, student mental health screening programs, and grants for specific initiatives like TeenScreen. The program allows mental health screening of individuals under 18 years of age without parental consent."
