    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that California spends significantly more on health and human services than on education, despite persistent poverty. They emphasize the need to invest in programs that lift people out of poverty. Article 3.7 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code to address these issues. The State Department of Social Services, in consultation with the County Welfare Directors Association of California, will implement a five-year pilot project providing monetary grants to organizations assisting CalWORKs recipients achieve economic independence by July 1, 2017. The project includes a competitive grant review process and methodology for determining grant amounts. Develop eligibility requirements for organizations seeking a grant, including elements specified in subdivision (d). The requirements do not impact individual eligibility for CalWORKs benefits. Implement an ongoing evaluation of grant-funded organizations to assess their effectiveness in teaching participants skills for economic independence, including completion rates and educational background of participants. The program evaluation criteria include high school diploma attainment, nonsubsidized employment, academic stability for children, CalWORKs benefits status, average income at program completion, family reunification, and periodic progress reports. The department may partner with academic institutions or entities for program evaluation. Organizations seeking grants must include education, mental health, employment, financial, parenting, life skills training, and child care services in their programs. The requirements for organizations seeking grant funding include parenting skills training, life skills training, child care services, criminal record clearance, a clean and sober environment, comprehensive case management, long-term monitoring of participants, and trauma-informed social work. If an organization serves only pregnant women, they are not required to provide child care services. The grant funds can be used for housing, transportation, and child care expenses for program participants. Organizations can set their own eligibility criteria as long as they align with the project goals and do not affect CalWORKs benefits eligibility. Organizations receiving grant funding must coordinate their programs with CalWORKs requirements and participation is voluntary. A report evaluating program effectiveness must be submitted by December 31, 2021, without revealing any participant's identity. The report evaluating program effectiveness must be submitted by December 31, 2021, in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code. A sum of fifty million dollars is appropriated to the State Department of Social Services for funding the pilot program."
