    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Promoting Health Care Purchasing Cooperatives Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The \"Promoting Health Care Purchasing Cooperatives Act\" outlines findings on health care spending, uninsured population, premium increases, and the effectiveness of purchasing cooperatives in managing costs and quality of employer-sponsored health plans. The Act aims to enhance quality improvements in healthcare, promote employee healthcare consumerism, and build on successful local employer-led health insurance initiatives. There are over 90 employer-led coalitions in the US collectively purchasing healthcare and sharing information on quality. Grants are provided to self-insured businesses to establish health care cooperatives. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can award grants to eligible groups for developing health care purchasing cooperatives. Eligible groups are defined as consortia of two or more self-insured employers responsible for their own health insurance risk pool. An eligible entity can apply for a grant to conduct a feasibility study for establishing a health care purchasing cooperative. Individual employers in the eligible group cannot transfer insurance risk to the group. The application must be submitted to the Secretary with required information. The Secretary approves applications for a feasibility study on a health insurance purchasing cooperative. After completion, an eligible group must submit a report to the Secretary. Criteria for the grant include pooling purchasing power and providing data to employers. After a feasibility study on a health insurance purchasing cooperative, eligible groups can apply for a grant from the Secretary based on criteria such as pooling purchasing power, providing data to employers, driving quality improvement, promoting healthcare consumerism, and meeting additional criteria determined by the Secretary. An eligible group awarded a grant under subsection (a) shall establish or expand a nonprofit health insurance purchasing cooperative that is democratically governed by member-employers and exists solely to serve its membership base. The cooperative must have a democratically elected board of directors and accept new members based on specific criteria determined by the Secretary. The grant recipients must assist cooperative members in pooling health insurance purchasing power, provide data for informed decision-making, enhance quality improvement, promote consumerism, and conduct other activities as determined by the Secretary. Reviews are conducted annually after grant awards. The Secretary will study programs funded by grants every 2 years and provide Congress with progress reports on improving employee access to quality health insurance. Sliding scale funding will be used to ensure grant-funded programs are self-sufficient within 10 years. Authorization of appropriations up to $60,000,000 for fiscal years 2003 through 2012 from administrative funds provided to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to carry out this Act."
