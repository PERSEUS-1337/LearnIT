    "content": "The report provides an overview of FY2015 appropriations for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) accounts, as well as enacted FY2014 appropriations. The amounts reflect new appropriations and do not include rescissions or scorekeeping adjustments. FY2014-enacted amounts were taken from a joint explanatory statement, while FY2015 requested amounts were from a report accompanying H.R. 4660. The FY2015 House-passed amounts were from the text of H.R. 4660. The FY2015 CJS appropriations act provides funding for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, including agencies like the Census Bureau, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, NOAA, and NIST. The Department of Justice receives funding for agencies such as the FBI, Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Marshals, and DEA. The FY2015 CJS appropriations act provides funding for various agencies including the FBI, Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Marshals, DEA, and other science agencies like NASA and NSF. The Department of Commerce's mission is to promote job creation, economic growth, and sustainable development through partnerships with businesses, universities, and communities. The Department of Commerce focuses on development, technology, entrepreneurship, business growth, and environmental monitoring. It opens new markets for U.S. goods, invests in research for innovation, manages natural resources, conducts the decennial census, and operates the national patent system. The Department of Justice enforces the law, defends U.S. interests, ensures public safety, and provides federal leadership. The Department of Justice (DOJ) enforces federal laws, prosecutes individuals accused of violating laws, and represents the U.S. Government in court. It provides legal advice to the President and executive branch department heads, investigates organized crime, illegal drugs, and gun violations, and protects the federal judiciary through agencies like the FBI and DEA. The DOJ, through the U.S. Marshals Service, protects the federal judiciary, apprehends fugitives, and detains individuals not granted pretrial release. It incarcerates those convicted of violating federal laws. NASA conducts civilian space and aeronautics activities with four mission directorates: Human Exploration and Operations, Science, and Space Technology. The Space Technology Mission Directorate and Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate develop new technologies for future space missions and aircraft systems. The Office of Education manages education programs, while the National Science Foundation supports basic research and education in non-medical sciences and engineering. Established in 1950, the NSF promotes science progress and is a key source of federal support for U.S. university research. The CJS act is responsible for federal STEM education programs and student aid. Nominal appropriations increased from FY2005 to FY2010 but have declined since then. Adjusted for inflation, FY2013 and FY2014 appropriations were similar to FY2005 levels. Appropriations for CJS between FY2005 and FY2008 were generally in line with inflation. Total appropriations for CJS by major component show increases over FY2005-FY2014. Since FY2010, total appropriations for the Department of Commerce, DOJ, and NASA have been around $60 billion, with exceptions in FY2013 due to sequestration. Decreased appropriations for the Department of Commerce explain the overall decrease in CJS appropriations, with cuts also seen in funding for DOJ and NASA. DOJ's FY2014 appropriation is 1.9% below its FY2010 appropriation, while NASA's FY2014 appropriation is 5.8% below its FY2010 appropriation. Recent reductions to NASA's appropriation have aligned it more with FY2005 levels. Congress still appropriated $6.883 billion for DOJ despite recent cuts. Despite recent cuts to DOJ's appropriation, Congress still allocated $6.883 billion more for DOJ in FY2014 compared to FY2005. This increase was due to growing funding for federal law enforcement and counter-terrorism efforts. For FY2015, the Administration requested $62.397 billion for agencies funded under the CJS bill, which was $774.4 million more than the FY2014 appropriation. The request included $8.746 billion for the Department of Commerce, $27.974 billion for DOJ, $24.721 billion for science agencies, and $956.1 million for related purposes. President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, providing $61.623 billion for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.

The Administration's FY2015 request for Legal Activities included nearly $935.9 million, 7.9% higher than FY2014. The House-passed bill proposed $884.1 million, 2.0% more than FY2014 but 5.5% below the Administration's request. The Senate Committee recommended $915.0 million, 5.5% more than FY2014 and 2.2% below the Administration's request. The FY2015 enacted amount is $885.0 million, 2.1% more than FY2014, 5.4% below the Administration's request, and 3.3% below the Senate Committee's recommendation. The Administration also proposed a $2.6 million increase for the criminal division for 25 new positions. The Administration requested a $2.6 million increase for the criminal division to combat cybercrime, including 25 new positions. Additionally, they sought a $19.6 million increase for MLAT reform efforts to address delays in obtaining evidence for criminal investigations. The Administration is concerned about delays in processing MLAT requests, which could impact U.S. law enforcement and foreign cooperation. The requested funding would centralize MLAT request handling, clear backlogs, and improve technological resources. The FY2015 budget did not include additional funding for these activities. The President's FY2015 budget request for the U.S. Attorneys included $1.955 billion, with a focus on the \"Smart on Crime Initiative\" to reduce recidivism. Additionally, $1.3 million was allocated for MLAT reform to enhance law enforcement partnerships, especially in cyber security. The House-passed bill proposed $1.971 billion for FY2015, while the Senate-committee reported bill included $1.950 billion for the U.S. Attorneys. The FY2015 appropriation for the U.S. Attorneys is $1.960 billion, slightly higher than the FY2014 appropriation and the Administration's request. Congress provided funding to enhance MLAT processing and backlog reduction. Other Legal Activities include the Antitrust Division and the U.S. Trustee System Fund for maintaining the integrity of the U.S. bankruptcy system. The FY2015 appropriation for Other Legal Activities was nearly $375.2 million, slightly less than the Administration's request but more than the FY2014 enacted amount. This account includes various legal entities such as the U.S. Trustee System Fund and the Antitrust Division. The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) received $2.728 billion in FY2014, with $1.185 billion for Salaries and Expenses and $1.533 billion for Federal Prisoner Detention. The Administration requested $2.790 billion for FY2015, a 2.3% increase, with $1.595 billion for USMS. The Administration requested $1.595 billion for the Federal Prisoner Detention account to cover increased costs of federal detention population. The House-passed bill allocated $2.804 billion for the USMS, with $1.199 billion for S&E account and $1.595 billion for Federal Prisoner Detention, slightly higher than the Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported bill included $2.790 billion for the USMS, with $1.185 billion for the S&E account and $1.595 billion for the Federal Prisoner Detention account. The FY2015 appropriation for the USMS is $1.700 billion, which is significantly lower than previous appropriations and requests. The FY2015 budget for the US Marshals Service (USMS) is $2.800 billion, with $1.100 billion transferred from the DOJ's Assets Forfeiture account to the Federal Prisoner Detention account. Congress debated whether the USMS has enough resources for its expanded mission, including assisting with apprehending fugitives, federal terrorism-related prosecutions, and high-level security demands. The US Marshals Service (USMS) budget for FY2015 is $2.8 billion, with $1.1 billion transferred from DOJ's Assets Forfeiture account to the Federal Prisoner Detention account. Congress provided a 0.8% increase in the USMS's S&E account. The National Security Division (NSD) coordinates DOJ's national security and terrorism missions through law enforcement investigations and prosecutions, established in response to the recommendations of the WMD Commission. The National Security Division (NSD) was established under the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 to coordinate intelligence-related resources and share criminal intelligence information. The FY2015 appropriation for the NSD was $93.0 million, a 1.3% increase from FY2014. The National Security Division (NSD) received a $93.0 million appropriation for FY2015, a 1.3% increase from FY2014. The Interagency Law Enforcement account reimburses departmental agencies for their participation in the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) program, which combines federal agencies with state and local law enforcement to disrupt narcotics-trafficking organizations. The Interagency Law Enforcement account funding for FY2015 was $507.2 million, slightly lower than FY2014 but higher than the Administration's request and Senate Committee recommendation. The FBI is involved in OCDETF along with other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. The FBI, as the lead federal investigative agency, focuses on defending the country against terrorist threats and enforcing federal laws. Since 9/11, the FBI has prioritized preventing terrorism. Congress has significantly increased funding for the FBI from $3.32 billion in FY2001 to $8.44 billion in FY2015. The House-passed bill for FY2015 allocated $8.468 billion to the FBI, 1.5% more than FY2014 and 1.4% more than the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $8.385 billion for the FBI for FY2015, which was 0.5% more than the FY2014 enacted amount and the Administration's request. P.L. 113-235 provided $8.437 billion for the FBI, an amount 1.1% greater than both the FY2014 enacted amount and the President's request. Additionally, P.L. 113-235 included funding for completing a review of the FBI's implementation of the 9/11 Commission recommendations and specified funding for the Nation Gang Intelligence Center to coordinate intelligence on human trafficking. The Administration's request included an increase of $15 million for the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC) facility in Alabama, but Congress did not provide this increase. Instead, Congress directed the Department of Justice (DOJ) to designate a single entity to lead the Counter IED effort and report to Congress within 30 days. DOJ was also asked to describe efforts to prevent duplication and ensure coordination. Additionally, Congress instructed the FBI to prioritize financial and mortgage fraud investigations at FY2014 levels. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is the only single-mission agency mentioned. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) enforces controlled substance laws to reduce drug availability and abuse. They disrupt drug trafficking and money laundering organizations, facing challenges in limiting illicit drug supply and reducing trafficking from Mexico. DEA plays a key role in the Southwest Border Initiative to counter drug-related border violence and terrorism. DEA is also active in combating Prescription Drug Abuse. The DEA plays a crucial role in enforcing controlled substance laws and combating drug trafficking. They target improper prescribing practices and promote proper disposal of unused prescription drugs. The DEA's budget for FY2015 was $2.033 billion, a slight increase from previous years. They also address the rise in heroin abuse in the United States. The Administration did not request additional funding to address the recent rise in heroin abuse in the United States. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concern over prescription drug and heroin abuse, directing the DEA to report on ways to address the issue. Congress enacted language in the FY2015 Appropriations Act to prevent federal interference with state medical marijuana laws. The FY2015 Appropriations Act includes language preventing federal interference with state medical marijuana laws and prohibits the use of funds for industrial hemp research in contravention of the Agricultural Act of 2014. The ATF enforces federal criminal law related to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives, working independently and through partnerships to investigate and reduce crime. Congress has increased ATF's direct appropriation from $771.0 million to $1.201 billion for FY2015. The ATF's budget for FY2015 has increased to $1.201 billion, a 1.9% increase over FY2014. This increase is intended to improve firearms enforcement and regulatory efforts. The House-passed bill initially proposed $1.114 billion for ATF, which was 5.5% less than the previous year's appropriation. The Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed concern about ATF's FY2014 appropriation, specifically regarding a missing briefing and report on gun law enforcement allocations. They also highlighted increasing processing times for applications under the NFA and GCA. The Senate-reported bill would have allocated a similar amount to ATF as requested for FY2015, supporting efforts to enforce firearms laws and combat weapons trafficking on the Southwest border. The Senate report language directs ATF to enforce firearms laws and combat weapons trafficking on the Southwest border. It also calls for reporting on efforts to submit ballistics evidence to NIBIN and allocates $4.0 million for the National Center for Explosives Training and Research. The ATF budget decision units were reduced from three to two in the FY2015 budget request. The FY2015 budget request for ATF allocated funds to different decision units, including Law Enforcement Operations and Investigative Support Services. This new budget alignment may complicate Congress's ability to determine ATF's priorities. The House-passed bill included gun control provisions related to ATF operations, such as prohibiting federal agents from facilitating firearm transfers to individuals associated with drug cartels. The Senate-reported bill included provisions on monitoring firearms, exporting firearm parts to Canada, importing \"curios or relics\" firearms, and preventing new restrictions on shotgun imports. The House-passed bill included language to make certain provisions permanent law. The Senate confirmed B. Todd Jones as ATF's Director in 2013, ending a period of multiple acting directors. ATF faced oversight for gun trafficking operations like Fast and Furious. The Bureau of Prisons was established in 1930 to house federal inmates and ensure centralized administration of the federal prison system. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was established in 1930 to manage federal prisons and provide work and self-improvement opportunities for inmates. The BOP operates 119 correctional facilities and contracts with Residential Re-entry Centers to assist inmates nearing release. Congress funds the BOP through two accounts: Salaries and Expenses (S&E) and Buildings and Facilities (B&F). The Salaries and Expenses (S&E) account funds the daily operations and care of federal inmates, while the Buildings and Facilities (B&F) account funds construction and maintenance of facilities. Congress also sets a cap on Federal Prison Industries' revenue for administrative expenses. The BOP received $6.862 billion in total funding. The BOP received $6.862 billion for FY2014, with the majority for the S&E account. For FY2015, the Administration requested $6.897 billion, mainly for the S&E account to cover increased costs related to managing a growing federal prison population. No additional FTEs were requested for FY2015. The BOP did not request additional FTEs for FY2015. The House-passed bill allocated $6.973 billion for the BOP, 1.6% more than FY2014. The Senate Committee recommended $6.912 billion, with $6.804 billion for the S&E account. The FY2015 appropriation for the BOP is $6.924 billion, 0.9% more than FY2014. The BOP's appropriation for FY2015 is 0.9% greater than FY2014, 0.4% more than the FY2015 request, 0.7% less than the House-passed amount, and 0.2% more than the Senate Committee's recommendation. The BOP faces challenges with managing the growing federal prison population and overcrowding, with estimates showing operations at 41% over capacity by FY2019. Despite these issues, the Administration did not request additional funding to address overcrowding. The Administration did not request funding for new prison construction or additional contract bedspace in FY2015. Congress allocated $106.0 million for the B&F account, a 17.8% increase from FY2014. The federal prison population growth has led to overcrowding and strained the BOP's ability to manage inmates. Staff-to-inmate ratio increased from 3.6 to 1 in FY1997 to 4.8 to 1 in FY2013. The BOP has dedicated more resources to inmate care and programming. The BOP is required to provide residential drug abuse treatment to eligible inmates, with successful completion potentially reducing their sentence by up to one year. Due to limited capacity, inmates currently receive an average reduction of 10 months. The BOP's budget request aims to expand the program to treat all eligible inmates and extend sentence reductions to the full 12 months allowed by statute. The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) administers programs under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) to improve criminal justice responses to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. In FY2014, OVW received $417.0 million, with a proposed increase to $422.5 million in FY2015. The budget request includes funding increases for various programs and a decrease for Research and Evaluation of Violence Against Women. The House recommended $429.5 million for OVW, a 3.0% increase from FY2014. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $430.0 million, a 3.1% increase. P.L. 113-235 includes $430.0 million for OVW, with a focus on improving grant funding execution and efficiency, particularly for the Rural Domestic Violence Grant Program. Congress requested a report on OVW's efforts to raise awareness of the program in rural areas. The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) manages various grant programs with a budget of $1.643 billion in FY2014. In FY2015, the Administration requested $1.567 billion, while H.R. 4660 proposed $1.722 billion for OJP. The Senate committee's bill included $1.609 billion for OJP. Congress requested a report on OVW's efforts to raise awareness in rural communities. The FY2015 appropriation for OJP is $1.691 billion, 2.9% above FY2014, 8.6% greater than the Administration's request, 1.8% less than the House-passed amount, and 5.1% more than the Senate Committee's recommendation. The Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account funds the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Institute of Justice. The Administration requested $136.9 million, 14.1% more than FY2014. The House-passed bill proposed $120.0 million, the same as FY2014, and 12.3% less than the Administration's request. The FY2015 appropriation for the Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account was $111.0 million, which is 7.5% less than FY2014, 18.9% less than the Administration's request, and 3.5% below the Senate committee-reported amount. This account includes funding for various grant programs to improve state, local, and tribal criminal justice systems. The S&LLEA account includes various grant programs such as the JAG program, Drug Courts program, SCAAP, and DNA backlog reduction grants. The FY2015 appropriation for this account was $1.241 billion, which is 5.9% greater than FY2014 and 20.1% greater than the Administration's request. The FY2015 appropriation for the S&LLEA account is 5.9% greater than FY2014, 20.1% greater than the Administration's request. The Administration proposed to eliminate the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), which provides reimbursement for incarcerating illegal aliens with felony or misdemeanor convictions. The program was criticized for not promoting correctional reforms or reducing correction costs. The Administration's proposal to eliminate the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) was not accepted by Congress, who provided $185.0 million for SCAAP for FY2015. Funding for drug and mental health courts was not consolidated into a \"problem solving justice\" program as proposed by the Administration. Instead, Congress allocated funding for individual problem-solving court programs, including $8.5 million for mental health courts, $4.0 million for drug courts, and $5.0 million for veterans' treatment courts for FY2015. For FY2015, the Administration requested $35.0 million for the Community Teams program to reduce the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Backlog and improve investigations. The funding could be used for various purposes such as supporting law enforcement, assessing investigation practices, developing evidence-tracking systems, and enhancing resources for investigative and prosecutorial needs in sexual assault cases. The Community Teams program aims to address sexual assault issues by funding initiatives such as sexual assault testing, cold case units, law enforcement training on trauma, victim notification procedures, and victim services. The House recommends $41.0 million for this program, with a focus on preventing sexual assault and improving the system's response to victims. In FY2015, the Administration requested $147.0 million for grants to support the \"Now is the Time\" initiative, focusing on reducing gun violence. This included funding for programs like VALOR, comprehensive school safety, NICS Act Record Improvement, and National Criminal History Improvement. Congress allocated funds for VALOR and school safety programs, as well as for a National Instant Criminal Background Check System Initiative. The Administration requested funding for drug courts, Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) program, and prescription drug monitoring programs. Congress provided funding for RSAT and prescription drug monitoring programs in the Juvenile Justice Programs account. The FY2014 enacted appropriation for juvenile justice programs was $254.5 million. The Administration's FY2015 request included $299.4 million, a 17.6% increase. Funding for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Program was eliminated in FY2014 but would have been reinstated in FY2015. The House-passed bill proposed $223.5 million, 12.2% less than FY2014. The Senate Committee recommended $257.5 million, 1.2% more than FY2014 and 14% less than the Administration's request. The FY2015 enacted funding for juvenile justice programs is $251.5 million, which is 1.2% less than FY2014, 16.0% less than the Administration's request, and 12.5% more than the House-passed amount. The Public Safety Officers Benefits (PSOB) program provides benefits to public safety officers and their survivors for death, disability, and education. The FY2014-enacted appropriation for PSOB was $97.3 million. The FY2015 appropriation for PSOB was $87.3 million, which was 10.3% below the FY2014 appropriation. The COPS program received $214.0 million for FY2014, with a proposed increase of $60.0 million for FY2015. The FY2015 appropriation for the COPS program was $208.0 million, which was 2.8% less than the FY2014 appropriation and 24.1% less than the FY2015 request. The House-passed bill included $209.5 million for COPS, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $224.0 million. The FY2015 CJS appropriations act does not include language allowing funds for hiring non-sworn law enforcement personnel. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) was established by the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-473, VOCA) and provides funding for victim compensation and assistance programs. In FY2014, the obligation cap on the CVF was $745.0 million, with the FY2015 Budget Request seeking to raise it to $810.0 million. The House recommended $770.0 million, 3.4% more than FY2014 but 4.9% less than the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $775.0 million for the CVF cap for FY2015, which was 4.0% higher than the FY2014 enacted amount and 4.1% lower than the Administration's FY2015 request. The FY2015 enacted amount for the CVF cap is $2.361 billion, a 216.9% increase over the FY2014 enacted amount and 191.5% higher than the Administration's request. The Administration proposed an increase for the Crime Victims Fund to enhance victim programs, support human trafficking victims, and implement strategies outlined in the Vision 21 report. The House Committee on Appropriations reported that OVC may implement Vision 21 within available resources. Congress significantly increased the CVF cap, which currently has a balance of nearly $13 billion. The increase in CVF funds will be distributed to crime victims programs according to a formula established by VOCA. The Science Agencies received $24.824 billion under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, and the Administration requested $24.721 billion for FY2015. The House Committee on Appropriations reported that OVC may implement Vision 21 within available resources. Congress increased the CVF cap to nearly $13 billion, with funds distributed to crime victims programs. The FY2015 appropriation for science agencies is $25.360 billion, 2.2% greater than FY2014, exceeding the Administration's request and House-passed amount. The National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 established the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) within the Executive Office of the President. The OSTP director advises on scientific, engineering, and technological issues at the highest government level, manages the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), and co-chairs the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). OSTP is funded in the CJS appropriations bill. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) within the Executive Office of the President is funded in the CJS appropriations bill. P.L. 113-235 provides $5.6 million for OSTP, the same as the Administration's request and the FY2014 appropriation. The joint explanatory statement approves all report language from the House and Senate bills unless changed. The House-passed bill urged OSTP to implement key recommendations on Neuroscience and report to the House Committee on Appropriations within 120 days. The report urged OSTP to prioritize and implement recommendations, promote international collaboration in neuroscience, establish a committee for medical imaging research coordination, and report semiannually on federal research agency progress. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $5.6 million for OSTP, directing them to report on their efforts. The Senate committee recommended bill directed OSTP to report quarterly on open access to federal research, establish an NSTC subcommittee on medical imaging, revise the National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing, and collaborate with non-federal education communities for STEM programs. The Administration's FY2015 request was also mentioned. The Administration's request for FY2015 for the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was $5.6 million, the same as appropriated for FY2014. Congress has restricted OSTP from certain activities with China, but allows activities certified to pose no risk of transferring technology or information with security implications. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created in 1958 to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities. Congress appropriated $17.647 billion for NASA for FY2014, with a proposed decrease of 1.1% for FY2015. NASA's budget for FY2015 included $885.5 million from the OGSI initiative. The final appropriation was $18.010 billion, with $5.245 billion allocated for Science, including $1.280 billion for Planetary Science. The FY2015 budget request for NASA included $1.280 billion for Planetary Science, with $15.0 million designated for a potential mission to Jupiter's moon Europa. Congress had previously allocated funds for the Europa mission, but concerns were raised about the estimated cost of $4.7 billion. NASA sought mission concepts costing less than $1 billion, and the House-passed bill for FY2015 proposed $100.0 million for a mission meeting science goals outlined in a planetary science survey, along with $18.0 million for technology development. The Senate report directed NASA to use the Space Launch System as the baseline launch vehicle for planning a Europa mission to maximize scientific return. Congress appropriated $100 million for FY2015 for planning a Europa mission in line with the planetary science decadal survey. NASA was directed to evaluate the use of the Space Launch System as the launch vehicle for the mission. The Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) reached full operating capability in February 2014, but due to delays in development, NASA proposed placing the aircraft in storage unless international partners could support operating costs. The House and Senate reports disagreed with terminating SOFIA, recommending $70 million and $87 million respectively for the project in FY2015. Congress ultimately appropriated $70 million to maintain SOFIA. Congress appropriated $70 million for FY2015 for SOFIA to maintain core operations. NASA was directed to seek partners to restore SOFIA to its full operational level. The OGSI proposal included an additional $187.3 million for Science, above the Administration's base request. The House and Senate bills included comparable amounts above the request, but did not closely correspond to the content of the OGSI. The Senate report recommended $25 million for PACE, along with funds for Jason-3 and DSCOVR. The final statement included $20 million for PACE in FY2015 and funded Jason-3 and DSCOVR through NOAA. NASA's FY2015 Aeronautics request was $551.1 million, with a proposed reorganization aligning with a new strategic vision. The OGSI proposal added $43.9 million for Aeronautics, aiming to restore proposed reductions in rotorcraft funding. The House-passed bill would have provided $666.0 million for Aeronautics.

The request for Exploration was $3.976 billion, funding the development of the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle and the Space Launch System for human exploration beyond Earth orbit. Additionally, funds were allocated for commercial crew transportation capability for U.S. astronaut access to the International Space Station. The request for Exploration Systems Development decreased by 10.6%, while the request for commercial crew increased by 21.8%. The OGSI proposal included additional funding for SLS and Orion. The OGSI proposal included an additional $100.0 million for SLS and Orion and an additional $250.0 million for commercial crew. Congress perceived a difference in human spaceflight priorities between Congress and the Administration, leading to controversy. The House-passed bill allocated $4.167 billion for Exploration, with frustration expressed over reduced funding for SLS and increased funding for commercial crew. The Senate bill proposed $4.368 billion for Exploration, with a focus on Exploration Systems Development and commercial crew. The Senate report criticized the funding levels for Orion and the SLS, stating they were below requirements. There was a debate over the need for certified cost and pricing data for commercial crew contracts. The final FY2015 appropriation included $3.245 billion for Exploration Systems Development and $805 million for commercial crew. The Space Operations request for FY2015 was $3.905 billion, a 3.4% increase. The FY2015 Space Operations budget was $3.905 billion, a 3.4% increase. NASA planned to eliminate one cargo flight to the ISS but the OGSI proposal included an additional $100.6 million to fund its restoration. The final appropriation for FY2015 was $3.828 billion, with no specific allocation mentioned for the ISS. The Education budget request for FY2015 was $88.9 million, a 23.8% decrease due to government-wide consolidation in STEM education programs. The FY2015 budget included funding for STEM education programs such as the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program, EPSCoR, and MUREP.

The House-passed bill proposed $5.974 billion for R&RA, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $5.839 billion. The Administration's request maintained most R&RA subaccounts at close to FY2014 levels in FY2015. In FY2015, NSF's Research and Related Activities account received an increase in funding, with the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences subaccount receiving the largest increase. The debate over NSF support for social sciences resurfaced in Congress, leading to restrictions on funding for certain projects. The House report recommended allocating additional appropriations to math and physical sciences, computer, and information science and engineering. The House report recommended allocating additional appropriations to math and physical sciences, computer and information science and engineering, engineering, and biological sciences. There were concerns about funding for social, behavioral, and economic sciences, with a House floor amendment seeking to hold funding for SBE at the FY2014 level. The explanatory statement adopts House report language requiring NSF to apply funding increases for R&RA to MPS, CISE, ENG, and BIO. EPSCoR and Advanced Manufacturing programs received funding in FY2015. E&HR received $866.0 million in FY2015, including $60.9 million for the Robert Noyce program. In FY2015, NSF's education account, E&HR, received $19.5 million more funding than in FY2014, totaling $866.0 million. The largest increase was for Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE), with a proposed $25.0 million increase to $99.1 million.
