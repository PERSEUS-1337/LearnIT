    "content": "The Act titled \"Clinical Research Enhancement Act of 1999\" is cited as the short title. Congress finds that clinical research is crucial for scientific advancement, with significant progress in biology providing new insights into human health. Translational research plays a vital role in developing new methods for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. Despite a substantial healthcare budget, federal funding for health research at the National Institutes of Health is limited. The budget for health research at the National Institutes of Health is $15.6 billion, with only 1 percent allocated to clinical research. Various studies have highlighted the current issues in clinical research, leading to the recognition by the Director of NIH. A special panel recommended increased support for existing programs and the creation of new initiatives to address the fragmented, undervalued, and underfunded training and support for health professionals in clinical research. Young investigators are seen as crucial for the future. The number of young investigators applying for grants dropped significantly between 1985 and 1993, raising serious questions about the future of life-science research. The number of physicians applying for National Institutes of Health research grants also decreased, with newly independent life-scientists expected to raise funds for their research programs and a portion of their salaries. The decline in active clinical researchers and those choosing this career path is attributed to factors such as high student debt, lengthy clinical training, lack of mentors, funding instability from federal agencies, and a lack of clinical opportunities. In 1960, general clinical research centers were established under the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health with an initial appropriation of $3,000,000, which increased to $200,500,000 in fiscal year 1999. The absence of clinical research training in training grant awardees' curriculum and challenges faced by Academic Medical Centers in maintaining a research-friendly environment are compounded by decreased third-party payer willingness to cover research-related health care costs. In fiscal year 1999, there were 77 general clinical research centers operating with a budget of $200,500,000, which has declined from 3% to 1% of the National Institutes of Health budget since the late 1960s. The purpose of this Act is to provide additional support and expand clinical research programs. SEC. 3. INCREASING THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH IN CLINICAL RESEARCH. Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on clinical research. The Director of National Institutes of Health is required to support and expand the involvement of NIH in clinical research. This includes establishing fellowship programs for medical and dental students and a training program at NIH. The goal is to meet the diverse needs of clinical research. Directors of the National Institutes of Health must enhance resources for the clinical research community, including inpatient, outpatient, and critical care research. The Director shall implement peer review mechanisms to evaluate applications for awards and fellowships, ensuring qualified individuals assess the merits of research proposals. SEC. 481C. GENERAL CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTERS. Grants for enhancing resources in clinical research community. The Director of the National Center for Research Resources awards grants for general clinical research centers to support clinical studies and career development. Activities include expanding centers through telecommunications and telemedicine initiatives. Appropriations are authorized for each fiscal year. The Service Act is amended to include additional provisions at the end. SEC. 409D. ENHANCEMENT AWARDS. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will provide Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Awards to support individual careers in clinical research at institutions with appropriate resources. Grants will be used to support clinical investigators in the early stages of their independent careers. The Director of the National Institutes of Health offers grants for Mid-Career Investigator Awards in Patient-Oriented Research to support individual clinical research projects at general clinical research centers. Applications must be submitted by individual scientists as required by the Director, with necessary appropriations authorized for each fiscal year. Grants are available for mid-career level clinicians to conduct patient-oriented clinical research and mentor beginning clinical investigators. Applications must be submitted by individual scientists as required by the Director, with necessary appropriations authorized for each fiscal year. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will provide grants for individuals pursuing master's or doctoral degrees in clinical investigation, known as Graduate Training in Clinical Investigation Awards. These grants will support advanced degree programs in clinical investigation for 2 years or more, including stipend, tuition, and institutional support. Applications must be submitted by individual scientists as required by the Director. The subsection defines advanced degree programs in clinical investigation as those awarding master's or Ph.D. degrees after 2 or more years of training in various areas. Appropriations are authorized for carrying out this subsection. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will provide grants for the development of core curricula for training clinical investigators, including medical students. The core curricula may cover areas such as analytical methods, clinical pharmacology, epidemiology, data management, and ethical issues. Grants are available for the development of core curricula in informatics, ethical and regulatory issues, and biomedical writing. Applications must be submitted by individual institutions or consortia, with grants lasting up to 5 years and renewable. Appropriations are authorized for each fiscal year. SEC. 487F. LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM REGARDING CLINICAL RESEARCHERS. The Secretary will establish a program for health professionals to conduct clinical research in exchange for up to $35,000 repayment of educational loans per year. Provisions of existing loan repayment programs apply to this new program. Funding will be authorized for this purpose. Funding for the program will be authorized with appropriations as necessary for each fiscal year, and the allocated amounts will remain available for two fiscal years. SEC. 6. DEFINITION. Amends Section 409 of the Public Health Service Act to define 'clinical research' as patient-oriented research involving human subjects or research on disease causes and consequences in human populations. The Comptroller General of the United States must report to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment on the National Institutes of Health's compliance with the amendments."
