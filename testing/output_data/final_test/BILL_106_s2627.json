Significant structural damage to the road has been verified since its opening in 1932. Infrastructure in most developed areas of the park is inadequate for cold-season use. The historic hotels in Glacier National Park, including Many Glacier Hotel and Lake McDonald Lodge, are essential for public enjoyment but are in need of significant repair to meet basic safety and operational standards. Other accommodations like Rising Sun Motor Inn and Swiftcurrent Motel also require maintenance. The hotels in Glacier National Park require substantial repairs due to deferred maintenance, high remodeling costs, and limited financing capacity. The concessionaire will need to borrow funds for repairs and operate for only 4 months due to lacking essential infrastructure. The National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998 addresses the challenges faced by concessionaires in Glacier National Park, such as high remodeling costs and limited financing capacity. The Act aims to achieve its purposes but may require additional authority for demonstration projects.
