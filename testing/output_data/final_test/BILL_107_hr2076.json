The \"Residential Solar Energy Tax Credit Act\" allows individuals to claim a tax credit for qualified photovoltaic and solar water heating property expenditures. The credit is 15% of the expenditures made during the taxable year, with a maximum limit of $2,000 for each type of property described. The tax credit for residential solar energy expenditures is only applicable to property installed in the United States and used as a residence. Safety certifications are required for solar water heating equipment and photovoltaic systems to qualify for the credit. The tax credit for residential solar energy expenditures in the United States applies to solar water heating and photovoltaic systems that meet specific qualifications. Solar panels installed as a roof are considered eligible property for the credit. Labor costs for onsite preparation, assembly, or original installation of eligible solar property are included in the tax credit. Expenditures for swimming pools or energy storage mediums with functions other than storage are not eligible. Special rules apply for joint occupancy situations.

Tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations and members of condominium management associations can also claim their proportionate share of expenditures.

The term 'condominium management association' refers to an organization that meets specific requirements with respect to a condominium project. Additionally, joint owners of solar energy property can qualify for certain expenditures. Expenditures for multiple dwelling units can still qualify for a tax credit. The credit amount is calculated separately for each unit if the expenditure is for residential purposes. If less than 80% of an item is used for nonbusiness residential purposes, only the portion allocated to residential use qualifies for the credit. Expenditures for nonbusiness residential purposes are taken into account, with use for a swimming pool not considered residential. Expenditures are treated as made when the original installation of an item is completed, except for expenditures in connection with building construction, which are considered made when the structure is first used by the taxpayer. The text discusses the amount of expenditures for a tax credit, basis adjustments, and the termination of the credit after December 31, 2006.
