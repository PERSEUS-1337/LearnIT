The \"Federal Travel Transparency Act\" mandates additional disclosure of travel details by specific senior officials, including definitions for key terms like 'Administrator' and 'covered individual'. The \"Federal Travel Transparency Act\" defines key terms like 'open format' and 'travel information website' for public availability of travel information for covered individuals. The \"Federal Travel Transparency Act\" requires Executive agencies to submit data on official travel by covered individuals, including duration, destination, travel party, and justification, in machine-readable and open format after each calendar quarter. The \"Federal Travel Transparency Act\" mandates Executive agencies to disclose data on official travel, including duration, destination, travel party, justification, authorizing official, and total cost to the Government for travel, transportation, and lodging. The Administrator must make this information publicly available online at no cost. Executive agencies can exclude national security sensitive travel information from the data submitted to the Administrator if it would harm national security interests. Each agency must maintain a record justifying this decision. The Executive agency can exclude national security sensitive travel information from submission if it would harm national security interests. The Administrator should use existing resources, like a website, to implement this. The Administrator must make travel information available on a website within 30 days of receiving it from an Executive agency. Classified travel information can be excluded from submission, but must be maintained by the agency for 2 years. The Inspector General of each Executive agency may conduct audits to ensure accuracy of information provided to the Administrator, review exclusions of classified travel information, and report to Congress. The Inspector General must notify Congress if an Executive agency improperly withholds information from the Administrator. This does not affect other reporting requirements under the Federal Travel Regulation or any other laws."
