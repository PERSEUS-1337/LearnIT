    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Corporate Inversions Act of 2014\" and includes modifications to rules relating to inverted corporations. The \"Stop Corporate Inversions Act of 2014\" amends section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code to treat inverted corporations as domestic corporations under certain conditions. The \"Stop Corporate Inversions Act of 2014\" amends section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code to address acquisitions of domestic corporations or partnerships between May 8, 2014, and May 9, 2016, where more than 50% of the entity's stock is held by the acquiring party. The \"Stop Corporate Inversions Act of 2014\" addresses acquisitions of domestic corporations or partnerships where former shareholders or partners hold stock or interest in the entity, and management primarily occurs within the United States. The \"Stop Corporate Inversions Act of 2014\" focuses on acquisitions of domestic corporations or partnerships with management primarily in the United States. Foreign corporations are exempt if they have substantial business activities in the country of organization. The Secretary may issue regulations increasing the threshold percent in tests for determining substantial business activities. Regulations for management and control of an expanded affiliated group primarily in the United States apply after May 8, 2014. The regulations for management and control of an expanded affiliated group in the United States after May 8, 2014, specify that executive officers and senior management must primarily be based in the United States to be considered as such, regardless of their title. The regulations require that at least 25 percent of employees, employee compensation, assets, and income of an expanded affiliated group must be based in the United States for significant domestic business activities. The regulations, effective May 8, 2014, allow for treating references to 'foreign country' as 'the United States'. The Secretary can adjust the threshold percent in tests to determine significant domestic business activities. Conforming amendments to section 7874 of the Code are also made. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending after May 8, 2014, including changes to subsections and paragraphs related to domestic and foreign corporations."
