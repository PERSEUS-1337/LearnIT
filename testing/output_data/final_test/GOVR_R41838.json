    "content": "The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 led to fiscal stimulus packages, nationalization of private-sector debt, and increased government borrowing. Public debt in G-7 economies rose from 84% of GDP in 2006 to a forecasted 121% in 2013. Concerns about high public debt levels have been focused on the Eurozone, where countries like Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus have borrowed money to meet their financial obligations. High levels of sovereign debt in advanced economies are a concern for global economic recovery. Countries like Spain and Italy in the Eurozone are facing challenges with their public finances. The United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom are also grappling with rising debt levels. Congress is debating fiscal issues related to debt management and the federal budget, amidst an uncertain global economic recovery. In the context of federal budget and the debt ceiling, comparisons are made between the United States and other advanced economies like Greece, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Analyzing debt levels and factors shaping debt sustainability can inform these comparisons. Most advanced economies are implementing fiscal austerity programs to lower their debt levels, which could impact the U.S. economy through reduced demand for exports and deterred investment. The report provides background information on sovereign debt and examines concerns about debt reduction strategies in other countries. Sovereign debt, also known as public or government debt, is incurred by governments for various reasons. The shift in concerns over debt sustainability from emerging markets to advanced economies post the 2008-2009 global financial crisis is analyzed. Policy options for lowering debt levels, including fiscal austerity, are discussed along with concerns about its global impact. Issues of interest to Congress, such as comparisons between U.S. and European debt levels and potential impacts on the U.S. economy, are also examined. Governments borrow money for various reasons such as health, education, defense, infrastructure, and research. Borrowing can be for consumption or investment, including running expansionary fiscal policies to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment. Economists believe public debt can be beneficial during recessions or for long-term investment projects, but caution against imprudent use of debt. Governments borrow money through issuing government bonds to fund various purposes like health, education, defense, and infrastructure. They may borrow during economic downturns and repay during booms, leading to increasing debt levels over time. Most advanced economies sell bonds to private investors, both domestically and overseas. Some countries like Japan and Italy primarily sell bonds to domestic investors. The United States sells bonds to both domestic and foreign investors, with about half of its federal debt held by foreigners. Emerging economies also borrow from other governments and international organizations like the World Bank and the IMF. Sovereign debt differs from private-sector debt as there is no international bankruptcy court to enforce debt contracts between private investors and governments. In the international context, there are no internationally accepted laws or bankruptcy courts to provide creditors recourse against governments that refuse to repay their debts. Debt contracts between governments and private creditors often include provisions specifying the jurisdiction's law to be applied in case of a dispute. Sovereign debt differs from private-sector debt as there is no international bankruptcy court to enforce debt contracts between private investors and governments. Governments cannot be compelled to repay loans through court rulings, unlike in the private sector where collateral often backs debt contracts. Public debt is unsecured and lacks international regulations for enforcement, unlike private debt which may be backed by collateral like property or remain unsecured like credit card debt. Sovereign debt may be less risky than private-sector debt because governments have the power of taxation to raise money to service debt, unlike private borrowers. Creditors lend to governments based on the belief that governments will want to repay their debts to maintain a good reputation in capital markets. The government's reputation for creditworthiness in capital markets affects its ability to borrow at low interest rates. Defaulting on debt can have adverse effects on international trade and economic growth, leading to debt crises where a country may be unable or unwilling to pay its debts. Despite incentives to repay debt, governments have a history of suspending or falling behind on payments. Debt crises can lead to defaults, but governments often restructure debt to make payments easier. Various factors like economic recessions, currency depreciation, and political changes can trigger defaults. Debt crises can lead to defaults, triggered by factors like economic recessions, currency depreciation, and political changes. Debates on government defaults often revolve around \"ability\" versus \"willingness\" to repay debt. A nation's debt burden is measured as a percentage of its GDP, indicating the size of the economy and relative debt burden. Data on sovereign debt can be reported for the central government or all entities. Public debt can be reported for different levels of government, such as central/federal, state/province, and local governments. The headline number for \"U.S. debt\" typically refers to federal government debt only. In the European Union, general government debt is commonly reported in news. International organizations like the IMF and OECD provide standardized debt data for advanced economies. Debt can be reported on a gross or net basis, reflecting total liabilities. Governments report public debt on a gross or net basis, with the latter deducting financial assets. Japan's gross debt in 2013 was 244% of GDP, but net debt was 140%. Greece's gross and net debt were close in 2013. Some countries sell bonds to domestic investors, while others sell to foreigners. Italy and Japan sell bonds to domestic investors. \"External\" public debt refers to debt owed to foreign creditors. Analysts caution that government debt data may not accurately reflect all financial obligations, leading to potentially higher estimates if hidden debts were included. Governments have discretion in reporting public debt levels, with potential exclusions like loan guarantees, state-owned enterprise obligations, central bank obligations, and implicit guarantees. Underreporting of data is also a concern, as seen in the Greek debt crisis. In the Greek debt crisis, underreported budget deficits caused investor anxiety about Greece's debt sustainability. Some governments fail to fully account for spending on programs for aging citizens, leading to underestimated future debt levels. Prior to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, concerns over sovereign debt focused on middle-income, emerging-market countries like Latin America, Russia, and Argentina. Several emerging markets restructured their debt in the late 1990s and 2000s. Emerging markets like Russia, Ukraine, Pakistan, Ecuador, Argentina, Moldova, and Uruguay are more susceptible to debt crises due to high debt levels, limited resources for repayment, commodity price volatility, and weak political institutions. Their debt contracts, denominated in foreign currencies with short maturities, make them vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations and difficulties in rolling over debt. Since the financial crisis, concerns over sovereign debt sustainability have shifted from emerging markets to advanced industrialized economies. Governments in advanced economies faced rising levels of sovereign debt due to financial support for troubled banks and large stimulus packages to boost demand. This resulted in lower stability compared to emerging markets. The financial crisis led to increased government debt in advanced industrialized countries due to stimulus packages and lower tax receipts. Aging populations may strain public finances in the future, leading to continued high levels of public debt. Sovereign debt levels rose rapidly to 104% of GDP in 2011 and are forecasted to increase to 108% of GDP in 2014. In contrast, emerging markets and developing countries have lower debt levels, with gross general government debt at 49% in 2000 and decreasing to 37% in 2011. By 2017, debt in these countries is expected to fall further to 31% of GDP. Advanced economies show varying levels of debt, with Japan having the highest ratio of gross general government debt in 2013. In 2013, Japan had the highest gross general government debt relative to GDP at 244%, followed by Greece at 176%. Estonia had the lowest debt at 11% of GDP. The United States ranked eighth with 106% of GDP. Eurozone countries like Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus faced high debt-to-GDP ratios. Markets consider various indicators, not just debt levels, for evaluating debt sustainability. Net general government debt rankings differ among countries. In 2013, Greece is forecasted to have the highest net general government debt at 173% of GDP, followed by Japan at 140%. Some countries like Norway and Finland have negative net debt levels. The US is estimated to have 85% of GDP in net general government debt. Concerns arise about aging populations causing public debt to rise in advanced economies. Aging populations in advanced economies will lead to a significant increase in public debt due to a shrinking workforce and higher spending on pensions and healthcare. Economists warn that current government balance sheets do not fully account for these future liabilities, with debt-to-GDP ratios projected to reach alarming levels by 2020 in countries like Japan, the United Kingdom, and several European nations. Public debt levels in advanced economies are projected to reach 200% of GDP in the United Kingdom and 150% of GDP in Belgium, France, Ireland, Greece, Italy, and the United States. High debt levels combined with aging population-related spending pose serious concerns as they make governments vulnerable to changes in investor behavior, potentially leading to higher interest rates or loss of market access. High debt levels in advanced economies like the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Ireland, Greece, Italy, and the United States could lead to market pressure for policy adjustments such as tax increases or spending cuts. Countries like Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus have borrowed money to make debt repayments and implement reforms to regain investor confidence. Government deficits can crowd out private investment, impacting long-term economic growth. Government deficits can impact economic growth by crowding out private investment. However, deficits used for public investment may not harm growth. Borrowing from foreign investors can help maintain domestic investment but creates future obligations. High debt levels limit government response to crises and may hinder access to necessary financing. This can lead to reliance on other policy tools or international support during emergencies. Japan's borrowing needs have increased for reconstruction after the 2011 disasters. Governments have tools like fiscal consolidation, debt restructuring, inflation, growth, and financial repression to lower debt levels. Austerity programs are one way to reduce debt through tax increases or spending cuts. Austerity programs aim to reduce debt by targeting high government spending or low tax revenue. Proponents argue that fiscal consolidation can boost economic growth by increasing investor confidence and lowering interest rates. However, implementing austerity measures is costly and can reduce aggregate demand in the short term. Austerity policies, also known as contractionary policies, can lead to economic contraction and increased unemployment. If economic output falls faster than debt, the debt to GDP ratio may rise. Implementing austerity measures can be politically challenging, as seen in anti-austerity protests in various countries. Financial assistance from other governments or the IMF can help mitigate the negative effects of austerity programs by allowing reforms to occur over a longer period. Debt restructuring involves reorganizing a debt that is too burdensome for the borrower. It can include lenient repayment terms like extending the maturity of the loan or reducing the interest rate. Some argue that financial assistance from the IMF and European countries exacerbates debt issues. Emerging markets like Russia and Argentina have undergone debt restructurings in the past. Debt restructuring in the late 1990s and 2000s affected countries like Russia and Argentina. Proponents argue it reduces debt burden without harsh austerity measures, shifting costs to private creditors. Critics say it's not ideal for lowering debt. IMF economists believe restructuring in advanced economies is unnecessary and undesirable. Domestic government debt holders may resist restructuring, and governments may struggle to borrow after restructuring. Debt restructuring can pose challenges for governments, including the need to quickly balance budgets, higher borrowing costs, and complex negotiations with bondholders. It may also increase investor anxiety and potentially spread financial crises to other countries. For example, the Eurozone crisis involved efforts to prevent the crisis from spreading to larger economies like Spain, Italy, or Belgium. Inflation can help governments reduce the real value of debt by creating money to repay creditors, viewed as a form of default. It is not common in emerging-market debt crises due to foreign currency denominations. Inflation allows debt repayment without austerity measures and is simpler than debt restructuring. Using inflation to reduce debt can be simpler than restructuring, but it comes with risks. Unexpected inflation can lead to higher borrowing costs and adverse consequences like savings devaluation and economic uncertainty. Controlling inflation is challenging as it can create expectations for more inflation. Cooperation from the central bank is crucial for this strategy to work effectively. In advanced economies, central banks operate independently from the government, making it difficult to lower the real value of debt through inflation. Eurozone countries cannot use inflation to reduce debt due to the shared currency. Economic growth can help reduce debt relative to GDP, lower government spending, and increase tax revenues. Economic stabilization is necessary for sustained growth, achievable through expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. Growth can be stimulated through expansionary fiscal and monetary policies or structural reforms at the microeconomic level. Structural reforms, such as removing barriers to labor mobility and privatizing state-owned companies, can increase industry competitiveness. The IMF's program for Greece includes structural reforms to encourage growth and address debt problems without painful fiscal cuts. Results of these reforms may take time to manifest. Countries in debt crisis may struggle to grow out of it in the short term, leading to the need for fiscal cuts alongside structural reforms. Financial repression, involving selling bonds at artificially low interest rates, is also suggested as a strategy to lower debt levels. Financial repression involves governments extending loans with negative real interest rates to lower debt-to-GDP ratios over time. To ensure bond sales, policies like capital outflow restrictions are used to create a captive domestic audience. Empirical evidence shows that advanced economies used financial repression post-World War II to reduce public debt levels. Real interest rates were negative in advanced countries half the time between 1945 and 1980. In the US and UK, financial repression helped decrease debt levels by 3%-4% of GDP annually, or 30% to 40% each decade until the 1970s. Financial repression is an attractive option for lowering debt levels as it avoids austerity measures, debt restructuring, surprise inflation, and uncertainty. However, it is technically challenging due to 30 years of financial liberalization. Implementing capital controls may be difficult before capital flight occurs and could deter foreign investment. Investors may also resist policies that restrict their opportunities or require them to buy government bonds at low rates. The primary policy response to high debt levels in advanced economies has been fiscal austerity, with some countries implementing austerity measures in response to market pressures. At the G-20 summit in 2010, governments pledged to halve deficits by 2013 and stabilize or reduce government debt-to-GDP ratios by 2016. Japan's plans for fiscal consolidation were disrupted by a natural disaster in 2011, leading to immediate spending needs. In response to high debt levels, many advanced economies implemented fiscal austerity measures. Japan's fiscal consolidation plans were disrupted by a natural disaster in 2011, leading to immediate spending needs of $195 billion and $305 billion for reconstruction costs. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration prioritized growing Japan's economy and eliminating deflation through \"Abenomics,\" which includes fiscal stimulus, monetary policies, and structural reforms. In March 2012, Greece implemented the largest debt restructuring in history, with 97% of privately held Greek bonds taking a 53.5% cut to the face value. The net present value of Greek bonds was reduced by 75% in a restructuring due to a sharp economic contraction. The debt to GDP ratio is forecasted to be 171% in 2012, leading to concerns about the need for further debt relief. Some economists worry that austerity measures could harm global economic recovery, while others believe that current fiscal plans are insufficient to stabilize debt levels. There are also concerns about the lack of political will for necessary reforms. Some are concerned about the US heading towards a debt crisis similar to Eurozone countries, fearing loss of investor confidence and ability to borrow at reasonable rates. However, others argue that the US debt position is stronger due to factors like a floating exchange rate and international reserve currency status. They also point to stronger economic growth and lower borrowing costs in the US. The United States' strong economic growth and lower borrowing costs have put its debt levels on a sustainable path, supported by a history of debt repayment. In contrast, Greece has a high default rate. Market data show that investors do not view the US similarly to Greece, Ireland, or Portugal, with US bond spreads remaining lower than those countries during crises. The financial crisis originated in the U.S. housing market. S&P Capital IQ estimates the likelihood of U.S. default over the next five years to be 3.07%, ranking it as the ninth least-likely country to default. Market perceptions of the U.S. are influenced by deficit reduction policies. Other advanced economies' debt levels impact the U.S. economy. Addressing high debt levels in advanced economies through fiscal austerity could slow growth and impact U.S. exports. Slower growth rates in advanced economies may lead to U.S. investors shifting towards emerging markets. Default or restructuring of public debt in advanced economies could result in losses for U.S. investors. U.S. banks have credit committed overseas, not just to sovereign borrowers. U.S. banks have significant exposure overseas, with 71% of their $3,222 billion exposure concentrated in advanced economies. The most exposed countries include the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, and Canada. Exposure to Eurozone countries under market pressure is relatively small, totaling $64 billion in June 2013. Direct U.S. bank exposure overseas totaled $64 billion in June 2013, with additional exposure to Italy and Spain amounting to $103 billion. The BIS also started publishing data on banks' \"other potential exposures\" overseas, which totaled $677 billion for Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. However, the BIS data does not include collateral or hedges that U.S. banks may have in place to lower their exposure. The BIS data captures the exposure of U.S. banking institutions, excluding other financial institutions like money market, insurance, and pension funds. It also does not account for secondary exposures, creating uncertainty around the full extent of the U.S. financial system's exposure to Eurozone countries. This uncertainty extends to the implications of default or restructuring triggering contagion in the U.S. financial system. Some argue that the United States should address high debt levels through fiscal austerity without derailing economic recovery, sparking debates within Congress and at the multilateral level. Suggestions include fixing fiscal problems at an appropriate pace and urging the Administration to tackle sovereign debt issues in multilateral discussions. Multilateral coordination of fiscal policies may be necessary to prevent simultaneous fiscal contractions among advanced economies. To prevent large fiscal contractions in advanced economies and support economic recovery, coordinating fiscal policies among countries with debt issues and those without could soften austerity impacts globally. The G-20, through the mutual assessment process, may facilitate discussions on revisiting fiscal consolidation commitments and addressing the Eurozone debt crisis. Congress may urge engagement with international financial institutions like the IMF to tackle challenges posed by high debt levels in advanced economies. The IMF and other IFIs are focusing on high debt levels in advanced economies. They are working on increasing transparency by collecting public debt data quarterly from 44 countries. This initiative aims to provide standardized data to help monitor and address public debt levels in major economies."
