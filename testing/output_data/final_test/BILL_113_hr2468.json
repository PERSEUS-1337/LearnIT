    "content": "The \"Safe Streets Act of 2013\" is the short title of this Act. It includes definitions for various terms used within the legislation. The \"Safe Streets Act of 2013\" defines a \"complete street\" as a roadway that safely accommodates all travelers, including public transit users, bicyclists, pedestrians, motorists, and freight vehicles. It also defines \"complete streets policy\" as a transportation law or principle that ensures safe accommodation for all users in project planning and development. The \"Safe Streets Act of 2013\" defines a \"complete street\" as a roadway that safely accommodates all travelers, including pedestrians, bicyclists, public transit users, children, older individuals, individuals with disabilities, motorists, and freight vehicles. It emphasizes the safety and convenience of all users in project planning and development. The terms \"local jurisdiction\" and \"metropolitan planning organization\" are also defined within the Act. The \"Safe Streets Act of 2013\" defines a \"complete street\" as a roadway accommodating all travelers. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Transportation. A \"senior manager\" includes directors of transportation departments, metropolitan planning organizations, and regional transportation agencies. The term \"transportation improvement program\" is defined as TIP in section 134(b) of title 23, United States Code. SEC. 3. COMPLETE STREETS POLICY. Each State and metropolitan planning organization must have a law or policy in effect by October 1 of the fiscal year, requiring all transportation projects to accommodate the safety and convenience of all users in accordance with complete streets principles. The law or policy requires transportation projects to accommodate all users with complete streets principles, including accessibility for expected users. The law or policy mandates that new road projects must consider the needs of all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, transit vehicles, freight vehicles, and motorists. Improvements for pedestrian and bicyclist safety must be fully assessed in pavement resurfacing projects. The transportation improvement projects must comply with up-to-date design standards, including providing access for individuals with disabilities. Complete streets principles should be considered based on the project's urban, suburban, or rural context. Exemptions from complete streets principles require approval by a senior manager and documentation of the basis for the exemption. The project must adhere to performance standards for complete streets principles and include an implementation plan. An exemption may apply if at least 30% of the design phase is completed for a new road construction project. Exemptions require approval and documentation of the basis for the exemption. The exemption from complete streets policy may apply if accommodating specified users elsewhere is not feasible, the cost of compliance is excessively disproportionate, or the expected users of a roadway do not include pedestrians, public transportation, freight vehicles, or bicyclists. The exemption from complete streets policy can be approved by senior managers of relevant transportation organizations for projects where accommodating specified users elsewhere is not feasible, compliance costs are excessively disproportionate, or expected users do not include pedestrians, public transportation, freight vehicles, or bicyclists. Each State department of transportation and metropolitan planning organization must integrate complete streets policies. The metropolitan planning organization implementing a complete streets policy must incorporate complete streets principles into all aspects of transportation project development. Each State department of transportation is required to submit a report to the Secretary detailing measures taken to achieve compliance with the complete streets requirements. The Secretary will then determine if the State has achieved compliance. The certification process involves the Secretary determining if a State has achieved compliance with complete streets requirements. The Secretary will establish a method to evaluate compliance with complete streets requirements, including submission of reports on policies, implementation, and exemptions by State departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 3 years of enacting the Act, detailing the method for compliance with complete streets requirements, the status of adoption by State departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations, resources provided for implementation, and measures to encourage adoption by local jurisdictions. SEC. 5. ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS. The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board must establish final accessibility standards for new construction and alteration of pedestrian facilities within one year of this Act. Until then, states and planning organizations must adhere to temporary standards for public rights-of-way. The Act requires adherence to final accessibility standards for new construction and alteration of pedestrian facilities within one year. If these standards do not apply to an affected public right-of-way, the revised draft guidelines dated November 23, 2005 should be followed. SEC. 6. RESEARCH, TECHNICAL GUIDANCE, AND IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will conduct research on complete streets to help states, metropolitan planning organizations, and local jurisdictions develop plans and projects that align with complete streets principles. Participation in the research program will be solicited from various organizations. The research on complete streets will involve various organizations including the Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the American Society of Landscape Architects, and representatives from transportation safety, disability, motoring, bicycling, walking, transit user, aging, and air quality organizations. The research will be based on the Transportation Research Board's statement of complete streets research needs and will seek to develop new areas of inquiry. The research conducted aims to establish benchmarks and provide guidance on effectively implementing complete streets policies to accommodate all users, including vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users. The focus is on modifying design procedures to integrate different methods of use into facilities that meet the needs of each method in a balanced way, while indicating expected operational and safety performance. The Secretary collaborates with various agencies to collect data for nonmotorized and transit use surveys and develop survey tools for identifying multimodal capacity of roadways. Additionally, technical guidance reports will be provided to states and local jurisdictions within 15 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will provide a report to states and local jurisdictions on best practices for implementing complete streets principles, focusing on user needs, facility designs, safety benefits, and common barriers. Procedures for overcoming barriers, identifying costs, maximizing local cooperation, and assessing existing roadways for consistency with complete streets principles."
