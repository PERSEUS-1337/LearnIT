    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Department of Energy Nanoscale Science and Engineering Research Act\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of nanoscience and nanoengineering in creating new materials and advancing technology for energy exploration, production, and efficiency. These advancements will strengthen U.S. science, technology, and medicine. The Congress recognizes the significant challenges in nanoscience and nanoengineering, requiring public support for research and development. Advances in self-assembly of atom clusters are necessary for energy and manufacturing industries. New scientific instruments and specialized facilities will be essential for progress in the field. The Department of Energy's Office of Science is well suited to manage nanoscience and nanoengineering research and development. Contributions from individual researchers and multidisciplinary research teams are required to advance in this field. The Office of Science is the principal federal supporter of research in physical and computational sciences, genomics, and life sciences. The Department of Energy's Office of Science supports research and development by individual investigators and multidisciplinary teams, managing special user facilities for both university and industry investigators. The Department of Energy's Office of Science supports research and development by individual investigators and multidisciplinary teams, managing special user facilities for both university and industry investigators. Additionally, there is a specific Department of Energy program outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Energy, through the Office of Science, supports research in nanoscience and nanoengineering on a scale of 1 to 100 nanometers. The program includes supporting individual and multidisciplinary teams of investigators and developing special equipment or facilities for research in this field. The Secretary of Energy supports nanoscience and nanoengineering research on a scale of 1 to 100 nanometers. Funding is available for projects to develop special equipment and facilities for investigators in this field. The Secretary of Energy supports nanoscience and nanoengineering research at the scale of 1 to 100 nanometers, including measurement, manipulation, and integration of technologies. Facilities may include electron microcharacterization, microlithography, and scanning probe facilities. Collaboration among universities, laboratories, and industry is encouraged, with a focus on technology transfer.Merit review is required for all financial assistance awards under this Act. Financial assistance awards under this Act require independent merit review before being awarded. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary of Energy for fiscal years 2002 to 2006: \n- $160,000,000 for 2002\n- $270,000,000 for 2003\n- $290,000,000 for 2004\n- $310,000,000 for 2005\n- $330,000,000 for 2006\nFunds allocated for Nanoscience and Nanoengineering Research Centers and Major Instrumentation for the same fiscal years:\n- $55,000,000 for 2002\n- $135,000,000 for 2003\n- $150,000,000 for 2004\n- $120,000,000 for 2005\n- $100,000,000 for 2006"
