    "content": "The War Crimes Act imposes criminal penalties for certain offenses under the law of war, regardless of where they occur. Offenders can face imprisonment for life, or the death penalty if the victim dies. Initially, the Act only covered grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, but was later amended to include additional war crimes suggested by the State and Defense Departments. The War Crimes Act covers violations under Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, applicable to conflicts not of an international character. It prohibits violence, cruel treatment, and outrages upon personal dignity towards persons not taking part in hostilities. Controversy surrounds potential prosecution of military and intelligence personnel for activities related to captured Al Qaeda suspects. The Bush Administration argued that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to Al Qaeda members captured in the \"war on terror\" until the Court's ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld in 2006. The Administration claimed that the Conventions only applied to conflicts between States and not non-State actors like Al Qaeda. The issue in Hamdan primarily concerned military matters. The Court's ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld in 2006 addressed military tribunals for detainees, rejecting the Administration's interpretation of Common Article 3 and requiring new treatment guidelines for military detainees, including Al Qaeda members. The War Crimes Act has not been used to prosecute anyone, leading to questions about its scope. Some suggest amending the Act to clarify what constitutes punishable offenses, especially regarding violations of Common Article 3. President George W. Bush mentioned in 2006 that certain provisions of Common Article 3 protect U.S. personnel. George W. Bush suggested amending the War Crimes Act to specify punishable offenses under Common Article 3, but some argued this could overly restrict its scope. There is debate over what constitutes impermissible conduct like torture or cruel treatment. President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order in January 2009. In January 2009, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order prohibiting U.S. officials from relying on Bush Administration interpretations of interrogation laws. For more information on U.S. and international jurisprudence on interrogation techniques, refer to CRS reports. Prior to the Court's ruling in Hamdan, the Bush Administration did not apply Common Article 3 protections to captured Al Qaeda agents, leading to questions of potential criminal liability under the War Crimes Act. U.S. personnel could have defenses if their actions were authorized by the Administration and believed to be lawful. Section 1004(a) of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 addressed these issues. Section 1004(a) of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 provides a defense for U.S. personnel involved in detention and interrogation practices authorized by the President or his designees, as long as they believed the practices were lawful and a person of ordinary sense would also believe so. The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 provides a defense for U.S. personnel engaged in authorized detention and interrogation practices if they believed the practices were lawful. Good faith reliance on advice of counsel is a key factor to consider. The defense does not apply to unauthorized conduct or higher-level officials who authorized but did not directly engage in the practices. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 clarified that the defense for U.S. personnel charged with War Crimes Act offenses extends to activities prior to the act and after September 11, 2001. Legal defenses can be raised if conduct was authorized, done with government sanction, or based on erroneous information from authorities. \"Mistake of law\" defenses, though generally rejected, have been recognized in certain cases. These defenses can be categorized as defense of entrapment by estoppel, among others. Defense of entrapment by estoppel, defense of public authority, and defense of apparent public authority are available for defendants who rely on government officials' representations to engage in conduct that would otherwise be criminal. These defenses may also apply to military personnel in courts-martial proceedings. Additionally, U.S. personnel may be protected from prosecution by the federal statute of limitations. The federal statute of limitations limits prosecution under the War Crimes Act to five years, except for capital offenses. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 retroactively amended the War Crimes Act to specify punishable violations, including torture and cruel treatment. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 amended the War Crimes Act to include punishable violations such as torture, cruel treatment, murder, biological experiments, mutilation, rape, and taking hostages. The definition of \"cruel treatment\" under the MCA is similar to that of \"torture\" in the Federal Torture Statute, but with a broader scope of intent to cause harm. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 amended the War Crimes Act to include punishable violations such as torture, cruel treatment, murder, biological experiments, mutilation, rape, and taking hostages. \"Serious mental pain and suffering\" and \"serious physical pain and suffering\" are defined under the MCA as rising to the level of cruel treatment punishable under the War Crimes Act. The War Crimes Act, as amended by the Military Commissions Act of 2006, defines \"serious physical pain or suffering\" constituting cruel treatment as bodily injury involving a substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, serious burns or disfigurement, or significant loss or impairment. The mental pain and suffering for cruel treatment need to be serious and non-transitory, while torture requires severe and prolonged suffering. Conduct before the MCA enactment must involve prolonged pain and suffering. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 expanded the definition of \"serious physical pain or suffering\" under the War Crimes Act to include bodily injury with a substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, serious burns, disfigurement, or significant loss or impairment. This could lead to criminal prosecution for acts considered torture, especially if the offender intended to cause such harm. The amendments also allowed prosecution for reckless or criminally negligent actions causing injury, retroactively applying to certain conduct covered under the earlier version of the War Crimes Act. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 expanded the definition of \"serious physical pain or suffering\" under the War Crimes Act to include bodily injury with a substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, serious burns, disfigurement, or significant loss or impairment. The Act also amended the DTA to provide defense for U.S. personnel in criminal prosecutions related to detainee treatment between September 11, 2001, and December 30, 2005. It required the federal government to provide counsel and pay fees for prosecutions or civil actions against U.S. personnel for authorized detention or interrogation activities. The Act specified exceptions to certain provisions of the War Crimes Act and prohibited U.S. courts from using foreign or international sources to interpret the Act. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 expanded the definition of \"serious physical pain or suffering\" under the War Crimes Act. The Act also amended the DTA to provide defense for U.S. personnel in criminal prosecutions related to detainee treatment. Additionally, the MCA prevents the invocation of the Geneva Conventions in certain judicial proceedings. President Bush signed an Executive Order interpreting Common Article 3 in relation to the detention and interrogation of certain alien detainees by the CIA. The Executive Order signed by President Bush interprets Common Article 3 in relation to the detention and interrogation of alien detainees by the CIA who are affiliated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban. It prohibits torture, cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, and other violent acts. The Executive Order signed by President Bush prohibits torture, cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, and other violent acts, including acts of personal abuse and denigration of religion. It is not always clear which interrogation techniques are considered \"cruel\" under the Order. The Executive Order signed by President Bush prohibits torture, cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, and other violent acts, including acts of personal abuse and denigration of religion. Certain controversial interrogation techniques like waterboarding, hooding, sleep deprivation, or forced standing for prolonged periods were not specifically addressed by the Order. CIA Director Michael Hayden suggested that additional interrogation techniques beyond those in the Army Field Manual could be used. President Obama later rescinded President Bush's order and implemented a new Executive Order. The new Executive Order issued by President Obama rescinds President Bush's order and sets new requirements for interrogation by the CIA and other agencies. It prohibits any interrogation technique not authorized under the Army Field Manual, which includes 19 approved techniques such as \"Mutt and Jeff,\" \"false flag,\" and separation. The Order does not allow certain interrogation tactics to be used on lawful prisoners of war. The Executive Order issued by President Obama prohibits interrogation techniques not authorized under the Army Field Manual, including \"Mutt and Jeff,\" \"false flag,\" and separation. It does not allow these tactics to be used on lawful prisoners of war and establishes a Special Interagency Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies. The Task Force is tasked with evaluating interrogation practices in the Army Field Manual for use outside the military and recommending guidance for other departments or agencies. Legislative proposals in the 110th Congress aimed to amend the War Crimes Act to criminalize cruel treatment of protected persons in U.S. custody. The 110th Congress proposed amendments to the War Crimes Act to criminalize cruel treatment of protected persons in U.S. custody and ensure fair trials for war crimes. Additional proposals may be introduced in the 111th Congress to further modify the Act."
