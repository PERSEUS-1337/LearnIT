    "content": "Federal employees earn pension benefits under either the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) or the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). Military service can be added to civilian service for retirement eligibility. Employees may need to make a deposit to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) for military service to count towards their pension. The report focuses on how the required deposit amount is determined. The report discusses how military service can be credited towards a civil service pension, with specific rules based on the years of service, date of hire, and retirement system. Federal law differentiates between pre-1957 and post-1956 military service, employees hired before and after October 1, 1982, and those enrolled in CSRS or FERS. Congress established the Civil Service Retirement System in 1920. In 1920, Congress established the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) for federal employees to receive pensions. Employees and federal agencies contribute to prefund pensions, invested in U.S. Treasury bonds. Contributions are deducted from employee pay, starting at 2.5% and increasing to 7.0% since 1969. In 1986, Congress established the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) with employees contributing 0.8% of pay to the CSRDF for FERS pensions and 6.2% to Social Security. In 2012, the employee contribution for FERS was increased to 3.1% to the CSRDF and 6.2% to Social Security for new hires in 2013. In 2013, the contribution for FERS was further increased to 4.4% to the CSRDF for employees hired after December 31, 2013. The CSRS allowed veterans turned civilian federal employees to count military service towards retirement benefits without contribution. Congress granted wage credits under Social Security for wartime military service post World War II. Military service was brought under the Social Security Act in 1956. In 1946, the Social Security Act provided survivor benefits to World War II veterans' dependents. Amendments in 1950 granted wage credits for military service between 1940 and 1947. Veterans could choose to credit military service towards Social Security benefits or a civil service pension, but not both. Contributions to Social Security were not required for credit towards World War II service. In 1952, Congress amended the Social Security Act to grant wage credits for military service between July 1947 and January 1954. The amendments in 1953 and 1955 further extended wage credits for military service. Contributions were not required for these credits. In 1956, Congress addressed the issue of unfunded liability in Social Security trust funds by granting wage credits for military service performed before 1957. This law brought military service after 1956 fully under the Social Security Act, subjecting it to payroll taxes for future benefit accruals. Since 1957, military service has been subject to Social Security payroll taxes and counted as covered employment for benefits. Military service performed after 1956 is excluded from CSRS pension computation if eligible for Social Security. CSRS pensions are reduced by the amount attributable to military service when eligible for Social Security benefits, but not if ineligible for Social Security. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 (OBRA of 1982; P.L. 97-253) established a process for federal employees who are veterans of military service to avoid having their civil service pensions reduced when they become eligible for Social Security benefits. Veterans hired into civilian federal employment before October 1, 1982 can deposit an amount equal to the total of quarters of covered employment under Social Security into the CSRDF. Veterans hired into federal employment before October 1, 1982 can deposit an amount equal to the total deductions withheld from their basic military pay into the CSRDF to avoid pension reductions when eligible for Social Security. The required deposit is 7.0% of basic pay for CSRS enrollees and FERS enrollees. Employees enrolled in FERS must make a deposit of 3.0% of their total basic military pay to the CSRDF, which can be paid in a lump sum or through payroll deduction. Interest is charged on deposits made after October 1, 1985. Veterans hired into federal employment after September 30, 1982, must make a deposit to receive civil service retirement credit for post-1956 military service. For CSRS enrollees, the required deposit is 7.0% of total basic pay received during military service. Employees enrolled in FERS must make a deposit of 3.0% of their total basic military pay to the CSRDF. The deposit must be paid before separating from federal employment to ensure proper retirement annuity processing. Social Security coverage is mandated for federal employees hired after 1983. The Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 created a new retirement system for federal employees hired after 1983 or who transferred from the Civil Service Retirement System. Employees under FERS contribute to their civil service pensions and also pay Social Security payroll taxes. Employees under FERS contribute 6.2% of pay to the Social Security trust fund in addition to other contributions based on date of first hire. Employees under FERS contribute to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) based on their date of first hire, ranging from 0.8% to 4.4% of pay. The normal cost of prefunding a pension is determined by various factors like employee salaries, pension benefits, tenure, and future economic assumptions. The Office of Personnel Management estimates the normal cost of CSRS pensions. The Office of Personnel Management estimates the normal cost of CSRS and FERS pensions. Employee contributions for CSRS and FERS account for a portion of the total annual cost of prefunding retirement and survivor annuities. Contributions by federal agencies, interest earned on Treasury bonds, and transfers from Treasury revenues cover the majority of retirement costs. The OBRA of 1982 mandates federal employees hired after September 30, 1982, to deposit to the CSRDF for military service credit towards civil service annuities. CSRS employees must deposit 7.0% of total basic pay for military service, while FERS employees must deposit 3.0%. For FERS employees, the required contribution for military service credit is 3.0% of total basic pay, with slight variations based on the year of hire. The required contribution for military service credit under FERS is 3.0% of total basic pay, set by Congress to ensure equal percentages of total cost for civilian retirement annuity between CSRS and FERS employees. The required contribution for military service credit under FERS is 23.6% of the normal cost of a FERS annuity, paid out of the Treasury's general revenues. Contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund are invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Deposits for military service credit can be made without interest within specified time limits, but interest is charged if made after the deadline. Interest is charged on military service deposits made within three years of the OBRA of 1982 enactment. For deposits after October 1, 1985, interest accrues from that date. Interest rates change annually, with charges starting two years after hire for employees after September 30, 1982. CSRS employees accrue interest on October 1 each year, while FERS employees do so on their employment anniversary. Interest continues until deposit payment or retirement. Rates since 1985 are in Table 1. Veterans hired after January 1, 1996, could make interest-free deposits by January 1, 1998, to credit military service. When Congress established the Civil Service Retirement System in 1920, it allowed veterans of active-duty military service hired as federal employees to credit their military service towards a FERS annuity by making a deposit to the CSRDF before January 1, 1998. The deposit would be 3.0% of the basic pay received during military service, with interest charges applied if made after January 1, 1998. Interest rates change annually, and veterans hired after January 1, 1996, could make interest-free deposits by January 1, 1998. When Congress established the Civil Service Retirement System in 1920, it allowed veterans of active-duty military service hired as federal employees to credit their military service towards a FERS annuity by making a deposit to the CSRDF before January 1, 1998. Most current federal employees hired after September 30, 1982, and enrolled in FERS, must make a deposit equal to 3.0% of their total basic pay received during active-duty military service to have it credited towards a FERS annuity. Interest is charged if the deposit is made more than two years after the employee was hired, and deposits must be paid before separating from federal employment."
