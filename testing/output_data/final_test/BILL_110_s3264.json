Eligible entities must not be for-profit organizations or institutions, and nominations are solicited publicly before awards are given. The Excellence in Economic Development Awards program, established under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, includes categories such as urban/suburban, rural, environmental/energy, economic diversification, university-led, community/faith-based, and historic preservation-led strategies for economic development. The Secretary may determine additional award categories. Each selected entity may receive a plaque or similar article. The Secretary can allocate up to $2,000 per fiscal year for this program. SEC. 3. ENHANCEMENT OF RECIPIENT FLEXIBILITY TO DEAL WITH PROJECT ASSETS. The amendment allows recipients to request the conversion of project assets from a revolving loan fund if no longer needed, for better economic development use. The amendment allows recipients to convert project assets from a revolving loan fund by selling assets or retaining loan repayments. Recipients must use proceeds from asset sales to pay any outstanding debts. The amendment allows recipients to retain loan repayments for capital increase according to an approved strategic reuse plan by the Secretary. The Secretary may allocate not more than 2 percent of the amounts made available for program administration, including terms and conditions for assistance conversion and ensuring expeditious use of converted assistance.

MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT.\" Before providing investment assistance for a construction project, the Secretary must establish the expected period for the recipient to achieve economic development objectives. During this period, any property acquired or improved with assistance must be held in trust for the project's benefit, and the Secretary retains an interest in the property. The Secretary may terminate the reversionary interest in the property once the recipient fulfills their obligations for the applicable period, or if the recipient's economic development needs have changed. The recipient may request to terminate the Secretary's reversionary interest in the project property before the expected period ends, subject to approval by the Secretary. If a request to terminate the Secretary's reversionary interest in the project property is made within 10 years of receiving assistance, the recipient must repay 100 percent of the fair market value of the Federal share. If the request is made after the 10-year period, the recipient must repay the fair market value to the Secretary. The Secretary may establish terms and conditions, including extending the reversionary interest period for unsatisfactory performance. The Secretary may approve requests from recipients to convert property to a different use if the intended use no longer represents the best use of the property. The Secretary may approve requests from recipients to convert property to a different use, subject to the condition that the new use aligns with the purposes of the Act.
