The International Competition on Knowledge Engineering for Planning and Scheduling (ICKEPS) has been running since 2005 to promote the use of knowledge engineering methods in Automated Planning. The aim is to accelerate research, encourage sharing of tools, and improve the construction of reliable planning systems. The latest competition was held in 2016. The 2016 ICKEPS competition highlighted issues with existing planning systems, such as the lack of cooperation support and low participation. Knowledge engineering is crucial for domain-independent planning in real-world scenarios, but the planning community underestimates its importance. Accidental complexity issues can hinder the use of automated planning approaches in complex scenarios. In this paper, the format of past ICKEPS competitions is reviewed to identify weaknesses and strengths from both organizers' and participants' perspectives. Alternative formats are suggested to attract more participants. The aim is to review formats, suggest improvements to ICKEPS, and call for future competitions focused on knowledge engineering aspects of planning and scheduling. The first edition of ICKEPS in 2005 focused on tools for knowledge engineering, including knowledge formulation, planner configuration, domain model validation, and system maintenance. The competition had two stages: precompetition with paper submissions and on-site competition with tool presentations. The 2007 edition of ICKEPS extended the competition format by including a simulation stage where participants used their tools to encode models and submit plans for evaluation. Tools were judged by experts based on specific criteria. In 2007, the evaluation criteria for the competition were extended to include aspects related to simulation, such as domain simulation applicability and specific tools design. Judges assessed tools that support knowledge engineering technology and can generate solver-ready domain models quickly for real-world applications. The 2012 edition of ICKEPS 4 included two tracks: The Design Process Track focused on software engineering aspects and the Challenge Track evaluated the usefulness of tools in tackling complex application domains of Planning and Scheduling. Participants were given natural-language specifications of challenging scenarios to solve off-site. The participants in the ICKEPS 2012 Challenge Track had to demonstrate the advantage of using their tools to produce models for specified scenarios. Scenarios were not real-world applications but were inspired by games or potential domains. Participants had freedom in selecting scenarios and tools to use, with no restrictions. The ICKEPS 2012 Challenge Track allowed participants to use any tools with no restrictions, except for time and team size. Teams had to present their knowledge engineering process in a 10-minute demonstration, discussing work division, tools used, key decisions, and challenges faced. Evaluation focused on KE tools utilized and covered steps. The ICKEPS 2012 Challenge Track allowed participants to use any tools with no restrictions. Teams presented their knowledge engineering process in a 10-minute demonstration, discussing work division, tools used, key decisions, and challenges faced. Evaluation focused on KE tools utilized, model characteristics, and planners' performance. Expert jury awarded teams based on strengths and weaknesses observed. KE tools developed in past ICKEPS competitions have been beneficial for testing planning in real-world applications. The format of competition in knowledge engineering challenges can be challenging due to the availability of numerous tools, making it hard to provide innovative general tools. Designing and developing tools and techniques for these competitions is demanding, impacting the number of competitors. Comparing general tools can be cumbersome, especially when they support different aspects of knowledge engineering for planning. However, competitions focusing on specific aspects or languages can be useful for comparison and fostering work in overlooked areas, although they may limit community interest and participation. Off-site modelling and demonstration competitions pose a significant burden on organizers as they need to identify new application domains or angles within existing domains for automated planning. This allows for more complex cases to be considered compared to on-site competitions, fostering the use of principled knowledge engineering approaches. The format of on-site modelling competitions has pros and cons opposite to off-site competitions. The limited time in off-site modelling competitions restricts participants to \"toy\" examples, hindering the exploration of real-world planning applications. Despite the simplicity of models, these competitions, inspired by Hackathons, attract a wider audience and can highlight good practices in knowledge engineering. The knowledge obtained from past ICKEPS competitions suggests two possible structures for future competitions focusing on Specific Tool Design, such as automated domain model acquisition. This format can help foster tool development and establish standards for future work in the area. Automated domain model acquisition in Specific Tool Design competitions can specify input information, output expectations, and quantifiable metrics for tool evaluation. These metrics can be tailored to application domains, promoting the development of critical tools for Planning and Scheduling. Objective evaluation through quantifying metrics can reduce subjective judgments and ease the burden on competition organizers. Automated domain model acquisition in competitions like ICKEPS can reduce the burden on organizers by focusing on a narrower scope. A suggested format for future competitions involves a mix of off-site and on-site modeling to exploit the strengths of both. Participants would model \"not so easy\" application domains in a planning language and demonstrate the capabilities of planning engines. In the online stage, participants would modify their models based on provided specifications and evaluate them on planning instances. This approach aims to encourage the use of principled KE approaches in formulating domain models. The idea is to promote the use of principled KE approaches for creating domain models, focusing on robustness and maintenance. Organizers need to select challenging yet manageable application domains for competitions like ICKEPS to increase awareness of KE techniques in the AI community. Success in these competitions can make AI planning more accessible across various domains. In this paper, a review of past ICKEPS competitions is provided, along with suggestions for new formats to attract more participants and reduce the burden on organizers. The aim is to initiate a discussion on the future format of ICKEPS competitions and motivate potential organizers to take the lead in organizing upcoming competitions."
