    "content": "The State Partnership Program (SPP) is a Department of Defense (DOD) security cooperation program run by the National Guard. It aims to improve partner nations' capabilities, strengthen relationships, enhance cultural awareness, and integrate reserve and active component forces into a \"total force.\" The program originated in 1992 to assist former Soviet Union nations in defense reform and has since expanded significantly. The State Partnership Program (SPP) is a significant component of DOD's security cooperation efforts, linking state and territorial National Guards in partnerships with 70 partner nations. Nearly every state National Guard participates in the SPP, including Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. Congressional scrutiny has focused on the conformity of SPP activities with the law, program effectiveness, and its alignment with the priorities of U.S. combatant commanders and ambassadors abroad. The State Partnership Program (SPP) is a key part of DOD's security cooperation efforts, connecting state National Guards with 70 partner nations. The program aims to promote civilian leadership, human rights, and a defensive military posture in former Soviet bloc nations. USEUCOM led the initiative to establish military-to-military contacts with Central and Eastern European states after the Soviet Union's collapse. The Joint Contact Team Program (JCTP) was established by USEUCOM in 1992, initially with active component personnel and special forces. However, National Guard and Reserve personnel were later included when engaging with Baltic nations. In 1993, the National Guard initiated the first state partnerships with New York-Estonia. In early 1993, the National Guard established the first state partnerships with New York-Estonia, Michigan-Latvia, and Pennsylvania-Lithuania. Additional partnerships were proposed later that year for several other countries. The State Partnership Program (SPP) provided personnel, funding, and access to military personnel with relevant language and cultural skills. Today, USEUCOM has 22 state partnerships, and the SPP has expanded to other combatant commands. United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) and United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) also have multiple partnerships with various countries. The State Partnership Program (SPP) was established in the early 1990s with partnerships like Louisiana-Belize, Kentucky-Ecuador, and West Virginia-Peru. USPACOM, USAFRICOM, and USNORTHCOM also have partnerships with different states and countries. The SPP conducts various activities to support partner nations, such as subject matter expert exchanges. The State Partnership Program (SPP) conducts subject matter expert exchanges where National Guard personnel share expertise with partner nation personnel. For example, in 2005, U.S. Army National Guardsmen visited Uruguayan Army units for discussions on various topics including peacekeeping and infantry training. Familiarizations showcase National Guard capabilities or discuss related policy issues. In the late 1990s, the Pennsylvania National Guard assisted Lithuania in developing their Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Academy. 26 Lithuanian officers visited Pennsylvania for curriculum development for the NCO course at the Lithuanian NCO Academy in Kaunas, covering topics such as medical specialist instructor course development, leadership, and emergency operations. The Georgia National Guard hosted representatives from the Republic of Georgia and US officials for high-level discussions on Defense Reform, State Partnership Program, and Border Security. They also observed a B-1B bombing demonstration and activities at the Combat Readiness Training Center. The Operational Mentor and Liaison Teams provide mentoring and training for the Afghan National Army. The Operational Mentor and Liaison Teams (OMLTs) serve as liaisons between the ANA and ISAF in Afghanistan, composed of 13-30 personnel from one or more countries. National Guard personnel embed with partner nation forces to train and mentor them in infantry maneuvers and tactics. For example, in 2010, Colorado Army National Guard Soldiers paired with Slovenian soldiers to mentor an Afghan National Army infantry battalion. The National Guard and the Republic of Slovenia have collaborated for 17 years through the State Partnership Program, focusing on disaster management, military education, search and rescue, and other activities. The SPP is based on various statutory authorities used for security cooperation activities. The State Partnership Program (SPP) is unique in its ability to forge long-term relationships between individuals, particularly National Guard personnel, and foreign military partners. Unlike active component personnel who typically have short duty assignments with foreign nations, National Guard personnel may engage with partner nation military repeatedly throughout their career due to the long-standing partnerships between state National Guard and foreign nations. The State Partnership Program (SPP) allows National Guard personnel to build enduring relationships with foreign military partners over nearly two decades. This long-term engagement fosters strong connections and opportunities for cultural knowledge and language skills development. The State Partnership Program (SPP) allows National Guard personnel to develop cultural knowledge and language skills through recurring contacts with foreign military partners. The National Guard's dual status as both a state and federal organization enables it to conduct a wide range of military activities, including disaster response, civil disorder control, counterdrug missions, border security, and airport security. National Guard personnel develop skills in their civilian occupations, such as state trooper or paramedic. Their expertise in disaster response, border security, and counterdrug operations is in demand by foreign militaries. Active component forces also have expertise in these areas but not exercised as frequently as National Guard forces. The National Guard forces have a limited supply for security cooperation activities with foreign nations, targeting those deemed most important. Some nations may not compete well and are passed over. Despite partnership priorities, roughly three SPP events per year are conducted even for lower priority nations, seen as a long-term investment or a misallocation of resources. The State Partnership Program (SPP) differs from active component security cooperation activities in the role of individual states in the relationship, providing a link between senior state and foreign nation officials through the adjutant general. The State Partnership Program (SPP) facilitates relationships between individual states and foreign nations, beyond just the National Guard, to enhance economic ties and educational exchanges. This can potentially strengthen the overall relationship between the United States and the partner nation. However, conflicts of interest may arise between the state and the federal government. The SPP operates under various authorities related to Armed Forces and National Guard missions. The State Partnership Program (SPP) operates under various authorities, including Title 22 and 10 U.S.C. 168, which allows for funding military-to-military contacts to encourage democratic orientation in defense establishments of other countries. The State Partnership Program (SPP) operates under various authorities, including Title 22 and 10 U.S.C. 168, allowing for funding military-to-military contacts to promote democratic values in foreign defense establishments. SPP activities include military liaison teams, personnel exchanges, seminars, conferences, publications distribution, and personnel expenses related to these activities. Additionally, reimbursement for reserve component personnel and non-reciprocal personnel assignments can be authorized by the Secretary of Defense. The State Partnership Program (SPP) operates under various authorities, including 10 U.S.C. 1051 for funding military-to-military contacts. This provision authorizes payment of travel expenses for defense personnel of developing countries attending conferences. An amendment in 2002 extended this authority to NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) country personnel. Section 1050 is similar but applies specifically to Latin American countries. The Secretary of Defense must determine if payment of expenses is in the interest of U.S. national security. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to provide special compensation for officers and students of Latin American and African countries, as well as cover expenses for cooperation. Additionally, there are provisions for funding incremental expenses for developing countries participating in military exercises to enhance US security interests. Another set of authorities focus on humanitarian and civic assistance. The Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster Assistance, and Civic Assistance (OHDACA) programs, authorized by 10 U.S.C. 401 and 2561, allow DOD to conduct humanitarian and civic assistance activities in host nations to promote security interests and benefit armed forces personnel. Activities include medical care, construction, well drilling, and transportation systems. The provision authorizes the expenditure of humanitarian assistance funds for transportation and other purposes. Other authorities like 10 U.S.C. 402, 404, and 2557 can also be used. Security cooperation authorities, including 10 U.S.C. 2249c and \"Section 1206,\" have been utilized in conjunction with SPP activities. The Building Partnership Capacity Funding Authority, established by Section 1206 of the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act, funds the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program for preventing weapons proliferation. National Guard members participating in SPP events receive military pay and benefits under specific authorities. Current funding includes pay and allowances from DOD appropriations for National Guard participants, with full-time overseas support covered separately. The State Partnership Program (SPP) covers pay and allowances for full-time overseas support by active component Army or Air Force personnel. Other costs include travel expenses like transportation, lodging, and meals, which are typically paid for out of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) accounts. Funding for SPP comes from various programs and activities such as Traditional Combatant Commander's Activities (TCA) and the Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program (CFTP). The State Partnership Program (SPP) is managed by SPP coordinators and military officers assigned to U.S. embassies in partner nations. These officers are in a Title 10 status and typically hold the rank of Captain through Lieutenant Colonel. They are responsible for coordinating SPP and other DOD security cooperation activities. Officers assigned to U.S. embassies in partner nations hold the rank of Captain through Lieutenant Colonel and have different titles and duties based on the COCOM. For example, Bilateral Affairs Officers (BAOs) in USEUCOM serve two-year tours, while Traditional Commander's Activities coordinators (TCAs) in USSOUTHCOM have six-month assignments. The National Guard Bureau aims to have officers stationed at each embassy for SPP activities, pending approval from the U.S. ambassador. The approval process for State Partnership Program (SPP) activities in a given country involves multiple levels of approval, including the ambassador, combatant commander, and state National Guard. Proposed activities are developed with partner countries, approved by the home state National Guard, and then presented to the ambassador and combatant commander for final approval. Concerns have been raised about past SPP events involving funding for engagements beyond the scope of the law. Some concerns have been raised about State Partnership Program (SPP) activities, including funding beyond the scope of the law and lack of effective linkage to priorities. There are worries about DOD security cooperation activities extending military influence too far into foreign policy domains. Engagement with civilian officials from partner nations' health, public safety, or transportation ministries may be required for coordinating assistance. 10 U.S.C. 168 focuses on military-to-military contacts, with authorized activities involving U.S. or foreign military personnel. Concerns have been raised about past State Partnership Program (SPP) events funding civilian participation outside statutory scope, leading to regulations and reporting requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010. During 2009 and 2010, the State Partnership Program (SPP) spent over $1 million annually on civilian engagement activities, with concerns about compliance with statutory requirements. Combatant commanders are now required to ensure that foreign civilians participating in SPP events are requested by the partner country's Ministry of Defense and contribute to its mission. The SPP no longer funds non-defense related civilian engagements. The State Partnership Program (SPP) acts as a \"clearing house\" for information between civilian parties from the state and partner nation. Concerns have been raised about the lack of coordination with combatant commands and U.S. embassies, leading to activities not aligning with priorities. The National Guard Bureau has implemented procedures to address this issue. The State Partnership Program (SPP) ensures coordination with combatant commands and U.S. embassies for funded activities in foreign countries. Approval by combatant commanders and the chief of mission is required to align activities with priorities. Implementation will determine the extent of alignment, potentially allowing events with limited connection to priorities to be approved. Some SPP activities, like the \"Section 1206\" global train and equip authority and humanitarian assistance, have raised concerns about the militarization of U.S. foreign assistance. Critics argue that these activities, previously under State Department authority, may not align with long-term development goals in recipient countries. The National Guard's involvement in foreign activities raises concerns about militarization of U.S. foreign assistance. The Senate's National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 allowed funds to be used for the State Partnership Program (SPP) activities conducted by the National Guard. The FY2010 NDAA allowed funds for the State Partnership Program (SPP) activities conducted by the National Guard, with provisions for joint approval by combatant commanders and U.S. embassy chiefs. Other federal agencies could participate in SPP activities, reimbursing DOD for costs. Revised language required the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to regulate funds for National Guard activities under the SPP. The FY2010 NDAA allowed funds for State Partnership Program (SPP) activities conducted by the National Guard, with provisions for joint approval by combatant commanders and U.S. embassy chiefs. The revised language included a prohibition on funds being expended for SPP activities in foreign countries unless jointly approved, dropped language on participation and reimbursement by other federal agencies, and added a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on civilian engagement activities under the SPP. The National Guard Bureau (NGB) issued guidance in October 2010 for State Partnership Program (SPP) events, emphasizing the importance of partner nation involvement and alignment with U.S. security objectives. The Department of Defense (DOD) is finalizing a Directive Type Memorandum (DTM) to regulate SPP funding use, as mandated by the FY2010 NDAA. Congressional committees are to receive reports on civilian engagement activities under the SPP. The State Partnership Program (SPP) spent over $1 million annually on civilian engagement activities from 2009 to 2010. Concerns have been raised about funding for U.S. and foreign civilians participating in SPP events. The NGB issued guidance to prevent unauthorized funding, and the DOD is expected to release a Directive Type Memorandum to specify authorized SPP activities. The State Department, in collaboration with the National Guard, conducted a survey of U.S. ambassadors regarding the State Partnership Program (SPP). Most respondents found the SPP valuable in meeting their goals. However, assessments of the program have been limited in scope, focusing on outputs rather than outcomes. This lack of data is not unique to the SPP, according to a recent RAND report. According to a recent RAND report, the lack of data is common in security cooperation programs, making it challenging to determine their impact on U.S. objectives. Program assessments are inconsistent and often lack objectivity, with a comprehensive framework for assessment currently lacking. Efforts are being made to address these issues. The NGB's International Affairs Division is developing \"measures of effectiveness\" to assess progress towards program goals. Some policymakers may advocate for a larger State Department role in SPP administration and oversight, especially if concerned about DOD's expansion into foreign assistance activities. The Secretary of State is responsible for overseeing all military education and training programs, regardless of their title under Title 22 or Title 10 authorities. Some policymakers and analysts are concerned about the increasing role of the Department of Defense in security assistance and cooperation programs, which they believe may hinder coherent U.S. foreign policymaking. However, others see security cooperation as a vital competency of the military and support a broader DOD role in this area. Current security cooperation activities are authorized under various legislation, with some requiring State Department involvement, but mandates are inconsistent. Some security cooperation activities require State Department approval, while others do not have a statutory requirement for State Department involvement. Coordination between the Department of Defense and the State Department is established informally for certain programs. The State Department does not have a systematic role in overseeing all State Partnership Program (SPP) programs globally. State Department involvement is focused at the embassy level, where approval of SPP proposals is required. Country desk officers handle issues arising from SPP missions, and the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and Office of the Special Representative for Global Intergovernmental Affairs engage with the National Guard Bureau on policy matters related to the SPP. The expansion of the State Partnership Program (SPP) to 63 partnerships over the past two decades necessitates a new, unified SPP authority to replace multiple existing authorities. A dedicated SPP statute could establish clear purposes, standardize coordination, and regulate funding. Currently, oversight is fragmented, with the National Guard Bureau and Combatant Commands each overseeing funded activities. A lack of standardized oversight may have led to past confusion. The State Partnership Program (SPP) may have caused confusion in the past due to a lack of clear oversight. Suggestions for improvement include focusing on specific mission sets, allowing greater civilian participation, and involving a wider range of foreign civilians. However, these proposed changes were met with criticism. The National Guard, as both a state and federal entity, plays a unique role as a reserve component of the Army and Air Force. The National Guard serves as a reserve component of the Army and Air Force federally, focusing on military skills development. At the state level, it emphasizes emergency management for natural disasters and civil disorders. Supporters suggest reshaping the State Partnership Program to leverage the National Guard's expertise in these areas, but concerns exist about potential inconsistencies in training. The State Partnership Program (SPP) could be adapted to include federal, state, and local government employees alongside National Guard participants, based on their civilian skills. This would provide a broader array of expertise for events in foreign countries, such as emergency management. The National Guard could expand the State Partnership Program (SPP) to include civilian government employees with expertise in areas like law enforcement. This would enhance the program's effectiveness in supporting U.S. objectives abroad. Concerns about information consistency and program management may arise with this shift, potentially leading to the Department of State (DOS) taking a more prominent role in overseeing the program. The NGB issued guidance for SPP events funded by them, limiting participation by foreign civilians. Some argue these restrictions do not align well with foreign governments' structures, hindering fruitful cooperation. Supporters argue that foreign civilian agencies play a critical role in national stability and security, advancing U.S. security interests. DOD regulations for SPP funding under the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act are being finalized, with a Directive Type Memorandum (DTM) to be converted into a Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) for monitoring by Congress. The DTM under the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act aims to monitor SPP funding and provide Congress with additional information for potential codification. However, due to existing statutory guidance, it may have limitations in resolving tensions related to mission types, participants, and oversight. Congress may need to review SPP program goals, assessment methodology, and event support for key plans to ensure cost-effective contributions to U.S. objectives. This could be achieved through committee hearings, periodic reports, or directed reviews. The current lack of centralized oversight in the SPP program may lead to administration mistakes. To improve program administration, one organization could be given approval authority over all SPP activities. However, this could also make event coordination more cumbersome. The SPP program's lack of centralized oversight may lead to administration mistakes, making event coordination cumbersome. Congress may need to establish specific parameters for SPP activities to ensure appropriate use of funds and oversight. This could involve codifying guidance or developing its own guidelines if DOD's guidance lacks necessary elements. If Congress chooses to codify the State Partnership Program (SPP) into law, it may restrict current activities and impose new requirements. Some suggested modifications include focusing on missions where the National Guard has expertise and allowing a wider range of civilians to participate. Congress should pay attention to specific areas if they decide to formalize the program. Congress may include language detailing the scope of authorized activities, participation of U.S. citizens, and types of foreign personnel in the State Partnership Program (SPP). It may establish standardized programs of instruction for non-military topics and funding mechanisms for state, local, or private sector individuals. Congress may also address the effectiveness of SPP by defining program goals, assessment methodology, and assessment frequency in any SPP statute. The State Partnership Program (SPP) may be governed by a new statute that assigns responsibilities, requires periodic reports, and determines assessment frequency. There is a debate on whether SPP should fall under Title 10 or Title 22 of the U.S. Code, with arguments for each based on current activities and funding sources. Some prefer Title 10 for flexibility and implementation ease, while others advocate for Title 22 due to past State Department involvement in training activities with foreign partners. Placing the State Partnership Program (SPP) under Title 22 could lead to greater State Department oversight and a shift towards a public diplomacy role. This could allow for the use of National Guard troops for activities utilizing their civilian skills and broaden the range of SPP activities beyond just military training. Placing SPP under Title 22 may complicate state-based organizations' interactions with the Department of State, potentially reducing combatant commanders' interest in engaging with foreign militaries through the program. It could shift focus from military skills to civilian expertise, limiting the program's utility in military training. State Department oversight capacity for military programs may need augmentation before adding additional duties. The State Partnership Program (SPP) currently operates under Title 10, Title 32, and National Defense Authorization Act authorities. SPP events do not occur under Title 22 authorities at present, but there are circumstances where a state National Guard might operate under Title 22 authorities to support their partner nation, such as providing trainers for peacekeeping training under the Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI). The State Partnership Program (SPP) operates under Title 10, Title 32, and National Defense Authorization Act authorities. While SPP events do not occur under Title 22, state National Guards may use Title 22 authorities for training with partner nations, including the Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) for peacekeeping skills development. Funding for Title 22 programs comes from the State Department's Security Assistance account. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) program, built on the African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) program, provides training in peacekeeping skills and capacity development. The State Department, in collaboration with the Department of Defense (DOD), implements the program through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) and Combatant Commands. Authorization for GPOI is under Section 551 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Additionally, the International Military Education and Training Program (IMET) offers foreign military personnel opportunities to attend U.S. military educational institutions and training courses, including the Expanded-IMET (E-IMET) component for foreign civilian and military leaders. The Foreign Military Sales and Foreign Military Financing Programs provide opportunities for foreign military leaders to enhance their skills in managing military establishments, budgets, judicial systems, and codes of conduct. The State Department, with input from DOD, decides which countries can participate and their funding levels. Authorization is provided by Section 541 of the Foreign Assistance Act. The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) Programs provide loans or forgiveness of payments for countries in need of military equipment. The State Department determines which nations receive assistance, while DOD's DSCA implements the program. FMS is authorized by the Arms Export Control Act, and FMF is authorized by a section of the same act."
