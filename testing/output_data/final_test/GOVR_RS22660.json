    "content": "Members of Congress have introduced legislation to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow the importation of FDA-approved drugs from lower-priced foreign sources. Senator Dorgan introduced S. 1232, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2009, which addresses drug importation issues. The report provides a comparison of S. 1232 to current law regarding drug importation. The legislation aims to reduce the financial burden of prescription drugs on U.S. consumers while ensuring safety and effectiveness. Current law prohibits importing prescription drugs, except by manufacturers, with provisions for pharmacists and wholesalers pending HHS certification for safety and cost savings. The HHS certifies that the importation program would be safe and offer cost savings to U.S. consumers. Secretaries in both the Clinton and Bush Administrations have declined to provide that certification, citing safety and cost concerns. Despite debates, Congress included importation provisions in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. The Obama Administration has shown openness to drug importation activities, proposing to allow Americans to buy safe and effective drugs from other countries. The FDA is considering policy options for drug importation, which is currently not allowed for individuals. The Secretary may permit importation for personal use under certain conditions. The FDA has been lenient in enforcing the prohibition, allowing individuals to bring in a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use. The FDA's personal use import policy allows individuals to bring in drugs for their own use with certain conditions. Legislation like S. 1232 aims to modify current laws to allow pharmacists, wholesalers, and individuals to import prescription drugs with potential safeguards for safety and effectiveness. S. 1232 aims to modify current laws regarding the importation of prescription drugs to ensure safety and effectiveness, as well as to influence industry behavior for cost savings. The bill would require manufacturers to notify the HHS Secretary of any differences between imported drugs and FDA-approved drugs for sale in the U.S. It also includes provisions for administrative arrangements and financing. S. 1232 aims to permit prescription drug importation from select countries, with safety measures in place to prevent adulterated or counterfeit drugs from entering the U.S. market. The legislation includes criteria for adding more countries to the list and requires Canadian establishments involved in drug distribution to register with the Secretary. S. 1232 would require exporters and importers to register, ensuring a monitored chain of custody for imported drugs. This includes ongoing physical monitoring of manufacturing facilities and inspections along the chain of custody to verify drug authenticity. S. 1232 would mandate the use of overt, optically variable, counterfeit-resistant technologies in the packaging of all prescription drugs, similar to those used in U.S. currency. Manufacturers must incorporate these technologies into various packaging elements. Exporters and importers must mark each shipping container to show compliance with registration conditions, including anti-counterfeiting or track-and-trace technology. S. 1232 would require detailed information on Internet pharmacy websites, including pharmacist credentials and prescription requirements. The bill includes restrictions on dispensing drugs without a valid U.S. prescription and the need for a qualifying medical relationship with the patient. These provisions were written before the passage of the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008. The current law does not address Internet sales of imported prescription drugs, so S. 1232 may need technical revisions. It includes provisions to prevent manufacturers from unfairly discriminating against exporters, importers, or distributors of imported drugs. S. 1232 aims to address the issue of drug manufacturers creating different versions of drugs for distribution in permitted countries to restrict importation. A recent federal court case allowed manufacturers to block U.S. imports of drugs sold abroad by exercising patent rights. The bill would reverse this precedent by allowing imported goods from authorized foreign sales by U.S. patent holders into the United States without restrictions. S. 1232 proposes a fee mechanism to fund the importation program of drugs sold abroad by U.S. patent holders into the United States. It includes exporter and importer fees to cover program costs, with a limit of 2.5% of the total drug price. The Secretary would collect flat and proportional registration fees from each exporter and importer based on their activity level. S. 1232 proposes fees for importers and exporters to fund the drug importation program, with fees based on activity level. The Secretary would collect fees to cover program costs, with a limit of 2.5% of the total drug price. Importation provisions would allow for personal use with safety certification. The Secretary must promulgate rules within one year. S. 1232 proposes fees for importers and exporters to fund the drug importation program, with fees based on activity level.

The Secretary must promulgate rules within one year. Implementation regulations for registered exporters and importers from permitted countries are required within specific timeframes after enactment. If any provision of the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2009 is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the act remains unaffected.
