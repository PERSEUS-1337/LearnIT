    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nonprofit Energy Efficiency Act\" and includes a provision for an Energy Efficiency Retrofit Pilot Program. Definitions in this section include the term \"applicant\" as a nonprofit organization applying for a grant, and \"energy-efficiency improvement\" as a measure that reduces energy demand in nonprofit buildings. This improvement can involve repairing, replacing, or installing various components like roofs and electrical wiring. The curr_chunk discusses the different components that qualify as energy-efficiency improvements, including roofs, electrical wiring, plumbing, windows, doors, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. It also includes renewable energy generation systems like solar, wind, and biomass. The curr_chunk defines a nonprofit building as one owned and operated by a nonprofit organization, including hospitals, youth centers, schools, social-welfare program facilities, houses of worship, and other nonresidential buildings. The Secretary of Energy will establish a pilot program to provide grants for retrofitting nonprofit buildings with energy-efficiency improvements. Grants may be awarded based on criteria set by the Secretary upon receiving an application from eligible applicants. The Secretary will award grants for retrofitting nonprofit buildings with energy-efficiency improvements based on performance-based criteria prioritizing cost-effectiveness and evaluation plans. Grants will not exceed 50% of the improvement cost or $200,000, with a 50% non-Federal cost-sharing requirement. In-kind contributions can be used as the non-Federal share for grants awarded for retrofitting nonprofit buildings with energy-efficiency improvements. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2016 for this purpose. Section 399A(i) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to allocate $200,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2016 for retrofitting nonprofit buildings with energy-efficiency improvements."
