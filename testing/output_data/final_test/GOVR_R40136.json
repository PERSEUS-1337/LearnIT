    "content": "The President, as commander-in-chief, has the authority to restrict the flow of intelligence information to Congress, leading to conflict between the legislative and executive branches. Recent incidents like the Fort Hood shootings and the Christmas Day bombing have brought this issue to the forefront. Recent incidents like the Fort Hood shootings and the Christmas Day bombing have highlighted the sensitivity of Congress's need to be informed about intelligence activities. While some Members of Congress are satisfied with the executive branch's efforts to share information, others criticize the White House for not keeping them adequately informed about national security issues. The White House has been criticized for hindering Congress from accessing important national security information. The executive branch, including the President and top officials, have greater access to sensitive intelligence compared to Members of Congress. This control over intelligence allows the President and his advisors to assess the quality of the Intelligence Community more accurately. The President and his senior advisors, with their greater access to intelligence and active involvement in foreign policy, are better positioned than Congress to assess the quality of intelligence. They can gather additional information and impressions that are generally unavailable to Congress, providing them with a unique perspective to judge intelligence. The President has control over intelligence dissemination to Congress as the Intelligence Community is part of the executive branch. While the President is considered the \"owner\" of national intelligence, they are obligated to keep Congress informed. The executive branch cannot withhold intelligence information from congressional intelligence committees. In 2004, Congress strengthened its access to national intelligence by directing the Director of National Intelligence to provide the legislative branch with access. Congress previously required the head of the Intelligence Community to provide national intelligence to the legislative branch \"where appropriate,\" but did not define what was considered appropriate. Despite the directive in 2004, the impact on the Intelligence Community depends on how aggressively Congress asserts its access claims. The U.S. Congress has asserted its legal authority for unrestricted access to national intelligence, while the executive branch argues it is not obligated to provide such access. The issue has not been addressed by the U.S. courts, and the Committees interpret the law to decide how they will access intelligence. The U.S. Congress asserts its legal authority for access to national intelligence, while the executive branch argues against unrestricted access. Congress interprets the law to determine how they will access intelligence information, with a focus on protecting sources and methods. There is a lack of formal written rules governing the sharing and handling of national intelligence, leading to accommodations between the branches when compelling needs arise. The current system of intelligence sharing between Congress and the executive branch is shaped by experience and lacks hard-and-fast rules. Efforts have been made to provide tailored intelligence products to Members of Congress, but it is unclear if a comprehensive report was produced. Intelligence committees aim to keep members informed of relevant intelligence. In FY 2006, the SSCI required the Intelligence Community to provide sensitive intelligence information within 15 days of a request from congressional intelligence committee leaders. Efforts have been made to address Gang of Eight notifications for covert actions. The Gang of Eight provision in the FY2010 Intelligence Authorization bill allows limited notification to key congressional leaders for covert actions. The House Intelligence Committee replaced this provision with written procedures, while the Senate Intelligence Committee kept the Gang of Eight structure unchanged but required full committee notification for covert actions. The FY2010 Intelligence Authorization bill included the Gang of Eight provision for limited notification to key congressional leaders regarding covert actions. The enacted legislation required the President to notify all intelligence committee members if notifications were only provided to the Gang of Eight, along with a general description of the planned activity. The executive branch typically does not share certain types of intelligence information with Congress. The President's Daily Brief (PDB) is a highly sensitive intelligence product briefed daily to the President and a few senior policymakers. It contains current intelligence and is limited to protect against leaks. The executive branch officials emphasize the need to protect sensitive information to prevent leaks that could endanger sources and intelligence methods. Congress is not routinely provided with details on intelligence methods due to security concerns. Officials restrict congressional access to raw intelligence due to security concerns, including the risk of exposing sources and methods. They argue that unanalyzed intelligence could lead to dangerous policy decisions by members of Congress. Additionally, they believe that revealing collection methods could compromise intelligence efforts. The Intelligence Community argues that Congress lacks the capacity to securely store raw intelligence and restricts access to tailored intelligence products like PDBs. Providing such products to Congress could compromise sources, methods, and operational information. Community analysts have limited access to intelligence information, while congressional intelligence officials question the executive branch's security concerns regarding raw intelligence. Congress has occasionally obtained intelligence information from the executive branch, such as during investigations into CIA covert operations in Nicaragua. During investigations into CIA covert operations in Nicaragua in the 1980s, intelligence committees obtained identities of sources and access to raw intelligence. Committee members have also requested raw intelligence to verify Intelligence Community judgments. However, administrations have been reluctant to share certain intelligence information, as seen in President Bush's rejection of a request to review a PDB related to the September 11th attacks in 2002. The Bush Administration denied requests by the SSCI to review PDBs related to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and links to terrorists. Critics faulted President Obama for not keeping Congress informed on national security issues, such as the Fort Hood shootings. Congress usually has access to finished intelligence reports. The executive branch has increased the volume of finished intelligence products provided to Congress over time, following investigations by special congressional committees in the mid-1970s. Congressional access to intelligence information was limited before then. The Intelligence Community has been working to balance source protection with providing more information to Congress since the mid-1970s. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence criticized the Community for not disclosing enough details about their sources in the 2002 NIE on Iraq. The Intelligence Community has faced criticism for withholding relevant source information from analysts, leading to a lack of fully informed judgments. The DNI implemented a new policy in 2007 to provide more structured sourcing information to improve analysts' understanding of the information they receive. The DNI's new policy aims to improve analysts' understanding of intelligence sources, but some critics argue it may hinder analysts' ability to provide informed views. Limited impact has been observed, with analysts still struggling to assess source reliability due to lack of access to information. The executive branch receives intelligence information primarily through briefings initiated by congressional committees or members. Sensitive information may be discussed, but if deemed too sensitive, only select members or staff directors are briefed. The Administration is not legally obligated to share all intelligence with Congress, potentially withholding certain sensitive information. Congress, particularly its intelligence committees, could explore ways to ensure full and current information sharing on intelligence activities. The FY2010 Intelligence Authorization Act granted full committee membership access to extremely sensitive intelligence previously limited to leadership. Congress could also assess source transparency and require the DNI to make changes if needed. The committees could make a more concerted effort to oversee intelligence activities. Congress could explore mechanisms to achieve more equal footing with executive branch policymakers as consumers of intelligence. This could involve requiring joint presentations by analysts and collectors, ensuring access to detailed sourcing information in critical situations, and overall improving oversight of intelligence activities. Congress could improve its role as a consumer of intelligence by becoming a more disciplined consumer, which would help assess the quality of the Intelligence Community's analysis and collection."
