    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Elderly Housing Plus Health Support Demonstration Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Congress finds that the elderly population is growing rapidly, with estimates of 70,000,000 persons by 2030. Vulnerable groups such as women, minorities, and the oldest old are at risk in terms of housing and economic stability. Many elderly persons face significant housing challenges, with 1,700,000 low-income senior households spending over half of their incomes on housing. Public housing is the largest federal program for seniors, with over 1,000,000 elderly Americans residing in such housing. These seniors are older, poorer, frailer, and more racially diverse compared to those in other assisted housing. Two-thirds of public housing developments for the elderly also serve the disabled. Many public housing developments for elderly and disabled individuals, built before 1970, require major rehabilitation for new roofs, energy-efficient systems, safety features like sprinklers and fire alarms. Units are often undersized, inaccessible, and non-compliant with ADA requirements, lacking necessary amenities. A recent study by HUD highlighted the significant modernization needs for this demographic in public housing. The need for public housing for elderly and disabled persons exceeds $5.7 billion. Many face unnecessary institutionalization due to lack of supportive services. Independent living is preferred by many and congregate housing with coordinated services is cost-effective for enabling independence. The Act aims to establish a program for competitive grants to provide health-supportive housing with assisted living for elderly and disabled individuals in public housing. It also seeks to enhance public housing developments for the elderly and disabled, increase accessibility to supportive services, and offer living arrangement choices through service coordinators. The program aims to provide health-supportive housing with assisted living for elderly and disabled individuals in public housing. It also aims to enhance public housing for the elderly and disabled by incorporating congregate housing service programs more fully into operations. Funding will be provided under existing provisions of law to support these initiatives. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will implement an elderly housing plus health support demonstration program to show the effectiveness of coordinated funding for selected public housing projects for elderly and disabled families. This includes rehabilitating projects, providing space for supportive services and health facilities, service coordinators, and congregate services programs. To be eligible for the demonstration program, a public housing agency must submit an application and a plan to the Secretary. The plan must identify designated public housing projects for elderly or elderly and disabled families, and include provisions for local agencies to provide health-related services and enhance living conditions for residents. The Secretary will select public housing agencies based on competition and criteria including the need for rehabilitation activities, past performance in serving elderly or disabled residents, and success in obtaining resources for residents. The effectiveness of agency plans in creating or expanding services for residents, including housing resources. SEC. 5. CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. The Secretary will provide assistance from the Capital Fund for capital improvements to rehabilitate public housing projects or provide space for supportive services and community facilities. The allocation of funds will be based on specific criteria for public housing agencies participating in the demonstration program. Authorization of Appropriations: $250,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2001 for the Capital Fund under the United States Housing Act of 1937, with additional funding as needed for subsequent years. SEC. 6. SERVICE COORDINATORS. The Secretary will provide grants to public housing agencies for elderly and disabled families to improve access to services that support health and well-being. The grants will be used for public housing projects with capital assistance under section 5 of the Act. The Secretary will provide grants to public housing agencies for elderly and disabled families to improve access to services that support health and well-being. Each agency selected will receive a grant of up to $400,000. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2001, with additional funding as needed for subsequent years. The Congregate Housing Services Program is established under Section 7. The Secretary will provide grants to public housing agencies for congregate housing service programs for elderly and disabled families, in connection with public housing projects receiving capital assistance. These grants will be used in accordance with specific sections of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and the Housing Act of 1959. The Secretary will provide grants to public housing agencies for congregate housing service programs for elderly and disabled families. Grants will not exceed $750,000 per agency. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2001 for these grants. SEC. 8.
