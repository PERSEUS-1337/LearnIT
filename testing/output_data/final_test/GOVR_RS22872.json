Critics argue that many parties lack clear ideologies and are primarily focused on serving the interests of their members and financial backers. Despite high-level corruption, Latvia has maintained a consistent course of building democratic institutions, strengthening the rule of law, establishing a free-market economy, and integrating into NATO and the EU. The current government is led by Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis. Latvia's current government, led by Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis of the LPP-LC, was formed in December 2007 after the fall of the previous government. The coalition holds a slender majority in the parliament. In September 2007, the previous Prime Minister attempted to fire the head of Latvia's Corruption Monitoring and Prevention Bureau, sparking street demonstrations. Latvia's government fell in December 2007 after street demonstrations forced the parliament to drop an effort. The thin majority may lead to earlier elections. President Valdis Zatlers, a surprise choice with no prior political experience, was elected in July 2007. The Loskutovs affair highlighted ongoing corruption issues in Latvia. President Valdis Zatlers of Latvia, elected in July 2007, faced criticism for accepting gratuities from patients and not paying taxes on them. Despite this setback, he regained some support by speaking out against the government during the Loskutovs affair. Latvia experienced rapid economic growth in 2006 and 2007, but growth slowed down in recent years. Latvia's economy saw significant growth in 2006 and 2007, with a 12.2% and 10.3% increase respectively. However, growth slowed in late 2007 and is expected to continue decelerating in 2008 due to inflation, which was at 10.1% in 2007 and 16.8% in March 2008. The country maintains a budget surplus of 1% for 2008 but struggles with a large current account deficit. Latvia joined NATO and the EU in 2004, and is working to meet NATO standards for its armed forces. Latvia receives substantial EU funding to address issues like border security and public infrastructure. It has delayed adopting the euro due to high inflation. Latvia supports democratic forces in neighboring countries and advocates for their NATO membership. Relations with Russia have been challenging, especially regarding NATO's role in patrolling Latvia's airspace. Russia has expressed irritation at NATO's role in patrolling the airspace of Latvia and the other Baltic states, and the non-participation of Latvia in the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty. Russia claims that Latvia violates the human rights of its ethnic Russian minority, who make up 37.5% of the population. Many Russian-speakers are poorly integrated into Latvian society due to citizenship policies implemented after independence in 1991. Latvia's citizenship policies have led to 57.5% of ethnic Russians obtaining Latvian citizenship, while over 18% of permanent residents remain stateless. Noncitizens cannot vote or hold public office. Latvia is heavily dependent on Russia for energy, and both Latvia and the US are concerned about the North European Gas Pipeline project. Latvian and U.S. officials are advocating for energy supply routes from the Caspian Sea region to Europe to enhance energy security. Russia has diminished Latvia's role in oil transit trade by cutting off shipments to the Latvian oil terminal at Ventspils, diverting them to its own Baltic Pipeline System. This move is seen as a power play by Transneft to gain control of Ventspils Nafta. In December 2007, a Russian-Latvian border treaty entered into force, benefiting Latvian business interests with increased transit business from Russia. The United States has strong relations with Latvia, supporting its independence, NATO and EU membership, and cooperation in Iraq and Afghanistan. Latvia has increased its contributions to international peacekeeping efforts, with troops in Afghanistan, Kosovo, and receiving security assistance from the United States. There have been some controversies in U.S.-Latvian relations, including Latvia's desire to join the U.S. Visa Waiver program. Latvia is upset about citizens needing visas for U.S. travel despite most EU countries not requiring them. In March 2008, the U.S. and Latvia signed a memorandum for Latvia to join the Visa Waiver Program. U.S. Ambassador's speeches in 2007 raised concerns in Latvia. The U.S. ambassador, Charles Lawson, has expressed support for strengthening Latvia's democracy, despite some opposition in the Latvian press."
