    "content": "The power of neural networks lies in their ability to generalize to unseen data, yet the reasons for this phenomenon are still unclear. This work aims to make generalization more intuitive by exploring the geometry of loss landscapes and how dimensionality affects optimizers. Neural networks are effective for classification due to their expressiveness and ability to generalize well to new data. Neural networks can make accurate predictions on unseen test data if sampled from the same distribution as training data. The training algorithms minimize a loss function using only training data, leading to flexible parameter configurations. Visualizations show the presence of \"bad\" minima with poor generalization, highlighting the challenge of achieving high test accuracy. The text discusses how neural networks achieve high test accuracy despite fitting training data perfectly. It explores the concept of generalization through visualizations and experiments, focusing on the correlation between the \"flatness\" of minima and generalization. The goal is to understand neural network behavior with over-parameterization and high-dimensional parameter spaces. Neural networks can approximate any function with enough parameters but struggle to learn from limited training data. Training involves minimizing a loss function using only training data, leading to the exploration of how high dimensionality biases optimizers towards flat minima that generalize well. Counterfactual experiments validate this intuition. Code for reproducing experiments is available at https://github.com/genviz2019/genviz. Neural networks with over-parameterization can fit arbitrary labeling functions on large datasets, leading to near-zero loss during training. An experiment with CIFAR-10 dataset shows the difference between model fitting and generalization using two over-parameterized models. The linear model with 298,369 parameters achieves only 49% test accuracy, while ResNet-18 achieves 92%. The performance of the neural network raises questions about the existence of bad minima in parameter space. Incorporating a loss term that promotes poor generalization confirms the presence of bad minima. The presence of bad minima in parameter space is confirmed by incorporating a loss term that promotes poor generalization. This is achieved by minimizing the cross entropy loss on the training set and the reverse cross entropy loss on a set of unseen examples, leading to a parameter vector that fails to generalize despite minimizing the original training set loss. The presence of bad minima in parameter space is confirmed by incorporating a loss term that promotes poor generalization. Using the anti-generalization loss to search for bad minima near the optimization trajectory reveals their widespread distribution. Visualizing the distribution in Figure 1, the anti-generalization optimizer easily finds minima with poor generalization near every SGD iterate. Neural network optimizers are biased towards good minima, showing implicit regularization. Training a VGG13 network on various gradient and non-gradient methods reveals that all methods generalize better than a linear model. The presence of implicit regularization suggests it may be influenced by optimizer geometry. The optimizer suggests implicit regularization may be due to the loss function's geometry. The high dimensionality of parameter space acts as implicit regularization for optimizers, impacting generalization. Classical theory struggles to explain generalization in over-parameterized neural nets due to their complexity. Recent works propose new metrics to characterize the capacity of neural networks in the over-parameterized setting. These metrics aim to explain the mismatch between empirical observation and classical theory by providing high probability upper bounds on generalization ability. One approach considers model space complexity, where the capacity of the model class being trained influences the generalization risk. Efforts have been made to find tight characterizations of the complexity of the model class being trained. Bartlett et al. (2017) developed bounds based on the spectral norm of weight matrices, without exponential dependence on network depth. Model class complexity can be improved if weight matrices adhere to structural constraints like sparsity or eigenvalue concentration. Stability and robustness are also important factors, with B being proportional to model stability. Characterizing the stability of a neural network is challenging, but it is crucial for robustness and generalization. The text discusses the importance of stability and robustness in neural networks, with a focus on generalization bounds and model compression. PAC-Bayes bounds and margin theory provide guarantees for randomized predictors, while model compression theory emphasizes the need to limit the size of the model class for better generalization. Model compression theory suggests that neural network model classes are effectively smaller than they appear due to optimizers settling into a selective set of minima. This results in a reduced effective model complexity, allowing for learning on a narrower set of acceptable models. The optimizer's bias towards \"flat\" minima removes most models from consideration, leading to insights gained through visualizations and linking back to theory. The text discusses the bias towards \"flat\" minima in neural networks, which reduces effective model complexity. Traditional linear models use regularization to cope with over-parameterization, while neural networks promote flatness as a good prior instead of wide margin regularization. This implicit regulation aims to maximize Euclidean distance to class boundaries while classifying data correctly. Flatness in neural networks is linked to generalization, with flat minima tending to generalize well. Large batch sizes lead to sharper minima, which generalize poorly. Flatness measures how sensitive network performance is to parameter perturbations, with sharp minima showing a significant increase in loss with small parameter changes. In contrast, flat minima maintain training accuracy under perturbations. The stability of flat minima to parameter perturbations can be seen as a wide margin condition, where training data remains safe from class boundary changes. Sharp minima, on the other hand, risk misclassification when boundaries are perturbed. Visualizations show the impact of sharpness on neural networks. The \"good\" minimizer has a wide margin, while the \"bad\" minimizer has almost zero margin, leading to unstable class labels under perturbations. Visualizations and metrics help in understanding the sharpness of minima in neural networks. The sharpness of minima in neural networks can be measured using local entropy or filter-normalization schemes. These measures are invariant to parameter scaling and have been found to correlate with generalization. Visualizations of loss function geometry around minima can help in understanding the stability of class labels under perturbations. The sharpness of minima in neural networks can be measured using local entropy or filter-normalization schemes, which are invariant to parameter scaling and correlate with generalization. Visualizations of loss function geometry around minima show the instability of class labels under parameter perturbations, leading to sharper minima for bad minimizers and wider basins for good minimizers. This concept is validated on the Street View House Number (SVHN) classification problem using ResNet-18, where the well-generalizing minimizer is flat. The sharpness of minima in neural networks can be measured using local entropy or filter-normalization schemes, which correlate with generalization. Good minimizers have flat loss function geometry, occupying wide basins in parameter space, while bad minimizers have sharp minima in narrow basins. This volume disparity may explain why stochastic optimizers tend to find good minima that generalize well. An optimizer using random initialization is more likely to land in the attraction basin for a good minimizer than a bad one due to the volume disparity between good and bad minima in high-dimensional spaces. The differences in \"width\" between good and bad basins are magnified by the curse of dimensionality, where small differences in sharpness between minima result in exponentially large disparities in the volume of their surrounding basins. The probability of colliding with a region during random initialization scales with the volume, not the width, of the basin. The text discusses the impact of dimensionality on neural loss landscapes by quantifying the local volume within basins surrounding different minima. The volume of a basin is defined as the set of points with loss value below a cutoff, and its calculation involves a Monte-Carlo integration method. The n-dimensional volume of the basin is determined by the radius in the direction of a unit vector, utilizing Euler's gamma function. The text discusses estimating the volume of basins surrounding minima in neural loss landscapes by calculating radii in random directions. It shows a relationship between generalization and basin volume, indicating sharper minima with decreased generalization accuracy. Basins around good minima have significantly larger volumes than bad minima, making it unlikely to stumble upon bad minima accidentally. Decision boundaries for different levels of generalization are visualized, with all networks achieving over 99.5% training accuracy. Neural networks achieve high training accuracy above 99.5% with decision boundaries showing generalization gaps. The text explores the problem of separating blue and red dots, where neural networks struggle to find a well-behaved circular boundary in certain scenarios. The margin of the classifier affects the minimizer's behavior, making it likely to be found by SGD. By pinching the margin between red and blue rings, SGD can find networks that cherry-pick red points and maintain a large margin. This contrasts with a simple circular decision boundary, which would be less stable and unlikely to be found by SGD. Experiments on classification margin and loss basin volumes reveal insights on generalization and loss function geometry. The study explores the properties of \"large margin\" flat minima in neural networks and questions the precise metrics for \"margin\" and \"volume\" in optimizing neural networks. It aims to connect these observations to a rigorous PAC learning framework to understand neural network generalization better. The experiments conducted hope to inspire theoretical progress towards definitive answers to deep questions in this field.
