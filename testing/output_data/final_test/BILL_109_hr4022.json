    "content": "The \"Reconstructive Surgery Act of 2005\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 discusses the coverage of reconstructive surgery under group health plans, amending Section 2706 of the Public Health Service Act. The \"Reconstructive Surgery Act of 2005\" requires group health plans to cover reconstructive surgery, defined as medically necessary surgery to correct abnormal body structures for functional improvement or normal appearance. The section specifies that group health plans are not required to cover cosmetic surgery, which is defined as surgery to alter normal body structures for appearance improvement. Additionally, there is a conforming amendment to the Public Health Service Act. \"SEC. 713. COVERAGE FOR RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY.\" Group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage must provide coverage for reconstructive surgery, including pre-operative and post-operative care deemed necessary by the treating physician. Reconstructive surgery refers to medically necessary procedures to correct abnormal structures caused by various factors, aiming to improve functions or restore a normal appearance. In connection with group health plans, coverage for cosmetic surgery is not required. Cosmetic surgery is defined as altering normal body structures for appearance improvement. Conforming amendments are made to sections 731(c) and 732(a) of the Act. The table of contents in section 1 of the Act is amended by inserting new item after section 712. Section 2752 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to provide coverage for reconstructive surgery in the individual market. The provisions of section 2706 apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market, effective for group health plans starting January 1, 2006, and for health insurance coverage in the individual market thereafter. For group health plans under collective bargaining agreements ratified before the enactment of this Act, the amendments do not apply until the last agreement terminates or January 1, 2006. Plan amendments to comply with the new requirements do not count as agreement terminations. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 is amended to coordinate regulations with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act."
