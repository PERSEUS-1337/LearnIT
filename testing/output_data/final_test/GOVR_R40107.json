    "content": "Policymakers are considering accelerated investments in public infrastructure to address economic challenges and create jobs. The report discusses the role of infrastructure in economic growth, setting priorities, governance, and the potential for \"green\" infrastructure as part of economic stimulus. The report discusses the potential role of \"green\" infrastructure in economic stimulus amidst deteriorating economic indicators. Real GDP fell by 0.5% in the third quarter of 2008, with forecasts predicting a further decline of 1.1% in 2009 and an unemployment rate of 8.1%. The National Bureau of Economic Research declared the U.S. economy to be in recession. The U.S. economy has been in recession since December 2007, with job losses totaling 1.9 million in 2008. Fiscal problems are affecting all levels of government, with states facing budget gaps of $30 billion and cuts to state budgets. States are dealing with increased expenditure pressures, including funding public assistance programs and addressing long-term issues like pensions and infrastructure maintenance. Local governments are facing fiscal pressures due to a decrease in revenue from property, sales, and income taxes. A survey found that 79% of cities expect their finances to worsen in 2009, leading to layoffs, fee increases, and project cancellations. Cities and states are finding it difficult to finance long-term projects due to limited access to the bond market, resulting in higher interest rates for municipal bonds. States and cities are facing challenges in borrowing money due to higher interest rates on municipal bonds, leading to project delays or cancellations. They are seeking federal assistance for various policies and projects, including infrastructure, healthcare reform, and budget relief. Organizations have issued recommendations to Congress and the Administration for short-term and long-term support. Increased spending on public works infrastructure is not new, with Congress appropriating funds in past decades for existing federal programs to stimulate projects and job creation. This time, the severity of the economic downturn and the merging of job-creating stimulus discussions with infrastructure investment needs are key factors. Policymakers and the public are increasingly recognizing the decline in U.S. investments in public infrastructure. The U.S. is underinvesting in public infrastructure, with a significant decline in investments over recent decades. Data shows a decrease in infrastructure spending relative to GDP, shifting from capital to operation and maintenance. Government spending per capita has also decreased. Candidate Barack Obama pledged to invest in rebuilding the nation's infrastructure during his presidential campaign. President-elect Obama has emphasized immediate investments in infrastructure projects to revitalize the economy, with a $25 billion Jobs and Growth Fund to support ongoing projects and school repairs. This increased investment aims to alleviate budget pressures and address high unemployment levels, providing a triple win of capital deployment, job creation, and economic boost. Obama and Biden's $25 billion investment aims to create 1 million jobs, boost the economy, and improve the environment through energy-efficient school and infrastructure repairs. Details of the economic stimulus plan, including allocation to different infrastructure sectors, are still unclear. The term \"infrastructure\" may encompass public and private sector spending beyond traditional systems like roads and airports. The term \"infrastructure\" may be broadly defined to include private sector spending and public investments in assets like public buildings. There is no single definition for infrastructure in the current economic stimulus discussion, and it will be defined by those crafting the legislation. Policymakers are considering a broad definition that encompasses various facilities with differing levels of historic federal investment. The term \"infrastructure\" encompasses a wide range of assets with varying levels of historic federal investment, including physical structures and systems with public and private ownership. There is a blurred line between public and private infrastructure, leading to questions about the government's role in providing infrastructure services. Private sectors are increasingly involved in providing functions traditionally seen as public, such as prisons, passenger rail, and postal services. The term \"infrastructure\" includes a wide range of assets with varying levels of federal investment, blurring the line between public and private ownership. Private sectors are now involved in traditionally public functions like prisons, passenger rail, and postal services. A new dimension is the concept of \"green infrastructure\" that combines public works with environmentally friendly systems. Discussions in the 111th Congress include infrastructure categories for economic stimulus legislation. Debates focus on the impact of infrastructure investment on productivity and the economy. The general issue discussed is the impact of infrastructure spending on productivity and growth, as well as its role in stimulating the economy. Infrastructure is seen as a public good that enhances productivity and generates positive externalities for production. It is essential for private firms to be productive and plays a central role in altering the economy's capacity to produce goods and services. Public infrastructure, such as roads and telephones, plays a crucial role in enhancing economic productivity by providing services for transporting goods and people. Academic interest in the economic payoff of infrastructure spending grew due to declines in public investment and economic productivity growth in the early 1970s. Research in the late 1980s suggested a link between public investments in infrastructure and economic productivity growth. Studies found that increasing public capital stock by 10% could raise multifactor productivity by almost 4%, indicating a significant impact on economic output. However, subsequent investigations showed that these results were sensitive to various factors. Investigations found that initial results on the economic effects of investing in public infrastructure were sensitive to factors like data changes and sectors analyzed. Further research in the 1990s either confirmed or challenged these findings, leading to a consensus that there are positive returns on investment in public infrastructure, with the greatest impact seen in energy infrastructure, followed by mass transit and water and sewer. Recent studies show varying returns to the economy based on the type of infrastructure invested in. Recent research shows that the impact of new public investment in infrastructure depends on the existing stock and its efficient use. Congress has historically increased federal spending on public works to create jobs and stimulate the economy during economic downturns. Increasing federal expenditures on public works can lead to job creation, with job estimates based on input-output models of the economy. These models analyze the production of materials like concrete and steel used in construction, translating output requirements into employment needs. Job creation estimates reflect both direct and indirect employment supported by increased demand. Job creation estimates are based on employment directly and indirectly supported by industry demand, including induced jobs resulting from purchases made by those in direct and indirect jobs. Estimates vary depending on industry definition, data sources, and time period. The Federal Highway Administration provides widely cited estimates, with $1 billion on highway construction supporting 27,822 direct, indirect, and induced jobs in 2007. These estimates focus on jobs supported by investments, not created. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides employment requirements data for researchers, showing 13,860 jobs per $1 billion spending in the construction industry in 2007. This is higher than the FHWA's estimate of 11,768 jobs per $1 billion in highway expenditures in 2006. Another estimate based on RIMS II and BLS data suggests 8.1217 jobs per $1 million in infrastructure spending. The RIMS II model provides estimates of job creation for water reuse activities like Title XVI projects, with 8.1217 to 12.6231 jobs created per $1 million spent. Regional data is used to address the limitations of national models in predicting job creation in specific geographic areas. Since mid-2008, there have been increasing calls for Congress and the Administration to address the nation's economic difficulties through policy approaches. Some argue for economic stabilization through monetary policy and fiscal stabilizers, while others support a fiscal stimulus. In February 2008, legislation included tax rebates to stimulate the economy, with effects still unknown. A second stimulus package is now under discussion, with advocates proposing direct fiscal stimulus through infrastructure investments and state fiscal relief. A wide range of experts, including economists like Martin Feldstein and Paul Krugman, argue that a massive government spending infusion is needed to stimulate economic activity. They suggest that infrastructure investment can boost labor demand and enhance productivity by addressing neglected investments in roads, bridges, and water systems. The economic downturn presents an opportunity to address unmet infrastructure needs, as highlighted by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) reported that the nation's infrastructure merits a grade of \"D\" and requires $1.6 trillion in funding. This includes roads, dams, wastewater systems, and schools, all of which are in poor condition due to lack of investment. The American Society of Civil Engineers reported that the nation's infrastructure needs $1.6 trillion in funding for facilities in poor condition. Analysts caution about the timing of fiscal stimulus for infrastructure investment, as poorly timed policies may aggravate inflation and increase federal debt. Timing is critical for federal purchases like infrastructure spending. The primary issue in targeting infrastructure spending is the timing, as many projects take years to complete and cannot easily provide stimulus during recessions. Public works projects typically have slow initial spendout and expenditures spread out over a long time, making it challenging to inject money swiftly into the economy. Major infrastructure projects may have an initial spending rate of 25% or less in a given year. Infrastructure spending poses a challenge due to slow initial spendout rates and expenditures spread out over time. Various categories like highways, transit, airports, and water projects have different spendout rates over multiple years. Economist Mark Zandi highlights the time it takes for funds to reach the economy. Advocates of infrastructure spending argue that projects take time to get underway, emphasizing the need for patience. Advocates of infrastructure spending argue that projects with extended timeframes can still contribute to the economy's recovery during long recessions. They believe that significant backlogs of \"ready to go\" projects can quickly begin construction work, stimulating economic growth. Critics argue that higher deficits from stimulus spending can slow economic growth in the long run by crowding out private investment. However, some economists believe that government spending during a recession can utilize idle resources and labor without fully displacing private investment. If federal assistance only substitutes for local dollars in the same activity, it may not provide any additional benefit. State and local officials argue that federal stimulus funding is necessary to support infrastructure projects during the current recession. This funding is seen as a way to encourage projects that would otherwise be hindered by budget shortfalls. While some view infrastructure spending as a long-term investment, others question its effectiveness in quickly stimulating the economy. The debate on infrastructure spending for economic stimulus revolves around what the stimulus will achieve. Key considerations include the speed and impact of the stimulus relative to its cost. Prioritizing infrastructure spending is typically based on funding needs estimates to determine where to allocate resources for maximum impact. These estimates aim to identify the necessary investment level to meet quality or service standards. The concept of infrastructure spending for economic stimulus revolves around meeting a defined level of quality or service. This differs from the concept of \"ready to go\" projects and economists' calculations of optimal infrastructure investment. The last comprehensive national infrastructure needs assessment was conducted in 1988, showing a potential need for a significant increase in capital investment. The Council estimates that future infrastructure needs could require a 100 percent increase in annual capital investment. Needs assessments face challenges in defining what constitutes a \"need,\" leading to disagreements. Some assessments use current provision as a benchmark for estimating future spending needs. The U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency estimate future spending needs for infrastructure, including highways, public transit, and wastewater treatment facilities. Other federal agencies also calculate funding necessary to bring the current infrastructure system to a state of good repair, known as the infrastructure \"backlog.\" This estimate is influenced by judgments on what constitutes a state of good repair. The needs estimate for infrastructure is influenced by judgments on what constitutes a state of good repair. Needs assessments are often conducted by organizations with a vested interest in the outcome, which can lead to biased results. Estimating future conditions, such as consumer demand for services, is challenging due to factors like population and economic growth rates. Predicting long-term conditions becomes increasingly difficult, especially with unpredictable structural and technological changes in the economy. Consumer demand can vary based on how a service is financed and priced, as well as public policy decisions. Highway tolls that fluctuate with congestion can reduce travel demand and impact infrastructure needs. Water supply needs can be reduced through conservation methods. Public funding may be necessary for infrastructure projects. The need for public funding for infrastructure projects can vary as roles of public and private sectors shift over time. Assessing infrastructure needs can be difficult due to changing intergovernmental relationships and differing estimates for individual elements. Some assessments focus on capital spending while others include both capital and operation and maintenance spending, with some developed for short-term plans and others for long-term needs. Assessing infrastructure needs can be challenging due to varying estimates and assumptions about economic and population growth. Needs surveys are conducted at different times, leading to dollar estimates expressed in different years. Comparing infrastructure needs estimates from different assessments is difficult due to differences in nominal and constant dollar preparation methods. Assessing infrastructure needs is complex due to differences in dollar estimates and methodologies. Individual needs assessments cannot be combined to provide a single estimate, leading to potential double counting or undercounting. Additionally, separate assessments may overlook interdependencies between infrastructure sectors. For example, improvements in one area may reduce the need for upgrades in another. In September 2008, the House approved a job creation stimulus bill with $25 billion in funding for various infrastructure projects. The legislation aimed to prioritize projects that could start construction within 90 or 120 days, known as \"shovel ready\" projects. Interest groups have been presenting lists of these projects to support arguments for more spending in a new stimulus bill. In November, the National Governors Association and the U.S. Conference of Mayors identified billions of dollars in \"shovel ready\" projects for roads, transit, passenger rail, wastewater, and drinking water. State and local water agencies also identified billions in wastewater treatment and drinking water projects. The American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials, the Association of Public Transit Officials, and the American Public Works Association have identified billions of dollars in \"shovel ready\" projects for roads, highways, transit, water supply, and wastewater. These projects are designed, engineered, and have cleared environmental permitting, lacking only funding to proceed. The projects identified by various associations are \"shovel ready\" and lack only funding to proceed. However, there is no standardized definition for this term, and some projects may have permits but lack necessary land acquisition. The true status of these projects is uncertain without a recognized methodology for vetting them. Many lists include estimates of job creation expected from the projects. For example, the Conference of Mayors predicts 790,910 jobs from its infrastructure projects. Jobs will be created from infrastructure projects on the mid-December list, with estimates derived based on FHWA methodology. Some lists identify projects with descriptions, while others only list state-by-state totals. Critics argue that \"ready to go\" projects may include those with marginal value. Funding decisions under a stimulus program will be made by state and local officials. Proponents believe citizens will hold officials accountable for project quality and funding tension exists between creating quick jobs and investing in projects with sustained value. Critics fear small projects won't solve long-term problems or have strategic value. Balancing quick spending and long-term investment is crucial for a new stimulus program. Some public jobs programs focus on quick spending and long-term investments. Infrastructure projects like highway resurfacing and transit station rehabilitation can add value to capital assets and be completed faster than new construction. Public officials aim to include both short-term and long-term projects in stimulus programs. The current focus is on infrastructure stimulus spending for short-term and long-term projects. Key issues include the availability of labor and resources, as well as ensuring accountability for federal funds. The U.S. economy currently has excess capacity in labor and materials for infrastructure projects, with many unemployed workers in the construction sector. The transferability of skills from residential construction to infrastructure projects is uncertain. The availability of labor and resources for infrastructure projects is uncertain. Industry officials believe materials and equipment will meet demand. Stakeholders advocate direct federal grants for project funding. The federal government is considering providing direct grants to project sponsors for infrastructure projects, instead of funneling funds through state agencies. Some local government groups argue that state agencies are slow in awarding funds, hindering economic stimulus efforts. States prefer the current selection and delivery mechanisms for funds, citing concerns about disrupting procedures and additional grants management responsibilities for federal agencies. Some stakeholders are concerned about programmatic requirements for federal assistance, including planning mandates, procurement rules, and environmental regulations. There are debates about suspending these requirements to expedite project spending, but not all support this idea. Some stakeholders are concerned about programmatic requirements for federal assistance, including planning mandates, procurement rules, and environmental regulations. Debates exist about waiving these requirements to speed up project spending, especially regarding state match requirements for federal funds. The governance issue with stimulus funds is ensuring accountability for large amounts of federal dollars. Advocates propose a total stimulus of $850 billion, including $350 billion for infrastructure. Transparency, quality project investments, and oversight are crucial for public assurance. Building America's Future recommends tracking funds at the state and city levels. Building America's Future suggests states and cities should track and report on stimulus spending and job creation. President-elect Obama aims to create green jobs through renewable energy, weatherization, and next-gen vehicles. Interest groups like the Center for American Progress propose $100 billion for green projects in a stimulus package. The Apollo Alliance proposes a $500 billion program to create five million \"green\" jobs, while questions arise about the definition of \"green infrastructure\" and its role in conservation and human benefits. In the context of economic stimulus, \"green\" projects involve developing energy-efficient technologies and environmentally friendly solutions like renewable energy sources. This includes mass transit projects, retrofitting buildings for clean energy use, and the question of whether these projects can stimulate the economy quickly enough. The key to stimulus spending is to quickly get funds into the economy. Green economy proponents suggest projects like full funding of federal energy-efficiency programs to create green jobs rapidly. Critics argue that these projects are costly and slow to stimulate the economy, while proponents defend their potential impact. Proponents argue that \"green\" investments, although pricey and slow to stimulate the economy, are a downpayment on long-term growth. American Rivers has identified 194 water-related green infrastructure projects totaling $1.1 billion ready within six to nine months. These projects include green roofs, raingardens, and permeable pavement to reduce the need for new wastewater treatment plants. Restoring wetlands, floodplains, and planting urban forests are also part of the plan. Job creation potential of \"green infrastructure\" investments is discussed in a recent CRS report. Estimating the number of jobs dependent on green infrastructure activities is challenging due to the lack of separate identification for green industries in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass are not uniquely recognized in NAICS, making it difficult to accurately assess job numbers in these sectors. The conventional input-output model is not suitable for estimating the number of jobs in green activities like wind energy and biofuel production due to the unique mix of inputs required. The lack of a specific category for \"green\" retrofitting in the building construction industry further complicates job estimation in these sectors. This challenge is often overlooked in analyses of green job creation, according to a CRS report. The CAP study addresses the challenge of estimating green job creation by creating synthetic industries to account for sectors like wind, solar, biomass, building retrofitting, and mass transit. This approach combines parts of existing industries to provide estimates for green jobs, as traditional input-output tables do not recognize these sectors separately. The complexity of estimating green jobs is further compounded by the presentation of estimates in various studies, as discussed in the CRS report on job loss and infrastructure job creation during the recession. Studies often develop employment projections based on differing sets of assumptions and time horizons, such as estimating direct and indirect jobs supported by a shift from coal to wind and geothermal power generation. Some reports include induced employment, but this is not always clear. Job estimates may vary by state due to different industry mixes and availability of inputs. Some analyses express job estimates per unit of power generated by renewable resources. The job estimates for green infrastructure programs are often based on assumptions and methodologies that are not clearly articulated, making it difficult to review the results. Policymakers may not find many green economy studies helpful in deciding which programs to fund for job creation during the recession. This Appendix describes various infrastructure categories mentioned for inclusion in economic stimulus legislation. The curr_chunk discusses various infrastructure categories such as water resources, wastewater, drinking water, electric transmission, schools, federal public buildings, and broadband that may be included in economic stimulus legislation. It provides information on conditions, performance, funding needs, recent federal assistance, and investment opportunities for each category. The responsibility for financing, policy, and standard setting for these infrastructure categories is summarized in Table A-1. Additionally, it mentions that there are almost 4 million miles of highways in the United States. Appendix. Highways and Bridges in the United States consist of almost 4 million miles of highways, with the majority owned and operated by state and local governments. Federal ownership accounts for only 3.1% of highway mileage, primarily in national parks and other federal facilities. Rural highways make up over 75% of the total, carrying 35.9% of traffic, while urban highways carry 64.1% of traffic, with urban interstates making up 15.4% of the total. The U.S. highway system includes nearly 600,000 bridges, mostly owned and operated by state and local governments. The U.S. highway and bridge infrastructure requires significant investment to accommodate future traffic growth, despite improvements from increased spending. Urban interstate bridges carry a large portion of daily traffic. The number of structurally deficient bridges was significantly reduced between 1990 and 2007. A 2007 report highlighted the need for increased spending on surface transportation infrastructure, estimating between $145 billion and $276 billion per year. The federal-aid highway program is the main source of federal funding for transportation infrastructure, with FY2009 authorizations totaling nearly $42 billion. The federal-aid highway program, with FY2009 authorizations of almost $42 billion, provides funding through seven formula programs for surface transportation infrastructure. States have flexibility in spending funds, and reauthorization is expected in the 111th Congress. Highways and bridges are viewed as a way to stimulate the economy by creating valuable assets and employment opportunities. Infrastructure spending during a recession aims to create economically valuable assets and jobs quickly. While some argue that the benefits may not be fully realized until after the recession, transportation industry groups have identified over 5,200 projects ready to start, which could generate a significant number of new jobs. The focus is on starting projects quickly to create new jobs and address the national backlog of infrastructure projects. Concerns include whether prioritizing \"ready to go\" projects will address the most critical needs and if resources are sufficient for speedy spending of stimulus funds. The stimulus funds aim to boost infrastructure spending, but concerns arise over states cutting back on their own infrastructure projects. The uncertainty lies in whether the stimulus can make up for the shortfall in state spending, raising questions about the expected levels of infrastructure improvement and job creation. Public transit infrastructure, including various modes like bus, rail, and ferryboat, is a key component of this spending. The Department of Transportation estimates that maintaining current transit systems in the US will require 25% more annual funding than is currently being spent. In 2004, transit capital spending was $12.6 billion, falling short of the estimated $15.8 billion needed annually over the next 20 years. Federal assistance is provided through the Federal Transit Administration. The Federal Transit Administration's transit program consists of various funding programs, with the Urbanized Area Formula Grants Program and the Capital Investment Program being the main ones. In FY2009, $10.4 billion was authorized for transit programs, with the Urbanized Area Formula Program receiving 40% ($4.2 billion) and the Capital Investment Program receiving 43% ($4.5 billion). The Capital Investment Program includes the Bus and Bus Facilities Capital Program, the Rail Modernization Program, and the New Starts Program, funded at roughly 20-40-40 percentage shares. Additionally, $1.7 billion funded other transit programs in FY2009. The Federal Transit Administration funds various programs, including the Rural Formula Program, Elderly and Disabled Program, Jobs Access Program, and state and metropolitan planning. Around 30% of federal funding goes towards operational expenses. In 2008, proposals for federal transit spending shifted from coping with fuel price increases to focusing on economic stimulus and job creation. The American Public Transportation Association played a role in advocating for additional funding. In October, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) identified 559 \"ready to go\" projects worth about $8 billion, which increased to 736 projects worth $12.2 billion in mid-December. A U.S. Conference of Mayors report also identified 726 transit projects worth $8.8 billion. Transit funding is criticized for spending out slowly, especially for bus and rail vehicle purchases dominated by foreign companies. Despite domestic content requirements, some transit capital spending may not benefit domestic manufacturers. Some concerns regarding federal transit spending include the potential lack of job creation in the United States, the bias towards capital over operating expenses, and the possibility of federal funds replacing rather than supplementing state and local spending. Additionally, questions arise about the effectiveness of a large increase in transit spending in improving service and ridership, as well as the rising government expenses in the transit industry despite increasing patronage. The transit industry faces challenges in covering costs with fares, needing more support from government. Federal funding from the Highway Trust Fund is a key issue, with the Mass Transit Account providing 80% of transit program funds. Current revenue levels are insufficient to sustain FTA programs. Airports are mainly funded through the Airport Civil aviation public infrastructure. The majority of airports in the United States are publicly owned, with state and local governments typically owning about one-quarter of them. These publicly owned airports handle the majority of commercial aviation operations. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported 20,341 airports in the US in 2007, with 5,221 being civil public use airports eligible for Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants. The estimated capital needs for airports from 2009 to 2013 were $49.7 billion. The estimated capital needs for airports from 2009 through 2013 is $49.7 billion (in 2008 dollars), approximately $9.9 billion a year. The estimates do not include projects ineligible for AIP funding. A more comprehensive accounting by the Government Accountability Office estimates airport capital development costs for 2007 through 2011 at $14 billion a year (in 2006 dollars). Federal Assistance GAO calculated public spending on airport capital improvements averaged about $13 billion per year. Public spending on airport capital improvements averaged $13 billion per year between 2001 and 2005. Funding sources included the federal Airport Improvement Program, airport bonds, Passenger Facility Charge, and state/local contributions. Aviation interest groups called for an additional $1 billion to the AIP program for economic stimulus, aiming to create 35,000 jobs. The American Association of Airport Executives stated that $1.7 billion could be used for \"ready to go\" projects that can be bid and under contract within 180 days. U.S. airports have requested projects for stimulus spending due to expected growth in air traffic. FAA forecasts a significant increase in revenue passenger enplanements by 2025. The FAA's accuracy in activity forecasts has been affected by industry instability post-9/11, leading to larger errors in short-term predictions. Unpredictable fuel prices add to aviation forecast uncertainty. Airport stimulus spending prioritizes capacity and delay reduction at the 35 busiest airports, impacting national aviation connectivity significantly. FAA's Operational Evolution Plan focuses on funding infrastructure projects at these key airports. Amtrak is the nation's only provider of intercity passenger rail service, operating trains over a network covering around 22,000 miles. The Northeast Corridor (NEC) includes heavily used sections of track shared by Amtrak, commuter rail, and freight operations. Amtrak was created in 1970 by the federal government to preserve intercity passenger rail service. Amtrak, the nation's only provider of intercity passenger rail service, is structured as a private company with most of its stock held by the federal government. It faces financial challenges with an estimated $5-$6 billion backlog in deferred maintenance. Amtrak struggles to offer modern features like speed and reliability due to outdated infrastructure and equipment. Amtrak operates on railways with at-grade crossings, limiting speeds to around 80 mph even on high-speed Acela service. Delays are common due to sharing tracks with freight trains and aging equipment. Amtrak's on-time performance is low, with a 71% system-wide ratio in FY2008. The Acela route only achieves 85% on-time performance. Amtrak's ridership is concentrated on the NEC and short-distance corridors, capturing only 0.8% of intercity trips nationally. Amtrak competes well with air passenger service in the NEC, with more people riding between Washington, D.C. and New York City on Amtrak than flying. Amtrak captures only 5% of the air-rail travel market between Washington, D.C. and Boston, with personal vehicles dominating the market for trips between 50 and 499 miles. Since its creation in 1970, Amtrak has relied on federal assistance, receiving around $1.3 billion annually from Congress. The Act of 2008 authorized significant increases in Amtrak funding, around $2.4 billion per year through FY2013. Congress directed the DOT to seek proposals from the private sector for high-speed rail development in 11 designated corridors. Amtrak competes for funding from the General Treasury as there is no dedicated user fee mechanism for rail investments. There is uncertainty in Congress appropriating funding close to authorized levels. Analysis on rail sector's economic stimulus impact is lacking compared to road building. The rail sector may face delays due to winter weather, but rail maintenance projects could start sooner than new construction projects. Amtrak relies on state government approval for some projects and cooperation from freight railroads. Regulatory approval is not needed for freight rail upgrades, but negotiation with freight railroads is necessary. Railroad union work rules could impact the jobs impact of rail funding. Railroad union work rules and Amtrak's transparency in account keeping are key factors affecting the jobs impact of funding rail improvements. Congress may prioritize directing economic stimulus funding towards job-inducing projects for Amtrak. Policymakers should consider the long-term public financial commitment associated with investments in intercity passenger rail, which can compete with automobiles in certain conditions. Intercity passenger rail can be competitive with airlines for trips under 350 miles, especially between large cities with important intermediate stops like in the NEC. Water resources infrastructure includes various structures and is managed through shared responsibilities across government levels and the private sector. The U.S. has over 25,000 publicly owned and 54,000 private dams providing flood control, power generation, and irrigation water. Federal agencies like the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have played a significant role in constructing large dams, but few similar federal facilities are currently being built. Reclamation and the Corps own and operate the majority of the largest U.S. dams, producing a significant amount of electricity. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers owns and operates over 600 dams and 75 hydropower projects, generating 68 billion kilowatt hours annually. They also maintain navigation conditions for 900 harbors and 12,000 miles of waterways. The Corps constructed 9,000 miles of the nation's levees but only maintains 600 miles, with the rest operated by nonfederal entities. Many federal water resources structures are over 50 years old and require rehabilitation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers owns and operates numerous dams and hydropower projects, contributing to economic development but also causing environmental degradation. There are concerns about aging infrastructure, with a backlog of $70 billion for construction projects and $4 billion for maintenance. Federal agencies do not estimate future infrastructure needs or conduct national assessments, instead following congressional directives. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's NRCS finances water resource projects, including nonfederal dams and levees. The estimated cost to rehabilitate nonfederal dams is $36.2 billion, with no national estimates for other flood protection measures. Federal appropriations for water resource activities total around $6.6 billion annually, primarily spent directly by agencies. Local project sponsors are typically required to share construction costs with the Corps. The Corps requires local project sponsors to share construction costs for water resource projects through grants or loans. Reclamation projects are financed upfront with users repaying the federal government. The potential level of investment in water resources activities for economic stimulus is unknown, but estimates suggest the Corps alone could use $7 billion for projects. The potential economic stimulus of $7 billion for water resource projects by the Corps is uncertain due to lack of information on specific projects. This amount is significantly more than the agency's annual appropriations and could have various economic and environmental effects. The diversity of Corps projects in terms of purpose, size, and controversy could pose political challenges. The $7 billion potential economic stimulus for water resource projects by the Corps is uncertain due to lack of specific project information. $3.2 billion is being discussed for Corps operation and maintenance activities, with $1.8 billion estimated for deferred maintenance in FY2006. Reclamation funding discussions target nontraditional projects like wastewater reuse and rural water supply. Congress has enacted user pays approaches and environmental laws for water resources projects that require nonfederal cost-sharing. Federal water resource construction activities face challenges such as fiscal constraints, changes in national priorities, and environmental impacts. There are uncertainties regarding nonfederal cost-sharing, project start times, and agency constraints. Despite ongoing forces, proposals for increased federal funding are being considered. The federal government is considering proposals for greater financial and technical assistance to address pressures on water supplies and manage regional resources. Congress is grappling with how to adapt the federal role to meet current water demands and address aging infrastructure challenges in wastewater facilities. The federal government is considering proposals for greater financial and technical assistance to address pressures on water supplies and manage regional resources. Nearly all wastewater facilities are publicly owned and operated by local governments, facing challenges due to aging infrastructure. An estimated $202.5 billion is needed nationally for wastewater facility projects eligible for federal assistance under the Clean Water Act. The federal government is considering proposals for greater financial and technical assistance to address pressures on water supplies and manage regional resources. An estimated $202.5 billion is needed nationally for wastewater facility projects eligible for federal assistance under the Clean Water Act (CWA). This estimate includes funding for wastewater treatment and collection systems, correcting uncontrolled overflows from municipal sewers, and stormwater management. The largest federal program for wastewater treatment assistance is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the CWA, with total FY2008 funding of $689 million. Federal funds are used to capitalize state loan programs (State Revolving Funds, or SRFs), and project loans are made by states to communities based on priority lists determined by the states. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture provides assistance through grant and loan programs for communities with populations of fewer than 10,000 persons. In FY2008, USDA programs provided $534 million in funding for communities with populations under 10,000. Local governments are the main investors in wastewater systems, investing $14 billion in capital projects and $22 billion in operations and maintenance in 2004-2005. Interest in using wastewater projects for economic stimulus has increased, with cities identifying 3,343 \"shovel ready\" projects needing $18.9 billion in funding. The National Governors Association and Water Information Network estimate that nearly $20 billion in wastewater projects are \"shovel ready,\" with $9 billion specifically for wastewater projects. Questions arise about the efficiency and equity of funding these projects for economic stimulus. In terms of equity and sustainability, questions arise about the distribution of stimulus funds for wastewater projects and ensuring accountability for water quality benefits. Long-term issues include how communities will meet funding needs for wastewater pollution control projects and the federal role in addressing these needs. The federal government's role in funding capital investments for drinking water utilities is being questioned. There are nearly 53,000 community water systems nationwide, with 15% being investor owned. The federal government has primarily been a regulator in this sector, setting standards for water quality control. The federal government has primarily acted as a regulator in the drinking water sector, setting quality standards and providing technical and financial assistance for infrastructure projects. A recent EPA survey estimated a $276.8 billion investment needed over 20 years for safe water provision and compliance with regulations. The majority of this funding is required for water supply transmission and distribution systems and treatment facilities. The agency warns of a 20-year funding gap for drinking water infrastructure, ranging from $45 billion to $263 billion. Local governments provide most financing despite federal programs like the DWSRF. The DWSRF program provides funding for water systems to comply with regulations and protect public health. States receive grants to make loans for projects prioritizing public health, compliance, and economic need. Congress has allocated over $10.3 billion since FY1997. The USDA also administers a program for smaller communities. Funding for FY2008 included $829 million for DWSRF and $534 million for USDA projects. The American Water Works Association (AWWA) has identified $10 billion worth of drinking water infrastructure projects ready for funding, which could generate 400,000 jobs. The U.S. Conference of Mayors estimates $15.36 billion in water and wastewater projects could create 133,193 jobs. Stimulus funding is crucial for water infrastructure projects affected by the credit crisis. The economic stimulus proposals for the water sector face challenges in funds distribution. While using the DWSRF program for delivering stimulus funds has benefits, some concerns include slow distribution by states and time-consuming federal requirements hindering project starts and effectiveness of recovery efforts. Additionally, the alignment of \"ready to go\" projects with state funding priorities is questioned. Some policy questions arise regarding the distribution of stimulus funds for water projects. Should projects outside program eligibility be considered? Should federal requirements be relaxed, and what are the trade-offs? The National Rural Water Association suggests using the USDA program for quicker fund distribution, but it is limited to small communities. Questions remain on how priorities will be set, considering various factors like job creation, public health, and economic needs. The federal role in water infrastructure financing and stimulus efforts' impact on funding sources, such as a water infrastructure trust fund, are key policy questions. The electric power transmission grid in the lower 48 states consists of 160,000 miles of high voltage lines primarily owned by investor-owned utilities, with federal Power Marketing Administrations operating in the West. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) and Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) own and operate a significant portion of the transmission system in the Northwest. BPA maintains 75% of high-voltage transmission lines, while WAPA covers 1.3 million square miles and maintains 17,000 miles of high-voltage transmission. The nation's electric generating capacity is 1,000,000 megawatts, owned by various entities. The regulatory system for electric power is fragmented and inconsistent, with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approving transmission rates for investor-owned utilities. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approves transmission rates for IOUs and independent transmission companies, providing oversight for PMAs but not for utilities in most of Texas. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allows for incentive rate making for new transmission to encourage investment. FERC has approved incentive rate making for many new projects under Order 679. State regulation over power prices and plant siting decisions vary, influenced by federal environmental regulations and access to the transmission system. The transmission grid was developed over decades to support system reliability and bulk power sales. The grid's role has evolved with power market deregulation, now carrying a large volume of wholesale power sales to maintain competitive prices. Concerns arise due to low investment since the 1970s, leading to worries about grid reliability and its ability to support new market functions. Expanding the grid for renewable energy sources like wind and solar power poses challenges for reliability and construction. Climate change policies will impact future generation and transmission decisions. The future emphasis on renewables and green technologies would require significant investment in the transmission system to respond to climate change policies. Renewable power is currently more expensive than coal and natural gas, so incentives or mandates are needed to meet the Department of Energy's goal of generating 20% electricity from wind by 2030. The financial crisis may slow demand growth and reduce investment in new power plants, creating uncertainty about the future balance of electricity supply and demand. The proposal for grid modernization includes the development of a \"smart grid\" technology and an ultra-high voltage backbone system to address transmission capacity and reliability issues. The estimated investment required for the power system is $1.5 to $2.0 trillion by 2030. The federal government offers incentive programs for electric power investments, including production tax credits for renewable sources, tax credits for clean coal technologies, loan guarantees for low carbon technologies, and incentive rates for new transmission projects. The effectiveness of these programs has been debated, with delays in issuing guarantees and complex financial transactions for wind farms. Power sector investments for new wind farms may be impacted by a recession, potentially limiting opportunities. The investment requirements for the power sector could reach trillions of dollars, mainly for privately owned infrastructure. Short-term stimulus versus long-term benefits from these investments is a consideration. Some advanced grid technologies are ready for deployment, but a national smart grid template is lacking. Utilities have transmission projects planned, including the ultra-high voltage backbone grid. Federal incentives could accelerate transmission projects for wind and solar generation development. However, lengthy state siting approvals are still required for most projects. National planning and federal preemption of state regulation are key issues with greater federal intervention in the power sector. Initiatives like installing renewable power or an ultra-high voltage transmission grid may necessitate additional federal control over investment decisions. PMAs, especially in the West, could play a role in this. The PMAs could create a larger federal presence in the transmission system, allowing greater influence to implement climate change policies. Timely grid enhancements for remote renewable power and smart grid technology may require federal authority to override state decisions. Decisions are needed to enhance grid reliability and accommodate intermittent resources like wind and solar. Data on transmission network reliability is limited, with a new data gathering system in place. Choices must be made regarding promoting nuclear power, clean coal, or natural gas-fired plants. Since the 1990s, natural gas has been the primary fuel for new power plants, but increased use poses a risk of reliance on another fossil fuel, leading to potential large imports. Approximately 50 million students were enrolled in public schools in 2008, with safe and up-to-date facilities considered crucial for successful education. School infrastructure funding has traditionally been a state and local responsibility, with limited federal involvement. Data on school infrastructure needs are scarce and challenging to assess due to varying assumptions and definitions. In 2000, the Department of Education issued a one-time study estimating the costs of modernization, renovation, and repair for school buildings. The study, based on 1999 survey data from 903 public schools, estimated the cost to bring facilities into good condition at $127 billion. Approximately 25% of schools were found to be in inadequate condition. Approximately 25% of schools were found to have inadequate onsite buildings, with 50% having one or more building features in inadequate condition, and 40% having unsatisfactory environmental conditions. The federal government provides indirect support for school construction through tax exemptions and direct support through programs like Impact Aid. School infrastructure investment can serve as an economic stimulus. Federal investment in school modernization, renovation, and repair projects can provide alternative funding for states and localities facing budget shortfalls. School districts are struggling with financial choices, delaying construction projects due to lack of affordable credit. The Committee for Education Funding advocates for a $20 billion investment spread over five years to address these challenges. The Committee for Education Funding proposes a $20 billion investment over five years to support 50,000 jobs annually through green school construction and renovation. This approach could save $20 billion in energy costs over the next decade while creating new jobs. School infrastructure needs are complex, influenced by factors like student population shifts, technology changes, energy efficiency requirements, and legislation compliance. The lack of federal data on school infrastructure hinders accurate projections of needs. States and localities struggle to finance projects, prompting questions about increased federal involvement. The Public Building Service constructs and renovates federal buildings to meet space needs. PBS constructs new buildings, renovates existing ones, and leases space for a range of government activities such as courthouses, federal office buildings, and data processing centers. They also survey housing needs, identify critical workspace needs, and rank construction projects in order of priority, with homeland security projects being top priorities in FY2008 and FY2009. In FY2008 and FY2009, PBS prioritized homeland security projects for capital investment, including modernizing land ports of entry and federal courthouses. Funding for construction and renovation projects comes from the Federal Buildings Fund, which is financed by rent from GSA-controlled space occupants and congressional appropriations. The Fund requires new obligational authority each year. For FY2008 and FY2009, Congress allocated funds for new construction and renovation projects through the Federal Buildings Fund. The funding ranged from several million to hundreds of millions of dollars, with a focus on homeland security projects. However, the distribution of funds may not be equitable, as funding has been concentrated in a small number of projects in recent years. In FY2008, $722 million was allocated for six renovation projects and $531 million for 11 new construction projects, with a focus on homeland security needs. Funding may be geographically concentrated, with construction projects prioritizing land ports of entry along the borders with Mexico and Canada. Cities with existing federal presence are more likely to receive funding for workspace renovation. Adequate funding remains a challenge for federal building construction and renovation to meet homeland security needs and improve space. The Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) struggles to secure adequate funding for homeland security needs, courthouse security, and building repairs. Discussions may arise about restructuring the FBF for increased capital. Broadband infrastructure in the US is primarily managed by private sector companies, with federal and state regulations in place. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) data shows that 58% of U.S. households have broadband adoption, with less than 10% lacking access to any provider. Rural and lower-income areas face the most significant infrastructure gaps due to limited economic incentives for companies. The demand for broadband services may lag due to affordability issues. It is challenging to estimate the funding needed for nationwide broadband deployment. The state of broadband data in the US is incomplete, making it difficult for policymakers to determine underserved areas. Federal assistance programs like the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program aim to address infrastructure gaps in rural and lower-income areas. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have federal programs focused on financing broadband infrastructure in underserved areas. These programs have provided $1.8 billion in loans and $83.7 million in grants since inception. Other federal programs also offer financial assistance for telecommunications development, including the FCC's Universal Service Fund and potential Department of Commerce grants for broadband data collection. The Broadband Data Improvement Act (P.L. 110-385) aims to stimulate economic growth through increased broadband investment. Estimates suggest that investing in broadband deployment could create direct jobs in the technology sector and indirectly lead to millions of new jobs. Studies show that increasing broadband penetration can boost employment rates in states. Comparisons with other countries' successful broadband deployments support the argument for a federal broadband infrastructure program. Many point to successful broadband deployments in other nations as essential for U.S. economic competitiveness. The challenge is balancing federal assistance for unserved areas with minimizing negative effects on competition and private sector investment. Policy options include loans, grants, tax incentives, demand-side assistance, broadband bonds, regulatory measures, and spectrum policy to promote wireless broadband services. Congress will consider broadband deployment incentives to create jobs in the short and long term, target next-generation technologies, and align stimulus measures with national broadband policy goals."
