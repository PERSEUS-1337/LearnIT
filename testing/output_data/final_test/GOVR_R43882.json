    "content": "U.S. interests in the Western Hemisphere encompass economic, political, security, and humanitarian concerns. The region has strong economic ties with the United States, with the U.S. being a major trading partner and source of foreign investment for many countries. Free trade agreements have enhanced economic relations with 11 countries. Latin American nations, especially Mexico and Venezuela, supply a significant portion of imported crude oil to the U.S. Immigration from the Western Hemisphere is substantial, driven by geographic proximity and economic and security conditions. Curbing drug trafficking from the region has been a longstanding focus of U.S. relations with the area. The Latin American and Caribbean region has seen significant progress in democratic political development over the past three decades, with close security cooperation to combat drug trafficking. Concerns have arisen over undemocratic practices in countries like Venezuela. U.S. policy towards the region considers economic and political changes, as well as the region's growing independence from the United States. In Latin America and the Caribbean, most governments are now elected democracies, with free and fair elections being the norm. In 2015, several countries saw changes in leadership through elections, while Guatemala faced corruption scandals leading to the resignation of President Otto P\u00e9rez Molina. In 2015, Guatemala faced corruption scandals leading to the resignation of President Otto P\u00e9rez Molina. Former actor Jimmy Morales won the presidential election with a strong anticorruption platform. In 2016, several countries held elections for head of government, including Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Peru, and St. Lucia. Notably, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of Peru defeated Keiko Fujimori by a slim margin. In St. Lucia, the opposition United Workers Party led by Allen Chastanet defeated the ruling St. Lucia Labour party in June's parliamentary elections. In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega won a controversial third term in November 2016. Haiti's presidential election in October 2015 was nullified due to fraud allegations, with Jovenel Moise winning the new election in November 2016. Jovenel Moise won the 2016 Haiti election with almost 56% of the vote and is set to be inaugurated in February 2017. Despite improvements in political rights, challenges to democracy persist in the region, including issues with public services, accountability, transparency, rule of law, and citizen safety. Several elected presidents in the past 25 years have faced social turmoil, economic crises, autocratic actions, and corruption scandals leading to their early ouster. The suspension and impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in Brazil in 2016 was influenced by a scandal and economic downturn. Democracy in the region has been declining due to factors such as organized crime, abuse of power by the executive, and a deterioration of media freedom. Venezuela has been particularly noted for the abuse of power by elected leaders. A decline in media freedom in several countries due to organized crime-related violence and political attempts to control independent media. Freedom House's 2016 report categorized countries in Latin America and the Caribbean as free, partly free, or not free, with only Cuba ranked as not free. The Dominican Republic was downgraded for limiting independent media and restricting civil and political rights for Dominicans of Haitian descent and Haitian migrants. Freedom House highlights threats to freedom and democracy in Central American countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras due to criminal gangs, political violence, and corruption. Venezuela's political and economic crisis is a significant challenge, with President Maduro resisting opposition victories. The shift away from leftist governments in Latin America, seen in Argentina's election of a center-right government in 2015, is viewed positively. The defeat of a referendum in Bolivia and the peace agreement in Colombia are seen as setbacks to the leftist model of government in Latin America. The region is also facing economic challenges. In the 1990s, Latin America shifted towards export promotion, foreign capital attraction, and privatization of state enterprises. The region experienced economic downturns in 2002 and 2009 due to global crises, with varying impacts on different countries. Despite rebounds in 2010 and 2011, growth rates started to decline afterwards. In 2011, Latin America and the Caribbean experienced economic growth rates of 6.1% and 4.9%, which declined to just 1% in 2014. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected a 0.6% contraction in 2016 due to global commodity price declines and China's economic slowdown. Brazil and Venezuela saw economic contractions in 2015, with Brazil projected to contract by 3.3% in 2016 and Venezuela by 10%. Business and consumer confidence in Brazil is showing signs of improvement, with a projected increase of 0.5% in 2017. Latin America has made progress in combating poverty and inequality since the early 2000s, with a decrease in poverty rates from 44% in 2002 to 28% in 2012. This was achieved through increasing per capita income levels and targeted public expenditures like conditional cash transfer programs. However, in 2015, poverty in the region increased to 29.2% due to contracting economies. In 2015, poverty in Latin America increased to 29.2% as economies contracted, with an estimated 175 million people living in poverty. The region's confidence in solving its own problems grew due to political stability and economic performance, reducing dependency on the United States. Latin American countries diversified economic and diplomatic ties with other nations, including China. China has become a major trading partner in Latin America, with total trade growing significantly from 2002 to 2014 before dropping in 2015. The United States remains the largest trading partner in the region. Latin American countries have established regional integration organizations, reflecting increasing independence and cooperation within the region. The 11-member group ALBA was founded by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2004 to promote regional integration and alleviate poverty. Despite its goals, it was often associated with anti-American rhetoric. With Ch\u00e1vez's death in 2013 and the decline in oil prices since 2014, Venezuela's influence in the region has been challenged. Another regional organization, UNASUR, was established in 2008 to promote political, economic, and security coordination. UNASUR, established in 2008 largely due to Brazil's influence, aims to promote coordination in South America, resolving disputes and conflicts. Despite some successes in defusing tensions, questions have been raised about its efficacy and financial support. In 2014, efforts to mediate political unrest in Venezuela ultimately failed. The Pacific Alliance, formed in 2011, focuses on trade integration among its members. The Pacific Alliance, established in 2011, promotes trade integration among Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Costa Rica and Panama are potential members. The Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), formed in 2011, aims to enhance regional cooperation and excludes the US and Canada. There are concerns that CELAC could overshadow the Organization of American States (OAS), but it lacks a permanent staff to compete with OAS. CELAC, formed in 2011, aims to enhance regional cooperation and exclude the US and Canada. It lacks a permanent staff to compete with OAS. In January 2015, China hosted the first China-CELAC Forum, agreeing to a five-year cooperation plan. CELAC held its third summit in Costa Rica and the fourth summit in Ecuador in January 2016. The establishment of CELAC reflects a desire to reduce US influence in the region, but the US remains engaged through OAS and its affiliated organizations. US officials support OAS Secretary-General Luis Almagro's efforts to protect democracy and human rights in the region. The Summit of the Americas process, linked to OAS, is crucial for US engagement with Latin American nations. The sixth Summit of the Americas in 2012 showed U.S. divergence on Cuba and anti-drug policy but also aimed to deepen hemispheric integration. The upcoming seventh Summit in Panama in 2015 faced challenges regarding Cuba's attendance, with many Latin American countries threatening to boycott if Cuba was not invited. Panama eventually decided to invite Cuba, causing a dilemma for the United States. In August 2014, Panama announced it would invite Cuba to the Summit of the Americas, creating a dilemma for the Obama Administration. However, in December 2014, President Obama announced a new policy approach towards Cuba, allowing them to participate in the summit. Cuba ultimately attended the summit in Panama, where a historic meeting between President Obama and President Ra\u00fal Castro took place. The Obama Administration outlined four priorities for U.S. policy towards Latin America and the Caribbean: promoting economic and social opportunity, ensuring citizen security, strengthening democratic institutions, and securing a clean energy future. The Obama Administration emphasized partnership and shared responsibility in its policy approach towards the region, promoting stable, prosperous, and democratic nations in the hemisphere. President Obama highlighted equal partnership at the sixth Summit of the Americas in 2012, stating that all nations are equal partners. The commitment to work with hemispheric nations in the spirit of genuine and equal partnership was reiterated by then-Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson in 2012. In a November 2013 OAS address, Secretary of State John Kerry declared the end of the Monroe Doctrine era and emphasized the importance of the United States working with other hemispheric nations as equal partners to promote democracy, security, peace, prosperity, and address climate change challenges. Kerry highlighted the need for countries to view each other as equals, share responsibilities, cooperate on security issues, and make decisions together to advance shared values and interests. In December 2013, Assistant Secretary of State Jacobson emphasized the administration's commitment to engagement in the Americas, focusing on partnership initiatives with Latin America. In December 2014, President Obama announced a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba, moving towards normalization of relations by easing sanctions and reestablishing diplomatic ties. The shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba in December 2014 led to the easing of sanctions, removal from the sponsors of terrorism list, and reestablishment of diplomatic relations. Latin American and Caribbean leaders, as well as regional organizations like CARICOM, OAS, and UNASUR, welcomed the change. President Obama and Vice President Biden highlighted the significance of the policy shift, emphasizing improved partnerships and collaboration in the region. The policy priority in Latin America is to expand economic opportunity to address poverty and inequality. Despite improvements since 2002, recent economic downturns have caused a rise in poverty levels. Innovative programs like the Pathways to Prosperity Initiative aim to help countries learn from each other's experiences. The OAS Inter-American Social Protection Network, supported by the U.S., aims to reduce social disparities and extreme poverty through the exchange of best practices. President Obama's 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative promotes student exchanges between Latin America and the U.S. as part of efforts to combat global hunger and advance food security. At the sixth Summit of the Americas in 2012, President Obama announced initiatives to expand economic opportunity in Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras. The Small Business Network of the Americas helps small businesses participate in international trade, while the Women's Entrepreneurship in the Americas program aims to increase women's economic participation. The Innovation Fund of the Americas, launched by USAID, finances effective solutions to challenges. The USAID initiative aims to finance effective solutions for development challenges, with a focus on advancing citizen security in Latin America due to high levels of crime and violence linked to drug trafficking. U.S. support in the region, including programs like Plan Colombia, has been key in combating drug trafficking and production for over 30 years. The Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI) was initiated in 2011 to align U.S. assistance with the follow-up strategy to Plan Colombia. U.S. support also includes partnerships with other countries in the region to combat drug trafficking and reduce crime. The United States provides foreign aid to support democratic governance in the region, focusing on rule of law, human rights, good governance, political competition, and civil society. This includes improving state institutions and supporting NGOs working on democracy and human rights issues. The Obama Administration supported NGOs working on democracy and human rights issues, defended press freedoms, and advocated for the rights of LGBTI individuals in the hemisphere. U.S. officials spoke out against human rights abuses in countries like Cuba and Venezuela, threats to political rights in Nicaragua, and the erosion of freedom of expression in the region. They also emphasized the importance of combating corruption in the region. The Obama Administration emphasized the need to strengthen democratic institutions and the rule of law in the region to combat corruption, which siphons funds from important social projects and fuels organized crime. Additionally, the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas was introduced to promote collaboration on clean energy in vulnerable countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean face climate change challenges and energy security issues. ECPA promotes clean energy, enhances energy security, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions through voluntary initiatives involving international organizations, regional organizations, and the private sector. President Obama and Colombia launched Connecting the Americas 2022 at the sixth Summit of the Americas in 2012 to achieve universal access to reliable, clean, and affordable electricity. The Administration also initiated the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative in 2014 and established a clean energy financing facility for the Caribbean and Central America in 2015. During the Obama Administration, there was continuity in U.S. policy toward Latin America with an emphasis on partnership and shared responsibility. Support was provided to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in Colombia, Mexico, and Central America through initiatives like the M\u00e9rida Initiative and CARSI. Assistance to Mexico shifted towards rule of law programs. During the Obama Administration, U.S. policy in Latin America focused on partnership and shared responsibility. Support for combating drug trafficking and organized crime in Colombia, Mexico, and Central America was emphasized. Assistance to Colombia shifted towards rule of law programs, human rights, and economic development. U.S. assistance levels to Colombia decreased as the country took over responsibility for programs once funded by the United States. Trade bills for FTAs with Colombia and Panama negotiated under the Bush Administration were enacted into law in October 2011. During the Obama Administration, trade bills for FTAs with Colombia and Panama were enacted into law in October 2011. In 2015, an extension of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) was enacted benefitting 15 countries in the region. The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement with Mexico, Chile, Peru, and eight other Pacific countries was concluded in October 2015, but the 114th Congress did not take any action on implementing legislation. President-elect Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the TPP in November 2016. Trump announced in November 2016 his intention to withdraw from the TPP, impacting U.S. trade with Latin American countries. Obama supported immigration reform, providing relief for certain immigrants, but faced challenges in implementing broader initiatives. The Obama Administration implemented policy changes in Latin America, emphasizing partnership and shared responsibility. They established various partnership programs in security, energy, and economic opportunities, promoting mutual respect through engagement and dialogue. A significant shift was the normalization of relations with Cuba in 2014, positively impacting U.S. relations with the region. The Obama Administration implemented policy changes in Latin America, emphasizing partnership and shared responsibility. They normalized relations with Cuba in 2014 and pursued policy shifts in Venezuela, Central America, and the Caribbean. This included sanctions on Venezuelan officials, a broader approach in Central America focusing on economic development and governance, and addressing energy needs in the Caribbean through the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative (CESI). In the 113th Congress, legislative actions included measures related to Latin America and the Caribbean, such as the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement and the 2014 farm bill. Additionally, there were appropriations measures for foreign aid with provisions on Latin America and requirements for reports on various disputes and recovery efforts in the region. The 114th Congress enacted legislation addressing post-earthquake recovery in Haiti and imposing sanctions for human rights abuses in Venezuela. Significant actions included the FY2016 omnibus appropriations measure with increased funding for Central America and the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act with provisions for Central America and restrictions on funding for the closure of Guantanamo Bay. Congress also approved an extension of the Generalized System of Preferences earlier in the year. In 2016, Congress took action on various measures related to the region, including extending the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) through 2017 and passing resolutions supporting freedom of the press and condemning violations in the region. Legislation was also enacted to extend the termination date for imposing targeted sanctions on individuals for human rights abuses in Venezuela. In 2016, Congress passed legislation related to Latin America and the Caribbean, including funding for Zika virus control and a strategy for U.S. engagement with the Caribbean. Additionally, a Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission was established to review U.S. drug control policy in the region. The National Defense Authorization Act also included provisions for the region. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), P.L. 114-328 (S. 2943), signed into law by the President on December 23, includes provisions extending a unified counterdrug and counterterrorism campaign in Colombia, prohibiting the closure of the U.S. Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay, requiring a joint report on military units in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and restricting funding for Cuba's participation in certain exercises. In FY2017, Congress did not pass standalone legislation for foreign aid appropriations but instead enacted a continuing resolution (P.L. 114-254) funding most programs at FY2016 levels with a slight reduction. The 115th Congress will need to finalize FY2017 foreign aid appropriations, with oversight focusing on U.S. interests in Latin America and the Caribbean, the Administration's policy shift on Cuba, aid for Central America, and the migration crisis. The text chunk discusses various issues in Latin America and the Caribbean, including trade with Cuba, aid for Central America, Venezuela's crisis, Haiti's situation, Iran's activities, energy issues, Colombia's peace talks, press freedom threats, Chinese and Russian engagement, human rights in Cuba and Venezuela, the Zika epidemic, U.S. engagement with the Caribbean, and the democratic setback in Nicaragua. Foreign aid is highlighted as a crucial tool for advancing U.S. policy priorities in the region. The Obama Administration's foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean in FY2017 was $1.74 billion, similar to the amount appropriated in FY2016. Aid to the region has increased since FY2014 but remains below FY2012 levels. Most U.S. assistance is focused on implementing the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, as well as programs in Colombia, Haiti, and Mexico. In FY2017, the Obama Administration's foreign aid budget for Latin America and the Caribbean was $1.74 billion, similar to FY2016. Most aid is focused on implementing the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, as well as programs in Colombia, Haiti, and Mexico. Funding for foreign aid programs was extended through a continuing resolution until April 28, 2017. The Obama Administration's foreign aid budget for Latin America and the Caribbean in FY2017 was $1.74 billion, similar to FY2016. Funding for foreign aid programs was extended through a continuing resolution until April 28, 2017, with additional appropriations for global health assistance to address the Zika virus outbreak. The 114th Congress enacted legislative measures affecting U.S. foreign aid to the region, including P.L. 114-223 and P.L. 114-323. The incoming 115th Congress will need to complete action on FY2017 appropriations for the rest of the fiscal year. The FY2017 NDAA, P.L. 114-323, established a Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission to review U.S. drug control policy in the region. It also extended DOD's authority to support counterdrug and counterterrorism efforts in Colombia, mandated annual budget requests for security cooperation programs, and required the development of an assessment framework for such programs. Latin America is a significant source of migration to the United States, driven by factors such as familial ties, poverty, political instability, and crime. The 114th Congress conducted oversight hearings on foreign aid programs in the region. The FY2017 NDAA established a commission to review drug policy and mandated assessment frameworks for security cooperation programs. Increased border enforcement in the mid-1990s has made unauthorized entry into the United States more difficult, leading migrants to rely on alien smugglers to cross the border. Migrants face risks such as kidnapping and human trafficking during their journey. Latin American governments support comprehensive immigration reform in the U.S., but it was not on the agenda in the 114th Congress. President Obama's 2012 executive action provided relief from removal for illegal immigrants. President Obama's 2012 executive action provided relief from deportation for certain immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children. El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and Nicaragua have requested extensions for temporary protected status (TPS), while Guatemala seeks inclusion in the program. TPS is granted to eligible nationals when their country is affected by armed conflict, natural disasters, or other extraordinary conditions. TPS for Haiti is set to expire in July 2017, for Honduras and Nicaragua in January 2018, and for El Salvador in March 2018. Latin America and the Caribbean are top destinations for U.S. deportations, with 235,413 individuals deported in FY2015. In FY2015, DHS deported 235,413 individuals worldwide, with 94% returned to Mexico and Central America. Concerns exist about the safety of Mexican deportees and the impact of deportations on countries in the region. Requests have been made for better information on deportees with criminal records and reintegration assistance. DHS provides criminal history information to some countries, while USAID offers reception and reintegration assistance to certain nations. Mexico and Central American governments are increasing consular services for their citizens in the U.S. Increased consular services are being provided to citizens living in the United States, including legal service referrals for those facing deportation. Illegal emigration from Mexico has decreased, but there has been a surge in illegal emigration of families and unaccompanied children from Central America since mid-2014. Analysts suggest that sustainable reductions in migration flows would require addressing the poor security and socioeconomic conditions in Central America. The number of undocumented Cubans entering the U.S. by land has significantly increased in recent years, with most entering through the southwest border. The number of Cubans entering the U.S. through the southwest border has significantly increased due to changes in immigration policies. Thousands of Cubans became stranded in Central American transit countries, prompting negotiations for their passage to the U.S. The Dominican government is addressing citizenship issues for Haitian descendants and undocumented individuals. The U.S. government is working on naturalization and regularization plans to benefit qualifying individuals and ensure transparent deportations. Foreign assistance is being provided through U.N. and other entities to address migration factors from Central America and support Mexico's migration management. Congress is focusing on border security challenges in the Western Hemisphere, including the increase in African, Asian, and Haitian migration to the southwestern border. Legislation was introduced in Congress to address migration push factors in Central America and provide legal aid to Central American asylum seekers in the United States. The Secure the Northern Triangle Act (S. 3106 and H.R. 5850) aimed to bolster country and regional responses to migration challenges. Congressional oversight also focused on State Department assistance and the Central American Minors in-country refugee/parole processing program. The Latin American and Caribbean region is a key trading partner for the United States, despite challenges like diplomatic tensions and violence in some countries. Economic relations between the US and most trading partners in the region remain strong. The United States has strong economic ties with Latin America and the Caribbean, accounting for a significant portion of trade in the region. This includes trade agreements with countries like Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and others. The United States has trade agreements with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Mexico, Chile, and Colombia. The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement includes countries like Chile, Mexico, and Peru, while some South American economies like Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela have not formed comprehensive agreements with the US. Other bilateral and plurilateral trade agreements exist in the Western Hemisphere without the US involvement. The US also extends trade preferences through programs like the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act and the Generalized System of Preferences. The Trade Preferences Extension Act authorized GSP through December 31, 2017, aiming to improve regional supply networks and hemispheric cooperation. The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement could have significant implications for U.S. trade with Mexico, Chile, Peru, Canada, and other Pacific countries. The proposed TPP trade agreement aimed to update trade rules related to NAFTA, including provisions on intellectual property rights, investment, services trade, worker rights, and the environment. Central American countries were concerned about potential impacts on their trade competitiveness, particularly in apparel and textiles. Congress was interested in worker rights, IPR protection, environmental issues, services trade, investment, and rules-of-origin provisions in the TPP, as well as its potential effects on Central America and broader trade policy efforts in the region. President-elect Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the TPP and examine the ramifications of withdrawing from NAFTA. The United States was granted observer status to the Pacific Alliance, a trade initiative among Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Energy reform in Mexico and its implications for U.S. oil imports and business opportunities were also of interest to Congress. Latin America and the Caribbean play a significant role in U.S. counternarcotics policy due to being a source and transit zone for illicit drugs like cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, and opiates. The region's impact on the opioid crisis in the United States, particularly from Mexico, has raised concerns among policymakers. Latin America, particularly Mexico, has seen an increase in opium poppy cultivation and heroin production. The region's drug trafficking and crime syndicates have led to high levels of violence and drug-related homicides. Despite efforts to combat the drug trade, governments in Latin America struggle with overwhelmed law enforcement and border control agencies, as well as government corruption facilitated by criminal kingpins. The illicit drug trade in Latin America, fueled by criminal kingpins, hinders efforts to stop drug trafficking and prosecute offenders. There is a belief that the ongoing demand for drugs in the U.S. contributes to crime and violence in the region. Some Latin American leaders are exploring alternative drug policies, with hopes that the 2016 U.N. General Assembly Special Session on illicit drugs would prompt discussions on changing marijuana-related crime policies. Some countries in Latin America are already adjusting their drug laws to decriminalize certain aspects. In Latin America, countries are adjusting drug laws to decriminalize drug possession and consumption, as well as to reduce penalties for drug supply. Uruguay and Bolivia have taken unique approaches, such as establishing a legal market for cannabis and decriminalizing activities involving coca leaf. Colombia recently ended its U.S.-supported aerial eradication campaign for coca crops. The World Health Organization announced in March 2015 that the herbicide used to eradicate coca crops may cause cancer in humans. U.S. counternarcotics policy in Latin America and the Caribbean remains a key issue, with the 114th Congress debating drug policy reform and evaluating counternarcotics goals in the region. Congress passed P.L. 114-323 in December 2016, establishing a drug policy commission to review U.S. foreign policy efforts in combating drug trafficking in the hemisphere. The 114th Congress established a drug policy commission to review U.S. foreign policy efforts in combating drug trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean. The potential threat of terrorism in most countries in the region is low, with most terrorist acts occurring in the Andean region of South America. The Andean region of South America has seen terrorist activities by Colombian and Peruvian guerrilla groups designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the U.S. State Department. The FARC engaged in peace negotiations with the Colombian government, resulting in a peace accord signed in 2016. The ELN has not started formal talks yet, while the Shining Path has been weakened by Peruvian military operations. The United States is concerned about Iran's activities in South America, including ties to Hezbollah and the 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires. There are also worries about support for the Islamic State in the region. The U.S. uses various tools to counter terrorism, such as sanctions, assistance, and cooperation through the Organization of American States. The United States has imposed sanctions on Venezuela and Cuba for their involvement in supporting terrorist organizations in the Western Hemisphere. Congress has also enacted legislation to counter terrorism in the region. The Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012 required the Administration to address Iran's presence in the region. The 114th Congress oversaw terrorism concerns in the Western Hemisphere, including activities of Iran and Hezbollah, peace agreement in Colombia, border security, and terrorist financing in South America. Legislation was introduced but not approved, including a provision in the FY2017 NDAA extending a counterdrug and counterterrorism campaign in Colombia. The House passed H.R. 4482 in April 2016, requiring a border threat analysis and strategic plan to prevent terrorists from entering the US. Senate resolutions addressed the AMIA bombing in Argentina and urged monitoring of Iran's activities in Latin America. Initiatives focused on Cuba harboring US fugitives, a long-standing issue noted in terrorism reports. The OAS, founded in 1948, has been a key forum for U.S. regional cooperation in the Western Hemisphere. Its actions have historically aligned with U.S. policy, reflecting the dominant power in the region. The OAS, founded in 1948, historically aligned with U.S. policy in the region. However, over the past 15 years, Latin American and Caribbean governments have adopted more independent foreign policies. While the organization's mission still aligns with U.S. goals, it has become less receptive to U.S. initiatives and struggles with funding. U.S. policymakers have expressed concerns about the organization's increasing independence. The OAS is facing criticism for not effectively supporting democracy and human rights. Some argue that the U.S. should use its influence, including funding, to push for stronger action. Others believe the OAS is still important for U.S. relations with other countries in the hemisphere and should be strengthened. The 114th Congress continued to provide funding for the OAS, with the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocating funds for the U.S. assessed contribution and voluntary contributions for development assistance programs and democracy strengthening. The OAS received a $4.1 million voluntary contribution for the Fund for Strengthening Democracy, including $2 million for the IACHR. Congress passed a continuing resolution in December 2016 to fund foreign operations in FY2017 at the FY2016 level with a slight reduction. The Senate Appropriations Committee's FY2017 bill would have increased assistance to the OAS, including $16.5 million for voluntary contributions. The 114th Congress took action on legislative measures related to the OAS, including establishing a drug policy commission to review U.S. counternarcotics policy in the hemisphere. The House also adopted a resolution urging Western Hemisphere countries to uphold principles outlined in the Inter-American system. The House passed the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act (H.R. 5708) urging OAS electoral observation missions to Nicaragua in 2016 and 2017. Latin America and the Caribbean face climate change risks despite contributing a small portion of global CO2 emissions. Latin America contributes a small percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from deforestation. The region relies on clean energy sources like hydroelectric power but faces challenges such as erosion, severe weather events, and sea-level rise. Climate change poses risks to agriculture, tourism, biodiversity, and livelihoods in Latin America. Climate change poses risks to agriculture, tourism, biodiversity, and livelihoods in Latin America, with lower fish catches, coral reef die-offs, and the spread of mosquito-borne illnesses. Latin American countries have made advances in low-carbon energy production, such as solar, wind, and biofuels, with Brazil reducing deforestation in the Amazon and Mexico leading in environmental initiatives. Mexico played a significant role in the global climate change efforts, submitting its pledge for the Paris Agreement in 2015. The agreement aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote cooperation among nations to adapt to climate change. It came into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement, in force since November 4, 2016, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through voluntary pledges. Latin America and the Caribbean nations' approach to climate change in 2017 and beyond may vary due to diverse political perspectives and geographies. There is consensus in Latin America that climate change is a crucial policy issue. The region faces challenges from the 2015-2016 El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomena. The 2015-2016 El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomena caused floods and droughts in Central America and Bolivia. Latin American and Caribbean nations are striving for sustainable growth with low CO2 emissions development. The Obama Administration's policy focused on securing a clean energy future through the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA), which promoted clean energy technologies and partnerships. In FY2014, new U.S. assistance under ECPA concluded, but existing projects continued through FY2016. In October 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry launched a $10 million clean energy initiative for Central America and the Caribbean, targeting the private sector for increased investment in clean energy projects. Western Hemisphere countries received $71.4 million in foreign assistance for climate change initiatives in FY2015 and an estimated $70.5 million in FY2016. The FY2017 request was for $70.7 million. Members of the 114th Congress showed interest in these programs and their impact on the region. During the 114th Congress, discussions focused on the U.S. response to the Zika virus outbreak in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Colombia. The virus, which can cause severe birth defects, has spread throughout the Western Hemisphere. Brazil has reported the highest number of Zika cases and associated microcephaly. The region's response has been led by Brazil and Colombia. The Zika outbreak in Latin America, led by Brazil and Colombia, has raised concerns about health system capacity in Central America and the Caribbean to handle Zika cases, especially among pregnant women. The Obama Administration requested almost $1.9 billion in funding for Zika response, with $526 million allocated for international efforts. USAID reprogrammed $215 million for international efforts, including a $78 million transfer to the CDC. The CDC and USAID are prioritizing vector control, social communication, and maternal health services to prevent Zika spread in Haiti, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic. The CDC is collaborating with Brazil and Colombia on Zika research, vaccine development, and supporting surveillance and treatment capabilities in other countries. Key policy issues include supplemental appropriations for Zika response in 2016 and a continuing resolution for FY2017 foreign aid programs. The continuing resolution (P.L. 114-223) funded foreign aid programs from October 1, 2016, to December 9, 2016, and included $145.5 million for global health assistance to combat the Zika virus outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean. Argentina, with a population of almost 43 million, has had a democratic tradition since 1983, with President Mauricio Macri leading the center-right Republican Proposal party. In 2015, Mauricio Macri, representing center-right and center-left parties, won the presidential race in Argentina, ending the 12-year Kirchnerismo era. Macri succeeded Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and focused on economic reforms and improving relations with the United States. Argentina has a diverse economy with a strong agricultural sector and educated population. In 2001-2002, Argentina faced a severe economic crisis due to unsustainable debt, defaulting on nearly $100 billion. Subsequent administrations resolved most of the debt through restructurings in 2005 and 2010. In 2014, an agreement was reached to repay foreign governments. Macri prioritized resolving the standoff with private creditors, reaching an agreement in 2016. In April 2016, Argentina resolved its default by issuing new government bonds and paying holdout creditors. U.S.-Argentine relations have been characterized by robust commercial ties and cooperation in various areas. President Obama visited Argentina in March 2016, increasing cooperation in trade, investment, and renewable energy. President Obama's state visit to Argentina in March 2016 focused on increasing cooperation in trade, investment, renewable energy, climate change, and citizen security. He also announced efforts to declassify U.S. documents from the era of military rule. Secretary of State John Kerry launched a High-Level Dialogue with Argentina in August 2016 to ensure sustained engagement on bilateral issues and regional challenges, including democracy and human rights. U.S.-Argentine relations have been a priority for Congress, especially regarding the investigation of the 1994 bombing. Progress has been made in investigating the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) and the death of special prosecutor Alberto Nisman in January 2015. Some Members of Congress have tried to block the lifting of U.S. import restrictions on fresh beef and lemon imports from Argentina. Two Senate resolutions on Argentina were introduced in the 114th Congress but not considered. S.Res. 167 would have called for an internationally backed investigation into Nisman's death, while S.Res. 620 would have supported the partnership between Argentina and the United States. President Macri praised the government for economic reforms and resolving disputes with international creditors. He urged investigation and prosecution for the AMIA bombing and Nisman's death. Brazil has potential as a world power but has faced setbacks like military rule and economic challenges. Brazil experienced a period of rapid economic growth fueled by international demand for commodities, leading to the expansion of the middle class and strengthening its international stature. However, the economy began to slow in 2011, contracting by 3.8% in 2015 and expected to contract by 3.3% in 2016, causing some to fall back into poverty as unemployment rises. In Brazil, a corruption scandal led to the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in 2016. President Michel Temer, her successor, has faced corruption allegations as well. Despite policy reforms, the economy has struggled to recover, with high unemployment rates. The United States has had strong economic and political ties with Brazil in the past. The relationship between the United States and Brazil has been strained at times due to disagreements over foreign policies and national interests. Despite this, bilateral cooperation gradually resumed, leading to President Rousseff's official visit to the White House in June 2015. There has been continuity in U.S.-Brazilian relations despite the change in government in Brazil, with bilateral dialogues continuing throughout the impeachment process against President Rousseff. The Obama Administration expressed confidence in the impeachment process following Rousseff's removal in 2016. The Obama Administration expressed confidence in Brazil's impeachment process and pledged to continue working with the Brazilian government. The 114th Congress approved legislative measures impacting U.S.-Brazil relations, including renewing the Generalized System of Preferences program and authorizing IMF reforms with greater voting power for Brazil. Foreign assistance of $10.5 million was provided for conservation programs in Brazil. For FY2017, foreign aid programs for Brazil are funded at the FY2016 level with a 0.2% reduction until April 28, 2017. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aimed to address issues such as informing travelers about the Zika virus and pressuring Brazil to amend its extradition policies. Several Members of the 114th Congress expressed concerns about Brazil, including the Zika virus precautions for the 2016 Olympics and the impeachment process threatening democracy. Various reports provide additional information on Brazil's crisis, background, trade relations, Zika virus, and the 2016 Olympic Games. Many Caribbean nations serve as transit countries for illicit drugs bound for the U.S. and European markets. President Obama identified several countries in the region as major drug-producing or drug-transit countries in 2016. Homicide rates have risen in some Caribbean countries due to gangs, organized crime, and drug trafficking competition. The Obama Administration established the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative in 2009 to combat illicit activities in the region. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) aims to reduce illicit trafficking, enhance public safety, and promote social justice in the Caribbean. U.S. funding for the program totaled $444 million from FY2010 to FY2016, supporting areas such as security cooperation, law enforcement capacity building, border/port security, justice sector reform, and crime prevention for at-risk youth. In FY2016, Congress allocated $57.7 million for the CBSI, exceeding the Administration's request. The Obama Administration launched the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative (CESI) in 2014 with the goal of promoting cleaner and more sustainable energy in the Caribbean. The initiative includes various U.S. activities to facilitate cleaner energy sources, finance projects, increase energy efficiency, and expand access to electricity and technology. The recommended funding for CESI in FY2016 was $5 million. In FY2016, the explanatory statement to the omnibus measure provided $2 million for the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative (CESI). Vice President Biden hosted a Caribbean Energy Security Summit in January 2015, where commitment to cleaner energy future was reiterated. President Obama announced a Clean Energy Finance Facility for the Caribbean and Central America in April 2015. In October 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry announced the opening of a facility for representatives from the United States, governments in the region, and regional institutions. Vice President Biden hosted a U.S.-Caribbean-Central American Energy Summit in May 2016, addressing energy security issues and urging countries to diversify their energy sources. Concerns about drug trafficking through the Caribbean led to sustained congressional interest in the CBSI program. The Administration requested $48.4 million for the CBSI in FY2017, a 16% reduction from FY2016. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $57.7 million for the CBSI, while the Senate Appropriations Committee's report did not specify an amount. In December 2016, Congress enacted P.L. 114-291, the United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act of 2016, aiming to increase engagement with the Caribbean. The Act requires the Secretary of State to submit a multiyear strategy to Congress for U.S. engagement with the Caribbean region, including efforts to improve energy. The United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act of 2016 aims to improve energy security and citizen security in the Caribbean region. It requires a report evaluating the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) and making recommendations for its effectiveness. Congress also approved a new commission to review U.S. drug control policy in the Western Hemisphere, including an evaluation of the CBSI. U.S. policymakers have expressed concerns about conditions in Central America. U.S. policymakers have expressed significant concerns about conditions in Central America, particularly in the \"northern triangle\" countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. High levels of crime and violence are linked to factors such as social exclusion and weak security institutions. Transnational criminal organizations have worsened security conditions by fighting for control of territory to transport illicit narcotics. Congress has allocated $1.5 billion in assistance through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) to address these challenges. The Obama Administration launched a new whole-of-government \"U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America\" to address underlying socioeconomic challenges in the region, focusing on fostering prosperity, improving governance, and continuing to address security concerns. The governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, with support from the Inter-American Development Bank, are carrying out complementary efforts under their \"Plan of the Alliance for\" initiative. Many analysts doubt the commitment of leaders in the region to make significant structural changes due to recent corruption scandals. Despite some reforms being implemented by the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, challenges persist such as violence, poverty, and migration to the U.S. border. The 114th Congress expressed concerns about conditions in Central America and allocated $750 million in funding to support development and security efforts in the region. The 114th Congress allocated $750 million for the Administration's Central America strategy, with conditions on aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. A continuing resolution (P.L. 114-254) in December 2016 extended funding for most foreign aid programs in FY2017 at FY2016 levels. The FY2016 NDAA (P.L. 114-92) emphasized the importance of stability and security in Central American nations. The 114th Congress allocated $750 million for the Administration's Central America strategy, with conditions on aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The FY2017 NDAA prioritized efforts to address security threats in the region and authorized $30 million for U.S. Southern Command operational support for Central America. Congress also approved P.L. 114-323 in December 2016, which included provisions related to security and stability in Central America. Several legislative initiatives related to Central America were introduced in the 114th Congress, including bills seeking to condition aid on efforts to prevent unauthorized migration and provide a coordinated regional response to violence. One bill aimed to suspend security assistance to Honduras until human rights conditions were met. In the 114th Congress, legislative initiatives related to Central America included bills to condition aid on preventing unauthorized migration and addressing violence. One bill sought to halt security assistance to Honduras until human rights conditions were fulfilled. Additional information can be found in various CRS reports on Central America, including topics on unaccompanied children, regional security, gangs, trade agreements, and U.S. relations with El Salvador and Honduras. Colombia, the third-most-populous country in Latin America, has a population of around 48 million. Colombia, the third-most-populous country in Latin America with around 48 million inhabitants, has been a key U.S. ally enduring an internal armed conflict for half a century. In July 2016, a plebiscite was approved for Colombian voters to decide on a peace accord between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The first accord was rejected in October 2016 by a narrow margin, leading to further negotiations between the Santos government and FARC. In late November 2016, the Colombian Congress approved a second peace accord between the Santos government and the FARC, addressing criticisms from the \"No\" campaign. The fast-track mechanism for implementation was upheld by the Colombian Constitutional Court on December 13, 2016. The FARC, a leftist group, has funded their activities through extortion and drug trafficking, evolving into a major drug trafficking organization. Despite this, negotiations for peace were favored over continued hostilities. The Santos Administration negotiated a peace settlement with the FARC, despite concerns of giving away too many concessions. The U.S. Congress remains invested in Colombia's political future, supporting security, stability, and various collaborations with the country. Colombia has been a significant source of drug trafficking, funding civil conflict through left-wing and right-wing armed groups. Colombia, with U.S. support under Plan Colombia, made progress in reestablishing government control, combating drug trafficking, and reducing poverty. Despite the peace accord with FARC, the ELN and criminal groups persist, with some eyeing former FARC territory. The ELN is in preparatory peace talks with the Santos Administration, with formal peace talks expected in 2017. The cost of implementing the government-FARC peace accord may exceed $30 billion over the next decade. U.S. foreign assistance to Colombia has been declining, with President Obama proposing the Peace Colombia initiative totaling $450 million in support. President Santos continues market-oriented economic policies. During his first term, the U.S. Congress approved the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, making the United States Colombia's top trade partner. Colombia's growth rate declined to 3.1% in 2015 and is projected to slow to slightly below 2% in 2016 due to lower earnings from energy exports. Key policy issues include foreign assistance funding to Colombia and the country's ongoing internal conflict. Members of the U.S. Congress may need to evaluate if Peace Colombia or another post-accord program can assist Colombia in achieving sustainable peace. Secretary of State John Kerry believes that implementing the peace accord in Colombia would help stabilize the region and provide a return on the U.S. investment in Plan Colombia. However, some observers argue that Colombia, as an upper-middle-income country with significant capacity, may be able to handle reconstruction efforts independently. For more information, refer to CRS Report R43813, Colombia: Background and U.S. Relations, and other related reports. Cuba remains a one-party communist state with a poor human rights record. Ra\u00fal Castro succeeded Fidel Castro in 2006 and began his final term in 2013. Market-oriented economic reforms have been implemented, but tight political control persists. Short-term detentions and harassment have increased, despite the release of long-term political prisoners. In recent years, Congress has shaped U.S. policy towards Cuba through legislation strengthening or easing economic sanctions. President Obama shifted policy in 2014 towards engagement and normalization of relations, emphasizing the importance of engagement over isolation. Talks were initiated to restore diplomatic relations. The policy change towards Cuba under President Obama included restoring diplomatic relations, rescinding Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and easing embargo regulations. Despite these steps, the overall embargo remains in place and can only be lifted with congressional action or specific conditions in Cuba. President Obama's visit to Cuba in 2016 aimed to advance the normalization process. The outlook for U.S. policy towards Cuba under President-elect Trump is uncertain. The Obama Administration's shift in Cuba policy sparked interest in Congress, with some members supporting the initiative while others criticized it for not obtaining more concessions from Cuba. In the 114th Congress, various legislative initiatives were introduced on both sides of the policy debate, including provisions in appropriations bills to block some policy changes and introduce new economic sanctions. The outlook for U.S. policy towards Cuba under President-elect Trump is uncertain. In the 114th Congress, legislative initiatives were introduced to block some Cuba policy changes and introduce new economic sanctions. Provisions in appropriations bills aimed to ease certain sanctions were not included in the FY2016 omnibus appropriations measure. In 2016, House FY2017 appropriations measures had provisions to block Cuba policy changes, while a Senate appropriations measure would have lifted certain sanctions. The Senate foreign aid appropriations bill would have funded additional personnel costs for the U.S. Embassy in Cuba and democracy programs, while the House version would have prohibited assistance for expanding the U.S. diplomatic presence. In the 114th Congress, legislative initiatives were introduced to block some Cuba policy changes and introduce new economic sanctions. Provisions in appropriations bills aimed to ease certain sanctions were not included in the FY2016 omnibus appropriations measure. Congress enacted a continuing resolution (P.L. 114-254) in December 2016, which funded foreign aid appropriations through April 28, 2017. Provisions in various bills prohibited funding to close the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The FY2017 NDAA, P.L. 114-328 prohibits Department of Defense funding for Cuba's participation in certain exercises. Various bills in the 114th Congress aimed to lift or increase sanctions on Cuba. For more information, refer to CRS reports on Cuba policy and sanctions. In 2015, Guatemala's judicial system investigated government corruption, leading to the resignation and arrest of its president and vice-president. The country formed an interim government, held elections, and transferred power to newly elected president Jimmy Morales in January 2016. President Jimmy Morales took office in January 2016 after a period of government corruption and elections. He faces challenges such as high crime rates, impunity, and poverty. Morales' government policy focuses on zero tolerance for corruption, modernizing the state, improving health and education, supporting small businesses, promoting tourism and housing, and protecting the environment. Despite some resignations, Morales has been implementing tax reforms and appointing experienced professionals in key positions. In July 2016, the Morales Administration faced criticism for not resolving the health care crisis in Guatemala, with severe shortages of medicine and supplies in hospitals. The Finance Ministry did not transfer funds to support cash transfer programs for the poor until midway through the year. Attorney General Thelma Aldana's Public Ministry lacked funding, limiting its ability to investigate corruption and human rights cases. Aldana believed threats against her were from organized crime in response to her anti-corruption efforts with the CICIG in 2015. The Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) uncovered a corruption ring at the national tax agency, leading to the resignations and arrests of President Otto Perez Molina and his vice president. Over 200 officials have been arrested and charged for corruption. In March 2016, the Public Ministry prosecuted the first case for sexual violence during the civil war and made public previously unknown military documents from 1983 to 1990. President Morales caused controversy by planning to revive a traditional army parade suspended out of respect for civil war victims. The 1998 truth and reconciliation report documented over 54,000 cases of human rights violations during the 1960-1996 civil war, with 90% attributed to the army as genocide against the indigenous population. President Morales praised the military, while his advisor Edgar Ovalle is under investigation for his role in 1980s massacres. Corruption charges are seen as a crisis by some but an opportunity for government accountability by others. Congress has approved aid to strengthen Guatemalan institutions with conditions attached. The US has provided aid to strengthen Guatemalan institutions with conditions based on human rights concerns. In FY2016, up to $750 million was allocated to address migration root causes in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Congress required these governments to combat corruption and human rights violations to receive aid. In December 2016, a bipartisan group of Members of Congress praised efforts to fight corruption and organized crime in the region. Haiti has been without an elected president since February 2016, but a newly elected president, Jovenel Moise, is scheduled to take office on February 7, 2017. Former President Michel Martelly ended his term without an elected successor, leading to the appointment of interim president Jocelerme Privert. Privert oversaw second-round presidential elections in April 2016, and a new president was installed in May. In May, a verification commission was established by Privert to investigate electoral fraud allegations. The commission called for a re-hold of the first round of the presidential election. Privert's term expired on June 14, and the Haitian legislature failed to extend his mandate or appoint a new provisional president. New elections were scheduled for October 2016 but were postponed to November 20 due to Hurricane Matthew. Jovenel Moise of the Bald Head Party won the re-held presidential elections with almost 56% of the vote. Voter turnout was 21%, and Moise's victory was confirmed by the provisional electoral council after complaints from other candidates. Haiti's provisional electoral council confirmed Jovenel Moise's first-round victory, with his inauguration set for February 7, 2017. Runoff elections for parliamentary and local positions will take place on January 29, 2017. Despite progress in recovery efforts since the 2010 earthquake, reconstruction aid is criticized for being slow, leading to frustration with international donors and the government. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) has helped maintain order since 2004, but has faced criticism for sexual abuse by some of its forces. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) has faced criticism for sexual abuse by some of its forces and introducing cholera to the country. The U.N. will not compensate cholera victims due to diplomatic immunity. MINUSTAH has reduced its troops in Haiti, leading to the Haitian National Police taking on election security in 2015. Former President Martelly has faced opposition for recreating an army, while the Dominican Republic's \"immigrant regularization\" process has caused many Dominican-born people of Haitian descent to relocate to Haiti. The Dominican Republic extended the registration period for migrants to regularize their status for one year in July 2016. U.S. policy priorities for Haiti include strengthening democratic processes, improving security, and promoting economic development. Other concerns are the cost and effectiveness of U.S. aid, human rights protection, combating trafficking, and poverty alleviation. The United States contributed $33 million for the 2015 electoral cycle in Haiti. The State Department announced in July 2016 no additional funding for Haiti's electoral process, but it does not indicate a decrease in U.S. support. The Haitian government will secure funds for the elections. The Obama Administration granted TPS to Haitians after the 2010 earthquake and extended it annually. The DHS implemented the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program in 2015 for Haitian relatives of U.S. citizens or residents. The program benefits only a small portion of approved Haitians for residency. The Assessing Progress in Haiti Act of 2014 directs the Secretary of State to coordinate a three-year strategy for Haiti. The State Department submitted reports to Congress on Haiti's post-earthquake recovery efforts. Congress focused on strengthening democratic institutions and addressing corruption in Haiti. Assistance to Haiti's central government is contingent on meeting certain criteria, including holding free and fair elections and improving governance. The State Department does not provide direct assistance to the Haitian government. Congressional attention in the 114th Congress focused on Haiti's completion of elections and monitoring political tensions for development and stability. Congress has a long-standing interest in promoting Haiti's economic development. In the 114th Congress, attention was focused on Haiti's completion of elections and monitoring political tensions for development and stability. Congress has a strong interest in promoting Haiti's economic development. Congress also maintains interest in Mexico, a top trade partner and energy supplier with which the United States shares a nearly 2,000-mile border and strong cultural, familial, and historical ties. The U.S. and Mexico are economically interdependent, and the U.S. economy could benefit from Mexico's currency stability, reforms, and increased investment. Security conditions in Mexico also impact U.S. national security, especially along the U.S.-Mexican border. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is in the fifth year of his six-year term and has shepherded structural reforms through a fragmented Mexican Congress. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has implemented structural reforms in Mexico through an agreement with various political parties. These reforms cover education, telecommunications, politics, access to finance, and energy. While some reforms, like the energy reform, have been successful, others, such as education reforms, have faced opposition. Pe\u00f1a Nieto's approval rating has remained low due to economic and security challenges, scandals, and unresolved human rights cases. Problems in the energy sector and global uncertainty have also affected Mexico's economy. The depreciation of Mexico's currency and budget cuts are influenced by the energy sector and global uncertainty. Rising homicides are a concern despite the adoption of a new criminal justice system in June 2016. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto and other officials have been involved in conflict-of-interest scandals and corruption charges. High-profile human rights cases, like the abduction and murder of 43 students in Guerrero, remain unresolved. U.S.-Mexican relations are strong, focusing on economic ties, border modernization, and educational exchanges. Bilateral relations between Mexico, Canada, and the United States have been strengthened through economic dialogues, trade agreements, energy cooperation, and security initiatives like the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Water-sharing in the Colorado River Basin has progressed, but tensions persist over Mexico's deliveries in the Rio Grande Basin. The M\u00e9rida Initiative is a U.S. aid program focused on justice sector reform and securing Mexico's southern border. Congress has provided $2.6 billion since FY2008 for this initiative. Bilateral efforts also target combating opium cultivation, heroin, and fentanyl production and trafficking in Mexico. Key policy issues for the 114th Congress included U.S.-Mexican trade and security cooperation, with legislation such as the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act impacting bilateral energy trade and ending country-of-origin labeling requirements for meat products. Congressional oversight and funding for the M\u00e9rida Initiative continued. In FY2016, Congress funded the M\u00e9rida Initiative with $161.2 million for Mexico. President Obama's FY2017 aid request included $129 million for the initiative. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $157.5 million for Mexico, while the Senate Appropriations Committee fully funded the request with additional requirements. The Senate bill included reporting requirements on Mexico's water deliveries in the Rio Grande Valley. Congress approved funding for foreign aid to Mexico at the FY2016 level until April 28, 2017. For more information, refer to various CRS reports on Mexico and U.S. relations, organized crime, drug trafficking, security cooperation, heroin production, and immigration enforcement efforts. Nicaragua transitioned to a democratic government in the 1990s after a civil war. President Daniel Ortega, a former Sandinista leader, has been in power since the late 1990s, with weak and increasingly politicized institutions. President Daniel Ortega, a former Sandinista leader, has been in power since the late 1990s. He won reelection in 2006 and 2011, slowly consolidating control over national institutions. Ortega won a third consecutive term in the 2016 elections, with the Sandinista-controlled Supreme Court preventing major opposition forces from running against him. The court also allowed Ortega's wife, Rosario Murillo, to run as his vice president, setting her up to potentially succeed him. President Daniel Ortega has been in power since the late 1990s, slowly consolidating control over national institutions. He won reelection in 2006, 2011, and 2016, with the Supreme Court preventing major opposition forces from running against him. Ortega's pragmatic approach in international relations has led to limited criticism from the United States and other countries, as Nicaragua is more stable and less violent than its Central American neighbors. Opposition figures and international analysts have questioned the legitimacy of Ortega's elections. Since his election in 2006, President Daniel Ortega has implemented social-welfare programs that have reduced poverty in Nicaragua and increased his popularity. Despite concerns over his authoritarian tendencies, many Nicaraguans support him due to the improvements in their standard of living. However, controversy has arisen over Ortega's decision to grant a 100-year concession for an inter-oceanic canal to a Chinese company, leading to protests from civil society over corruption and environmental damage. The State Department expressed concern over Nicaragua's actions limiting democratic space before elections, calling for fair elections and opposition party freedom. US-Nicaragua cooperation includes free trade and counternarcotic efforts, but tensions rose when Nicaragua expelled US officials. US also criticizes human rights violations in Nicaragua. The concerns in Nicaragua include human rights violations, government harassment of civil society groups, arbitrary arrests, and corruption. The US and Congress are worried about Nicaragua's relationship with Russia and recent military purchases. The House approved the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act in 2016 to oppose loans for Nicaragua unless it holds free, fair, and transparent elections. Relations with Venezuela deteriorated under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela saw political turmoil, including his death in 2013 and the controversial election of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as his successor. Maduro's government faced protests and violence in 2014, leading to arrests of opposition figures. In 2015, the opposition won a significant majority in the National Assembly, but Maduro's government limited their power. The Venezuelan government under President Maduro limited the opposition-controlled legislature's power by blocking representatives and bills, including an amnesty law. Efforts to recall Maduro through a referendum were suspended, leading to talks mediated by the Vatican and former presidents, criticized by some opposition activists. The economic crisis in Venezuela, exacerbated by the Maduro government's mismanagement, has led to a contracting economy, high inflation, declining reserves, and increasing poverty. The situation has resulted in shortages of food and medicine, high crime rates, and concerns about human rights violations. U.S. policymakers have been critical of Venezuela's lack of cooperation on antidrug and counterterrorism efforts. The Obama Administration imposed sanctions on Venezuelan officials involved in human rights abuses after a failed government-opposition dialogue in 2014. They continued to speak out about the democratic setback, called for the release of political prisoners, expressed concern about the humanitarian situation, and supported dialogue efforts. The Administration also backed the Organization of American States Secretary General's focus on Venezuela's democratic issues. Congress enacted the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014 to impose targeted sanctions on human rights violators. In December 2014, targeted sanctions were imposed on those responsible for human rights abuses in Venezuela. The 114th Congress extended the sanctions through December 2019. Congress has also allocated funding for democracy and human rights programs in Venezuela, with amounts ranging from $4.3 million to $6.5 million annually. The FY2017 request was for $5.5 million. The House version of the foreign aid appropriations bill, H.R. 5912, proposed $8 million in democracy funding for Venezuela, while the Senate version, S. 3117, supported the Administration's request for $5.5 million with the possibility of additional funds. The 114th Congress approved a continuing resolution in December 2016, providing funding through April 28, 2017, at the FY2016 level. Congressional hearings in the 114th Congress also focused on the situation in Venezuela. The political situation in Venezuela and U.S. policy will continue to be a focus for Congress in the 115th Congress. Key interests in economic, political, and security concerns will drive attention to Latin America and the Caribbean. Congressional oversight may include the crisis in Venezuela, peace accord in Colombia, challenges for Haiti's government, security and economic development in Central America, and Nicaragua post-2016 elections. The next Congress will need to address FY2017 appropriations and foreign aid funding. The current continuing resolution (P.L. 114-254) funds foreign aid through April 28, 2017. Uncertainty surrounds policy toward Latin America under the incoming Trump Administration, with potential changes in relations with Mexico, Cuba, and trade policy in the region. President-elect plans to withdraw from Trans-Pacific Partnership and examine NAFTA ramifications."
