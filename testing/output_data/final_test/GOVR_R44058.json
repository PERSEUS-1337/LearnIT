    "content": "The reconciliation process allows Congress to expedite legislation aligning spending, revenue, and debt laws with current fiscal priorities set in the budget resolution. Since 1980, 24 reconciliation bills have been passed using this optional process. The reconciliation process in Congress involves the adoption of a budget resolution with reconciliation directives included. These directives instruct committees to develop legislation related to spending, revenue, or the debt limit. The reported reconciliation legislation can be considered under expedited procedures in both the House and Senate, with any differences between the chambers needing to be resolved. The differences in reconciliation legislation passed by the two chambers must be resolved before the bill can be sent to the President for approval or veto. Congress includes reconciliation directives in its annual budget resolution to trigger the reconciliation process. These directives require committees to develop and report legislation under special expedited procedures to achieve budgetary goals. The reconciliation process involves determining the budgetary changes in legislation, including direct spending, revenue, and debt limit. Committees are directed to report on these changes to achieve deficit reduction goals. Any legislative committee with jurisdiction over spending, revenue, or the debt limit may be directed to report reconciliation legislation. Committees with jurisdiction over spending, revenue, or the debt limit may be directed to report reconciliation legislation, including submission deadlines for development of legislative language. Budget resolutions may set goals for deficit reduction over a specified period, but the Budget Act does not impose any specific requirements. The Budget Act does not impose additional requirements on committees directed to achieve budgetary goals. Committees follow their usual rules and practices, with discretion on how to meet goals. Committees can report on matters within their jurisdiction, regardless of assumptions in the budget resolution. If given multiple directives, committees can make separate recommendations. Senate practice limits reconciliation bills to one measure of each type under expedited procedures. Under current Senate practice, up to three measures can qualify for expedited reconciliation procedures, one for spending, revenue, and the debt limit. Compliance with reconciliation directives is measured on a net basis, allowing for legislation that includes both spending reductions and increases as long as overall spending decreases are met. Committees have discretion to recommend changes to direct spending programs or offsetting collections in response to reconciliation directives. Reconciliation directives can recommend changes to direct spending programs or offsetting collections. Direct spending changes refer to outlay levels, which are the projected disbursed federal funds. Reconciliation directives may also instruct committees to recommend legislation to increase or decrease revenues, falling under the jurisdiction of specific committees. The reconciliation process instructs committees to increase or decrease revenues based on specific amounts. Congress can adjust the statutory debt limit through legislation. Reconciliation is one of three methods used for debt limit legislation, although it is the least frequently used. Committees develop legislative language in response to reconciliation instructions before marking up and voting on it. The committee will meet to mark up and vote on reconciliation language, which can be reported favorably or unfavorably. There is no procedural mechanism to compel committee action before the specified date in the budget resolution. Late responses to reconciliation directives do not impact the inclusion of language in a reconciliation bill or the privileged status of resultant legislation. The reconciliation directive maintains a bill's privileged status, setting minimum and maximum spending limits. Committees can exceed minimum spending reductions but not go below, or increase spending up to a specified maximum. Flexibility is allowed for combining spending and revenue changes in response to instructions. The reconciliation bill must be reported by the House of Representatives by May 18, 2001, with changes in laws to reduce revenues by $1.25 trillion for fiscal years 2001-2011. The total outlays can be increased by $100 billion for the same period. The \"fungibility rule\" allows committees to substitute changes in spending and revenue, up to 20% of each directive, as long as the total changes reported equal the instructed levels. There is no procedural mechanism to ensure compliance with reconciliation directives if legislation is not reported by a committee. In cases where a committee fails to report legislation in compliance with reconciliation instructions, chambers have methods to move forward with reconciliation bills. The House Rules Committee can make amendments to achieve necessary changes, while the Senate can take action on the floor to satisfy the directive if a committee does not respond. If a committee fails to report legislation in compliance with reconciliation instructions, the Senate can offer a motion to recommit the bill with instructions for the committee to report back with an amendment. This motion allows any Senator to craft legislative language within the committee's jurisdiction. Unlike amendments to the bill, the motion to recommit is not subject to the germaneness requirement. Budget resolutions may direct one or multiple committees to report reconciliation legislation. If only one committee is directed to report, it can report directly to the full chamber. The Budget Committee must package committee responses into an omnibus budget reconciliation bill without substantive revision. Before voting, the committee may hold a business meeting where members can express support or concerns. The committee also secures cost estimates to ensure compliance with reconciliation directives and budget parameters. The Senate Budget Committee examines recommendations for reconciliation bills to ensure compliance with budget parameters and the Byrd rule, which prohibits extraneous material. Provisions cannot be deleted before the bill is reported, but Senators can raise a point of order on the Senate floor. The Senate Budget Committee reviews reconciliation bills for compliance with budget parameters and the Byrd rule, which prohibits extraneous material. Once reported, the reconciliation measure is placed on the House or Senate calendar for consideration. House consideration is governed by special rules setting debate duration and allowable amendments. House rules allow for a motion to recommit a bill before the final vote, giving the minority party a chance to offer an amendment. Amendatory instructions in this motion are subject to the same limits as any other amendment. House rules and the Congressional Budget Act impose limits on amendments to reconciliation measures, such as prohibiting nongermane amendments and restricting changes that increase spending or reduce revenues. While the Senate generally allows amendments without specific limits, the reconciliation process sets specific constraints on both the content and duration of amendments. The Senate's consideration of reconciliation legislation is governed by Section 310(e) of the Congressional Budget Act, which sets specific time limits on debate for reconciliation measures. Total debate time on the measure, including all amendments, motions, or appeals, is limited to 20 hours, with debate on any amendment limited to two hours. The Senate's consideration of reconciliation legislation is governed by specific time limits on debate, with debate on any amendment to the measure limited to two hours. This period, known as a \"vote-a-rama,\" allows Senators to offer amendments and make motions or appeals without further debate. The Budget Act imposes no procedural limit on the duration of a vote-a-rama, historically making it unnecessary to invoke cloture to reach a final vote on a reconciliation bill in the Senate. The Budget Act places limits on subject matter and budgetary impact in Senate bills and amendments. Points of order can be raised against legislation that violates these rules, with a waiver motion requiring a three-fifths vote to succeed. Under the Budget Act, points of order can be raised against legislation violating subject matter and budgetary impact limits in Senate bills and amendments. A waiver motion requires a three-fifths vote to succeed, and if it fails, the presiding officer rules the provision or amendment out of order. Extraneous provisions are not allowed in the measure or as amendments. Instructed committees must exclude extraneous provisions in legislative language submitted for inclusion in an omnibus reconciliation measure. If a point of order is sustained, the provision is removed, but further bill consideration can proceed. Amendments to reconciliation bills must be germane according to Section 305(b)(2) rules. Under the Budget Act, amendments to reconciliation bills must be germane and adhere to budgetary impact limits. Section 310(d)(1) and Section 310(d)(2) prohibit amendments that would increase outlays or decrease revenues. Other budget rules also apply to reconciliation bills, such as Section 311(a)(2) which prohibits legislation causing new budget impacts. The Budget Act imposes restrictions on legislation that would impact budget authority, outlays, or revenues. Section 404(a) of S.Con.Res. 13 sets limits on deficit increases, while Section 310(g) prohibits changes to Social Security under regular Senate procedures. Section 313 also prohibits extraneous provisions in relation to Social Security changes. The reconciliation process involves resolving differences between the House and Senate through a conference committee. The conference report must be approved by both chambers without amendments. Alternatively, the House and Senate can negotiate through an exchange of amendments. The reconciliation process involves resolving differences between the House and Senate through a conference committee. Budget Act points of order apply to reconciliation bills, conference reports, and amendments between chambers. The Byrd rule in the Senate can make a conference report or amendment vulnerable to a point of order. Debate on a conference report or message between houses in the Senate is limited to 10 hours. The House and Senate must agree on the same text in the same bill before it can be presented to the President. The President has a 10-day period to sign a bill into law or veto it. If Congress is in session and the President doesn't sign, the bill becomes law. If Congress adjourns within the 10-day period, the President can prevent the bill from becoming law with a \"pocket\" veto. The President has vetoed reconciliation legislation four times, with Congress failing to override the veto in any instance."
