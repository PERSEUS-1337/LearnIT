    "content": "The model introduced combines deep learning and program synthesis to convert hand drawings into graphics programs written in a subset of \\LaTeX. It uses a convolutional neural network to propose drawing primitives and program synthesis techniques to recover a graphics program from these primitives, allowing for error correction and extrapolation of drawings. This approach aims to move towards agents that can induce useful outcomes. In the graphics program synthesis domain, an approach is developed to convert hand drawings into executable source code for drawing images. The process involves identifying components like rectangles and lines, and then determining the high-level structure of how these components are drawn. This method aims to generate human-readable programs from visual input. The hybrid architecture presented infers graphics programs using two nested loops for drawing shapes. The trace hypothesis framework connects perception to programs, converting sketches to high-level programs. The algorithm learns a policy for efficiently searching for programs. The text discusses the challenges of inferring trace sets from images and generalizing to noisy hand drawings. It also addresses the difficulty of discovering good programs due to their complexity and length, proposing a domain-general framework for learning a search policy to guide program synthesis efficiently. The text discusses developing a deep network architecture for inferring a trace set from an image efficiently. The model combines ideas from Neurally-Guided Procedural Models and Attend-Infer-Repeat. The network constructs the trace set one drawing command at a time, conditioned on what it has drawn so far. A convolutional network processes the target image and rendering of the trace set, with a multilayer perceptron predicting the next drawing command. A differentiable attention mechanism is used to aid network inputs and outputs. The model utilizes a 16x16 grid and a spatial transformer network for attention. Primitive drawing commands are supported, and the network is trained on randomly generated scenes to predict drawing commands efficiently. Training on 10^5 scenes takes a day on an Nvidia TitanX GPU.

To generalize to hand drawings, noise is introduced into the renderings of the training target images. A surrogate likelihood function is learned for hand drawings using a convolutional network to predict the distance between trace sets. The likelihood surrogate approximates the symmetric difference between two trace sets. The system was evaluated on 100 real hand-drawn figures but not trained on them.

A surrogate likelihood function is learned for hand drawings using a convolutional network to predict the distance between trace sets. The system was evaluated on 100 real hand-drawn figures, with the Top-1 most likely sample matching the ground truth in 63% of cases. The program synthesizer corrects small errors in the trace sets, aiming to synthesize graphics programs from their trace sets using a Domain Specific Language (DSL). The Domain Specific Language (DSL) BID16 encodes prior knowledge of graphics programs. A cost function is defined based on the number of statements in a program. The optimization problem is solved using the Sketch tool BID20. The Sketch tool BID20 is used for program synthesis, translating the problem into a constraint satisfaction problem and using a SAT solver to find a minimum-cost program. Despite the optimality guarantee, there are no runtime guarantees, with synthesis times ranging from minutes to hours. The main challenge is the high cost of searching for programs, but a faster synthesis method is described next.

Despite the optimality guarantee, there are no runtime guarantees, with synthesis times ranging from minutes to hours. A faster synthesis method is described next, timing out on 2% of the drawings and solving 58% of problems within a minute. The method involves complex program generation with various lines, circles, rectangles, and formulas.

The method involves complex program generation with various lines, circles, rectangles, and formulas. We want to leverage powerful, domain-general techniques from the program synthesis community, but make them much faster by learning a domain-specific search policy. A search policy poses search problems like those in Eq. 2, but also offers additional constraints on the structure of the program. A search policy \u03c0 \u03b8 (\u03c3|T ) predicts a distribution over synthesis problems, aiming to find parameters \u03b8 that balance tractable program spaces with concise explanations. The goal is to quickly find minimum cost programs using a bias-optimal search approach. The text discusses using a bias-optimal search algorithm to quickly find minimum cost programs. The algorithm guarantees finding a solution within a certain time frame by exploring the entire program space efficiently. Our new approach aims to learn the bias P bias [\u00b7] by minimizing the expected bias-optimal time to solve graphics program synthesis problems. This guarantees finding the minimum cost program and provides a differentiable loss function for policy parameters. Training is done on a corpus of hand-drawn diagrams using gradient descent. Our new approach aims to learn the bias P bias [\u00b7] by minimizing the expected bias-optimal time to solve graphics program synthesis problems. Training is done on a corpus of hand-drawn diagrams using gradient descent. We chose a simple low-capacity, bilinear model for a policy to synthesize programs efficiently. Comparing synthesis times, our learned search policy outperforms Sketch and approaches the performance of an Oracle policy. This learned policy allows us to synthesize 58% of programs within a minute. The learned policy enables the synthesis of 58% of programs within a minute by favoring concise and general programs in graphics program synthesis. The system reranks trace sets based on the prior probability of their programs, correcting errors made by the neural network.

The system corrects errors made by the neural network by reranking trace sets based on the prior probability of their programs. Learning a prior over programs can help correct mistakes, as shown in Fig. 9. Access to the source code of a graphics program allows for high-level image editing and extrapolation of figures by increasing loop executions. Our system automates the induction and extension of graphical patterns. It draws on theoretical concepts from Levin search and Schmidhuber's OOPS model. Unlike DeepCoder, our approach focuses on metareasoning to balance tractability and success probability. TerpreT's comparison of synthesis techniques informs our constraint-based approach. Our neural network is similar to Attend-Infer-Repeat in graphics program synthesis. Our neural network, inspired by Attend-Infer-Repeat (AIR) system, decomposes images into objects through iterative inference. Unlike AIR, our network uses an autoregressive-style model for parsing from randomly-generated (trace, image) pairs. Our goal is to convert noisy input into high-level programs, supporting programming constructs like loops and conditionals, which is more challenging than recovering markup languages. Our image-to-trace parsing architecture adapts prior work on procedural graphics programs to a different visual domain, efficiently synthesizing higher-level programs from traces. Other systems in computer graphics convert sketches into procedural representations using convolutional networks. Our system focuses on inferring a structured, programmatic representation of hand-drawn sketches, capturing higher-level visual patterns. This work complements Sketch-n-Sketch and CogSketch systems, offering a starting point for further editing and aiming to build an automated AI application. Our work introduces the trace hypothesis, suggesting that trace sets can be inferred from perceptual data to bridge perception and symbolic representation. We demonstrate how a trace can be used to synthesize high-level programs, specifically inferring graphics programs that generate L A T E X-style figures. Our system infers graphics programs from hand-drawn images using deep neural networks and stochastic search. It parses drawings into symbolic trace sets and feeds them to a program synthesis engine to infer a structured graphics program. The model can parse novel images and extrapolate from provided drawings, showing potential for producing professional-looking figures by drawing and letting an AI agent write the code. The trace hypothesis, parsing into trace sets and searching for a low-cost symbolic program, may be applicable to other domains requiring programmatically reasoning about noisy perceptual input. Our system infers graphics programs from hand-drawn images using deep neural networks and stochastic search. For an image I, a neurally guided sampling scheme samples a set of candidate traces, F(I). Instead of predicting the most likely trace in F(I) according to the neural network, we consider the programs that best explain the traces. By finding a maximum likelihood estimate of \u03b2, we perform MAP inference in a generative model where the program is drawn from a prior probability distribution over programs. Our system infers graphics programs from hand-drawn images using deep neural networks and stochastic search. By finding a maximum likelihood estimate of \u03b2, we perform MAP inference in a generative model where the program is drawn from a prior probability distribution over programs. Annotated ground truth traces are used to estimate \u03b2, which helps correct mistakes made by the neural network and improves Top-1 accuracy from 63% to 67%. The log linear distribution P \u03b2 [\u00b7] is defined to help predict whether a trace is the correct explanation for an image by extracting basic features of a program. The text discusses improving accuracy in inferring graphics programs from hand-drawn images by measuring similarity between drawings using features extracted from programs. Different similarity metrics are explored, with a focus on high-level geometric similarities. The goal is to estimate the policy minimizing a specific loss function. The text discusses estimating the policy minimizing a specific loss function by annealing the loss function during gradient descent. The regularization coefficient is set to 0.1, and the model parameterizes the space of policies using a log bilinear model. The distribution over drawing commands and traces factorizes in the model. The text describes an attention mechanism for traces in a convolutional network that processes images. The network predicts drawing commands using logistic regression based on image features. The text discusses using Spatial Transformer Networks as an attention mechanism in a convolutional network for predicting drawing commands. Each token of drawing primitives has its own learned MLP, with different networks for predicting spatial transforms for each drawing command and token. The parameters of the spatial transform are predicted based on previously predicted tokens. The text discusses training a deep network with special transforms for drawing commands and tokens. The network outputs an affine transformation matrix and was trained on synthetic examples. A comparison was made with a baseline model using image captioning architecture. The text discusses using an LSTM to predict a sequence of drawing commands token-by-token based on image input. The network is trained to predict two scalars using linear regression and ReLU nonlinearity, with random synthetic scenes for training. The text discusses training an LSTM network to predict drawing commands based on image input by generating synthetic scenes for training and perturbing them to minimize loss. Noise is introduced in the rendering process to create a \"simulated hand drawing\" style. Likelihood surrogate for synthetic data is engineered to measure distance between images. The system uses synthetic training data to discover drawing commands that match the target image, with parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 controlling the trade-off between explaining pixels and not predicting non-existent pixels. The sampling procedure incrementally constructs the scene, preferring to leave some pixels unexplained to avoid errors. Experimental values for \u03b1 and \u03b2 are set at 0.8 and 0.04 respectively. Synthetic training data is generated by sampling L A T E X code to determine the number of objects in the scene. The generative process involves sampling objects in a scene, such as circles, rectangles, and lines, in a specific order. A Chinese restaurant process prior is used to encourage reuse of coordinate values for alignment in the training data. The generative process involves sampling objects in a scene with aligned parts. The network can generalize to scenes with intersecting lines or lines penetrating a rectangle. Bias is applied when sampling endpoints of a line, favoring starting endpoints along sides of a rectangle or at the boundary of a circle. Examples of trained scenes are shown in FIG3. For creating synthetic training sets, refer to the provided source code at redactedForAnonymity.com. The minimum cost program at redactedForAnonymity.com evaluates drawing primitives in an execution trace T. Programs have costs for commands, unique coefficients in linear transformations, and loops of constant length 2. The goal is to produce programs with translational symmetry. The data set includes hand drawings and renderings. The leftmost column shows a hand drawing, the middle column displays the most likely trace found by the neurally guided SMC sampling scheme, and the rightmost column shows the program synthesized from a ground truth execution trace of the drawing. The inference procedure is stochastic, so the top one most likely sample can vary. A representative sample from a run with 2000 particles is reported below. The drawing consists of various shapes like rectangles, circles, and lines with arrows and solid lines. The shapes are positioned and reflected across different points on the grid.
