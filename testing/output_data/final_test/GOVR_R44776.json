    "content": "Money laundering involves criminals concealing illicit proceeds to make them appear legitimate within the financial system. It occurs in three stages: placement, layering, and integration. Efforts to combat money laundering are a global policy concern. Illicit funds flow undetected through the financial system, governed by national AML laws and regulations. The US has a robust policy apparatus for AML, including enforcement actions and support for improving foreign AML capacity. International institutions provide guidance and monitor national AML policies. The challenge of combating money laundering persists despite existing domestic and international AML mechanisms. Policymakers struggle to address policy gaps and evolving laundering methods while balancing AML efforts with financial inclusion principles. The global scope of money laundering remains a significant issue. The global scope of money laundering is a significant issue, with estimates suggesting it accounts for approximately 2.7% of global GDP, or $1.6 trillion. The U.S. dollar plays a dominant role in facilitating trillions of dollars in transactions daily, exposing the U.S. financial system to potential risks. The U.N. report estimated that the United States generated around $300 billion in illicit proceeds in 2010, equivalent to 2% of U.S. GDP. The main sources of illicit funds are white-collar crime and organized crime, with smaller amounts linked to public corruption and terrorism. Money launderers use various methods to conceal the origins of dirty money. Money launderers use a variety of methods to conceal the true origins and ownership of illicit proceeds, including preserving anonymity through cash transactions, avoiding AML requirements by structuring bank deposits, and utilizing hard-to-detect techniques like trade-based money laundering. They may involve complicit individuals and illegal financial service providers, as well as exploit legal offshore corporate structures and permissive foreign jurisdictions to obscure beneficial ownership. The lack of available information on legal and beneficial ownership of corporate vehicles increases vulnerability to money laundering. Unchecked money laundering can undermine the integrity of the international financial system and have global consequences. Unchecked money laundering can have global consequences by undermining the integrity of the international financial system, reducing consumer confidence, damaging the reputation of financial regulatory bodies, introducing economic distortions affecting various aspects of the economy, violating border and customs controls, contributing to state fragility, rewarding illicit behavior, enabling criminals to sustain their networks, and facilitating profits from illicit activities, including political corruption. The legislative foundation for domestic anti-money laundering (AML) in the United States originated in 1970 with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its major component, the Currency and Foreign Transaction Reporting Act. Amendments in the 1980s and 1990s expanded AML policy tools to combat crime, particularly drug trafficking, and prevent criminals from laundering their profits. Key elements of the BSA's AML legal framework are codified in Titles 12 and 31 of the U.S. Code. The legislative foundation for domestic anti-money laundering (AML) in the United States originated in 1970 with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its major component, the Currency and Foreign Transaction Reporting Act. Key elements of the BSA's AML legal framework, codified in Titles 12 and 31 of the U.S. Code, include requirements for reporting, customer identification, due diligence, recordkeeping, and the establishment of BSA/AML compliance programs. Bank examiners assess the effectiveness of AML policies and procedures, while substantive criminal statutes in Titles 31 and 18 prohibit money laundering and related activities, with enforcement actions leading to an average of 1,200 money laundering-related convictions annually. Federal authorities utilize various forfeiture tools to confiscate assets in money laundering cases. The BSA's AML policy framework was expanded after 9/11 to combat terrorism financing, providing greater authority and tools to counter illicit threats. Financial institutions play a key role in implementing suspicious activity monitoring systems and reporting to the Treasury Department. Over $4.4 billion in assets were confiscated in 2014 through non-conviction based forfeiture and criminal forfeiture tools. The reporting of suspicious activity to the Treasury Department is crucial for flagging situations that may require further investigation. Various reports are required for individuals transporting large amounts of cash internationally, those with significant foreign financial interests, and nonfinancial entities conducting large cash transactions. FinCEN regulations mandate financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs, including customer identification and due diligence processes. Banks must have a customer identification program, verify account holders' information, and conduct customer due diligence efforts to assess risk and prevent money laundering. Minimum standards for anti-money laundering programs are outlined in regulations for correspondent accounts and private banking. Financial institutions must comply with recordkeeping requirements, obtain additional customer information for targeted jurisdictions, and maintain financial records for at least five years to assist authorities during investigations and AML compliance programs. The BSA established recordkeeping requirements in 1970 for financial institutions to assist in investigations and AML compliance programs. Records include customer identification material, account statements, checks and deposits over $100, international transactions over $10,000, and actions in response to U.S. economic sanctions programs. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authorizes the President to impose financial sanctions in response to national emergencies. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers and enforces these sanctions against various entities, including foreign countries, terrorists, and weapons proliferators. Financial institutions must comply with sanctions provisions to prevent transactions with designated individuals and entities. Regulators monitor banks for compliance, with violations leading to civil and criminal penalties. Congress has mandated national strategies for combating money laundering and financial crimes, with reports submitted in specific years. The U.S. Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) issues the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report annually in two volumes, focusing on drug control and money laundering. The reports provide country-by-country surveys of foreign government policies and implementation challenges. The INCSR, mandated by the FAA, categorizes countries based on money laundering risk levels. The Obama Administration integrated AML goals into various strategy documents, including the National Security Strategy of 2015, emphasizing the use of economic sanctions to combat criminal and terrorist networks. The National Security Strategy of 2015 integrated AML goals to combat criminal and terrorist networks through international standards-setting bodies like FATF and the G-20. The Transnational Organized Crime Strategy of 2011 aimed to protect the financial system against transnational organized crime by enhancing intelligence sharing among law enforcement authorities. The National Drug Control Strategy of 2014 prioritized disrupting illicit financial networks related to drug trafficking, including seizing bulk cash. There are ongoing concerns about U.S. policies on beneficial ownership transparency and shell company formation, highlighted by the 2016 Panama Papers leak. In response, the Obama Administration announced additional steps to address these issues. The Obama Administration announced additional steps in May 2016 to strengthen financial transparency, combat money laundering, corruption, and tax evasion. Multiple federal agencies are involved in domestic and international cooperation to combat money laundering, including developing AML policy, oversight, regulation, prosecution, enforcement, and providing international training and assistance. The Treasury Department plays a key role in administering BSA/AML implementation and developing related regulations and policies. The Treasury Department established the Office of the Under Secretary of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) in 2004 to safeguard the financial system against illicit use and combat various national security threats. TFI integrates bureaus and offices like TFFC, OIA, OFAC, TEOAF, and FinCEN to implement policy and strategy overseas. TFFC is the policy and outreach office within TFI. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) TFFC is the policy and outreach office within TFI, representing the U.S. at international bodies like FATF. It collaborates with the Office of International Affairs on AML policies. OFAC enforces U.S. economic sanctions programs. OIA, part of the U.S. intelligence community, supports TFI's intelligence functions and integrates financial intelligence tools. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) administers the BSA and enforces regulations on financial institutions. It issues guidance on BSA implementation and maintains a database for reporting suspicious activities. OFAC has the authority to freeze assets of foreign terrorist entities under various legislative statutes. FinCEN administers the BSA and enforces regulations on financial institutions, serving as the U.S. Financial Intelligence Unit. It supports investigations of financial crimes through data analysis and refers cases to law enforcement. FinCEN can issue civil money penalties and collaborates with the private sector and international community on AML matters. The IRS, under the Treasury Department, is responsible for collecting internal revenue and enforcing BSA compliance for nonbanking financial institutions. The IRS criminal investigation division (IRS-CI) investigates financial crimes, including tax evasion and violations of AML statutes for nonbanking financial institutions. Federal regulators oversee compliance with BSA/AML requirements, conducting examinations to ensure safe functioning. Regulators may take enforcement action for BSA violations or AML program deficiencies. Banking regulators supervise compliance with various laws, including anti-money laundering and consumer protection regulations. AML compliance programs may face enforcement action from federal banking agencies like the Federal Reserve, FDIC, NCUA, and OCC. Other agencies responsible for AML regulations include the SEC and CFTC. The FFIEC sets standards for depository institutions, while the NAMLG oversees non-depository regulators. Non-depository regulators, such as the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC, oversee AML compliance for various financial institutions, including state-chartered banks and foreign bank branches in the US. They conduct examinations to ensure compliance with BSA regulations and other banking requirements. The OCC examines U.S. branches of foreign banks for BSA compliance. The NCUA regulates credit unions, with limited exposure to money laundering. In December 2016, FinCEN penalized a New York credit union for not updating its AML program. The SEC protects investors from fraud in securities markets and conducts BSA compliance examinations on various institutions. The CFTC delegates BSA examination to designated SROs like FINRA and NYSE to protect market users from fraud in derivatives markets. Designated SROs monitor and take disciplinary actions against registered futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, commodity pool operators, and commodity trading advisors. Views on the enforcement of AML laws vary, with some policymakers criticizing major financial institutions for insufficient punishment for violations. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that federal agencies imposed $5.1 billion in fines for BSA/AML violations from 2009 to 2015. A separate analysis noted a significant increase in penalties for BSA violations post-2008 financial crisis, with regulators becoming more aggressive in enforcement. The number and size of BSA/AML penalties grew notably after 2012, with nearly 90% of enforcement actions including monetary penalties. Enforcement actions from 2012 through 2015 saw a significant increase in monetary penalties, which have grown substantially in both absolute terms and as a proportion of firm capital. Recent trends show authorities using Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) and Non-Prosecution Agreements (NPAs) alongside fines and penalties as alternative enforcement tools. The number of DPAs and NPAs more than doubled in 2015 compared to the annual average since 2000, but some federal judges have started challenging this practice. Since the financial crisis, FinCEN and other regulators have increased focus on individual and corporate responsibility for AML compliance. U.S. federal departments provide technical assistance and training on AML/CFT topics to foreign counterparts, with support to over 100 countries in 2015. The U.S. government also backs multilateral organizations offering AML/CFT assistance through direct participation or funding. In 2015, the U.S. provided AML/CFT support to various stakeholders, including government personnel and private sector entities, through agencies like DHS, DOJ, and State Department. The U.S. federal entities, including DHS, DOJ, State Department, Treasury, and Federal Reserve, offer international training and assistance on AML/CFT compliance and supervision. The U.S. federal entities provide international training on AML/CFT matters, including workshops on detecting bulk cash smuggling, cross-border financial investigation training, and support for developing compliant AML/CFT regimes. Special agents and prosecutors are also placed overseas for advisory and long-term assignments. The U.S. federal entities provide international training on AML/CFT matters, including workshops on detecting bulk cash smuggling and cross-border financial investigation training. They also support the development of compliant AML/CFT regimes by placing special agents and prosecutors overseas for advisory and long-term assignments. Additionally, the State Department funds Regional Legal Advisors (RLAs) in various countries and Intermittent Legal Advisors (ILAs) in Colombia and Paraguay. The Treasury Department assigns attaches to U.S. overseas posts in several countries to provide AML/CFT technical assistance. Foreign assistance accounts administered by the Departments of State and Treasury primarily fund AML/CFT technical assistance projects. U.S. funding for AML/CFT technical assistance is provided by various government entities, including the Departments of State and Treasury, USAID, U.S. Embassies, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Funding estimates for AML-related programming ranged between $10 million and $20 million annually from FY2010 to FY2015, with some specific accounts showing trends in funding. However, comprehensive presentation of funding to Congress is lacking, especially for broader AML objectives. Between FY2010 and FY2015, annual funding for AML/CFT technical assistance ranged from $10 million to $20 million. International efforts have been made to improve global AML responses and coordination through various organizations like the FATF and Basel Committee. International organizations such as the Egmont Group, INTERPOL, UNODC, World Bank, and IMF play key roles in setting and implementing AML standards. Various groups like OECD, G-20, and OAS focus on AML initiatives. The 1988 U.N. Convention Against Illicit Drug Trafficking was the first treaty to criminalize money laundering from drug profits. The 1988 U.N. drug trafficking convention and the 2000 U.N. Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) expanded measures for mutual legal assistance and prohibited money laundering from all serious crimes involving organized groups. States parties are required to establish regulatory systems for financial institutions, including customer identification, recordkeeping, and reporting of suspicious transactions. Measures to detect and monitor cross-border cash movements are also recommended. The 2000 U.N. Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) aims to prevent public sector corruption, criminalize money laundering, and implement comprehensive AML systems. It requires states parties to verify customer identities, including beneficial owners, and prohibits high-risk banks. The treaty also promotes bilateral, regional, and global cooperation for AML, including training, technical assistance, extradition, and asset seizure. The United States has ratified various international conventions related to anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) sets global standards for AML and other threats to the international financial system. It consists of a secretariat in Paris and 37 member states or jurisdictions. FATF issued 40 recommendations on international standards for AML. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) issues global standards for anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing. It collaborates with international stakeholders to identify financial vulnerabilities and conducts mutual evaluations of participating countries. FATF has identified 10 high-risk jurisdictions and works with the IMF and World Bank to provide technical assistance. FATF-style regional bodies promote the implementation of FATF standards and facilitate requests for assistance and training. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) collaborates with international stakeholders to set global AML/CFT standards and identifies financial vulnerabilities. FATF works with 9 regional bodies to facilitate country requests for technical assistance and training on money laundering typologies. These regional bodies include APG, CFATF, MONEYVAL, EAG, ESAAMLG, GAFILAT, GIABA, MENAFATF, and GABAC. Other international entities also adopt FATF's AML/CFT standards for financial institutions. The Basel Committee and the Egmont Group incorporate FATF's AML/CFT standards for regulatory and supervisory institutions. The Egmont Group, with 151 member FIUs including FinCEN, facilitates information sharing and international cooperation on financial intelligence matters. The World Bank and IMF also contribute to international AML efforts through research projects on illicit financial flows and national risk. The World Bank and IMF support international efforts on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing through research projects and national risk assessments. They provide guidance, technical assistance, and training in AML/CFT matters. The IMF's AML/CFT trust fund, funded by donors, has been renewed for a five-year term in 2014 with over $20 million pledged through 2019. The IMF has received over $20 million in funding through 2019 for AML/CFT technical assistance and training. The 114th Congress introduced bills related to AML, terrorist financing, sanctions, beneficial ownership disclosure, and corruption. The 115th Congress will likely continue to address these issues, including critiques from the December 2016 FATF evaluation of the US. The 115th Congress may revisit proposals for AML policy challenges and priorities in a national strategy, considering new challenges like cyber-enabled financial crimes. Despite robust AML efforts, global money laundering remains a significant issue with diverse illicit methods. Global money laundering remains a significant issue with diverse illicit methods, and gaps in legal, regulatory, and enforcement regimes continue to limit a globally consistent policy approach to AML. The 115th Congress may revisit the existing AML policy framework to propose regulatory and statutory changes. In February 2017, The Clearing House proposed significant changes to the BSA/AML regime, including reshaping the relationship between FinCEN and other regulators, enacting beneficial ownership legislation, and rebalancing financial costs associated with preventing illicit financial activity. Additional proposals may arise as the 115th Congress addresses AML policy issues."
