    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Transparency and Honesty in Energy Regulations Act of 2016\". It includes findings related to energy regulations. Congress finds that the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and the Social Cost of Methane (SCM) are used to justify Federal actions by the Department of Energy and the EPA regarding greenhouse gas emissions, including regulations on coal and other fossil fuels as energy sources. The Office of Management and Budget Circular A-4 provides guidance for Federal actions. The Office of Management and Budget Circular A-4 guides Federal agencies on regulatory impact analysis, requiring discount rates of 3 and 7 percent. The Social Cost of Carbon estimates, developed in 2009, do not align with these prescribed rates. Additionally, the SCC calculated global benefits instead of reporting them separately from domestic costs and benefits as specified by OMB Circular A-4. The use of SCC estimates in Department of Energy and EPA rulemakings violated scientific peer-review requirements and the President's commitment to transparent government. In response to criticism, the OMB requested the NAS to review and improve the SCC estimates. The EPA used SCM estimates without proper peer review to justify methane emission rules. The Department of Energy and EPA regulations, based on SCC and SCM estimates, are costly to American families. The Secretary of Energy and the EPA Administrator are prohibited from considering the social cost of carbon or methane in any cost benefit analysis, rulemaking, guidance, or agency action unless explicitly authorized by a new law. The EPA Administrator must submit a report within 120 days of the Act's enactment, detailing the use of social cost of carbon or methane in rulemakings since January 2009. The term \"social cost of carbon\" is defined as the cost outlined in specific government documents published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon in 2010. The social cost of carbon and methane are estimates of the monetized damages associated with increased emissions, outlined in government documents like the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon and EPA rules. The social cost of carbon and methane are estimates of monetized damages from emissions, outlined in government documents like EPA rules. This includes the final rule on emission standards for oil and natural gas sectors published by the Environmental Protection Agency."
