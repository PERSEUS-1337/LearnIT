    "content": "In 1999, a bipartisan commission was created by Congress to study the housing needs of the aging senior population. The commission's final report, A Quiet Crisis in America, highlighted the lack of affordable housing and supportive services programs to meet the growing demand. By 2050, the number of individuals aged 65 and older is expected to nearly double, raising concerns about the availability of housing and supportive services for the elderly population. The bipartisan housing commission estimated a need for 730,000 additional units of affordable housing for elderly by 2020. HUD operates programs providing housing and services for elderly households, with one program exclusively for elderly persons. HUD operates programs that provide housing and services for elderly households, with some properties dedicated primarily to housing elderly residents. These programs include the Congregate Housing program, Service Coordinator program, ROSS Service Coordinator program, and Assisted Living Conversion Program, which aim to assist elderly persons living in HUD-eligible properties to remain in their apartments. The report summarizes HUD programs providing multi-family rental housing and supportive services for low-income elderly households. It highlights the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program as the only HUD program exclusively for elderly households, with nearly 350,000 units available. However, it does not cover all housing programs serving elderly households, such as HUD's Section 8 voucher program and the Department of Agriculture's rural housing programs. The Section 202 program provides capital grants and project rental assistance for developers to build affordable housing for very low-income elderly households. Congress has not funded new units since FY2011, but continues to appropriate funds for existing units. The program has evolved over its 50-year history and was last authorized in FY2003. The Section 202 program has evolved over its history, transitioning from loans to grants for financing developments and changing its target population from moderate-income elderly households to very low-income elderly households. It has also shifted from serving only elderly households to serving both elderly and disabled households, and then back to serving elderly households exclusively. The program's history can be divided into three phases based on changes to its financing structure and tenant income eligibility criteria. The Section 202 program evolved from providing loans to grants for financing developments and shifted its focus from moderate-income elderly households to very low-income elderly households. It also expanded to include disabled households and then reverted back to serving only elderly households. The program's history can be divided into three phases based on changes to its financing structure and tenant income eligibility criteria. The Section 202 program provided low-interest loans to private nonprofit developers to build affordable housing for elderly households with moderate incomes. Between 1959 and 1968, 45,257 units were constructed in 335 projects with rents set at affordable levels. Rents were determined on a community-by-community basis starting in 1962. In 1968, HUD set income eligibility limits for Section 202 developments at 135% of Public Housing limits or 80% of area median income. To make units affordable for low-income elderly tenants, Congress enacted the Rent Supplement program. Non-elderly \"handicapped\" individuals and families were added to the eligible tenant population in 1964. The Housing Act of 1964 expanded the definition of \"elderly families\" to include non-elderly handicapped individuals and families. However, participation in the Section 202 program by non-elderly handicapped tenants was very low between 1964 and 1974. Funding for the Section 202 program was not provided in FY1970, as the Nixon Administration did not propose new funds due to concerns about the program's impact on the federal budget. No new construction projects were funded between 1970 and 1974. Between 1970 and 1974, the Section 202 program did not fund any new construction projects for elderly households. Instead, housing was constructed using the Section 236 mortgage subsidy program. Approximately 240 buildings with over 33,000 units still have active loans from Section 202 properties funded before 1974. These properties continue to accept tenants based on the rules in place at the time of development. Pre-1962 Section 202 developments are not subject to income limits, while those built after 1962 but before July 1972 are subject to HUD-approved income limits. HUD has provided rental assistance for about 38% of units in pre-1974 Section 202 developments. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 reactivated the Section 202 program and introduced project-based Section 8 rental assistance for building owners. This assistance subsidized rent for low-income tenants by covering the difference between 25% of tenant income and market rate rent. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 reactivated the Section 202 program, introducing project-based Section 8 rental assistance for building owners. This subsidy allowed more low-income tenants to live in Section 202 projects, shifting from serving mostly moderate-income elderly families. Contracts were set for up to 20 years, loans for construction were available with changed terms, and funds were directed to urban areas. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 reactivated the Section 202 program, directing funds to urban areas. By 1988, 20-25% of funds were allocated to nonmetropolitan areas, increasing Section 202 units in smaller cities. Changes in P.L. 93-383 required Section 202 developments to support state and local services for elderly tenants. In 1981, income guidelines for Section 202 units receiving project-based Section 8 rental assistance were adjusted to prioritize very low-income households. Between 1974 and 1988, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 led to the construction of 128,636 additional units of Section 202 housing with project-based Section 8 rental assistance. The average size of developments decreased over time, with only 5.4% of units built between 1974 and 1985 being efficiencies. Between 1974 and 1988, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 resulted in the construction of 128,636 additional units of Section 202 housing with project-based Section 8 rental assistance. The average size of developments decreased over time, with only 5.4% of units built between 1974 and 1985 being efficiencies. In 1985, efficiencies increased to 18.9%, and in 1990, the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act changed the financing scheme of the Section 202 program to capital advances without interest for developers serving low-income elderly households for at least 40 years. This change was prompted by concerns about budget authority involved in extending Section 202 loans. Under the new program of capital grants, developers no longer need rental assistance for loan payments, resulting in lower project-based rental assistance payments. Development cost limitations for Section 202 projects also changed. Rental subsidies are no longer provided through the Section 8 program, with rents no longer based on Section 8 fair market rents. The new project rental assistance (PRAC) aims to help owners determine residents' needs for supportive services and coordinate funding for those services. The new project rental assistance contracts under P.L. 101-625 extended for three years, with project development costs calculated based on specific factors for Section 202 projects. This change aimed to ensure adequate funding for Section 202 housing nationwide, addressing the issue of low Fair Market Rents (FMRs) hindering development in certain areas. Additionally, housing for persons with disabilities was removed from the program. In P.L. 101-625, housing for persons with disabilities was removed from the Section 202 program and directed to a separate program called Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities. Congress initiated the split between housing for elderly and disabled households in 1978, with further specifications in P.L. 95-557 and P.L. 100-242. Developers of Section 811 housing receive capital grants similar to the Section 202 program. Developers of Section 811 housing receive capital grants and project rental assistance to construct, rehabilitate, or acquire housing for very low-income individuals with disabilities. Section 202 developments funded before 1992 continue to provide housing for persons with disabilities. Approximately 109,000 Section 202 units were developed since 1990, with an average of 44 units per building. Newer Section 202 developments have no efficiency units. Funding for new Section 202 developments was last provided in FY2010 and FY2011. Since FY2012, Congress has not allocated funds for new Section 202 units, signaling a shift away from using Section 202 as a funding source for new housing development. The Administration and HUD have suggested a model where developers would fund the capital costs of new housing units, similar to the Section 811 program for persons with disabilities. In 2011, a model was introduced where developers fund capital costs of new housing units using various funds like Low Income Housing Tax Credits and HOME Investment Partnerships program. Section 202 provides rental assistance for elderly residents. Funding for Section 202 capital grants may be uncertain in a constrained budget environment. Multiple funding sources are needed for affordable housing, including mortgage revenue bonds, tax credits, private loans, and local housing trust funds. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is a key source of funding for affordable housing development, providing federal tax credits to developers. States allocate these credits based on population, which developers can use to finance affordable rental housing projects. This funding model has become essential for Section 202 developers to bring together multiple sources of funding for their projects. In 2000, Congress enacted a law to facilitate the interaction of Section 202 funds and LIHTCs by adjusting how federal funds are treated. The qualified basis for LIHTCs is determined by property development costs, which are reduced by any federal grants received. This reduction can lead to lower tax credits for nonprofit developers. The Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000 allowed for-profit limited partnerships to participate in affordable housing projects. The Opportunity Act (P.L. 106-569) in 2000 allowed for-profit limited partnerships with a nonprofit organization as the sole general partner to be eligible Section 202 owners. This change in law enabled a nonprofit Section 202 grantee to loan the capital grant to the limited partnership, potentially increasing the value of LIHTCs by not treating the funds as federal grants. However, mixed financing arrangements are still uncommon due to their complexity and the preference to avoid federal grant financing in LIHTC projects. The treatment of Section 202 PRAC in tax credit transactions remains unclear. The IRS has not clarified the treatment of Section 202 PRAC in tax credit transactions despite exceptions for other rental assistance programs. Congress intended Section 202 assistance to be included in calculating qualified basis, but no ruling has been issued by the IRS. The IRS has not issued a ruling on including Section 202 PRAC in tax credit transactions, despite exceptions for other rental assistance programs. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 removed limitations on developing mixed finance projects using federal grants like Section 202 and LIHTC. Developers can now qualify for tax credits worth 9% or 4%, with the higher credit available for new construction not federally subsidized. Financing projects with LIHTC became less lucrative for developers of federally subsidized buildings due to the lower tax credit available. P.L. 110-289 made financing projects with LIHTC less lucrative by removing the phrase \"below market federal loans\" from the definition of federal subsidy. This change allows for new construction developed with below-market federal loans to be eligible for tax credits. The 9% credits are competitive, making it difficult for Section 202 developers to obtain them. The BMIR program, enacted in 1961, aimed to create housing for low- and moderate-income families but has not provided funds for new developments since 1968. Properties with active mortgages under the BMIR program continue to operate. The BMIR program, created in 1961, aimed to provide affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families. It was run by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and offered FHA-insured loans with low interest rates to developers of multi-family rental housing projects. The program was replaced by the Section 236 program in 1968. BMIR properties with active mortgages are still in operation, but as affordability terms expire, fewer units may be available for elderly residents. The Rent Supplement program, enacted in 1965, subsidizes rent payments for low-income households in Section 221(d)(3) BMIR housing developments. Units are open to households with incomes up to 95% of the area median income. Contracts with building owners cover the difference between tenant income and fair market rent. Up to 40% of units can be eligible for subsidy payments if deemed necessary by the HUD Secretary. Many contracts have converted to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. In 1968, Congress established the Section 236 program to provide housing for low- and moderate-income families, replacing the Section 221(d)(3) and Section 202 programs. The program aimed to develop housing units for elderly persons and those with disabilities, producing around 400,000 new units in 3,601 developments by 1976. The Section 236 program, established in 1968, produced approximately 400,000 new units in 3,601 developments by 1976. Despite a moratorium on new construction in 1973, the program continued to subsidize existing developments by providing FHA insurance for mortgages and Interest Reduction Payments to owners, allowing them to charge low rents to tenants. The Section 236 program, established in 1968, provided affordable housing through low-interest mortgages. Tenants pay basic or market rent, with subsidies available for low-income households. Approximately 66,000 units were reserved for elderly residents, with some projects receiving rent subsidies through the Rental Assistance Payments program enacted in 1974. The Rental Assistance Payments (RAP) program was enacted by Congress in 1974 to limit tenants' rent payments to 25% of their income. Building owners could receive RAP for up to 20% of units in a project. Section 236 owners were also eligible for Rent Supplement payments, which have mostly been converted to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Public Housing, established in 1937, provides housing for very low-income households. The Public Housing program, established in 1937, offers housing for very low-income households, with tenants required to pay 30% of their income towards rent. The Housing Act of 1956 authorized units specifically for low-income elderly individuals, increasing elderly households in Public Housing. Despite the intention to integrate elderly residents with non-elderly families, the first elderly-only development was created by 1960. In 1961, individuals with disabilities were included in the definition of \"elderly families\" for Public Housing. The inclusion of residents with disabilities in Public Housing for the elderly became more common in the 1980s and early 1990s due to factors like the availability of outpatient mental health care and the 1988 Fair Housing Act Amendments. In 1992, Congress allowed Public Housing Authorities to designate buildings as elderly only, disabled only, or elderly and disabled only due to conflicts between tenants with disabilities and elderly residents. In 1996, The Public Housing Opportunity Extension Act streamlined the process for designating buildings as elderly-only. If a PHA wants to change the composition of a building to only elderly residents, it must submit a plan to HUD for approval. HUD requires PHAs to submit a plan for approval to designate housing for elderly or disabled residents. If approved, PHAs cannot evict non-elderly residents with disabilities but can assist with relocation. Units must be offered to elderly households first, then near-elderly tenants, and finally to all families if not rented. HUD provides data on PHAs with approved housing plans. Between 1974 and 1983, Section 8 programs provided rental assistance for new and rehabilitated housing for low-income families. Rental assistance was provided to developers creating affordable housing for low-income families, including units developed between 1974 and 1990 that received Section 8 assistance. Section 8 rental assistance was available for properties dedicated to elderly and disabled households, allowing them to live together. In project-based Section 8 housing, elderly residents and those with disabilities can live together. Owners may give preference to elderly families but must reserve some units for tenants with disabilities. If units cannot be rented to elderly families, near-elderly families with a disabled adult member may be given preference. In 2005, there were 200,000 units of project-based Section 8 housing dedicated to elderly households. Four federal programs are available to provide services for elderly residents in HUD-subsidized buildings: Congregate Housing, Service Coordinator, ROSS Service Coordinator, and Assisted Living Conversion/Service Enriched Housing Program. These programs cater to frail elderly or at-risk elderly individuals based on their ability to engage in activities of daily living. The programs for elderly residents in HUD-subsidized buildings focus on activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, dressing, bathing, grooming, and home management. The Congregate Housing program includes an additional ADL related to mobility. Residents aged 62 or older who cannot perform at least three ADLs are considered frail, while those unable to perform one or two ADLs are at risk. Residents must be able to participate in ADLs to qualify for these programs. The Congregate Housing Services program, part of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978, provides funds for HUD housing facilities to offer services for elderly residents, preventing them from moving to nursing homes by providing meals and other supports. Residents must be able to participate in activities of daily living (ADLs) to qualify for assistance. In the programs, residents must be able to feed, dress, wash themselves, take care of personal appearance, be mobile, and use a wheelchair. Eligibility for assistance is determined on an individual basis or by the percentage of frail or at-risk residents in a building. The Congregate Housing Services program, established in 1978, provides support for elderly residents in HUD housing facilities to prevent them from moving to nursing homes. The program offers meals, housekeeping, case management, personal care, and transportation services. The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act expanded eligible developments to include those assisted under project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts. Since 1995, no new Congregate Housing contracts have been awarded, but existing contracts continue to be funded by HUD. HUD pays up to 40% of Congregate Housing costs, with recipients responsible for 50%. HUD pays up to 40% of Congregate Housing costs, recipients must pay 50%, and elderly participants must contribute at least 10% of total program costs. Eligible residents must be frail, identified by a committee including a medical professional. Service coordinators provide various services like transportation, meals, and healthcare. Funding for service coordinators through the Section 202 program began in 1990. Service coordinators became eligible for funding through the Section 202 program in 1990 (P.L. 101-625). Projects funded prior to capital grants and PRAC are eligible. HUD developments funded through Section 221(d)(3) and Section 236 programs were made eligible for funding in 1992 (P.L. 102-550). In 2000, the law was amended to allow service coordinators to assist elderly and disabled residents near HUD-subsidized buildings. Funding is awarded competitively, with owners of eligible properties applying annually through HUD's grant process. At least 25% of residents in a development must qualify for funding. The ROSS program, established in the FY1999 HUD Appropriations Act, provides grants for service coordinators and supportive services for elderly and disabled residents in designated Public Housing developments. Applicants must meet specific criteria, including having no other funds available for a service coordinator. Grants are awarded for three years and are renewable. In FY2008, HUD combined the ROSS Elderly/Persons with Disabilities program with the ROSS Family and Homeownership Program to create the ROSS Service Coordinators grant program. Recipients must provide a 25% match to the federal grant and funds are used for service coordinators, not services themselves. HUD allocated $34 million for Service Coordinator contracts in FY2015. The HUD Appropriations Act of FY2000 created the Assisted Living Conversion Program (ALCP) for HUD-subsidized facilities to accommodate elderly and disabled residents. Grants can be used for modifications and capital repairs in eligible buildings. The Assisted Living Conversion Program (ALCP) provides grants for capital repairs to eligible projects. Congress has not allocated new funds for ALCP since FY2013. HUD's definition of an assisted living facility includes licensing, supportive services, separate housing units, and common rooms. State definitions and care requirements for assisted living facilities vary. Recipients of conversion grants must meet state or HUD physical standards. HUD's Assisted Living Conversion Program (ALCP) provides funds for eligible facilities to make capital repairs. Facilities must have a central kitchen, lounge, and recreational areas. Program requirements include 24-hour crisis response, supervision of nutrition and medication, and three meals per day. Construction requirements include accessible bathrooms and a 24-hour emergency response system. Owners of eligible properties can apply for ALCP funds through HUD's annual NOFA process for modifications like grab bars, widened doors, accessible appliances, and emergency alert systems. The Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act made changes to the Assisted Living Conversion Program, adding a new category called \"Service Enriched Housing\" (SEH). SEH grants do not require the facility to be licensed, but service providers must be licensed or certified. SEH must have a service coordinator on staff, and residents unable to perform daily activities are eligible for services. Each unit in SEH should have its own emergency alert system. The Service Enriched Housing (SEH) grants were available as part of the FY2012 and FY2013 grant competitions. Funding for Section 202 and related programs was reduced by nearly 50% in FY2011 and has not recovered to previous levels since then. No funding has been appropriated for new Section 202 units since FY2011, and the Assisted Living Conversion Program has not received any funding since FY2013. Funding has mainly supported the renewal of Section 202 rental assistance and Service Coordinator contracts. In FY2011, Congress reduced funding for the Section 202 program to $400 million from $825 million in FY2010. Funding levels have fluctuated since then, reaching a low of $355 million in FY2013 before increasing to $420 million and $433 million in FY2016. No new funding has been allocated for Section 202 units since FY2011, and the Assisted Living Conversion Program has not received funding since FY2013. Funding has primarily supported the renewal of Section 202 rental assistance and Service Coordinator contracts. In FY2014, Congress authorized HUD to use excess funds for elderly housing programs. HUD allocated $20 million in FY2016 for a Supportive Services Demonstration. A Notice of Funding Availability was released in January 2016, offering $15 million to multifamily housing owners for service coordinators and wellness nurses. Owners of older Section 202 developments face challenges in funding property improvements for affordable housing. Refinancing can help by paying off old loans and using equity for upgrades. Prior to 2011, HUD approval was required to refinance into lower interest rate loans. The Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act (P.L. 111-372) allows owners of Section 202 properties with interest rates at or below 6% to refinance and use the proceeds for property improvements. HUD can subordinate existing Section 202 debt when owners obtain new financing. Owners must use the new loan proceeds to benefit tenants or provide affordable housing and services for elderly persons in another HUD-assisted property. The Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act (P.L. 111-372) allows owners to refinance their properties with interest rates at or below 6% for improvements. Owners must use the proceeds for supportive services, rehabilitation, and developers' fees. The law also extends the property's affordability term when owners prepay their Section 202 loans. The American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act (P.L. 106-569) requires property owners with rental-assistance contracts to continue operating under those terms through loan maturity. P.L. 111-372 mandates HUD approval to prepay a Section 202 loan, with owners agreeing to maintain affordability for 20 years beyond the original loan's maturation. Additionally, P.L. 111-372 authorizes Senior Preservation Rental Assistance Contracts (SPRAC) for unassisted units in properties financed before 1974. HUD released a final notice on July 3, 2013, describing how SPRAC funds would be awarded to prevent tenant displacement in cases of increased rents due to refinancing. The law prohibits Section 8 rental assistance from increasing unless through mark-up-to-market and mark-up-to-budget transactions under MAHRA. Previous refinancing provisions in FY2009 and FY2010 appropriations acts were only effective for the duration of the fiscal year. Under appropriations laws like P.L. 111-372, owners could refinance loans with interest rates at or below 6% to address property needs. However, there were additional provisions in the appropriations acts, such as meeting a cost benefit analysis by HUD and providing enhanced Section 8 vouchers instead of project-based rental assistance. HUD released a notice in 2012 outlining policies for refinancing Section 202 loans, which operate through private entities. HUD has agreements with private owners to maintain affordable housing for 20 to 50 years, with rental assistance contracts. Affordability restrictions on properties began ending in the 1980s, leading to the risk of unaffordability for low- and moderate-income tenants. Efforts to preserve affordability are known as \"assisted housing preservation.\" Affordable housing units may convert to market-rate housing when HUD-subsidized mortgages or loans mature. When HUD-subsidized mortgages or loans mature, owners may convert units to market-rate rentals or lose project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts. Older buildings may lack funds for renovations, making units uninhabitable. The fate of HUD assistance varies based on the type of subsidy program or rental assistance contract. Owners of Section 221(d)(3) and Section 236 properties can convert units to market-rate rents upon mortgage maturation if no rental assistance contract is attached. Section 8 assistance continues until the contract ends, with tenants receiving vouchers afterward. RAP and Rent Supplement contracts generally end at loan maturity. Owners can prepay HUD-insured mortgages without permission, ending affordability restrictions, with income-eligible tenants receiving Section 8 vouchers. Assisted tenants may not receive Section 8 vouchers if owners opt out of contracts. HUD began publishing notices in FY2010 to help property owners make improvements to their multifamily housing developments, preserving affordable units at risk of disrepair. One notice allows HUD to subordinate Section 202 loans for necessary rehabilitation or repairs, with owners required to enter extended use agreements. HUD issued a notice allowing for deferral of repayment of flexible subsidy debt to assist in preserving properties with financial difficulties. Owners must show the deferral is necessary for project preservation and agree to extended use agreements for 20 years beyond the loan's maturity date. HUD issued a notice allowing Section 202 owners to convert efficiency units to one-bedroom units to improve financial position. Nonprofit owners of Section 236 and other properties with FHA-insured mortgages can realize profits from property sales. Nonprofit owners can realize profits from property sales if specific requirements are met, including maintaining affordability for at least 20 years, renewing Section 8 contracts, implementing rent increases as per guidance, conducting repairs, having a feasible financing plan, and being experienced in affordable housing operation. Congressional Action: The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act established the Rental Assistance Demonstration program. The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act established the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD), allowing housing subsidy programs to convert to Section 8 project-based rental assistance or vouchers. Approximately 2.72 million grandparents were responsible for grandchildren under 18, with 21% living in poverty. HUD guidelines govern various housing programs. The HUD guidelines for housing programs prohibit excluding children from developments designed for elderly residents. While some elderly housing developments may allow children, they may not have the space to accommodate families with both elderly members and young children. The LEGACY Act, part of the American Dream Downpayment Act, funded housing units in the Section 202 program for elderly residents raising grandchildren or other relatives under 19. Congress allocated $3.96 million in FY2006 for an Intergenerational Families Demonstration Project, with two awardees in Chicago and Smithville, TN receiving capital grants and rental assistance. The LEGACY Act funded housing units in the Section 202 program for elderly residents raising grandchildren or other relatives under 19. HUD released a report on the affordable housing needs of grandparent-headed households and estimated that 265,000 grandparent-headed households and 225,000 households headed by other relatives were considered very low income and eligible for LEGACY Act-funded housing."
