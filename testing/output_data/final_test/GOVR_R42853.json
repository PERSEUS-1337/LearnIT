    "content": "The long-standing debate over nuclear energy's future is rooted in its dual nature as a source of limitless energy and potential for nuclear weapons. International efforts focus on spreading benefits while preventing proliferation through key nuclear fuel cycle facilities. The use of nuclear power for peaceful energy production remains controversial. The controversy surrounding nuclear power for peaceful energy production stems from the challenges of managing highly radioactive materials and long-term storage of nuclear waste. Technologies to reduce waste through recycling raise concerns about proliferation risks. Despite efforts to address these issues, substantial amounts of radioactive waste still need to be stored and disposed of, posing challenges for central storage and disposal sites. The challenges of managing highly radioactive materials and long-term storage of nuclear waste have hindered the development of central storage and disposal sites worldwide. The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant disaster in March 2011 has slowed nuclear power expansion plans, particularly in Japan and Western Europe. Despite this, new reactors are still being planned and built in China, India, Russia, and other regions, driven by the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and generate electricity without relying on fossil fuels. The United States has the largest nuclear power industry globally, but growth has been stagnant for the past two decades. The United States nuclear power industry has been stagnant for the past two decades, with most new electric generating capacity coming from natural gas and renewable energy. Incentives for new nuclear plants were enacted in 2005, but projects have been put on hold due to declining natural gas prices and uncertainty about carbon dioxide controls. Currently, only two new reactors in Georgia are under construction, while two identical reactors in South Carolina were cancelled in 2017. The United States nuclear power industry has been stagnant for the past two decades, with most new electric generating capacity coming from natural gas and renewable energy. Incentives for new nuclear plants were enacted in 2005, but projects have been put on hold due to declining natural gas prices and uncertainty about carbon dioxide controls. Existing U.S. nuclear power plants are facing tough competition from natural gas and renewable energy, leading to the closure of seven reactors from 2013 through 2018. The most recent retirement was New Jersey's Oyster Creek plant, which shut down in September 2018 to avoid constructing a cooling tower. The future of aging U.S. nuclear reactors is uncertain as some units face shutdowns while others have extended their operating licenses. The debate over the growth of nuclear power in the U.S. and globally continues, with questions for Congress on policies, safety standards, technology development, and waste management. Currently, there are 98 licensed nuclear power reactors in the U.S. generating about 20% of the nation's electricity. In the United States, 59 sites generate 20% of the nation's electricity. Reactors were licensed from 1969 to 2015, with most receiving 20-year license renewals. Some reactors face shutdown by 2030 or 2049, except for Watts Bar 2, which has an 80-year license. 12 reactors are scheduled to retire before their licenses expire. The cost of building and operating new nuclear power plants in the United States is higher than natural gas, wind, and solar. The Energy Information Administration estimates that nuclear power would cost 9.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, while gas-fired generation would cost 4.9 cents/kwh, and wind and solar would cost around 5 cents/kwh. The cost of building and operating new nuclear power plants in the United States is higher than natural gas, wind, and solar. Estimates show nuclear power at 9.3 cents/kwh, while gas-fired generation would cost 4.9 cents/kwh, wind at 5.0 cents/kwh, and solar at 5.0 cents/kwh. Various factors influence these estimates, such as fuel costs, availability of solar and wind, tax incentives, and environmental regulations. Construction delays and cost overruns have affected new U.S. reactors, with two units at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia set to begin operating in 2021 and 2022. Licenses for 10 additional reactors have been issued, but applications for 14 others have been withdrawn or suspended. Worldwide, there are 451 operable reactors and 54 under construction. In the world, 451 reactors are currently in service, with 54 more under construction. France is the most nuclear-reliant country, generating 72% of its electricity from 58 reactors. After the Fukushima accident, Germany closed 8 of its 17 reactors and plans to shut the rest by 2022. Japan, aiming for 50% nuclear power, now targets 20% by 2030, with only 9 reactors in service and 17 applying for restart. Japan has 17 reactors applying for restart to meet new safety requirements. France aims to reduce nuclear power to 50% by 2025. Spent nuclear fuel is stored in pools of water before being transferred to dry casks for storage. Reprocessing of spent fuel in the US has not been commercialized, leading to challenges in waste storage and disposal. The U.S. faces challenges in siting commercial spent fuel, with most remaining at nuclear plants. Yucca Mountain was designated as the sole candidate site for a permanent repository, but the project was halted due to opposition from Nevada. The Trump Administration sought funding to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process, but it was not included in the budget. The Obama Administration appointed the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop an alternative nuclear waste policy, and DOE responded with a waste strategy in 2013. A federal appeals court ordered NRC to continue the Yucca Mountain licensing process. The NRC issued the final volumes of the Yucca Mountain Safety Evaluation Report, determining that the repository would meet all standards. However, construction authorization was withheld until land and water rights requirements were met and a supplemental EIS was completed. The supplemental EIS was finished in May 2016, and the Yucca Mountain licensing documents were made public. The repository site was withdrawn from public lands laws and placed under DOE's control, allowing for the storage of spent fuel at an NRC-licensed interim facility. The bill aims to increase the capacity limit of the Yucca Mountain repository and provide funding for nuclear energy programs. The Energy and Commerce Committee ordered the bill reported, and it passed the House with a significant majority. The funding for nuclear waste programs would come from two appropriations accounts. The House and Senate disagreed on funding for Yucca Mountain in the FY2019 appropriations bill. The House approved $100 million more than requested, while the Senate included no funding for Yucca Mountain but authorized a pilot program for an interim nuclear waste storage facility. Ultimately, the enacted FY2019 appropriations measure did not include funding for Yucca Mountain or the Senate's interim storage authorization. The House and Senate disagreed on funding for Yucca Mountain in the FY2019 appropriations bill. The House approved $100 million more than requested, while the Senate included no funding for Yucca Mountain but authorized a pilot program for an interim nuclear waste storage facility. Ultimately, the enacted FY2019 appropriations measure did not include funding for Yucca Mountain or the Senate's interim storage authorization. The bill prohibits DOE from developing a repository only for defense nuclear waste until NRC has issued a final decision on a construction permit for the Yucca Mountain repository. The curr_chunk discusses bills introduced in January 2017 related to nuclear waste management, including obtaining consent from state and local governments before using funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund, authorizing contracts with private spent fuel storage facilities, and using interest earned by the Fund for private interim storage. It also provides funding for nuclear waste and energy programs, water development projects, and independent agencies. H.R. 3266, reported by the House Committee on Appropriations, was combined with other bills into H.R. 3354, passed by the House in September 2017. It included funding for DOE Yucca Mountain licensing activities and a pilot program for an interim nuclear waste storage facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not provide funding for Yucca Mountain in its version of the bill. The Senate panel approved a pilot program for an interim nuclear waste storage facility at a volunteer site. Energy and Water Development Appropriations were provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. DOE is authorized to make annual payments to local governments for storing spent nuclear fuel. The House and Senate bills did not include nuclear waste provisions. Payments of $15 per kilogram of nuclear waste are authorized for communities with closed nuclear power plants. The House and Senate bills add eligibility for the New Markets tax credit and authorize DOE to store high-level radioactive waste at a private-sector facility. It also requires moving spent fuel from pools to dry casks and expanding emergency planning zones. NRC would be authorized to use interest earned. The Senate and House bills aim to improve compliance with spent fuel transfer plans by authorizing NRC to use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund for grants to nuclear power plants. The bills also prohibit the Secretary of Energy from taking action on a nuclear waste repository until a study on alternative uses of Yucca Mountain is submitted to Congress. Introduced in 2017 and 2018, the bills are currently under review by relevant committees. U.S. nuclear power plants are facing financial pressure due to storage of spent nuclear fuel. Various reports and studies have been conducted on commercial nuclear waste management, including the need to resume licensing of the Yucca Mountain Repository. U.S. nuclear power plants are under financial pressure due to competition from natural gas and renewable energy, leading to closures and stalled construction of new reactors. Congress is debating federal action to support the existing nuclear fleet and promote new reactors, with a focus on the role of nuclear power in meeting energy and environmental goals. Supporters emphasize its secure, low-emission energy production, while opponents raise concerns about safety. Opponents of nuclear power argue that safety risks, proliferation concerns, nuclear waste hazards, and high costs outweigh the benefits of low greenhouse gas emissions. Potential mechanisms for increased federal support include loan guarantees, tax credits, clean energy mandates, emissions credits, and electricity market regulations. Some states have taken action to prevent nuclear plant closures by providing zero emission credits and eligibility for state procurement processes for nuclear reactors. Energy Secretary Rick Perry proposed a regulation to ensure coal and nuclear power plants could recover their costs. The Department of Energy (DOE) proposed a regulation to require coal and nuclear power plants to have a 90-day fuel supply on site for resilience. FERC rejected the proposal but initiated a new proceeding to evaluate bulk power system resilience. President Trump directed DOE to recommend actions to prevent retirements of fuel-secure power facilities. Federal tax credits for new nuclear plants were extended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended federal tax credits for new nuclear plants, allowing them to qualify for the production tax credit even after January 1, 2021, if the capacity limit has not been reached. The tax credit was also modified to allow non-taxpaying partners to transfer their credits to taxpaying partners. This extension is crucial for the financial viability of the two reactors currently under construction at the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia. Georgia Power's construction share for the two new reactors at the Vogtle plant has increased to about $10.3 billion, with a total estimated construction cost of $22.5 billion. The project received loan guarantees totaling $8.33 billion from the DOE. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz announced $6.5 billion in loan guarantees for two utility partners in the Vogtle project in 2014, with an additional $1.8 billion guarantee issued in 2015. Secretary Rick Perry later committed $3.7 billion in loan guarantees in 2017. The Trump Administration proposed to rescind DOE's authority to issue further loan guarantees in FY2019, but this was not approved by Congress. No other proposed nuclear plants have received DOE loan guarantees. The Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program manages research projects to address cost and technical issues in existing nuclear plants. The Trump Administration proposed cutting the program's funding, but it was continued at $47 million annually. Federal policy on carbon dioxide emissions could impact nuclear power expansion and existing reactor viability. The EPA is looking to repeal the Clean Power Plan, which could affect nuclear power's role in reducing emissions. The bill caps annual fees assessed by the NRC on nuclear power plants at FY2015 levels, adjusts for inflation, and sets limits on corporate support costs. It also establishes streamlining requirements for NRC review of license applications and deadlines. Introduced in March 2017, approved by the Committee on Energy and Commerce in July 2018. The bill aims to limit NRC's corporate support costs to 28% of its total budget after FY2023. It establishes a commission to analyze energy sources in the US and offers a tax credit for investments in nuclear energy plants. Introduced in 2017 and referred to various committees. Introduced in May 2018, the bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to study the legal, regulatory, and commercial practices of the US civilian nuclear industry. It also mandates the DOE to purchase power from a commercial nuclear reactor by 2023 and extend federal power purchase agreements to 40 years. Additionally, the bill requires the DOE to develop a 10-year strategic plan for the Office of Nuclear Energy. The bill introduced in May 2018 requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to study the US civilian nuclear industry and purchase power from a commercial nuclear reactor by 2023. It also extends federal power purchase agreements to 40 years and mandates the DOE to develop a 10-year strategic plan for the Office of Nuclear Energy. Additionally, the bill requires the DOE to provide financial assistance to local governments affected by troubled nuclear power plants. Hearings were held by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and the House Energy and Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Energy. The Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Energy held a hearing on H.R. 1320 and draft bills related to nuclear energy competitiveness and advanced technology. Witnesses included DOE officials, industry representatives, and environmental groups.

The Nuclear Power Dilemma: Declining Profits, Plant Closures, and the Threat of Rising Carbon Emissions, Union of Concerned Scientists, November 2018, discusses economic and market challenges facing the U.S. nuclear commercial fleet. The World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2018 by Mycle Schneider and Antony Froggat highlights delays and challenges facing new nuclear reactors in South Carolina. Existing commercial nuclear power plants in the United States are based on light water reactor (LWR) technology, using ordinary water to cool the reactor and moderate the neutrons in the nuclear chain reaction. The federal government developed LWRs for naval propulsion in the 1950s and funded the commercialization of the technology for electricity generation. Research has also been conducted on \"advanced\" reactor technologies that aim to be safer, more efficient, and less expensive than conventional LWRs. Advanced reactors aim to produce less radioactive waste by separating elements in spent nuclear fuel for reuse, with smaller designs compared to current reactors. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are being developed, with generating capacity of 300 MW or below, to reduce construction costs and financial risks associated with building new nuclear power plants. Legislation to promote advanced nuclear technology, including Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), was signed into law in 2018. This legislation allows for the construction of demonstration reactors funded by the private sector, authorizes the development of a test reactor for advanced nuclear fuels, and provides grants for advanced reactor licensing. Proponents argue that the current licensing system for advanced nuclear technology needs to be updated. The Trump Administration proposed reducing nuclear R&D funding by 37.2% in FY2019. The House-passed bill aimed to increase nuclear R&D by 11.7% over the FY2018 level, while the Senate voted for nearly flat funding. The enacted FY2019 funding measure provided $1.35 billion for nuclear R&D. The enacted FY2019 funding measure (P.L. 115-244) provided $1.35 billion for nuclear energy, with directives for producing high-assay, low enriched uranium (HA-LEU) and research and development for a versatile fast test reactor. DOE is required to support nuclear fission and fusion technologies through computer modeling, testing, and demonstration at national laboratories. Bills introduced in January 2017 focus on nuclear R&D funding and development. The Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act (H.R. 589) was referred to House and Senate committees, eventually passing into law as P.L. 115-248. It requires NRC and DOE to collaborate on technical support for advanced reactor projects, including modeling and simulation. NRC must develop a regulatory framework for advanced reactor licensing. The bill includes requirements for NRC to create a new licensing framework for advanced reactor technologies, with a staged licensing process to attract private-sector investment. It also authorizes a DOE cost-sharing program for advanced reactor license applicants. Introduced in January 2017, passed by the House in January 2017, and referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Introduced in March 2017, approved by committee in March 2017. The bill exempts NRC expenditures on developing a regulatory framework for advanced nuclear reactors from fee recovery requirements. It includes authorization of DOE nuclear energy research and development programs, allowing for privately funded experimental reactors at DOE sites. NRC would be required to develop a new regulatory framework for advanced reactors. The bill requires DOE to conduct at least four advanced reactor demonstration projects by 2028, potentially with cost-sharing with private-sector partners at DOE sites. It authorizes the construction of a fast neutron research reactor by the end of 2025. The FY2019 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act includes $65 million for these projects. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act (P.L. 115-244, Division A) allocates $65 million for research on a versatile fast test reactor and $20 million for high-assay, low enriched uranium (HA-LEU) preparation. It also requires DOE to purchase power from a commercial nuclear reactor by 2023 and extend federal power purchase agreements to 40 years. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act allocates funds for research on a versatile fast test reactor and HA-LEU preparation. It also requires DOE to purchase power from a commercial nuclear reactor by 2023 and extend federal power purchase agreements to 40 years. Additionally, DOE is mandated to prepare a 10-year strategic plan for the Office of Nuclear Energy. The 2011 Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant disaster in Japan raised safety concerns in the nuclear policy debate, highlighting the potential consequences of a total loss. Various reports and resources from organizations like Scully Capital, Kutak Rock, Third Way, Nuclear Innovation Alliance, and the U.S. Department of Energy provide insights into advanced nuclear technologies and strategies for reactor licensing. The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant disaster in 2011 underscored the risks of a total loss of power at commercial nuclear plants. The meltdown was caused by the inability to cool the reactors due to a loss of power after the tsunami, leading to the release of hydrogen and explosions in the reactor buildings. Following the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant disaster in 2011, concerns arose about the loss of cooling in the reactor buildings and spent fuel storage pools. The NRC regulates safety requirements for nuclear power plants in the United States, addressing external events and equipment failures that could lead to radioactive releases. Critics argue that the NRC is hesitant to enforce necessary safety measures, while the industry believes additional safety measures are unnecessary. Following the Fukushima disaster, the NRC established a task force to recommend safety improvements for U.S. reactors. This led to the implementation of regulatory requirements on March 12, 2012, including strategies to maintain cooling and containment integrity during severe external events. Additional requirements included reliable hardened vents for reactors of similar design to Fukushima, better instrumentation for monitoring spent fuel pools, and studying the inclusion of filters in containment vents to reduce radioactive material release. The NRC voted against requiring filters on vents to reduce radioactive material release from nuclear power plants. Legislation introduced in 2017 mandates consultation with state and local governments before submitting reactor decommissioning plans to the NRC. The NRC voted against requiring filters on vents to reduce radioactive material release from nuclear power plants. Legislation introduced in 2017 mandates consultation with state and local governments before submitting reactor decommissioning plans to the NRC. Senate and House bills introduced in 2018 authorize a DOE research program on the effects of exposure to low-dose radiation. The level of security required at nuclear power plants has been a prominent issue. Lessons learned from Fukushima have led to changes in regulatory bodies and reactor consequence analyses. The level of security at nuclear power plants has been a significant concern since the 9/11 attacks. The NRC has implemented stricter security measures, including increased attack readiness, fire and explosion mitigation, and aircraft crash resistance for new reactors. Emergency response planning has also been revised, especially after the Fukushima disaster. The NRC made revisions to emergency preparedness regulations in response to Fukushima, requiring plans to address events affecting multiple reactors and prolonged station blackout. The NRC Cyber Security Directorate was established in 2013 to oversee cybersecurity at nuclear facilities. A draft final rule was issued in 2018 on enhanced security measures. The draft final rule issued in 2018 by the NRC would establish procedures for nuclear facilities to apply for authorization to arm security personnel with \"enhanced\" weapons, preempting state laws. It also includes modifications to reporting requirements for physical security events and adds provisions for reporting suspicious activities. Additionally, it mandates the Department of Homeland Security to maintain a medical countermeasures stockpile for nuclear and other types of attacks and disasters. The curr_chunk discusses provisions for nuclear security, including the establishment of procedures for nuclear facilities to apply for authorization to arm security personnel with \"enhanced\" weapons. It also mentions the maintenance of a medical countermeasures stockpile for various types of attacks and disasters. Encouraging exports of U.S. civilian nuclear products, services, and technology while ensuring they are not used for foreign nuclear weapons programs is a key goal of U.S. nuclear energy policy. Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act mandates peaceful nuclear cooperation agreements with countries receiving U.S. nuclear technology to prevent weapons proliferation. These agreements can take effect after 90 days of continuous congressional session if they meet specified criteria. International controls and inspections aim to promote the peaceful use of civilian nuclear facilities and prevent nuclear weapons proliferation. Recent proposals to build nuclear power plants in 18 countries, including in the Middle East and less developed world, have raised concerns about inadequate international controls. Recommendations have been made to create new incentives for nations to forgo uranium enrichment and spent nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities that could produce weapons materials. Iran's nuclear energy program exemplifies the tension between peaceful and weapons uses of nuclear technology, with longstanding concerns about its uranium enrichment program. The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Iran for its suspected weapons material production. Iran signed the JCPOA in 2015 to lift sanctions in exchange for limiting nuclear weapons development. President Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2018, but other parties have continued to uphold it. Recent extensions of U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements with China and South Korea caused controversy. The U.S.-South Korea nuclear cooperation extension did not include advance consent for spent fuel reprocessing and uranium enrichment, unlike the agreement with China. A bilateral \"high level commission\" was established to address these issues. Japan's nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States automatically renewed in 2018. The U.S.-Japan nuclear cooperation agreement was automatically renewed on July 17, 2018, allowing Japan to reprocess spent nuclear fuel from its U.S.-designed reactors. Japan plans to complete a commercial reprocessing plant at Rokkasho in 2021. Some groups urged the U.S. to discourage Japan from starting its reprocessing program due to concerns about plutonium stockpiles. Japan's new Strategic Energy Plan includes a pledge to reduce its plutonium inventories following pressure from the U.S. and other countries. Recent discussions between the United States and Saudi Arabia regarding a nuclear cooperation agreement have sparked controversy. The U.S. nuclear industry supports the agreement to supply reactors and technology to Saudi Arabia, while nonproliferation groups want Saudi Arabia to commit to forswearing uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo testified that the U.S. is insisting on this commitment, despite Saudi arguments for their right to enrich and reprocess under international inspections. It has also been suggested that the agreement be conditioned on Saudi acceptance of the Additional Protocol. The agreement with Saudi Arabia for nuclear cooperation is contingent on their acceptance of the Additional Protocol, which strengthens international safeguards on nuclear activities. It also requires a commitment from Saudi Arabia to refrain from enrichment or reprocessing on their territory. Additional requirements for nuclear cooperation would be included. The President must submit a report to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on the national security implications of Saudi Arabia acquiring uranium enrichment capability through a commercial sale. President Trump's pending decision on withdrawing from the JCPOA and efforts to modify the agreement were discussed in a hearing by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Witnesses included former State Department officials and leaders of foreign policy organizations. The hearing also examined U.S. discussions with Saudi Arabia towards a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement, with witnesses from nuclear nonproliferation organizations and academic institutions. Videos, testimonies, and transcripts are available on the committee's website. The Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa examined President Trump's decision not to certify Iran's compliance with the JCPOA. Witnesses from nuclear nonproliferation and foreign affairs organizations testified. Additional information can be found at https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/hearing/subcommittee-hearing-presidents-iran-decision-next-steps/. Various CRS reports on nuclear energy cooperation with foreign countries were referenced. The curr_chunk discusses various sources related to nuclear energy cooperation, including reports from CRS, the Government Accountability Office, and the Nuclear Energy Institute. It also mentions a study on managing nuclear ambitions in Saudi Arabia and the economic aspects of pausing reprocessing in East Asia."
