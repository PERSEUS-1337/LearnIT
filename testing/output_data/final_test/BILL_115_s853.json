Tier 1 countries fully comply, Tier 2 countries are making efforts but fall short, and Tier 3 countries make minimal or no efforts to comply. SEC. 4. MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF CORRUPTION AND ASSESSMENT OF EFFORTS TO COMBAT CORRUPTION.

The government is required to vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict individuals involved in corruption, including public officials, to demonstrate serious and sustained efforts to combat corruption.

Access to resources for civil society organizations to combat corruption should be provided by the government. The government should support civil society organizations in combating corruption, ensure an independent judiciary for impartially deciding corruption cases, assist in international investigations of transnational corruption networks, and cooperate with other countries to extradite corrupt actors.

The Secretary of State and the USAID Administrator will create an online platform consolidating various anti-corruption reports, including the Human Rights Report, Fiscal Transparency Report, Investment Climate Statement reports, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, and other relevant public reports. The platform will also link to third-party indicators used by the United States Government for policy and programming purposes. The Department of State and USAID will enhance personnel training to support anti-corruption efforts as a foreign policy and development priority. This includes utilizing various business surveys and international indices, as well as participating in multilateral anti-corruption compliance mechanisms.
