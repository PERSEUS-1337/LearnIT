They achieved 50 consecutive successful Long March rocket launches from 1996 to 2006, with assistance from U.S. companies. China sent humans into space in 2003 and 2005, and orbited a lunar explorer in 2007. Despite being a world leader in yearly space launches, China is less active than Russia or the United States. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) was established in the 1990s, separate from the People's Liberation Army (PLA). China's space activities are managed by the civilian Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense and the PLA. China's intentions in space are not transparent, with a focus on domestic development goals and national security. China advocates for arms control in space and peaceful use of outer space in international forums. China's space activities are growing, with a budget estimated at $1.4-2.2 billion per year. China collaborates with various countries, including Russia, the EU, Brazil, Canada, and Nigeria, in civilian space activities. The partnership with Russia is particularly active and has benefited China's manned space efforts. China is not considered a key member of the international space community but has a collaborative framework with the EU since 1998. China's space program, established in 1992 as \"Project 921,\" focuses on sending humans into space to enhance national prestige. This approach, despite being more costly, garners attention domestically and internationally. China's progress in human space missions has been steady but not groundbreaking. China's Shenzhou program, part of Project 921, has made steady progress in human space missions. Divided into three phases, it has successfully launched multiple missions, including establishing a space laboratory module with docking capability. Phase III aims to establish a permanent space station. China's Shenzhou program has made progress in human space missions, including launching Chang-e 1, China's first lunar probe. The probe orbits the moon, mapping potential lunar resources for future use by Chinese industry. China plans to send Chang-e 2 with a robotic lunar rover in 2012 and Chang-e 3 to collect samples five years later. China's Chang-e 3 is set to send another rover to collect samples for return to Earth. China denies having a timetable for sending humans to the moon but plans to explore Mars and the outer solar system. Collaboration with Russia is being discussed. Cooperation between China and the United States in space has been limited, with mistrust growing in the mid-1990s due to accusations of sensitive military information transfer. Cooperation has stagnated due to economic, political, and security frictions in the U.S.-China relationship. In September 2006, NASA Administrator Michael Griffin visited his Chinese counterpart in China for a \"get acquainted\" meeting. China later conducted its first successful anti-satellite weapons test in January 2007, causing international condemnation for creating debris that threatens space assets. China conducted an anti-satellite weapons test in January 2007, posing a threat to space assets of multiple countries, including China's. The decision to conduct the test contradicted Beijing's peaceful use of outer space stance and may have been influenced by the U.S.'s aggressive space policies. The Chinese ASAT test in 2007 raised concerns about China's space capabilities and intentions. Some viewed it as a strategic deterrence display, while others saw it as a demonstration of ambitious objectives in space. The test disrupted potential cooperation between NASA and CNSA, with some arguing for increased dialogue and others warning against inadvertent technology transfer. Increased space cooperation with China should be avoided until Chinese intentions are clearer due to concerns about technology transfer and the risk of a \"space Pearl Harbor.\" Collaboration could improve transparency but may be viewed as a moral compromise given China's human rights record and non-democratic governance. Some argue that increased collaboration may not benefit the United States without a new political climate. Collaborating with China in space cooperation could benefit the United States by keeping China dependent on U.S. technology, leading to cost savings and information sharing. This approach may also help prevent China from developing technologies unilaterally and give the U.S. leverage in other areas of the relationship. NASA has engaged in space cooperation with CNSA in the past, but there is potential for further collaboration. This could involve dialogue on strategic communication, rules of the road, and joint activities such as bi-and multi-lateral partnerships on various space missions. Joint U.S.-Soviet space docking in 1975 is an example of successful cooperation during the Cold War."
