    "content": "Automobile manufacturers rely on a network of 20,000 independently owned dealers for sales and service. Dealers are crucial for connecting manufacturers with car buyers, and this relationship is vital for the success of the U.S. automobile industry. General Motors' CEO emphasized the importance of a strong dealer network for the company's reinvention, highlighting the significant role dealers play as the \"face of GM.\" The National Automobile Dealers Association also emphasized the support dealers provide to manufacturers. The automobile dealers support manufacturers by providing a distribution channel at no cost. Chrysler and GM are reducing their dealer networks, causing disagreement between manufacturers and dealers on network size and flexibility. Chrysler eliminated 789 dealers, while GM plans to reduce its network by half. The NADA reports that the eliminated dealerships had over 100,000 employees. Dealerships slated for elimination had over 100,000 employees, as part of the auto industry's realignment. The restructuring by Chrysler and GM included closing plants, cutting jobs, and reshaping dealer networks. Congress is examining the impact of government aid on the auto industry stakeholders. The report discusses the U.S. auto dealer network, its origins, economic contributions, state and federal involvement in franchising, and recent Congressional actions. It also addresses the termination of dealers during GM and Chrysler's bankruptcy cases. Additionally, it analyzes legislative proposals mandating dealership agreements for automakers receiving federal funds. Ford's early experience with selling cars involved setting up company-owned stores called branch houses in major cities during the first decade of the twentieth century. However, by the 1910s, Ford abandoned direct selling due to challenges in opening branch houses fast enough to meet demand and finding qualified staff. Salaried employees were not motivated enough to sell cars, leading Ford to conclude that dealers with a financial interest in their own company were more effective. The dealer franchise system emerged as a way for automakers to market, finance, and service motor vehicles. Dealers are independent businesses that represent manufacturers, selling and servicing cars locally. State franchise laws aim to equalize the relationship between dealers and manufacturers, with dealers bearing most of the investments and capital risk. The dealer franchise system aims to equalize the relationship between dealers and manufacturers, with dealers bearing most of the investments and capital risk. State franchise laws restrict manufacturers like G.M. from easily closing dealerships, making it costly to drop a brand due to dealer buyouts and potential lawsuits. Dealers make money primarily from servicing old cars and selling used ones, while manufacturers like G.M. profit from new car sales and financing. Dealers can thrive even when automakers struggle, and they often have more political influence at the state level. Some states have passed laws to prevent online car sales, protecting the traditional dealership model. In some states, laws were passed to ban online car sales, protecting traditional dealerships. Dealers make profits mainly from used-car sales and service work, while new-vehicle sales are becoming less profitable. Dealers have not been profitable in new-car sales since 2005, but can make significant profits from used-car sales and service departments. New-car dealerships generate significant revenue from used-car sales and service departments, with an average dealer payroll of $2.6 million. There is a wide variance in dealer size and performance across different states, with California having nearly 1,500 new-car dealers and Alaska having 35. Total U.S. auto industry sales have been declining for nearly a decade, with over 16 million new cars and light trucks sold in 2006 and 2007, but only 13.2 million units sold in 2008. In 2008 and 2009, U.S. auto sales hit a low with 10.4 million and 13.2 million units sold respectively, the lowest since 1982. The recession, credit crisis, and economic downturn have severely impacted auto dealers, manufacturers, suppliers, and workers. Analysts predict a slow recovery with sales not expected to exceed 12 million units annually until 2012 or later. The decline in auto sales in the United States is attributed to various factors such as volatile gasoline prices, tight credit markets, declining consumer confidence, and high unemployment rates. This has led to a drop in the number and size of cars sold, with average dealership sales decreasing from over $33 million in 2004 to just under $29 million in 2008. The net profit before taxes for the average dealer also decreased from $559,000 to $280,000 during the same period. The recession has led to reduced sales and profits for auto dealers, with market share shifting to foreign-owned automakers. Analysts predict that ongoing economic challenges and limited automotive loans for customers with lower credit ratings could further impact vehicle sales and margins. Auto dealers play a significant role in the U.S. economy, generating $758 billion in revenue in 2007, comprising 19% of total retail sales that year. The auto dealer industry in the United States accounted for 19% of total retail sales in 2007, with new-car dealers generating $677.2 billion in revenues. Auto dealers employed 1.2 million American workers in 2008. New-car dealers in the United States primarily sell vehicles from various manufacturers, offer additional services like warranties and financing, and are increasingly selling more used cars. The industry also includes dealers who exclusively sell used cars and trucks. The independent segment of the car industry consists of used car dealers who do not have franchise agreements with manufacturers. They sell previously owned or leased vehicles, benefiting from advancements in technology that have increased the availability of high-quality used cars. Despite steady growth in employment for over a decade, the number of dealerships has been decreasing due to consolidation, with a drop from 24,825 new-car dealers in 1990 to just over 20,000 in early 2009, estimated to fall below 17,000 by the end of 2009. The number of dealerships tends to fall during recessions, tracking national employment trends. In 2008, new-car dealers employed over 1 million workers, while used-car dealers employed 126,300 workers. Employment levels at dealerships dropped by 5% between 2007 and 2008, the biggest decline since 1991. The consolidation of dealerships parallels other industry trends. The recession and the closure of GM and Chrysler dealerships have led to a shift in the dealership landscape. The number of Detroit 3 dealerships decreased from 14,199 in January 2008 to 13,220 in January 2009. Meanwhile, single-brand import dealerships increased from 6,463 to 6,544 during the same period. The trend continued with the closure of over 2,000 GM and Chrysler dealerships in 2009 and 2010. Dealerships of Hummer and Saab will now sell vehicles from new owners, while Saturn dealers will close or sell used cars only. GM's Pontiac brand is also being terminated. The dealership landscape has shifted due to the recession and closure of GM and Chrysler dealerships. The number of Detroit 3 dealerships decreased, while single-brand import dealerships increased. GM's Pontiac brand is being terminated, with no effort to sell it to a third party. The make-up of foreign-badged dealerships differs significantly from the Detroit 3's networks, with a focus on urban areas where population and incomes are growing faster. Consolidations are creating larger dealerships, especially in urban areas, to compete successfully. The recession and closures of GM and Chrysler dealerships have led to a shift in the dealership landscape. Dealer consolidation is seen as necessary for enhancing competitiveness and improving profitability. The trend of larger dealerships, especially in urban areas, is accelerating due to the recession and reductions in dealership networks by GM and Chrysler. NADA estimated that the recession and these reductions could result in the loss of about 1,200 dealerships. The recession and closures of GM and Chrysler dealerships have led to a shift in the dealership landscape, with dealer consolidation seen as necessary for enhancing competitiveness. Auto dealer employment is larger than the automotive manufacturing industry, with extensive outsourcing leading to more workers in auto parts manufacturing. Outsourcing of parts and new technologies have reduced labor needed for automobile production. Auto dealer employment has increased, while auto and auto parts manufacturing employment has decreased. Between 1990 and 2008, auto dealer employment declined from 1.1 million to 880,000, with a significant drop in employment at auto assemblers like GM and Ford. Franchise dealers play a vital role in local and state economies, with California and Texas employing over 100,000 workers each in the auto dealer industry in 2008. In some states, auto dealer employees make up a sizable share of total retail employment, such as in Georgia where they account for 7.9% of all retail jobs. Other states with a significant share of auto dealer employment in retail trade include Delaware, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Virginia. Auto dealer employment declined between 1990 and 2008, with a drop in employment at auto assemblers like GM and Ford. Franchise dealers are crucial in local economies, with California and Texas employing over 100,000 workers each in 2008. States like Georgia have a significant share of auto dealer employment in retail trade. Financing is essential for car sales in the US, with dealers buying cars from automakers using financing, and consumers often taking out loans to buy cars. The credit crisis of 2008 disrupted this system, including floorplan financing where dealers purchase inventory from manufacturers. Auto company financing also plays a key role when customers buy cars from dealers. Auto dealers provide retail financing through manufacturers' finance arms like Ford Motor Credit or GMAC. GMAC and Chrysler Financial provide floorplan and retail financing for GM and Chrysler vehicles. Cerberus Capital owned 80% of Chrysler LLC, including Chrysler Financial, before Chrysler went into bankruptcy. GMAC is now majority-owned by the federal government. Other auto financing companies include Ford Motor Credit Company and Toyota. During the 2008 banking crisis, auto financing companies like GMAC and Chrysler Financial struggled to raise capital for the manufacturer-dealer-consumer pipeline. The federal government provided over $16 billion in assistance to GMAC since December 2008 to support financing to dealers. As a result, the U.S. Treasury now owns approximately 56% of GMAC. The U.S. Treasury owns 56% of GMAC, with Cerberus owning 15% and other investors holding the rest. GM must sell its ownership by 2011 to keep its bank holding company license. Efforts to revive financing in 2009 had limited success, with many banks exiting the market and credit availability tightening. Zero percent financing is mainly for customers with excellent credit. The government has provided support for dealers and financing companies. The Obama Administration implemented a warranty commitment program to back new-car warranties during GM and Chrysler's restructuring. The Small Business Administration's 7(a) loan program includes the Dealer Floorplan Financing pilot program for government-guaranteed loans to finance dealer inventories for autos and other vehicles. Starting July 1, 2009, the Dealer Floorplan Financing pilot program allows dealers to borrow from banks against retail inventory, acting as a revolving line of credit. The program offers individual loans up to $2 million, but many dealers feel the $2 million cap limits its usefulness. President Obama has requested Congress to raise the cap to $5 million. Additionally, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) announced by the Federal Reserve in December 2008 provides a $200 billion loan facility to finance inventory purchases, indirectly benefiting auto dealers by reopening the floorplan securitization market and providing capital to banks and floorplan lenders. The Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009 (CARS Act) provided $1 billion for a \"cash for clunkers\" program to boost car sales from July 1 to November 1, 2009. The program exceeded expectations and reached its maximum support level within a week, leading Congress to pass an additional $2 billion. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) has had limited success in enhancing credit availability for floorplan loans due to restrictions on AAA-rated securitizations. The CARS Act provided $1 billion for a \"cash for clunkers\" program, which was boosted by an additional $2 billion from Congress. Nearly 700,000 vehicles were sold during the summer with the help of federal rebates. A website was set up to explain the program, and all 50 states have franchise laws governing contracts between auto dealers and manufacturers. Dealers seek protection from termination without cause, while manufacturers seek more flexibility in distribution. Automotive manufacturers seek more flexibility in distribution to improve their ability to react to market conditions. Early automakers viewed dealers as a source of cash and sales experience, leading to the establishment of franchise agreements to sell their products. Initially, these agreements favored manufacturers over dealers, cutting costs and giving manufacturers greater control over sales. Auto manufacturers had the upper hand in dealer agreements, imposing tough conditions such as large cash deposits and unconditional cancellation clauses. Dealers were exclusive agents, required to sell cars at specified prices in assigned territories. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) criticized the unequal power dynamics between auto manufacturers and dealers in the late 1930s. The FTC report highlighted unfair franchise agreements set by manufacturers, leading to states enacting regulations on automobile distribution, starting with Wisconsin in 1937. Dealer practices like price fixing and padding new-car prices were also criticized for not benefiting consumers. In 1956, national legislation was passed by Congress in response to demands for federal automobile dealer legislation. The Automobile Dealer's Day in Court Act provides legal remedies for dealers harmed by manufacturers not acting in good faith regarding franchise agreements. Auto dealers argue that the 1956 federal law has not been effective. Auto dealers have found the 1956 federal law, the Dealer's Act, ineffective in protecting them, with only about 20 out of 115 cases providing relief in the first 30 years. Since then, all states and the District of Columbia have enacted their own automobile dealer legislation. State-level auto franchise laws have been upheld by courts and regulate the relationship between manufacturers and dealers in detail. Dealerships are heavily regulated in this sector. The business relationship between auto dealers and manufacturers is heavily regulated, with state laws covering a broad range of conduct and obligations on how manufacturers must interact with dealers. State auto franchise laws vary and are regularly amended to address issues in the franchise relationship, such as relevant marketing area laws defining geographic areas. State auto franchise laws cover a range of dealer obligations, including relevant marketing area laws, warranty claims, investments, purchases of cars and tools, allocation of automobiles, and termination mechanisms. These laws often require manufacturers to show good cause for termination, determine fair franchise value, and establish succession rights. Some states, like Massachusetts, California, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Virginia, also limit manufacturers' termination abilities. State franchise laws in some states (such as Massachusetts, California, North Carolina, and Virginia) restrict manufacturers from placing new dealers in existing dealer markets without giving notice and an opportunity to protest. These laws aim to create a fair playing field between dealers and manufacturers, but some argue they give too much power to dealers. While preventing arbitrary termination of dealers, experts believe termination provisions in state franchise laws can be a significant issue. The termination provisions in state automobile franchise laws are a key reason for the excess of dealers. Some state laws protect dealers from coercive behavior by manufacturers. Automakers argue that complying with these laws hinders their ability to operate efficiently. They claim that these laws benefit traditional dealers over consumers and manufacturers. In 2002, 45 states prohibited manufacturers from selling cars directly to consumers, hindering automakers' ability to innovate in sales methods. Direct manufacturer sales could lead to greater customer satisfaction by matching production with consumer preferences, reducing inventory levels, and potentially offering customized cars. The total value of new car inventory held by franchise new car dealerships in the US in 2008 was $100 billion with an annual carrying cost of $890 million. The issue of automobile franchise laws is hotly contested, with many states considering new legislation. The global recession and credit crisis have caused serious problems for automakers worldwide. The global recession and credit crisis have caused significant issues for automakers worldwide, particularly the Detroit 3. GM and Chrysler went through bankruptcy, with Chrysler now managed by Fiat and GM owned by the U.S. and Canadian governments. Ford avoided bankruptcy by strengthening its finances earlier. U.S. auto sales plummeted to a 26-year low in 2008, with sales dropping 30%-40% from the previous year. Sales of motor vehicles dropped from 13.2 million in 2008 to 10.4 million in 2009. GM and Chrysler sought federal assistance due to financial instability. Both companies submitted viability plans to the Obama Administration in 2009. The federal government provided GM and Chrysler with loans, but the viability plans submitted in 2009 were rejected as inadequate. Chrysler had 30 days and GM had 60 days to develop comprehensive restructuring plans to avoid bankruptcy. Despite efforts by the Auto Task Force, the companies were unable to complete their restructuring in time. The companies, Chrysler and GM, filed for bankruptcy in 2009. New entities were formed with Fiat purchasing Chrysler's assets and GM's assets being sold to \"General Motors Company.\" The new automakers are smaller with fewer plants, workers, and brands. The auto supply chain was also affected with several auto parts suppliers seeking Chapter 11 protection. An increasing number of smaller auto suppliers are going out of business or filing for bankruptcy due to the restructuring process and plant closures by GM and Chrysler. Chrysler and GM are reducing their number of dealerships as part of their restructuring plans, with Chrysler terminating 789 dealers and GM planning to reduce dealers from over 6,000 to 3,600. The Auto Task Force recommended accelerating steps to reduce the number of dealers, which Chrysler and GM believe will be crucial for their success as new automakers. Many Chrysler and GM dealers are opposed to the reductions in dealerships, citing concerns over wind-down periods, appeals processes, and contract terms. Despite presenting their cases to bankruptcy judges, dealer terminations proceeded as planned. Chrysler rejected contracts with 789 dealers as part of its bankruptcy proceedings. In June 2009, hearings were held by the Senate and House committees regarding dealer closings by GM and Chrysler. The automakers emphasized the need to trim their dealer network due to changing market realities. GM and Chrysler faced opposition from dealers and the NADA. Market realities have changed as the auto market has shrunk. GM and Chrysler are restructuring by cutting their dealer network, citing projections for a market recovery. GM's president mentioned the excessive number of dealers compared to competitors. All segments of the auto industry are downsizing due to the difficult economic climate. Sacrifices are required. Chrysler, like GM, is facing economic challenges and is restructuring by cutting its dealer network. Bankruptcy Judge Gonzalez's remarks highlight the need for tough economic decisions to ensure the survival of a successful \"New Chrysler.\" Sacrifices are necessary for the company to thrive in the current market conditions. Chrysler is restructuring by cutting its underperforming dealer network, which is hurting sales. The average U.S. automotive dealer made a profit in 2008, but Chrysler dealers lost money. Chrysler's unit sales per franchise are significantly lower than foreign-owned car makers like Toyota. Despite terminations, Chrysler is retaining 86% of its dealer network, ensuring customers are within a short distance of a dealership. GM's goal in dealer changes is not solely to reduce costs. The main goal of dealer changes is to create a healthy, profitable dealer network by focusing on brand strategy. Chrysler's Project Genesis aims to consolidate Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep brands under one roof, terminating dealers that do not fit this profile. Both GM and Chrysler are ending dual dealerships to focus solely on their brands, leading to cost savings. Excess dealerships are costly due to inefficiencies in maintaining multiple distribution systems. The inefficiencies and costs of maintaining multiple distribution systems, marketing and advertising messages split among too many products, and other cited costs by GM led to the termination of dealers. A rigorous process was used to select dealers for termination based on various factors. GM provided an appeals process resulting in over 50 dealers being reinstated. GM and Chrysler have reinstated some dealerships, stating that the job loss from closings is exaggerated. Chrysler estimates 30,000 employed in terminated dealerships, but 44% sell other vehicles and are expected to stay open. NADA criticized the lack of transparency in decision-making by the Treasury Department's Auto Task Force during the dealer closings. NADA criticized the Auto Task Force for demanding rapid closure of Chrysler and GM dealers, stating that dealers are the main revenue source for automakers. They argued that the dealer closures lacked transparency and objective standards. The 789 Chrysler dealers facing termination had only 26 days to sell inventory and close, leading to chaos. Dealers argued that the short wind-down period was unfair and not in line with state franchise requirements. They criticized GM for imposing onerous conditions on terminated dealers and vague performance agreements on continuing dealers. Dealers believed that cutting dealerships would not make GM or Chrysler more successful. Mr. McEleney argues that cutting dealerships will not make GM or Chrysler more successful as dealers generate over 90% of manufacturer revenue. The franchise dealer network was created to outsource the cost of selling and servicing cars. Terminating dealerships would result in a loss of market share and revenue for manufacturers. Additionally, dealers have built long-standing customer relationships and many are family-owned, so administrative savings would not be achieved as manufacturers incur minimal costs related to the dealer network. The elimination of dealerships will not lead to significant savings for manufacturers as dealers absorb various costs. State franchise laws are being undermined, impacting dealer investments and risking job losses for nearly 100,000 dealership employees nationwide. The rapid reduction of dealerships will result in the loss of nearly 100,000 jobs across the country, impacting communities and tax revenue. Reduced competition and longer distances to remaining dealers will be a challenge for consumers. The retail auto industry is struggling with credit availability, especially after the financial crisis. After GM and Chrysler announced dealership closures, Members of Congress heard from affected dealers. Hearings were held where concerns were raised, leading to legislative proposals to help dealers. The visibility of dealer concerns has increased, prompting Congress to take action. Legislative proposals have been introduced to assist dealers, including expanding the SBA loan program and implementing the \"Cash for Clunkers\" program. Congress also passed an emergency extension of the program due to high demand. In 2009, the House Appropriations Committee adopted an amendment requiring auto companies receiving federal funds to reinstate agreements with franchise dealerships. This was in response to concerns about bankruptcy judges undercutting state franchise laws. The House passed the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2010 (H.R. 3170) on July 16, 2009, by a vote of 219-208. The legislation aimed to address concerns about bankruptcy judges undercutting state franchise laws by requiring auto companies receiving federal funds to reinstate agreements with franchise dealerships. GM, Chrysler, and the Obama Administration opposed the amendment, citing potential risks to their viability. The final legislation affecting terminated dealers was passed in December 2009 in the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 3288), with a new provision replacing the earlier LaTourette amendment. President Obama signed the appropriations bill on December 16, 2009 (P.L. 111-117). Under the new law (P.L. 111-117), terminated GM and Chrysler dealers have the opportunity to participate in a binding arbitration process by June 2010. GM and Chrysler must provide terminated dealers with an explanation for termination and details of the arbitration process by mid-January 2010. The costs of arbitration will be split between the dealer and manufacturer, with arbitrators jointly selected. Arbitration must be concluded by June 2010, evaluating seven specified factors. The Administration's Auto Task Force activities were requested to be reported to the House of Representatives within 14 days. The President was asked to provide all information related to communication, financial assistance, dealer closures, retiree pensions, and ownership allocation of GM and Chrysler. The House requested information on dealer closures, retiree pensions, and ownership allocation of GM and Chrysler. Legislation such as H.R. 2743 and S. 1304 aims to restore economic rights of dealers during bankruptcy proceedings. H.R. 2793 requires a report on dealer closings and pension actions, while S. 1253 seeks reimbursement for auto dealers. S. 1253 (Corker) and S. 247 (Feinstein) propose reimbursement for closed dealerships by GM and Chrysler and a one-year cash for clunkers program, respectively. S. 1200 (Feinstein) also suggests a temporary cash for clunkers program. Additionally, S. 1135 (Stabenow) and H.R. 1606 (Manzullo) aim to incentivize the purchase of new vehicles. The Voucher Act aims to encourage new car purchases through various proposed bills such as H.R. 2224, H.R. 2285, H.R. 2750, H.R. 2796, H.R. 3088, and S.Amdt. 1189. These bills include provisions for dealer financing, tax breaks, franchise law protections, liability insurance requirements, and wind-down periods for companies like GM and Chrysler. The Appropriations Act would have required Chrysler to allow a 60-day wind-down for terminated dealers, but the amendment was withdrawn after reassurances from Chrysler's President. Appendices list new-car dealerships by state and dealerships announced for closure by GM and Chrysler."
