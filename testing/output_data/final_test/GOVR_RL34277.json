    "content": "During the 110th Congress, House and Senate committees conducted oversight activities on the Administration's warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance programs and possible changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. A National Intelligence Estimate on the terrorist threat to the U.S. Homeland highlighted the persistent threat from Islamic terrorist groups, particularly Al Qaeda. The Director of National Intelligence emphasized the need to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to adapt to technological changes. Admiral McConnell emphasized the need for modernization in response to technological changes and to meet current intelligence collection needs. He proposed two key changes: eliminating the need for a court order for foreign intelligence gathering from overseas targets and providing liability protection for those aiding in foreign intelligence collection efforts. The Protect America Act of 2007 was enacted into law with a 180-day sunset provision to address these concerns raised by the Director of National Intelligence. The House and Senate are considering legislation to address intelligence concerns. The House passed H.R. 3773, the RESTORE Act of 2007, while the Senate introduced S. 2248, the FISA Amendment Act of 2007. Senator Reid motioned to proceed with S. 2248 on December 14, 2007. On December 17, 2007, the Senate invoked cloture on the motion to proceed with S. 2248 by a vote of 76-10. Debate continued before the Senate broke for the holidays, with plans to revisit the measure in January. Senate activities on S. 2248 resumed on January 23 and 24, 2008, with a modified version of the Judiciary Committee's amendment tabled. Senator Reid sought consent for H.R. 3773, but Senator McConnell objected. A cloture motion on an amendment to S. 2248 by Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond failed on January 28, 2008. On January 28, 2008, cloture motions on amendments to extend the sunset on the Protect America Act failed in the Senate. Both the House and Senate passed a 15-day extension to allow for further consideration of proposed legislation to amend FISA. Several amendments were agreed to, while others failed during floor debate. Several Senate amendments were considered on February 7, 2008, with S.Amdt. 3941 passing and S.Amdts. 3913 and 3915 failing. S.Amdt. 3930 was withdrawn on February 6, 2008, after falling short of the required votes. Pending amendments include S.Amdts. 3938, 3911, 3907, 3927, 3919, 3920, and 3910. Floor debate is expected to continue with more votes on February 12, 2008. H.R. 3773, S. 2248, and the Senate amendment to S. 2248 all address amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. A comparison of these measures is provided using H.R. 3773 as a reference. A glossary of FISA terms is attached for clarity. Senator Reid introduced two additional FISA bills on December 10, 2007, S. 2440 and S. 2441, which were placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar. S. 2402, introduced by Senator Specter on December 3, 2007, was rejected by the Committee. These bills are not included in the comparison. The term \"Foreign power\" is defined in title I of FISA as a foreign government or any component thereof. The term \"Foreign power\" in FISA refers to various entities including foreign governments, factions of foreign nations, groups engaged in international terrorism, foreign-based political organizations, and entities directed and controlled by foreign governments. An \"Agent of a foreign power\" is defined as any person, other than a United States person, who acts on behalf of a foreign power engaging in clandestine intelligence activities in the United States. Any person who engages in clandestine intelligence activities for a foreign power in the United States, aids or abets such activities, or conspires to engage in them, is considered an agent of a foreign power under FISA. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) considers individuals as agents of a foreign power if they engage in clandestine intelligence activities, aid or abet such activities, or conspire to engage in them. This includes involvement in sabotage, international terrorism, or entering the United States under false identities for a foreign power. \"International terrorism\" refers to violent or dangerous acts that violate US laws. The definition of \"sabotage\" under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act involves activities that violate criminal laws and occur outside the United States, intended to intimidate or influence governments. Electronic surveillance refers to the acquisition of wire or radio communication contents of a known United States person within the country. This is done to protect against potential attacks, sabotage, terrorism, or clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or their agents. It also includes information related to national defense, security, and foreign affairs of the United States. The curr_chunk discusses the acquisition of wire or radio communication contents of a known United States person within the country under specific circumstances requiring a warrant for law enforcement purposes. The curr_chunk discusses the installation or use of surveillance devices in the United States for monitoring under circumstances requiring a warrant for law enforcement purposes. The curr_chunk outlines specific procedures for electronic surveillance to minimize acquisition and dissemination of nonpublic information concerning US persons, while allowing retention and dissemination of foreign intelligence information. The curr_chunk outlines procedures for the retention and dissemination of information related to crimes for law enforcement purposes, as well as restrictions on disclosing communication contents involving US persons in electronic surveillance. The curr_chunk defines terms related to electronic surveillance, including \"United States,\" \"aggrieved person,\" and \"wire communication.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to electronic surveillance, including \"person,\" \"contents,\" and \"state.\""
