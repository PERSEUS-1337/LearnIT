Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) began on January 1, 2015, to assist Afghan security forces. Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) began on March 19, 2003, primarily in Iraq, and ended on August 31, 2010. A transitional force of U.S. troops remained in Iraq under Operation New Dawn (OND) until December 15, 2011. U.S. military operations in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State of Iraq began on October 15, 2014. Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) is the new military operation in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Daily updates on U.S. military and civilian casualties can be found on the Department of Defense's website. The U.S. Army Office of the Surgeon General provided data on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) cases, defining a case as an individual with two or more outpatient visits or one or more hospitalizations where PTSD was diagnosed. In the context of Operation Inherent Resolve, PTSD cases are defined as individuals with two or more outpatient visits or one or more hospitalizations where PTSD was diagnosed. The data set defines an incident of PTSD among deployed servicemembers as occurring when diagnosed at least 30 days after deployment. Unlike PTSD numbers, traumatic brain injury (TBI) statistics are available to the public and represent medical diagnoses of TBI in locations where U.S. forces are located. Table 4 displays the number of individuals with major limb amputations in various conflicts, totaling 1,645 as of June 1, 2015. Figure 3 illustrates the trend of major limb amputations due to battle injuries from 2001 to 2015. Demographic data on servicemembers who died or were wounded in action can be found on the Defense Casualty Analysis System website. Demographic data, including gender, age, race, and ethnicity, have not been publicly released for OEF and OIR."
