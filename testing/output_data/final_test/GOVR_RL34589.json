    "content": "In July 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals vacated the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), a significant environmental measure by the Bush Administration. CAIR aimed to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from electric generating units in 28 eastern states and D.C. to protect downwind states from pollution. The court later allowed CAIR to remain in effect while EPA develops a replacement rule, reducing SO2 emission allowances by 50% in 2010 and 65% in 2015 to address acid precipitation and fine particle pollution. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) aimed to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions to protect downwind states from pollution. CAIR would significantly reduce PM 2.5 concentrations, leading to health benefits and preventing premature deaths. The NOx cap under CAIR would lower emissions by 53% in 2009 and 61% in 2015 compared to 2003 levels. NOx contributes to PM 2.5 and ground-level ozone formation, which can cause respiratory and cardiovascular issues. The court's decision undermined EPA's clean air strategy, as CAIR was a key component in reducing pollutant concentrations in states east of the Mississippi. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) was crucial for achieving National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and reducing mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. Despite not fully meeting NAAQS compliance, CAIR provided substantial benefits for affected communities. Its potential impact on air quality and mercury emissions prompted appeals from various stakeholders, including EPA, state agencies, and environmental organizations. The EPA conducted a multi-pollutant regulatory analysis in 2005, focusing on the benefits of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). The benefit-to-cost ratio ranged from 20 to 1 to 27 to 1, with the primary benefit being the avoidance of premature mortality. Other health impacts included the avoidance of non-fatal heart attacks, respiratory symptoms, asthma exacerbation, work loss days, school absence days, and minor restricted activity days. The Clean Air Act envisions a mix of state and federal authorities to reduce air pollution. The Clean Air Act establishes a partnership between state and federal authorities to reduce air pollution by setting national air quality standards. States develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to meet these standards. When EPA updated NAAQS for PM 2.5 and ozone in 1997, most states' existing SIPs were no longer sufficient. Under Section 110(k)(5) of the act, EPA can require states to submit revised SIPs with measures to achieve compliance. The Clean Air Act requires states to submit revised State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to meet updated national air quality standards. This includes addressing the issue of transported air pollutants, where upwind states must control pollution to help downwind states achieve compliance. The EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in 2005 to mitigate interstate transport of pollutants like SO2 and NOx contributing to nonattainment in eastern states. The EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in 2005 based on determinations regarding pollution transport, cost-effective control, and compliance feasibility within the State Implementation Plan process of the Clean Air Act. The rule identified states contributing to unhealthy levels of fine particles and ozone in downwind states, defining the geographic scope. EPA conducted modeling to determine upwind states' contributions to nonattainment areas in the eastern United States for 2010 and 2015. EPA defined a \"significant contribution\" for ozone nonattainment based on three factors. The EPA defined a \"significant contribution\" for ozone nonattainment based on three factors: the amount of transported pollution, frequency of contributions over thresholds, and comparative contribution to total nonattainment. After evaluating states east of the Mississippi River, 25 states and the District of Columbia were found to make a significant contribution to nonattainment under the CAIR seasonal NOx cap. The EPA determined significant contribution for PM 2.5 nonattainment based on actual and comparative amount of transported pollution. The threshold for significant contribution was set at 0.2 \u00b5g/m3, leading to 23 states and the District of Columbia being projected to contribute significantly to 2010 PM 2.5 nonattainment under CAIR's annual NOx and SO2 caps. EPA determined significant contribution for PM 2.5 nonattainment under CAIR's caps, leading to the development of a cost-effective remedy. EPA concluded that reducing transport of pollution from upwind states is crucial for reaching attainment in many nonattainment areas by 2010. Reducing transported sulfate from upwind SO2 emissions has shown air quality improvement in downwind areas. EPA's conclusions also apply to ozone. EPA's CAIR rulemaking developed criteria for determining \"highly cost-effective\" transport control levels for reducing SO2 and NOx emissions from various sources, including coal-fired electric generators and industrial combustion. Nitrogen oxides primarily come from mobile sources, while sulfur dioxide is mainly emitted by stationary sources. EPA concluded that further regional reductions in emissions were necessary to improve air quality in nonattainment areas. EPA focused on electric generators over 25 MW for emission reduction, deeming control technologies highly cost-effective. Regionwide caps were set assuming these technologies were installed. EPA focused on electric generators over 25 MW for emission reduction, deeming control technologies highly cost-effective. States are not required to adopt an electric-generator-only strategy under the SIP process, but must do so to participate in the EPA-sponsored regional trading program. EPA implemented a regional cap-and-trade program since 1990 to control SO2 emissions under Title IV of the Clean Air Act, limiting its ability to suggest alternative allocation schemes for emission allowances under CAIR. EPA melded CAIR's allocation scheme with the Title IV acid rain program, focusing on electric generators for emission reduction. The Ozone Transport Rule, another regional cap-and-trade program for NOx emissions, was finalized by EPA in 1998 and upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2000. 21 eastern states and the District of Columbia were required to submit state implementation plans to address regional ozone transport. The NOx SIP Call required states to submit plans to reduce ozone transport, focusing on NOx emissions from utilities. EPA set emission budgets for states to follow, allowing flexibility in control measures. A regional cap-and-trade program was encouraged, with participating states agreeing to join. Unlike the SO2 program, CAIR's NOx cap-and-trade scheme differed in budget determination and participant scope. EPA's focus on NOx SIP methodology in CAIR development was evident. EPA's focus on electric generators in the state budget determination for NOx emissions goes against recommendations from OTAG and the NOx SIP Call, which called for controls on various sources. The final NOx SIP Call included emission budgets based on cost-effective reductions from multiple sectors, with significant reductions required from electric generators and nonutility sources. EPA used a 70% reduction requirement for large industrial facilities and RACT control for smaller sources in CAIR. The D.C. Circuit found key challenges to CAIR valid and vacated the entire rule, remanding it to EPA. The court ruled that CAIR's emissions trading program for SO2 and NOx violates CAA Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The court found that the CAIR emissions trading program for SO2 and NOx violates CAA Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) by not ensuring that each state's sources do not \"contribute significantly\" to nonattainment in downwind states. The court invalidated the CAIR emissions trading program for SO2 and NOx for not ensuring states' sources do not \"contribute significantly\" to nonattainment in downwind states. North Carolina successfully argued against CAIR's 2015 deadline for upwind states and the court did not rule on the lawfulness of the NOx Compliance Supplement Pool. The court invalidated the CAIR emissions trading program for SO2 and NOx due to improper budget setting and inconsistency with existing regulations. EPA's use of adjustment factors and reconciliation efforts were deemed arbitrary and capricious. The court found EPA's actions under Title IV unlawful, specifically in regards to CAIR's proposal to remove some allowances from the market. Additionally, the court approved Minnesota Power's argument that EPA had overstated the state's contribution to PM 2.5, requiring a response from EPA on remand. The court did not feel obligated to defer to EPA's views, as the Clean Air Act spoke clearly on many of the issues raised. The court approved Minnesota Power's argument that EPA had overstated the state's contribution to PM 2.5, requiring a response from EPA on remand. In response to the court's decision, EPA requested reconsideration and asked for the CAIR rule to remain in effect while a replacement program was developed. The court allowed the rule to stay in effect, emphasizing the importance of protecting environmental values. EPA began developing a Clean Air Transport Rule to replace CAIR, with the proposed rule in July 2010 and expected finalization by summer. The EPA proposed the Clean Air Transport Rule in July 2010 to replace CAIR, with new limits set for 2012 and 2014. The rule aims to reduce SO2 emissions by 62% below 2005 levels by 2014 in 31 states and DC, allowing unlimited trading within states but limiting interstate trading. The EPA proposed a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to ensure quick implementation of emission budgets for each state based on controlling emissions from electric power plants. States can develop their own plans but the federal plan will take effect until replaced. The proposed transport rule responds to Court decisions by using state-specific data to measure contributions to non-attainment in other states and linking state budgets for SO2 and NOx directly to data measurements. The EPA proposed a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to implement emission budgets for each state based on controlling emissions from power plants. The proposal includes compliance deadlines coordinated with the CAA's deadlines for NAAQS and allows intrastate and limited interstate trading for compliance strategies starting in 2014. This aims to maintain compliance flexibility and cost savings of emissions trading while addressing court concerns. EPA would assess a state's emissions level annually and take action if emissions exceed the budget. The EPA proposed a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to implement emission budgets for each state based on controlling emissions from power plants. If a state's emissions were above the budget due to interstate buying of emission reductions, EPA would investigate and require affected entities to surrender credits. EPA is considering alternative approaches to interstate trading in its proposed rule, expected to be finalized in the summer of 2011. The agency also mentioned an \"ongoing commitment\" to consider upwind pollution contributions when implementing future NAAQS revisions. EPA is finalizing more stringent air quality standards for ozone and PM 2.5 by the end of July 2011. The EPA is finalizing more stringent air quality standards for ozone and PM 2.5 by the end of July 2011. A transport rule is expected to be proposed in the summer of 2011 to address emission reductions needed to meet the new standards. Areas designated nonattainment for ozone and PM 2.5 in the eastern United States face choices of their own. The EPA identified CAIR as a key component of State Implementation Plans to attain the PM 2.5 standard. About half of the SIPs had been submitted by July 2008, with the remainder expected later. The court decision added uncertainty to this process, causing states to reconsider plans already submitted. The EPA also tightened the 1997 standard for PM 2.5, increasing the number of areas in nonattainment. The EPA tightened the 1997 standard for PM 2.5, leading to more areas in nonattainment. States must submit SIPs outlining their strategy for meeting the new 2006 PM NAAQS by April 2012. Some suggest skipping to the 2006 standards due to delays in implementing the 1997 standards. EPA also strengthened the NAAQS for ozone in March 2008, triggering new nonattainment area designations and SIP revisions. The EPA's strategy for complying with PM 2.5 and ozone NAAQS includes provisions to prevent sources from contributing to nonattainment in downwind states. The remand of CAIR could lead to inadequate SIPs in downwind states if they assumed CAIR reductions. Upwind states could also have inadequate SIPs if they don't prevent downwind nonattainment, as required by the Clean Air Act. EPA has made little effort to address this provision in the past. Under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act, states can petition the EPA Administrator to address interstate pollution from major sources violating emission regulations. If out-of-state sources are found to contribute significantly to nonattainment, they may have to shut down unless emission limits are imposed. EPA has never granted such a petition as outlined by the statute. The EPA denied a 2004 Section 126 petition from North Carolina, which challenged the decision in court. Oral argument was scheduled but EPA asked for a remand, which the court agreed to. A decision in favor of North Carolina's petition could lead to more states filing similar petitions. Delaware also petitioned the EPA under Section 126 in December 2008. In 2008, Delaware petitioned the EPA under Section 126 to impose emission controls on electric generating units in nine other states. The remand of CAIR and the vacating of a companion rule targeting mercury have reignited the argument for a multi-pollutant strategy in the electric utility industry, based on consistent emissions caps and trading. Questions arise about the stringency of caps, schedule for introduction, relation to existing CAA provisions, and inclusion of carbon dioxide in control programs. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to impose emission caps on electric utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and mercury. In the 111th Congress, Senator Carper sponsored a bill addressing electric generating unit emissions of pollutants through cap-and-trade programs and technology limits. The Obama Administration and congressional leadership also pursued legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions. Electric generating units account for 40% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. The Clean Air Act does not impose formal penalties on nonattainment areas for failing to attain air quality standards. Instead, it penalizes areas that fail to submit and implement adequate plans identifying emission control measures. Many State Implementation Plans (SIPs) have relied on reductions projected from the implementation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) for EPA approval. EPA has stated that reaching attainment would be difficult without reducing transport to a greater degree over a broader regional area. The EPA is working on a replacement for the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) called the Clean Air Transport Rule to help nonattainment areas reach attainment. The agency is also reconsidering NAAQS for ozone, SO2, and particulate matter, with deadlines for designating nonattainment areas by June 2012. The review of the PM NAAQS is ongoing, with a proposal expected in 2011. The EPA is working on a replacement for the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) called the Clean Air Transport Rule, with implications for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The agency's Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) was vacated in 2008, leaving power plants as the largest uncontrolled source of mercury pollution in the U.S. The EPA sought to avoid imposing MACT on coal-fired power plants by substituting the CAIR and CAMR control programs. The Obama Administration withdrew the petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court and proceeded with the development of MACT standards for electric generating units. The EPA proposed standards in March 2011 for a 91% reduction in uncontrolled mercury emissions from power plants. Section 169A(a)(1) of the CAA aims to prevent impairment to visibility in designated \"class I areas\" and requires certain major stationary sources, including EGUs, to install \"best available retrofit technology\" (BART) if they may contribute to visibility impairment. EPA exempted EGUs under the CAIR trading program from the visibility BART program in 2005. The EPA's CAIR rule is in limbo, causing states to submit proposed SIPs without knowing its fate. EPA found that many states failed to include BART determinations in their regional haze SIPs. The CAIR rule was crucial for achieving ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS, reducing mercury emissions, addressing regional haze impacts, and responding to state petitions under the Clean Air Act. The D.C. Circuit reversed its decision to vacate the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) while EPA develops a replacement rule. The court left the substantive requirements intact, indicating no simple fix for CAIR. EPA has three options: start over with a new strategy, let states address the issue through Section 126 petitions, or seek new legislation for statutory authority. EPA is moving forward with proposing a new Clean Air Transport Rule in April 2010. Congress may consider providing EPA with authority to implement CAIR or other market-oriented approaches for NAAQS. Additionally, Congress could explore multi-pollutant legislation as a supplement or substitute for current regulations, including addressing mercury emissions and climate change."
