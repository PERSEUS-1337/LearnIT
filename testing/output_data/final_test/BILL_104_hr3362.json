The Act allows depository institutions to disclose financial records to state child support enforcement agencies without liability. State agencies can only use the information for establishing, modifying, or enforcing child support obligations. Civil damages may apply for unauthorized disclosure by state officers or employees. If a State officer or employee discloses a financial record of an individual in violation of the Act, the individual can bring a civil action for damages. No liability exists for a good faith misinterpretation of the Act. Damages in such cases may amount to $1,000 for each unauthorized disclosure of a financial record. The Act allows individuals to bring civil action for damages if a State officer or employee discloses their financial record unlawfully. Damages may include actual damages, punitive damages for willful or grossly negligent disclosure, and the costs of the legal action.

In Child Support Orders, procedures are required for coverage of health care costs for children in accordance with state guidelines. Expedited consideration of allegations is also mandated. State guidelines must be established by each State for the coverage of health care costs of children under child support orders, creating a streamlined process as per regulations set by the Secretary. The Secretary shall establish minimum standards for guidelines on covering health care costs of children under child support orders, including order contents, cost responsibility distribution, health insurance provision, claims payment, and parental rights to insurance information. The Secretary will establish guidelines for health insurance coverage for children under child support orders, including denial circumstances, penalties for non-compliance, and considering changes in parents' circumstances. The guidelines will prioritize the child's best interests, parents' financial situations, and cost-effectiveness. Within 9 months of the Act's enactment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must propose regulations for the amendments. Within 14 months, final regulations must be issued. Section 458(b) of the Social Security Act will include dependent health insurance in the Incentive Payments Program due to successful enforcement. The Social Security Act is amended to include successful enforcement of health insurance provisions in support orders as collection of support from absent parents. The amount collected will be determined by the savings to the State from providing health insurance to the children. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will prescribe regulations within 6 months to implement the amendment. A study will be conducted to determine incentives for States to enforce noncustodial parents' obligations to pay for children's health and dental expenses. A report is due within 12 months of the enactment of the Act.

The amendments made by this section of the Act will take effect on the enactment date and apply to wages paid after that date. States requiring legislation to comply with the amendments will not be penalized solely for the lack of legislation.
