    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Appalachian Communities Health Emergency Act\" or the \"ACHE Act\". Communities near mountaintop removal coal mining projects in Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Virginia are concerned about pollution causing health issues. Scientific research shows elevated risks of birth defects and adult hospitalizations associated with mountaintop removal mining. The health risks associated with mountaintop removal coal mining include elevated levels of chronic pulmonary disorders, hypertension, mortality, lung cancer, and chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease in both men and women. Immediate action is needed to halt new permits and increase health monitoring in existing projects while federal agencies investigate the links between health effects and mountaintop removal coal mining. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is leading a working group of Federal health agencies to investigate the health effects of mountaintop removal coal mining. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is conducting studies on the health impacts of mountaintop removal coal mining on surrounding communities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will determine if there are any health risks associated with this mining practice. Additionally, there is a moratorium on mountaintop removal coal mining permits. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must determine if mountaintop removal coal mining poses health risks to surrounding communities before permits can be issued for such projects by federal agencies or states under various environmental laws. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 regulates coal mining activities. SEC. 5. Mountaintop removal coal mining continuous health and environmental monitoring. Until the Secretary of Health and Human Services publishes a determination, any person conducting a mountaintop removal coal mining project must conduct continuous monitoring for pollution of water, air, and soil, submit results to the Secretary monthly, and make them available to the public. The Secretary must make monitoring results of mountaintop removal coal mining projects available to the public online within 7 days. Failure to comply may result in permit denial by relevant authorities. The Secretary must make monitoring results of mountaintop removal coal mining projects available to the public online within 7 days. This can lead to permit denial under specific Acts. SEC. 6. FEE TO PAY FOR HEALTH STUDIES AND MONITORING. The President shall assess and collect a one-time fee from mountaintop removal coal mining projects to cover Federal costs. The fee can only be used for implementing sections 3 and 5. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. This section defines \"mountaintop removal coal mining\" as surface coal mining using explosives in steep slope regions of certain states, and \"steep slope\" as defined in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977."
