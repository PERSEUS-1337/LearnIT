    "content": "The \"Americans Giving Care to Elders (AGE) Act of 2013\" is also known as the \"AGE Act\". It introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, specifically section 25E, which allows for tax credits for eldercare expenses. The \"AGE Act\" introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, specifically section 25E, allowing tax credits for eldercare expenses. The credit is based on the applicable percentage of eldercare expenses paid by an individual with qualifying individuals, with the percentage decreasing as adjusted gross income exceeds $120,000. Expenses related to eldercare are defined as amounts paid for the care of a qualifying individual, such as a parent or ancestor, who needs help with daily activities. These expenses incurred at care centers outside the taxpayer's home must comply with state or local regulations to be considered for tax credits. For eldercare expenses, the care center must provide care for more than six individuals and receive payment for services. The maximum amount of eldercare expenses eligible for tax credit is $6,000 per year. The tax credit for eldercare expenses is subject to reduction by the amount excluded from gross income under section 129. Special rules apply, including no credit for payments to related individuals who are eligible for a deduction for personal exemptions or are children under 19 years old. The term 'taxable year' refers to the taxpayer's year when the service is performed. To claim a credit, identifying information of the service provider must be included on the return. Failure to provide this information will result in disqualification for the credit. The taxpayer must exercise due diligence in providing required information to claim the credit. The taxpayer identification number of qualifying individuals must be included on the return. Married couples must file a joint return to claim the credit. No double benefit is allowed if a credit is already claimed under another section. Regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary to implement this section. The table of sections for subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new item after section 25D. Section 25E allows for expenses related to eldercare. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including changes to sections 213(e) and 6213(g)(2). These amendments apply to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. Extension and increase in funding for the National Family Caregiver Support Program.
