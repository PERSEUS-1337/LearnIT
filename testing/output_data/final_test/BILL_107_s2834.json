    "content": "The Act titled \"Emergency Livestock Assistance Act of 2002\" establishes a Livestock Assistance Program. The Emergency Livestock Assistance Act of 2002 allocates $500,000,000 from the Commodity Credit Corporation for livestock loss payments to producers affected by emergencies in specific counties in 2001 or 2002. Producers can choose to receive payments for either year, not both. Additionally, $12,000,000 is designated for the American Indian Livestock Program. The Secretary will provide assistance under the Emergency Livestock Assistance Act of 2002 in the same manner as specified in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001. The Commodity Credit Corporation will be utilized to implement this assistance. SEC. 3. PAYMENT LIMITATIONS. Section 1001 of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to limit the amount of gains and payments a person may receive during any crop year to $90,000 for loan commodities. This includes gains from repaying marketing assistance loans under the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002. The Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 limits gains and payments to $90,000 for loan commodities, including gains from repaying marketing assistance loans. This includes settlement of loans by forfeiture, loan deficiency payments, and gains from commodity certificates. The Secretary may determine loan commodities eligible for settlement using certificates. A person's gains and payments cannot exceed $90,000 in a crop year, including gains from repaying marketing assistance loans for peanuts, wool, mohair, or honey at a lower rate. Settlement of loans and gains from commodity certificates are included in the limit. The curr_chunk discusses the settlement of marketing assistance loans for peanuts, wool, mohair, or honey through forfeiture or repayment, loan deficiency payments, and gains from commodity certificates issued by the Commodity Credit Corporation. The curr_chunk states that individuals participating in a single farming operation can receive payments or gains covered by the section, but the total amount they can receive in any crop year is limited. The Secretary of Agriculture may issue necessary regulations to implement the Act and its amendments without following certain procedural requirements. Congressional review of agency rulemaking will be conducted under specified authority."
