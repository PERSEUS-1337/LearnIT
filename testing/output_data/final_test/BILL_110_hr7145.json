In the tax code, a deduction is allowed for reforestation expenditures on qualified timber property, defined as land in the US with trees for commercial use. Reforestation expenditures are direct costs incurred for tree planting and care. Reforestation expenditures cover costs for site preparation, seeds or seedlings, labor, and tools. Expenditures reimbursed under governmental cost-sharing programs are not included unless the reimbursement amounts are included in the taxpayer's gross income. Amendments are made to the tax code regarding the deduction for property owned by one person for life with remainder to another person, termination of amortization of reforestation expenditures, and a clerical amendment to the table of sections. Amendments made to the tax code include reforestation expenditures and a sense of Congress regarding biodiversity partnerships. Effective date applies to expenses after enactment of the Act. The sense of Congress is to promote biodiversity partnerships in the United States and abroad, involving businesses and conservation organizations to protect Earth. These partnerships, such as saving sea turtles and their habitats, serve as models for other conservation efforts worldwide. The Government of the United States should encourage more companies and individuals to participate in green enterprise partnerships to protect endangered populations and promote biodiversity worldwide."
