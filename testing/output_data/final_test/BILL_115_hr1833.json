    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Investing in America's Small Businesses Act of 2017\". The Congress acknowledges the historical lack of affordable credit for small businesses in underserved areas. Reports show that inadequate capital is a major constraint for the growth of small firms, especially women- and minority-owned businesses. Small businesses play a vital role in job creation, local tax contributions, and community revitalization. A significant portion of CDFI loan volume goes to borrowers from underserved populations. During the financial crisis, CDFI loan funds expanded to meet increased demand from borrowers unable to access traditional lending. The median fund deployment ratio grew annually by 3.1% from 2006 to 2009. After Superstorm Sandy, CDFIs launched disaster recovery loan programs to help affected businesses and organizations, providing credit to reopen grocery stores and social service organizations for communities in need. A 2014 report by the Dardin School of Business at the University of Virginia found that CDFI banks and credit unions, despite serving low-income markets, performed similarly to mainstream financial institutions. SEC. 123 of the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 introduces grants to establish loan-loss reserve funds for small business lending. The purposes of this section are to provide financial assistance to community development financial institutions for small business loan programs, encourage access to mainstream financial institutions, combat high-cost lending, and expand services to new investment areas and populations. The Fund provides grants to community development financial institutions to establish loan-loss reserve funds for small business loan programs. Institutions must apply for grants and meet matching requirements. The development financial institution must provide non-Federal matching funds equal to 50% of any grant received. The grant amounts can't be used for direct loans to small businesses but can be used to recapture defaulted loans or designate new programs. The Fund provides technical assistance grants to community development financial institutions for small business loan programs, including technology, staff support, and capacity building. Grant amounts can also be used for establishing technical assistance programs. The Administrator requires community development financial institutions to submit grant applications for technical assistance programs. Reports on funded activities and results are submitted annually to relevant committees. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Fund, with $25,000,000 allocated annually for fiscal years 2018 to 2023. An additional $2,000,000 is authorized for administrative costs. Definitions for \"small business\" and \"small business loan program\" are also outlined. The development financial institution offers loans to small businesses not exceeding $50,000 without pre-payment penalties, subject to affordability requirements set by the Administrator. A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents for the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. Grants are provided to establish loan-loss reserve funds for small business lending."
