CO, along with nitrogen and carbon dioxide, is used to preserve freshness and enhance appearance by creating a bright red color that lasts longer. Consumers may rely on the appearance of the meat or fish, influenced by CO, when making purchasing decisions. The use of carbon monoxide (CO) in Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) for meat and fish is debated among the meat industry, consumer groups, scientists, and policy makers. Supporters argue that MAP reduces shrinkage, extends shelf life, keeps meat fresh, and prevents cross-contamination. Some believe MAP offers better flavor, tenderness, and suppresses bacterial growth. Additionally, supporters claim that MAP products are more sustainable, less wasteful, and flexible. Supporters of the use of carbon monoxide in Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) argue that it offers benefits such as extended shelf life, freshness, and prevention of cross-contamination. They also claim that MAP products are more sustainable and preferred by consumers for their bright red color. Opponents, however, raise concerns about misleading consumers, increased health risks, and inadequate freshness indicators like \"sell by\" dates. Opponents of carbon monoxide use in Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) argue that it conceals signs of spoilage and can lead to health risks. They point out that CO is not approved in several countries for fresh meat or fish packaging. Opponents of carbon monoxide use in Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) argue that it conceals signs of spoilage and can lead to health risks. Certain grocery store chains have stopped selling MAP products, while others have taken different steps. The FDA and USDA regulate food safety and additives, with the FDA overseeing food additives and GRAS substances under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The definition of food additive includes substances that may affect the characteristics of food, excluding certain classes of substances like pesticide chemical residues and color additives. Food contact substances are also covered under this definition. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) exempts certain substances from FDA approval as food additives, including substances used before 1958, new animal drugs, dietary ingredients in supplements, and GRAS substances. Safety of GRAS substances is determined by experts to ensure they are not harmful under intended conditions of use. The person seeking GRAS status for a substance must prove it is safe under intended conditions of use. GRAS status can be based on scientific procedures or common use before 1958. Scientific evidence is required to establish the safety of a substance for GRAS determination. The GRAS determination for a substance must be based on scientific evidence to prove its safety under intended conditions of use. FDA regulations do not require a unanimous opinion from the scientific community, but a consensus of expert opinion is necessary. Conflict among experts regarding safety precludes a substance from being considered GRAS. Another type of GRAS substances are those used in food before January 1, 1958, shown to be safe through scientific procedures or common use. FDA regulations define \"common use in food\" as a history of consumption by consumers. GRAS determinations rely on generally available data. Prior-sanctioned substances used before January 1, 1958, outside the US must have proven safety. The FDA lists some GRAS substances in 21 C.F.R. Part 182, including spices and natural extracts. The list of GRAS substances in 21 C.F.R. Part 182 includes spices, essential oils, natural extracts, synthetic flavoring substances, substances from food packaging, anticaking agents, preservatives, emulsifying agents, stabilizers, sequestrants, and nutrients. The FDA Commissioner can affirm GRAS status based on a petition or initiative. Substances affirmed as GRAS in Part 184 differ as their status is sustained through rulemaking. The concept began in 1969 due to safety concerns. Affirmation of GRAS status occurs through notice and comment rulemaking. The FDA affirms GRAS status through the notice and comment rulemaking process, evaluating comments and evidence before adding the substance to the list in the Code of Federal Regulations. The FDA affirms GRAS status for direct and indirect food substances through the rulemaking process. Part 184 lists direct food substances as GRAS under specified conditions, while Part 186 lists indirect food substances like wrappers and containers. The final rule may contain limits on the application and use of the substance. The FDA affirms GRAS status for food substances through the rulemaking process, specifying conditions for direct and indirect substances. The affirmed substance must be used according to good manufacturing practices and limited conditions of use. Using the ingredient in a different manner requires independent verification of GRAS status or compliance with food additive regulations. Combining GRAS ingredients for the same effect is prohibited to prevent consumer deception or violations. The FDA proposed a rule in 1997 to change the process for substances affirmed as GRAS, eliminating the notice and comment rulemaking process and creating a new notification procedure. Despite the ongoing notice and comment rulemaking process, the FDA has been using the new notification procedure since 1998 without issuing a final rule. It is important to note that the FDA's procedure from 1997 is only guidance, not law, and the agency has provided industry guidance on GRAS through frequently asked questions. The FDA introduced a new notification procedure in 1997 for GRAS substances, with over 250 notifications submitted. Industry submits a notification stating the substance is GRAS, including details on the notifier, substance, conditions of use, and basis for the determination. The notifier takes responsibility for the GRAS determination. The 1997 proposed rule for GRAS substances shifts responsibility for determination from the FDA to the notifier. The FDA does not affirm GRAS status but states no questions, lack of basis, or notifier withdrawal. If the notification lacks sufficient information, the FDA will respond accordingly. The FDA may question the GRAS status of a substance if the information provided does not establish safety, lacks expert consensus, or is poorly presented. The agency may also have additional information that raises public health concerns. Notifiers receive a response documenting the agency's awareness of the GRAS determination. The FDA's response to GRAS notification submissions does not equate to approval of the substance as GRAS. A \"no questions\" response may give a sense of safety and confidence to manufacturers, but it does not mean the FDA has deemed the substance as GRAS. The FDA's response of \"no questions\" to GRAS notification submissions may reduce uncertainty for manufacturers using the substance. The agency has accepted over 250 notifications under interim policy until the final rule is published. The FDA's new GRAS notification process is being evaluated for potential modifications based on its administration of notices. The agency has accepted over 250 notifications under interim policy, with a chart showing the number of FDA response letters in different categories. One notification was counted twice due to the FDA having no questions but stating the notice did not provide a basis for a GRAS determination. The FDA responded to GRAS notifications for various substances, accepting some like Chrysanthemum, Licorice, and Jellywort, but not approving others such as Honeysuckle, Lophatherum, and Mulberry leaf. Resubmitted notifications were only included for substances like tasteless smoke from Hawaii International Seafood, Inc. Out of 18 resubmitted notifications, the FDA had no questions for some. The FDA shares food safety responsibility with the USDA. The USDA regulates meat and poultry safety, providing a mark of inspection for approved products. Approval for additive substances in meat and poultry involves a two-step process. The FDA and USDA share food safety responsibilities, with the USDA regulating meat and poultry safety. Approval for additive substances in meat and poultry products involves a two-step process: FDA determines substance safety and conditions of use, while FSIS approves substance applications. This process was outlined in a 2000 Memorandum of Understanding, which provides standard procedures for submissions to FDA or FSIS for approval of additives in meat and poultry products. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) outlines the process for reviewing substances used in meat or poultry products. It requires agencies to consult each other when determining the safety and suitability of substances. If FDA receives a request regarding a substance, it consults with FSIS, and vice versa. This collaboration also applies to GRAS Notices for substances used in meat or poultry products. FDA consults with FSIS regarding the use of substances in meat or poultry products. FSIS provides written comments within 60 days, including any concerns or recommended restrictions. Approval of a substance for use in food does not automatically apply to meat and poultry products, requiring a separate affirmation from FDA. FSIS requires an affirmative statement from FDA regarding the use of substances in meat or poultry products to determine suitability and the need for rulemaking. Suitability is based on the substance's effectiveness at the lowest necessary level without adulterating the product or misleading customers. FSIS needs specific data to demonstrate the substance's effectiveness and appropriate use. FSIS regulations require data to show that the use of substances in meat or poultry products is at the lowest necessary level to achieve the intended effect without adulteration or misbranding. Approval is needed for substances intended to impart color, and FSIS can permit their use based on provided data. If FDA confirms the substance's safety, FSIS may allow its use without the need for rulemaking. FSIS regulations may require amendments if a substance is prohibited or not normally found in the product. If rulemaking is necessary, the substance is added to the approved list after the formal process. Approved substances not listed in regulations are maintained in a directive system on the FSIS website. Determination of a substance as GRAS can be made by FDA affirmation or industry based on scientific evidence. The GRAS status of a substance can be determined by FDA affirmation or industry based on scientific evidence. FSIS regulations require FDA approval for substances used in meat and poultry products to ensure safety. Manufacturers have submitted GRAS notifications for carbon monoxide, with FDA stating no objections to its GRAS status. The FDA has confirmed that carbon monoxide is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for use in preserving the color, taste, aroma, and texture of raw seafood. Hawaii International Seafood, Inc. submitted a GRAS notification for the use of \"tasteless smoke\" containing carbon monoxide. The FDA has no questions about this use but emphasized the company's responsibility to ensure safety and compliance with regulations. The FDA confirmed that carbon monoxide is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for preserving the color of meat. The agency noted that while CO helps maintain a red color during storage, the meat's color deteriorates once removed. FSIS agreed that using carbon monoxide in the MAP system for packaging red meat cuts and ground meat is acceptable. FSIS and FDA confirmed carbon monoxide is GRAS for preserving meat color. FDA had no questions on industry's determination in 2004 and 2005. Two GRAS notifications pending for CO. Manufacturers could potentially use CO in other ways based on FDA's response. Two CO GRAS notices, 83 and 143, mention a 0.4 percent CO level in a MAP system. Using a higher CO level like 0.45 percent could lead to FDA penalties for FFDCA violations. Bills in the House address carbon monoxide use in meat and poultry products. The Food and Drug Administration Globalization Act of 2008, along with other bills, address the use of carbon monoxide in meat, poultry, and seafood products intended for human consumption. Proposed amendments to FFDCA would require carbon monoxide to be treated as a color additive unless properly labeled to inform consumers of its use. The Secretary of Health and Human Services would have the authority to establish alternative labeling. The discussion draft proposes alternative labeling requirements for substances deemed no longer necessary to prevent consumer deception by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Additionally, it includes a provision for GRAS determinations, requiring the Secretary to publish notices of requests for substances to be determined as GRAS within 90 days. The FDA Commissioner must publish a notice of a petition affirming the GRAS status of a substance within 30 days. A 60-day comment period follows, and if convincing evidence is provided, the substance will be listed as GRAS. Otherwise, it may be considered a food additive."
