    "content": "The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), managed by the Department of State (DOS), resettles refugees in the United States based on persecution or fear of persecution. The program determines where refugees will be resettled through the Reception and Placement Program (R&P). The placement of refugees, particularly Syrians, has sparked controversy, with some states trying to block Syrian refugee resettlement. In 2017, President Trump issued an executive order supporting greater state and local government involvement in refugee placement. The Refugee Act of 1980 established a process for refugee admissions and federal assistance for resettlement, including the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services. The Refugee Act of 1980 established the Reception and Placement Program for initial resettlement of refugees in the United States, administered by the Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. Nonprofit organizations provide services under this program through a cooperative agreement with PRM. The Reception and Placement Program provides services to refugees, including pre-arrival placement, basic needs support for at least 30 days, and help accessing health, employment, and education services. Decisions on resettlement are made at weekly meetings, with agencies agreeing to provide required services. Refugees with relatives or friends in the US are likely to be resettled near them. Refugees with U.S. ties are placed near relatives or friends, within 100 miles and the same state as the local affiliate providing services. Those without ties must be placed within 50 miles and the same state as their affiliate. Refugee arrivals have been placed in every state except Wyoming in FY2017. Refugees can freely relocate within the U.S., known as secondary migration. The INA provisions on refugee resettlement assistance require consultation with state and local governments and nonprofit agencies for refugee distribution. Policies are developed to ensure refugees are not placed in highly impacted areas unless they have close family there. Local affiliates of resettlement agencies coordinate placement with state and local governments. The Refugee Resettlement Program requires consultation with state and local governments to plan the placement of refugees based on factors like employment, housing, and self-sufficiency. Agencies must consider recommendations from states and provide data on their affiliates when submitting proposals. The proposals require documented local affiliate ability to provide quality reception and placement services for arriving refugees of diverse backgrounds, evidence of community support, and significant private contributions to the program. For new resettlement sites, applicants must consult with stakeholders and provide rationale for the community consultations. Participation in the R&P Program requires representation from various offices including state refugee and health coordinators, local governance, public health, welfare, social services, and education. Consultations must discuss program size, stakeholder capabilities, and the ability to serve refugees. Resettlement services are provided by local affiliates of participating agencies, with special arrangements possible for refugees with family ties. The R&P Program can make exceptions for remote placement cases where refugees have family or friends over 100 miles from the nearest affiliate. Wyoming and Mississippi have no local affiliates but can still resettle refugees through this process. Resettlement agencies use a combination of R&P funds and other contributions for initial services. Funding details are shown in Table 1. For FY2017, the per-refugee grant is $2,075, with $1,125 designated for direct support of refugees and $950 for the local affiliate's staff and infrastructure. The table displays the number of refugee arrivals in each state from 2011 to 2017, excluding total refugee populations. Total admissions to the US are represented in each year."
