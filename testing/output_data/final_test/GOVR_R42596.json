    "content": "The Agriculture appropriations bill funds various agencies including the USDA, FDA, and CFTC. Decision making mainly focuses on discretionary spending. House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have jurisdiction over the bill. The House and Senate reported bills for FY2013 Agriculture appropriations, with the Senate moving first and the House following. FY2013 began under a continuing resolution that funds operations at FY2012 levels. Stand-alone Agriculture appropriations bills were enacted five times in the past 14 years. In FY2013, the Senate Appropriations committee approved the Agriculture appropriations bill by a vote of 28-1 on April 26, 2012, using an expedited procedure. This procedure has been in use since FY2009. The Senate-approved Agriculture appropriations bill for FY2013 increased discretionary funding to $20.8 billion, a 6.2% rise from FY2012 levels. Key increases were seen in domestic nutrition programs, agricultural research, rural development, FDA, and the Farm Service Agency, while reductions were made in rescissions and limits on mandatory programs. The House Appropriations Committee reported the FY2013 Agriculture appropriations bill with a cut of $365 million from FY2012 levels. The bill aimed to reduce discretionary Agriculture appropriations to $19.4 billion, primarily by decreasing rural development funding. The House FY2013 Agriculture appropriations bill differed from FY2012 and the Senate bill by decreasing funding for various programs, while increasing funding for domestic nutrition programs. The House FY2013 Agriculture appropriations bill proposed cuts in funding for various programs, while increasing funding for domestic nutrition programs. The bill also included policy provisions such as removing a livestock and poultry marketing rule, tightening farm commodity program payment limits, and requiring USDA to allow white potatoes for the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) feeding program. The Administration opposed the cuts, particularly to CFTC, rural development, renewable energy, domestic nutrition, food safety, and international food aid. Discretionary Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010, with mandatory nutrition spending continuing to rise. The Agriculture appropriations bill for FY2013 in H.R. 5973 and S. 2375 includes mandatory and discretionary spending. Mandatory appropriations make up 85% of the total, with a 10-year average annual growth rate of +7.9%. Discretionary appropriations have a +0.8% average annual growth rate. Total nutrition spending has increased at an average rate of about +9.8% over the past 10 years. Total nutrition spending has increased at an average rate of about +9.8% per year over the past 10 years, compared to a +0.3% average annual change for the rest of the bill. Nutrition spending has increased even faster in the more recent five-year period. Figures and tables in the Agriculture appropriations bill show the growth rates and inflation-adjusted amounts. Total Agriculture appropriations have shown positive \"real\" growth, with an average annual real rate of about +4.2% over the past 10 years. Nutrition programs have increased at an average annual real rate of +7.4%, while the \"rest of the bill\" has shown a -1.9% average annual real decline over the same period. Mandatory spending has shown positive real growth, while discretionary spending has remained flat to slightly declining. The Agriculture bill's share of the federal budget declined from 4.4% in FY1995 to 2.7% in FY2009, before rising to nearly 3.9% in FY2013. The share for nutrition programs declined from 2.6% in FY1995 to 1.8% in FY2008, but rose to 2.9% in FY2013 due to the recent recession. The share for the rest of the bill declined from 1.8% in FY1995. Total Agriculture appropriations have risen slightly over the past two decades, with a steady increase in nutrition programs and a decline in non-nutrition agricultural programs. Per capita, inflation-adjusted total Agriculture appropriations have increased from $350 in 1995 to $435 in 2013, while nutrition programs have risen from $214 to $330 per capita over the same period. The FY2013 Agriculture appropriations bills in the 112th Congress included rescissions and limitations on mandatory farm bill programs, totaling about $1.5 billion in the House bill and $1 billion in the Senate bill. These actions were considered savings and helped meet discretionary budget allocations, providing more to regular discretionary accounts. These reductions grew in importance in the FY2011 appropriation, which required a large discretionary cut from the previous year. In FY2011, a $1.7 billion increase in farm bill limitations and rescissions contributed to a $3.4 billion reduction in discretionary appropriations. Appropriators have placed limitations on mandatory spending authorized in the farm bill, known as CHIMPS, to achieve savings and meet budget allocations. This action does not change the authorizing law but puts limits on mandatory programs using appropriations language. In 2008, a new farm bill increased mandatory funds for programs, some of which were reduced by appropriators or the Administration due to policy preferences or jurisdictional issues. The division over funding certain agriculture programs between appropriators and authorizers dates back to the 1930s. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was created to fund farm commodity programs, which were difficult to budget and based on multi-year programs. In the early 2000s, tension arose over using mandatory funds for programs that were traditionally discretionary, leading to a debate between authorizers and appropriators over funding responsibilities. Some question whether the CCC should be used for programs that are not highly variable. The CHIMPS affect conservation, rural development, bioenergy, and smaller nutrition assistance programs, not farm commodity or primary nutrition assistance programs like SNAP. In FY2013, the House bill had $1.052 billion reductions from 10 mandatory programs, and the Senate had $649 million reductions from five mandatory programs. Rescissions permanently cancel funds from previous appropriations laws to achieve budgetary savings. In FY2013, proposed rescissions totaled $484 million in the House bill and $330 million in the Senate bill, with the House bill amount similar to FY2012 but the Senate bill less than the previous year. FY2011 saw unusually large rescissions totaling about $925 million, compared to the typical range of $100 million to $500 million. Rescissions are funds still available for specific purposes appropriated a year or more ago, often resulting from cancelling unobligated budget authority. In FY2011, there were unusually large rescissions totaling about $925 million, compared to the typical range of $100 million to $500 million. The high level was difficult to repeat in FY2012 and FY2013 due to one-time savings from cancelling unobligated balances. Tables in the Agriculture appropriations bill provide detail on domestic food assistance programs, farm loan program amounts, agricultural research, food safety appropriations, and rural development appropriations. USDA carries out a wide range of activities related to appropriations bills. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has various responsibilities divided into mission areas, with food and nutrition programs being the largest. Farm and foreign agricultural services make up the second-largest mission area. USDA spending is not solely for farm programs, and agriculture appropriations do not completely align with USDA spending. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has various mission areas, with food and nutrition programs being the largest. Farm and foreign agricultural services make up the second-largest area. USDA's organization and budget data may not always align with the Agriculture appropriations bill in Congress. The Forest Service is a significant part of USDA's natural resources mission area, funded through the Interior appropriations bill. It accounts for about one-third of USDA's personnel. Funding for conservation programs in the appropriations bill is discretionary, while mandatory funding is included in the Commodity Credit Corporation. The non-Forest Service part of USDA's natural resources mission area includes both discretionary and mandatory conservation programs. The Agriculture appropriations subcommittees have jurisdiction over appropriations for the FDA and CFTC. The combined share of FDA and CFTC funding in the Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill is about 2%. Jurisdiction over CFTC appropriations is assigned differently in the House and Senate, alternating each year. In odd-numbered fiscal years, the CFTC is included in the Financial Services appropriations act, while the FDA and CFTC are part of the Agriculture appropriations bill due to their historical ties to agricultural markets. Despite the increasing focus on non-agricultural issues, agriculture and food issues remain significant at both agencies. Recent concerns include food safety responsibilities at the FDA and volatility in agricultural commodity markets at the CFTC. Discretionary and mandatory spending are handled differently in the budget process. In the budget process, discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts, while mandatory programs have eligibility requirements written into authorizing laws. In FY2012, 15% of the Agriculture appropriations bill was for discretionary programs, with the remaining 85% classified as mandatory. Most agency operations are financed with discretionary funds, including conservation programs, rural development programs, research and education programs, agricultural credit programs, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The USDA's mandatory spending includes food and nutrition programs like SNAP and child nutrition, farm commodity programs, crop insurance, and agricultural conservation and trade programs. Mandatory spending is influenced by program participation rates, economic conditions, and weather patterns, with formulas set in the 2008 farm bill. Mandatory spending, including nutrition benefits like SNAP and child nutrition, is governed by the Congressional Budget Office baseline. SNAP is an \"appropriated entitlement\" requiring annual appropriation, while the Commodity Credit Corporation operates on a line of credit with annual appropriations. Budget authority is the amount of money Congress allows a federal agency to spend, representing a funding limit. Obligations are the funds agencies commit to spending, while outlays are the actual money flowing out of an agency's account. These terms are crucial for understanding federal spending discussions. Program level is the sum of activities supported by an agency, which may exceed budget authority due to user fees, loans, transfers, or carryover funds from prior years."
