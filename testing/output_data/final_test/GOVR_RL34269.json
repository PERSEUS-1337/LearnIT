Courts have emphasized the importance of minority ownership in media rules. The FCC is required to consider the impact of its ownership rules on minority ownership. In 2009, the FCC sought comments on improving data on minority and female ownership of broadcast properties. This data will help the FCC determine the effectiveness of programs to increase minority ownership. The FCC and Congress support diversity in broadcast station ownership, especially for minorities and females. Two bills in the 110th Congress aimed to revive a tax incentive for businesses acquiring telecommunications properties. Programs to increase minority ownership may need to be narrowly structured to survive judicial challenges. From 1978 to 1995, the FCC operated a tax certificate program to aid minority-owned businesses in acquiring broadcast properties. The FCC operated a tax certificate program from 1978 to 1995 to aid minority-owned businesses in acquiring broadcast properties. In 1995, Congress questioned aspects of the program when Viacom structured a deal to sell a large portion of its broadcast property to a minority-owned business to defer taxes on capital gains. Congress expressed concerns about potential abuse of the program due to lack of limits on the amount of gain that could be deferred. Congress repealed IRC \u00a71071 due to concerns about the effectiveness of tax incentives for minority ownership of broadcast stations. The FCC's \"distress sale\" policy, aimed at promoting minority ownership, has seen a decline in usage since the Adarand Construction v. Pe\u00f1a Supreme Court ruling raised legal challenges. The FCC issued a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SFNPR) in 2007 to amend Broadcast Ownership Rules, including proposals for defining Socially Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs). New rules were adopted in 2007 to promote diversification of broadcast ownership, defining eligible entities based on Small Business Administration standards without considering race or gender. Further comments are being sought on this definition. The FCC is seeking further comment on expanding the definition of \"eligible entity\" to improve data on minority and female ownership of broadcast properties. The agency may use this data to develop programs to encourage ownership by minorities and women, but any race-based programs will be subject to strict scrutiny as per the Supreme Court's decision in Adarand Construction v. Pe\u00f1a in 1995. The Supreme Court's decision in Adarand requires any government action that classifies individuals based on race to withstand strict scrutiny. This level of review demands that the government prove the necessity of the measure to achieve a compelling interest and that it is narrowly tailored. Such actions are considered suspect and must protect individuals, not groups, from discrimination based on race. Based on Adarand, any law or regulation classifying individuals by race for eligibility must meet strict scrutiny. The government's interest in promoting broadcast diversity through tax provisions and FCC programs is to ensure a variety of voices and viewpoints, essential for democracy and protected by the First Amendment. The government's interest in promoting broadcast diversity through tax provisions and FCC programs is to ensure a variety of voices and viewpoints, essential for democracy and protected by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has debated whether this interest is compelling enough to survive strict scrutiny, as seen in cases like Metro Broadcasting v. FCC. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of promoting diversity of viewpoints on the broadcast airwaves, stating that it is essential for the welfare of the public. The Court highlighted the government's duty to distribute the electromagnetic spectrum to encourage a wide array of information sources and viewpoints, safeguarding the public's right to receive diverse programming. This was the basis for minority ownership policies in the Metro Broadcasting case. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of promoting diversity of viewpoints on the broadcast airwaves, stating that it is essential for the welfare of the public. Metro Broadcasting can provide guidance on arguments for broadcast viewpoint diversity as a compelling government interest, but deeper analysis is needed to determine if it can withstand strict scrutiny. Justice O'Connor acknowledged the persistence of racial discrimination and the government's ability to act in response to it, suggesting that racial classifications may be permissible to remedy past discrimination. The dissent in Metro Broadcasting argued that only remedial classifications to remedy past discrimination would survive strict scrutiny, but recent decisions have shown that diversity within a student body can also be a compelling interest. The Court in Grutter v. Bollinger determined that student body diversity is a compelling government interest, relying on Justice Powell's opinion in Regents of University of California v. Bakke. Powell argued that diverse viewpoints enhance the learning experience and are essential for the fulfillment of a university's mission. The Court accorded deference to the University administration in selecting a diverse student body, stating that it is central to the school's institutional mission. The Court in Grutter v. Bollinger determined that student body diversity is a compelling government interest, emphasizing the importance of diverse viewpoints for the educational mission. The Court accorded deference to the university's judgment in creating a diverse student body, citing the benefits supported by evidence. The interest in student body diversity was compared to the interest in diversity in broadcast programming, both rooted in First Amendment principles promoting the exchange of ideas and serving public education and freedom of speech. The government must prove that broadcast diversity is a compelling interest, necessary, and narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The Supreme Court has not set parameters for a narrowly tailored program in this context, but examples from other contexts and the Court's analysis in Metro Broadcasting may provide guidance. The government must show that diversity of broadcast ownership is necessary to increase diversity of broadcast viewpoint. The Court found that increased diversity of broadcast property ownership is substantially related to increased diversity of broadcast programming. The dissenting Justices in Metro Broadcasting questioned the necessity of minority ownership in increasing diversity of broadcast programming, arguing that there was no evidence to support the idea that minority-owned stations provide unique viewpoints. They criticized the assumption that stations owned by minorities offer desired perspectives, while others do not. The dissenters believed that the FCC was restricted by Congress from examining the factual basis for the link between broadcast programming diversity and ownership diversity. The dissenting Justices in Metro Broadcasting questioned the necessity of minority ownership in increasing diversity of broadcast programming, arguing that there was weak evidence to support the link between ownership diversity and programming diversity. They suggested a closer examination of the factual basis supporting minority ownership policies to establish their necessity for increasing broadcast diversity. The government must demonstrate that diversity of broadcast station ownership leads to diversity of broadcast viewpoint and consider race-neutral alternatives before adopting policies. If ownership diversity is deemed necessary, the government must prove that the program encouraging it is narrowly tailored to achieve the stated interest. In considering diversity of broadcast station ownership, the government must prove that any program promoting it is narrowly tailored to achieve the stated interest. The dissent in Metro Broadcasting criticized policies that solely benefited certain minorities, calling them \"a 100% set aside\" that imposed impermissible burdens on non-minorities. Quotas or set asides with rigid numeric goals for including specific racial groups have been struck down by the Supreme Court in school admissions cases. In Grutter, the Supreme Court provided guidance on permissible school admissions policies using race as a factor, allowing individualized consideration of race for diversity without strict quotas. Race is just one factor among many considered for student body diversity. The Court's determination in Grutter assuaged constitutional concerns by evaluating applicants based on individual contributions to diversity, not solely on group membership. When promoting diversity in broadcast ownership, a court may uphold a program considering race as one factor among many for viewpoint diversity. Durational limits and existing diverse programming in markets should also be considered in designing a narrowly tailored program using race as a factor. In promoting diversity in broadcast ownership, durational limits and periodic reviews may be necessary to ensure that racial preferences remain justified. Such controls could be essential components of new minority ownership programs enacted by Congress or the FCC."
