SENSE-S is a novel skip-gram based mechanism for learning vector embeddings of single graph nodes, improving accuracy in classification and link-prediction tasks. Building on SENSE-S, the generic SENSE method efficiently computes composite vectors for node sequences, preserving node order and demonstrating high accuracy in real data experiments. Accurately learning vector embeddings for a sequence of nodes in a graph is crucial for various applications. The SENSE-S method efficiently computes composite vectors for node sequences, preserving node order and demonstrating high accuracy in real data experiments. Learning embeddings for individual nodes and composing them to represent sequences in a graph is crucial for various applications. Many algorithms focus on single node embeddings, but there is a need for representations that capture the correlation between nodes both functionally and structurally. Learning embeddings for individual nodes and composing them to represent sequences in a graph is crucial for various applications. Representations that capture both textual descriptions and the underlying graph structure simultaneously are beneficial for tasks like node classification and product recommendations. Despite the importance in applications like workflow composability, there is generally a lack of efficient solutions for sequences greater than length 1. Concatenating or adding all involved node vectors may take up too much space or lose sequence information, rendering them unable to efficiently address the issue. We propose a neural-network-based model called SENSE-S for learning node sequence embeddings by combining textual descriptions and graph structure efficiently. Existing works either address these objectives separately or do not co-learn text and graph patterns effectively. Our model aims to answer how to combine these objectives and what framework to use for feature learning. SENSE-S is a model for computing vector representations of nodes in a graph by incorporating semantic information. It utilizes skip-gram models but differs in how neighboring words and nodes are sampled simultaneously. The joint optimization of text and graph inputs improves convergence speed. Evaluation on Wikispeedia shows a 50% increase in multi-label classification accuracy. The SENSE-S model improves multi-label classification accuracy by up to 50% and link prediction accuracy by up to 78% over the state-of-the-art. SENSE is proposed for general feature representation of a sequence of nodes, addressing challenges such as sequence representation, compactness, and deciphering functional nodes and their order. Efficient schemes are developed using vector cyclic shifting to combine individual vectors into complex sequence vectors. The sequence embedding method is evaluated on Wikispeedia and Physics Citation datasets, showing close to 100% accuracy in decoding node sequences with large vector dimensions. Related works include learning vector representation from text and graphs, with neural-network-based schemes outperforming n-gram techniques in learning word similarities. Research has focused on learning graph representations by translating graphs into word sets. Models like node2vec and Subgraph2vec advance graph embedding techniques by incorporating edge weight and direction information. Techniques like representing graph sequences with random binary vectors have also been proposed. This work falls under node embedding in graphs with auxiliary information, where nodes are associated with labels. In contrast to previous works focusing on graph embedding with information or network constraints, BID32, BID36, and Wang & Li (2016) explore embedding strategies in knowledge graphs to maintain entity relationships. EP BID3 and GraphSAGE BID6 learn embeddings for structured graph data, while Planetoid and metapath2vec BID2 focus on node embeddings in semi-supervised and heterogeneous network settings. Graph-Neural-Network-based embeddings are also investigated in BID11. Graph-Neural-Network-based embeddings are explored in BID11 and BID17. However, unlike SENSE, other related works do not consider the relative context of words within the document. PLANE aims to maximize the likelihood of similar embeddings for neighboring nodes but relies on strong assumptions of statistical distributions. In contrast, our proposed embedding scheme considers both network topology and semantic information of nodes. The SENSE-S method embeds single nodes in a graph by learning node representations and textual descriptions simultaneously. Each node in the graph is associated with a text description, and the goal is to capture both graphical and textual properties in the feature vector for each node. This is achieved by considering neighboring nodes and words in the text description using specific sampling strategies. The SENSE-S method aims to embed single nodes in a graph by learning node representations and textual descriptions simultaneously. It utilizes a skip-gram model to capture both graphical and textual properties by considering neighboring nodes and words in the text description. The goal is to find a function that maximizes the relationship between node and word neighborhoods in the graph and text. The SENSE-S method embeds single nodes in a graph by learning node representations and textual descriptions simultaneously. It uses a skip-gram model to capture graphical and textual properties by predicting neighboring nodes or words in the text description. The model is formulated as a neural network with input as a two-tuple (word \u03c6, node v) mapped to one-hot vectors. The SENSE-S method embeds single nodes in a graph by learning node representations and textual descriptions simultaneously using a skip-gram model. It formulates a neural network with input as a two-tuple (word \u03c6, node v) mapped to one-hot vectors. The model involves multiplying \u03c6 T and v T by matrices M w\u00d7d and M n\u00d7d in the first layer, adding the resulting vectors, and multiplying by another matrix M d\u00d7(w+n) in the second layer to obtain a vector h. This vector is decomposed into two sub-vectors, h 1 and h 2, which are fed to separate softmax functions to represent the probability vector of neighboring words of \u03c6. The SENSE-S method utilizes neural network architecture to learn node embeddings by maximizing probabilities of neighboring words in textual descriptions and neighboring nodes in the graph. It combines textual and graphical inputs to enhance learning, with an add operation for feature combination, resulting in the unique SENSE-S (add) model. The SENSE-S model, also known as SENSE-S (add), combines textual and graphical inputs using an add operation for feature combination. It focuses on computing semantically enhanced embeddings for individual nodes and proposes a general SENSE method to represent any set of nodes in a specified order. This method generates node sequence embeddings using node vectors from SENSE-S. Node sequence S can be represented by a matrix with vector representations of nodes. A low-dimensional vector representation is sought to preserve node properties and order. Node vectors are unit vectors obtained through SENSE-S, with positional encoding applied for node sequence vector construction. Node sequence vectors are created using positional encoding with a cyclic shift function to preserve node properties and order. This approach ensures that the dimension of the vectors remains the same as the original node vectors and allows for inference of which nodes are included and their positions within the sequence. Node sequence vector decoding utilizes cyclic shifting to determine the position of a node in a sequence. Claim 1 states that the inner product between the node sequence vector and a node vector can efficiently decode the node's position. This method has a quadratic complexity of O(d^2) and allows for easy identification of nodes within a sequence. The inner product of cyclic shifted vectors helps determine node positions in a sequence. Theoretical results support Claim 1, with proofs in the appendix. Evaluation of SENSE is done on various datasets, including Wikispeedia (2009) with graph information and textual descriptions. The curr_chunk discusses a directed graph with nodes representing Wikipedia articles and hyperlinks, as well as a citation network with papers and citations. It explains the training of the SENSE-S model using a defined loss function and stochastic gradient descent. The text also mentions updating model parameters and the frequency of node neighborhood sampling. The curr_chunk discusses injecting more input data of nodes' graphical neighborhood information by adjusting the model parameter update rule. It evaluates SENSE-S against baseline solutions using node2vec for graph information and paragraph2vec for textual information. The curr_chunk introduces concatenation operations at the hidden layer for joint text/graph learning, comparing different initialization methods using node2vec and paragraph2vec. It explores iterative vectorization to capture both semantic and graphical vectors iteratively. In this study, the researchers explore concatenation operations for joint text/graph learning using node2vec and paragraph2vec. They use iterative vectorization to capture semantic and graphical vectors iteratively. The final node embeddings are obtained by concatenating vectors from paragraph2vec and node2vec. The experimental setup involves learning vector representations for multi-label classification tasks on Wikipedia pages. The researchers use node2vec and paragraph2vec for joint text/graph learning, concatenating vectors for final node embeddings. They train OneVsRestClassifier for multi-label classification on Wikipedia pages and evaluate link prediction on the Citation Network. The researchers utilized node2vec and paragraph2vec for joint text/graph learning, training an SVM classifier for link prediction. Parameter settings included performing random walks, using a sliding window for word sampling, and selecting node vector dimensions. Error rates for multi-label classification and link prediction were determined based on the test set. Among schemes combining textual and graphical information, SENSE-S (add) and SENSE-S (concat) perform the best by co-learning both types of data. SENSE-S (add) outperforms node2vec by 40%, paragraph2vec by 55%, and other baseline schemes by 30% in link prediction. The results confirm the advantages of co-learning features from text and graph data under the SENSE-S architecture. SENSE-S (add) and (cat) are robust and can effectively extract useful information from text descriptions to reduce link prediction errors, demonstrating the effectiveness of SENSE-S in various scenarios. SENSE-S is evaluated for accuracy in encoding/decoding node sequences in three experiments: random selection from Wikispeedia nodes, random walks on Wikispeedia graph, and random walks on Physics Citation Network. Vector representations are computed for the constructed node sequences by SENSE-S. The SENSE-S algorithm computes vector representations for node sequences and evaluates decoding accuracy under different conditions. Longer node sequences and smaller vector dimensions lead to decreased decoding accuracy due to correlations between node vectors. However, with larger vector dimensions, even long sequences can be decoded accurately. The SENSE-S algorithm computes vector representations for node sequences and evaluates decoding accuracy under different conditions. It shows that even if node sequences are constructed from correlated node vectors, decoding still achieves high accuracy. The decoding algorithm successfully matches nodes from large networks with theoretical guarantees. SENSE-S improves multi-label classification accuracy in Wikispeedia dataset by up to 50% and link prediction over Physics Citation network by up to 78%. SENSE can represent node sequences with high accuracy using composite vectors. Since x and y are unit vectors, x \u00b7 y = cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between them. Since x and y are not correlated and uniformly distributed across the sphere surface, E[x \u00b7 y] = 0."
