    "content": "The \"Inflation Tax Relief Act of 1993\" allows for indexing of certain assets to determine gain or loss for tax purposes. The \"Inflation Tax Relief Act of 1993\" allows for indexing of assets held for more than 1 year when sold or disposed of, substituting the indexed basis for adjusted basis. Depreciation deductions are determined without this substitution. Indexed assets include stock in a corporation and tangible property used in trade or business. The term 'indexed asset' excludes certain types of property, such as creditor's interests, options, net lease property, certain preferred stock, and stock in foreign corporations. The exception for stock in a foreign corporation listed on national or regional exchanges does not apply to certain types of stock. The indexed basis for any asset is the adjusted basis of the asset multiplied by certain factors. The adjusted basis of an asset is multiplied by the applicable inflation ratio, which is determined by dividing the gross national product deflator for the quarter of disposition by the deflator for the quarter the asset was acquired. The inflation ratio must be greater than 1 and is rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a percent. The gross national product deflator is used to adjust the basis of assets for inflation. Special rules apply, such as treating certain improvements or contributions as separate assets. The applicable inflation ratio is reduced for assets that are not indexed assets throughout the holding period. Short sales of substantially identical property are treated as not indexed assets. Certain distributions are subject to specific treatment. Certain distributions with respect to stock in a corporation are treated as dispositions. The section prevents an increase in ordinary loss and treats the taxpayer as having a long-term capital loss in certain situations. The acquisition date is determined when subsection (a)(1) has been previously applied to an asset held by the taxpayer. The taxpayer's acquisition date of an asset is not earlier than the most recent prior application. Collapsible corporations are not affected by this section. Certain conduit entities like regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts have stock treated as indexed assets based on their fair market value. The ratio of indexed assets to the fair market value of all assets determines the treatment under this section. If the ratio is 90% or more, it is considered 100%, and if it is 10% or less, it is treated as zero. Real estate investment trusts are not required to value their assets under this provision. Real estate investment trusts must value their assets more frequently than once every 36 months, with the trustee's good faith judgment used for months without valuation. Qualified investment entities include regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, and common trust funds. The section discusses adjustments made at the partnership level that are passed through to partners. It also excludes certain property dispositions between related persons unless the basis is substituted. Related persons are defined as those with specific relationships outlined in the code. The section discusses adjustments at the partnership level passed through to partners. It excludes certain property transfers to secure or increase adjustments. Net lease property is defined as leased real property with a lease term of 50% or more of the property's useful life. The section discusses adjustments at the partnership level passed through to partners, excluding certain property transfers. Net lease property is defined as leased real property with a lease term of 50% or more of the property's useful life. The rental income produced by such property should have expenses (other than rents and reimbursed amounts) at 15 percent or less. Stock in a corporation includes interest in a common trust fund. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations for this section. Sec. 1022 discusses indexing of certain assets for gain or loss determination. Amendments apply to dispositions after December 31, 1993."
