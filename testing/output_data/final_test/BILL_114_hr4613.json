    "content": "The Act titled \"Help Extract Animals from Red Tape Act of 2016\" or \"HEART Act of 2016\" reduces the notice period for seized animals under specific sections of the Animal Welfare Act and the United States Code from 60 days to 30 days. Additionally, it introduces new bond hearing procedures. Section 983(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended to allow the Government to petition for a bond hearing within 21 days of a claim being filed for seized animals under specific sections of the Animal Welfare Act or the United States Code. The court must schedule the hearing within 15 days of notice being received by the claimant, and the Government must provide an accounting of costs 5 days before the hearing date. The government must provide an accounting of costs for the care of seized animals to the court and the claimant. The court may require the claimant to post a bond to cover these costs, unless they are financially unable to do so. The court may set a bond amount to cover partial payment of care costs for seized animals. Factors considered include the claimant's income, cost of care prior to seizure, and other relevant financial resources. If a bond is not ordered, it may only cover partial costs. The court may order a bond to cover partial payment of care costs for seized animals. If the bond is not posted within 15 days, the court may order immediate forfeiture of the animal to the Government. The seizing agency can use the bond to cover reasonable care costs, and any remaining amount will be returned upon resolution of forfeiture proceedings. If the person claiming an interest in the animal posts a bond and prevails in the forfeiture proceedings, they are entitled to receive the full amount posted as a bond. The Government will reimburse any amount drawn under necessary circumstances. Reasonable and anticipated costs include food, boarding, veterinary care, transport, and other necessary expenses. Owners can voluntarily relinquish their animals instead of posting security or going through a forfeiture hearing. Voluntary relinquishment of an animal by its owner to an animal control, shelter, protection organization, or the Government. Testimony in a hearing under this subsection is not admissible in criminal proceedings, except for perjury prosecution, and does not waive the right against self-incrimination."
