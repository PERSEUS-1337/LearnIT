    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Elie Wiesel Youth Leadership Congressional Fellowship Act of 2001\". Congress acknowledges that young people face obstacles in participating in public life due to perceptions of corruption in the legislative process and a lack of respect for idealism by elected officials. Elie Wiesel's leadership against indifference and injustice serves as inspiration for political activism, making him a fitting role model for American youth. Wiesel's dedication to social justice and equality, as a Holocaust survivor, has been instrumental in raising awareness of the atrocities suffered by the Jewish people. Elie Wiesel, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, has published numerous books on fighting hatred and genocide. A proposed Elie Wiesel Youth Leadership Congressional Fellowship aims to prepare young leaders for ethical decision-making and future roles in society. Elie Wiesel's service to society will complement and inspire the Fellowship's purpose of developing ethically informed youth leadership. Establishment of Congressional Fellowship Program. The Elie Wiesel Youth Leadership Congressional Fellowship Program allows House Members to hire an additional employee in July who meets eligibility criteria set by the Committee on House Administration. To be eligible as a Fellow for a Member of the House of Representatives, an individual must provide certification of residency in the Member's district, attendance at secondary school before the service period, a recommendation of high moral character, and a commitment to participate in leadership activities during the service period. The Elie Wiesel Youth Leadership Congressional Fellow serving in a Member of the House of Representatives office will receive a $1,400 allowance paid by the House of Representatives. The Chief Administrative Officer will also make annual payments to the Elie Wiesel Foundation based on the number of fellows serving Members of the House of Representatives.
