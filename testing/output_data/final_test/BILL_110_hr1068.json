Title I of the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 is amended to focus on research and development in high-performance computing, including long-term basic and applied research, technology advancement, and sustained access to advanced computing systems for the research community in the United States. The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 focuses on research and development in advanced computing systems, including software improvement, high-performance networks, computational science research, and technical support for high-performance computing systems. The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 emphasizes research and development in high-performance computing systems and software to address Grand Challenges. It also aims to educate and train students in various fields such as software engineering, computer science, and network security, while improving the security of computing and networking systems, including Federal systems. The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 focuses on research and development in high-performance computing systems and software to address Grand Challenges. It includes goals for Federal high-performance computing research, development, networking, and interagency coordination. The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 focuses on research, development, and networking for high-performance computing systems. It includes goals for Federal activities and the development of a roadmap for these systems. The Program Component Areas are described in detail, including any changes from the previous report and the reasons for those changes. Grand Challenges supported under the Program are also outlined. The President shall establish an advisory committee on high-performance computing consisting of non-Federal members, including representatives of the research, education, and the extent to which the Program incorporates the recommendations of the advisory committee established under subsection (b). The advisory committee on high-performance computing, consisting of non-Federal members, provides the Director with independent assessments on the Program's progress, need for revision, funding levels, research impact on US leadership, and other identified issues. The advisory committee for high-performance computing evaluates the Program's funding, management, and activities, reporting to congressional committees every two fiscal years. The committee is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and a change is made to include \"Program Component Areas\" in a specific section. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\" Section 4 of the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 is amended to include multidisciplinary teams of researchers, update system software applications, and manage large data sets. It also removes references to scientific workstations, specific types of supercomputers, and packet-switched technology. The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 is amended to include multidisciplinary teams of researchers, update system software applications, and manage large data sets. Additionally, it defines 'Program Component Areas' as major subject areas grouping related projects and activities under the Program. The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 is amended to include multidisciplinary teams of researchers, update system software applications, and manage large data sets. Passed the House of Representatives on March 12, 2007."
