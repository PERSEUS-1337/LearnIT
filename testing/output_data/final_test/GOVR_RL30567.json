    "content": "The party leadership organizations in Congress have evolved over time, with formally structured positions like the Speaker of the House and President pro tempore of the Senate dating back to the first Congress. Additional leadership roles were established in the 19th and 20th centuries. Data on service dates, party affiliation, and other information for various House and Senate party leadership posts are presented in tables. The leadership positions in Congress have evolved over time, with structured roles dating back to the first Congress. The information provided includes leaders' names, party affiliations, and dates of service for various House and Senate leadership positions from 1789 to 2017. The report includes details on the length of service for congressional leaders, with specific dates provided for the House Speaker and Senate President pro tempore. In cases of leadership changes during a Congress, exact dates are noted where possible. Official congressional documents can be used to verify the tenure of constitutionally specified leaders. The challenges of identifying party leaders in congressional history, especially in the absence of caucus records, have led scholars to rely on secondary sources like memoirs and correspondence. The changing nature of congressional leadership, including non-constitutionally specified roles like floor leaders, adds complexity to determining leadership positions. Historical records and informal practices are often used to identify party conference chairs in earlier Congresses. The concluding section of the report provides more information on sources and the reliability of leadership lists. In the absence of caucus records, scholars rely on secondary sources like memoirs and correspondence to identify party leaders in congressional history. Informal practices and historical records are used to determine party conference chairs in earlier Congresses. Presidential designees as legislative spokesmen were not considered party leaders as they were not chosen by a congressional party group or Speaker. The \"leadership\" system emerged during the \"War Hawk\" Congress under Speaker Henry Clay, where the Speaker appointed chairmen of standing committees. The position of chair of the Appropriations or Ways and Means Committee made the incumbent a powerful congressional figure due to the important legislation reported from these committees. These early leaders were not considered majority leaders in the modern sense. The leadership system in Congress emerged during the \"War Hawk\" Congress under Speaker Henry Clay, where the Speaker appointed committee chairs. These chairs were not chosen by a full party vote like modern leaders. In the Senate, party leadership developed later than in the House, with few records of party conferences in the 19th century Senate. Some Senators publicly declared there was no single leader within the Senate parties. Individuals who led the Senate through the early 20th century did not hold significant authority. Through the early 20th century, Senate party leaders were not elected but achieved their position through personal attributes like persuasion and oratory skills. Senate Republicans specified in 1945 that the conference chair and floor leader posts must be held by separate Senators. Senate Democrats have the floor leader also serving as the conference chair. Identifying party leaders in early Senate history can be challenging due to limited official sources. Identifying party leaders in early Congresses can be challenging due to limited official sources and issues with party affiliation designations in historical records. The 1989 and 1997 editions of the Biographical Directory resolved differences in party affiliations of regional political parties in nineteenth-century politics. The 1997 edition provided more complete notations for Members who changed party affiliations while in Congress. The main source for early party affiliations of Senator leaders is volume four of Senator Robert C. Byrd's The Senate, 1789-1989. An Appendix explains abbreviations used for party affiliations in the report. Some leadership posts are excluded from the tables to manage the data provided. Since the 1930s, both parties in the House have selected subordinate whips, with records lacking on all deputy, regional, and zone whips appointed in the past 70 years. The Speaker, constitutionally specified in Article 1, Section 2, is the only party leader chosen by a roll-call vote of the full House of Representatives. The Speaker's formal duties include administering oaths, signing bills, and presiding over sessions. The Speaker of the House is responsible for administering oaths, signing bills, presiding over sessions, and referring measures to committees. Each party conference gives additional powers to the Speaker, including influence over committee makeup. Party floor leaders are selected in a secret-ballot vote before each new Congress. The majority and minority party floor leaders are elected in a secret-ballot vote and work closely with the Speaker to oversee daily legislative operations. They also direct ongoing legislative strategies and serve as spokespersons for their respective parties in the House. Additional responsibilities are assigned to each floor leader by their party. Each House party caucus elects its own party whip at the start of a new Congress. House Republicans have always elected their party whips, while Democrats appointed a chief whip until 1986. Chief deputy whips are currently appointed by the party. The House whip organization, led by the chief whip, assesses passage prospects, mobilizes member support, and informs party leadership. Members are appointed or elected to serve in the whip team. The Republican Conference and Democratic Caucus are organizations of party members in the House, each with an elected chair overseeing meetings and decisions. The President pro tempore of the Senate, as outlined in Article 1, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution, is the chamber's presiding officer in the absence of the Vice President. Elected by the full Senate, the President pro tempore is the longest-serving member of the majority party. Prior to 1890, the Senate would elect a President pro tempore whenever the Vice President was not present, with the position being relinquished upon the Vice President's return. The President pro tempore of the Senate, elected by the full Senate, serves as the presiding officer in the absence of the Vice President. The position holds office at the pleasure of the Senate and executes duties during the Vice President's absences. Currently third in line of presidential succession, the President pro tempore has the power to decide points of order and enforce decorum on the Senate floor. The President pro tempore of the Senate has formal powers such as appointing conferees and certain Senate officers. However, in modern times, the majority leader typically exercises these powers. The Senate has also selected a Deputy President pro tempore and a Permanent Acting President pro tempore in the past. Special offices have been created connected to the position of President pro tempore. For more information, consult CRS Report RL30960. The Senate has created special offices connected to the position of President pro tempore, including the post of Deputy President pro tempore for specific individuals. Senator Hubert H. Humphrey held this position until his death in 1978, and in the 100th Congress, Senator John S. Stennis was designated as Deputy President pro tempore due to concerns over the health of the President pro tempore. The Senate established the post of Deputy President pro tempore in addition to Senators holding office under specific resolutions. Senator George H. Mitchell was designated Deputy President pro tempore in the 100th Congress. This position was created in 1963 to relieve the President pro tempore from presiding over prolonged debates. Senator Lee Metcalf served as Acting President pro tempore in 1963, and was authorized to continue performing the duties until ordered otherwise by the Senate in 1964. Senator Metcalf served as Acting President pro tempore in 1963 and held the position for the remaining 14 years in the Senate. Each Senate party selects its floor leader in a secret-ballot vote before a new Congress, with the majority leader responsible for scheduling legislative activity. The minority leader represents the minority party and is consulted by the majority leader in scheduling Senate floor activity. The Senate floor leader, second in command after the majority leader, has preferential floor recognition and additional responsibilities assigned by party conference rules. The Senate Democrats' floor leader also serves as the party's conference chair, leading the party's legislative priorities through the conference organization. Republicans elect their conference chairs separately, while the Democratic floor leader also chairs the Democratic Conference. Senate Democrats first selected a party whip in 1913; Republicans followed in 1915. Each party conference elects a party whip, who communicates leadership priorities to the party rank-and-file and assesses member support for pending legislative matters. Deputy whips are also appointed to assist in the whip operation. The Senate party whip communicates leadership priorities, assesses member support for pending legislative matters, and mobilizes support for leadership-supported measures. The report relies on primary congressional sources, authoritative documents, party conference journals, and secondary sources developed by scholars. The report relies on primary congressional sources, authoritative documents, party conference journals, and secondary sources developed by scholars. Conflicting interpretations occur in the data, even among reliable sources, with disparities on dates of elections and tenure of Senate Presidents pro tempore. The report attempts to footnote these divergences.
