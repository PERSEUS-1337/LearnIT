    "content": "The \"Developmental Disability Endowment Act\" is cited as the short title. It introduces State Developmental Disabilities Endowment Programs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This new part establishes State Developmental Disabilities Endowment Programs. A qualified State developmental disabilities endowment program is exempt from taxation but subject to taxes on unrelated business income. It is a program where contributions are made to provide services to the beneficiary. A qualified State developmental disabilities endowment program must meet specific requirements, including cash contributions only, penalties on non-qualified refunds, and separate accounting. \"A qualified State developmental disabilities endowment program must have separate accounting for each designated beneficiary and prohibit direct or indirect investment direction, pledging of interest as security, and excess contributions.\" \"A qualified State developmental disabilities endowment program must prevent excess contributions for designated beneficiaries. No gross income inclusion for beneficiaries or contributors, except for gift tax treatment.\" Any contribution to a qualified developmental disabilities endowment program on behalf of a designated beneficiary is treated as a completed gift and not a future interest in property. Excess contributions by a donor can be taken into account for gift tax purposes. Any distribution under a qualified State developmental disabilities endowment program is includible in the gross income of the distributee. In-kind distributions to a designated beneficiary are treated as a distribution to the beneficiary. Change in beneficiaries under a qualified State developmental disabilities endowment program does not apply to rollovers within 60 days to another designated beneficiary. Changing designated beneficiaries does not count as a distribution for tax purposes. Operating rules apply for section 72. Operating rules under section 72 treat all qualified State developmental disabilities endowment programs as one program for tax purposes. Distributions in a taxable year are considered as one, and the contract value is calculated at the end of the calendar year. No amount is included in estate tax treatment. No amount is included in the gross estate for estate tax purposes of an individual with an interest in a qualified developmental disabilities endowment program, except for amounts distributed upon the death of a beneficiary or excess contributions made by a donor who passes away before the end of a 5-year period. The gross estate of the donor includes contributions allocable after their death. Distributions from a qualified developmental disabilities endowment program are not taxable gifts. Officers must report program details to the Secretary and beneficiaries as required. The term 'designated beneficiary' in the qualified State developmental disabilities endowment program refers to the individual designated to receive payments, including new beneficiaries and other designated individuals. 'Qualified services' are also defined under the program. The term 'qualified services' refers to services designated under the qualified developmental disabilities endowment program. A clerical amendment is made to the table of parts for subchapter F of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000."
