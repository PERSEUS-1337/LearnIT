    "content": "The Act titled \"Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 1998\" allows for the electronic issuance of migratory bird hunting and conservation stamps. The Act of March 16, 1934 is amended to allow for the electronic issuance of migratory bird hunting and conservation stamps. This includes definitions for actual stamps, electronic stamps, and authorization by the Department of the Interior, the Postal Service, or a State. The electronic issuance of migratory bird hunting and conservation stamps is allowed under the amended Act of March 16, 1934. Electronic stamps can be issued by the Postal Service or authorized entities through endorsement on licenses or other electronic media. Electronic stamps must be smaller than 1.5 times the area of an actual stamp and must have a unique confirmation number and other identifying information printed on them. Electronic stamps must be recognized by law enforcement officers and delivered to the licensee within 14 days of issuance. The unique confirmation number on the electronic stamp should be fully recognized during the specified period. The electronic stamp issued must be replaced by the actual stamp within 14 days, as long as the licensee meets the requirements. A plan must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior for participation in the electronic stamp issuance. The State or person must provide a satisfactory accounting process for revenue collection, distribution, and law enforcement verification of electronic transactions, as well as the subsequent distribution of the actual stamp. The Secretary of the Interior will review the request and accompanying documentation within 60 days to approve or deny the plan. The State or person must transfer revenue from electronic stamp sales to the Department of the Interior within 14 days using an approved electronic fund transfer method."
