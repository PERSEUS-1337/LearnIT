    "content": "The U.S. policy on legal permanent immigration is based on four principles: family reunification, admitting immigrants with needed skills, protecting refugees, and diversity of admissions by country of origin. These principles are outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952, which has been amended multiple times by Congress. Noncitizens, or aliens, are individuals who are not U.S. citizens and can be either legal or illegal residents. Legal aliens are classified as immigrants who are admitted as legal permanent residents (LPRs) of the United States. Immigrants admitted as legal permanent residents (LPRs) in the United States have fewer restrictions compared to nonimmigrants. Nonimmigrants, like tourists and foreign students, are admitted for a specific purpose and time period. Immigrants can change employment and apply for citizenship after 5 years. Admission is based on numerical limits and preference categories. The United States has numerical limits and preference categories for admission of legal permanent residents, including family relationships, needed skills, and geographic diversity. This includes a worldwide cap of 675,000, per-country ceilings, and specific numbers allocated to family-based, employment-based, and diversity immigrants. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens are admitted outside of the numerical limits. Family relationships play a significant role in the admission of legal immigrants to the United States. In FY2001, 64% of the 1,064,318 legal immigrants entered based on family ties. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens were the largest group, followed by family preference immigrants, employment-based preference immigrants, refugees, asylees, and diversity immigrants. The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversees immigrant admissions. Refugee admissions have different criteria and numerical limits. Refugee admissions are governed by different criteria and numerical limits than immigrant admissions. Refugee status requires a finding of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution in situations of \"special humanitarian concern\" to the United States. The total annual number of refugee admissions and the allocation of these numbers among refugee groups are determined at the start of each fiscal year by the President after consultation with the Congress. Refugees are admitted from abroad. The INA also provides for the granting of asylum on a case-by-case basis to aliens physically present in the United States who meet the statutory definition of \"refugee.\" All aliens must satisfy State Department consular officers abroad and DHS Bureau of Customs and Border Protection inspectors upon entry to the U.S. that they are not ineligible for visas or admission under the so-called \"grounds for inadmissibility\" of the INA. These criteria categories are: health-related grounds. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) outlines various grounds for inadmissibility, including health-related issues, criminal history, national security concerns, public charge, illegal entry, lack of proper documentation, and previous removal. Family-based immigrants must have a new affidavit of support signed by a U.S. sponsor to meet the public charge requirement. The INA also specifies circumstances leading to deportation. Criminal grounds have been a focus, with laws toughened in 1996. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and the USA Patriot Act of 2001 expanded deportation consequences for criminal convictions and terrorist grounds. The annual number of LPRs admitted in the United States increased after World War II but never reached early 20th-century levels. Immigration growth after 1980 was due to increased admissions under the preference system and legalized aliens, as well as a rise in refugee admissions. The Immigration Act of 1990 increased employment-based preference immigration, leading to a rise in immigration from 718,000 in 1966-1980 to 1.6 million in 1981-1995. Two statistical perspectives on immigration trends are based on BCIS admissions data and Census population surveys, showing an increase in the foreign-born population. The foreign-born population in the U.S. has more than doubled since 1980, reaching a historic high of 32.5 million in 2002. Immigrants have the opportunity to become citizens through naturalization, which requires residency, good moral character, English proficiency, and passing a government examination. Foreign-born individuals in the U.S. can apply for citizenship through naturalization, which involves meeting residency, moral character, English proficiency, and passing a government exam requirements. Applicants pay a $310 fee and can choose to take a civics test or have an examiner quiz them during an interview. Waivers are available for those over 50 with at least 20 years in the U.S. or over 55 with at least 15 years, as well as for those over 65 with at least 20 years in the U.S. Military service may also qualify for waivers. The number of LPRs seeking naturalization has been increasing. The number of LPRs petitioning to naturalize has increased in the past year but has not reached nearly the highs of the mid-1990s. The pending caseload for naturalization remains over half a million, with some LPRs waiting 1-2 years for their petitions to be processed. Illegal aliens are noncitizens who entered the U.S. surreptitiously or overstayed their visas. The former INS estimated there were 7.0 million unauthorized aliens in the U.S. in 2000. In 2000, estimates of unauthorized aliens in the United States ranged from 8.5 to 8.7 million, including \"quasi-legal\" aliens. Noncitizens' eligibility for federal benefits depends on their immigration status and the enactment of welfare laws. Refugees are eligible for SSI and Medicaid for 7 years, while LPRs face restrictions until naturalization or meeting a 10-year work requirement. LPRs who meet a 5-year residence test and LPR children are eligible for food stamps. LPRs entering after August 22, 1996, face a 5-year bar from TANF and Medicaid. After the 5-year bar, the sponsor's income is considered for new immigrants' financial eligibility. Unauthorized aliens are ineligible for most federal benefits except emergency medical care. Aliens in the US are subject to similar tax obligations as citizens, with exceptions for certain nonimmigrant groups. LPRs and certain nonimmigrant groups in the US are treated similarly to citizens for tax purposes. Unauthorized migrants are subject to a \"substantive presence\" test based on their time in the country. Some countries have tax treaties with the US that may exempt their citizens from certain taxes."
