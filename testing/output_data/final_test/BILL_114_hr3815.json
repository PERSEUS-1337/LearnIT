    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. Congress finds that international terrorism poses a serious threat to the United States, impacting commerce and market stability. Congress has the power to impose penalties on those supporting terrorist organizations and allow victims to seek damages. Some foreign terrorist organizations raise significant funds outside the United States for conduct directed at the country. The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 recognizes causes of action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability. The legal framework for such liability is based on the Halberstam v. Welch case, which is widely acknowledged as the leading case in Federal civil liability for terrorism-related offenses. The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 imposes liability on those who knowingly support terrorist acts, as declared by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373. Countries are obligated to refrain from supporting terrorism in any form, whether directly or indirectly. The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 holds individuals and entities accountable for providing material support to terrorists. The United States aims to ensure that those injured in terrorist attacks have access to the court system to pursue civil claims against those who have supported terrorism. The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 allows civil litigants to seek relief against individuals or entities that have provided material support to terrorists, whether directly or indirectly, in order to hold them accountable for their actions. SEC. 3. FOREIGN SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY. Section 1605(a) of title 28, United States Code is amended to include cases where money damages are sought against a foreign state for physical injury, death, or property damage in the US caused by the tortious act of that foreign state or its officials or employees. This includes claims related to extrajudicial killing, terrorism, and material support for such acts. The amendment to Section 1605(a) of title 28, United States Code limits claims against a foreign state for physical injury, death, or property damage in the US caused by the tortious act of that foreign state or its officials. It excludes claims related to malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, interference with contract rights, emotional distress, or derivative injury suffered as a result of an event or injury to another person outside of the United States. The amendment to Section 1605(a) of title 28, United States Code limits claims against a foreign state for physical injury, death, or property damage in the US caused by the tortious act of that foreign state or its officials. It excludes certain types of claims and defines terms related to terrorism. SEC. 4. AIDING AND ABETTING LIABILITY FOR CIVIL ACTIONS REGARDING TERRORIST ACTS. In an amendment to Section 2333 of title 18, liability can be asserted against any person who aided, abetted, or conspired with an organization designated as a foreign terrorist organization for acts of international terrorism. This amendment does not affect the immunity of foreign states under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The term defined in section 1603 of title 28, United States Code, pertains to jurisdiction under other law. SEC. 5 amends Section 2334 of title 18, United States Code, to grant district courts personal jurisdiction over individuals involved in acts of international terrorism causing harm to U.S. nationals. SEC. 6 addresses liability for government officials in civil actions related to terrorist acts. Section 2337 of title 18, United States Code is amended to prevent suits against government officials. If any provision of this Act is held invalid, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. The effective date of the Act is specified in Section 8. The amendments made by this Act apply to civil actions pending or commenced on or after the enactment date, and arising from an injury on or after September 11, 2001."
