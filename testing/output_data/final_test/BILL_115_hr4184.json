    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Extending Status Protection for Eligible Refugees with Established Residency Act of 2017\" or the \"ESPERER Act of 2017.\" It involves the adjustment of status for certain foreign nationals. The \"Extending Status Protection for Eligible Refugees with Established Residency Act of 2017\" allows for the adjustment of status to permanent residence for eligible aliens if they meet specific criteria. The \"Extending Status Protection for Eligible Refugees with Established Residency Act of 2017\" allows eligible aliens to adjust their status to permanent residence if they have not participated in persecution based on certain criteria and have not been convicted of specific offenses. Aliens present in the United States who have been ordered to depart may apply for adjustment of status. They are not required to file a motion to reopen the order. If the application is granted, the order will be canceled. If the application is denied, the order remains in effect. This provision applies to any eligible alien. Aliens from Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador, or Honduras in temporary protected status under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act on specific dates, physically present in the US on January 12, 2011, and for at least 1 year before applying for adjustment of status under this Act, are eligible. Aliens in temporary protected status from Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador, or Honduras can apply for adjustment of status if physically present in the US on specific dates and for at least 1 year before applying. The Secretary of Homeland Security can provide regulations for aliens with a final removal order to seek a stay based on an application under subsection (a). During removal proceedings, aliens can raise eligibility for adjustment of status as a defense against removal. The Secretary of Homeland Security can authorize an alien applying for adjustment of status to work in the US during the application process. If the application is pending for over 180 days without denial, employment authorization must be granted. Additionally, spouses and children are eligible for adjustment of status regardless of certain provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to adjust the status of an alien to that of a lawful permanent resident under certain conditions, including being physically present in the US at the time of application. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to adjust the status of an alien to that of a lawful permanent resident if the alien is eligible and admissible, with exceptions for certain grounds of exclusion. Continuous physical presence is required, with absences not exceeding 180 days in total. Administrative review is available. The Secretary of Homeland Security provides applicants for adjustment of status with the same administrative review rights as applicants under the Immigration and Nationality Act. A determination by the Secretary regarding status adjustment is final and not subject to judicial review. The granting of lawful permanent residence status does not reduce the number of immigrant visas available. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply to the administration of this Act, without affecting the Secretary of Homeland Security's authority. Eligibility for permanent residence under this Act does not prevent seeking status under other laws."
