    "content": "The Act titled \"DTV Border Fix Act\" allows for the continuation of analog broadcasting along the common border with Mexico. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to allow television stations near the US-Mexico border to continue analog broadcasting. The Commission allows TV stations near the US-Mexico border to continue analog broadcasting until February 17, 2014, on channels 2-51. The extension of analog television service channels must meet specific requirements to avoid hindering spectrum auction, public safety services, or reserved channels. Each station described in clause (i) operates on its assigned analog channel between 2 and 51, as of February 16, 2009, if the channel has not been previously assigned for digital operation after the required digital transition. As of February 16, 2009, a station can use its analog channel for broadcasting analog television service after the digital transition without causing interference to authorized digital television stations. If the station does not meet the requirements for operating on its assigned analog channel, it can request an alternative. As of February 16, 2009, a station can request a new channel for broadcasting analog television service between channels 2 and 51 without causing interference to other stations. On February 16, 2009, stations can request a new channel for broadcasting analog or digital television service between channels 2 and 51 without causing interference to other stations. If mutually exclusive applications are submitted for the right to use a channel for broadcasting analog television service, the Commission will award the authority through established procedures and consider any resolution procedures."
