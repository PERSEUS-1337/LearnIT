    "content": "The \"Small Business Tax Cut Act\" is cited as the short title. It introduces a deduction for domestic business income of qualified small businesses under a new section 200 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Small Business Tax Cut Act introduces a deduction for qualified small businesses based on domestic business income. The deduction is 20% of the lesser of qualified domestic business income or taxable income for the year. Additionally, the deduction is limited to 50% of W-2 wages paid to non-owners or non-owner family members of direct owners. The section defines non-owners as individuals who do not own any stock or interest in the business and non-owner family members as relatives of direct owners who are not owners themselves. The term 'direct owner' refers to individuals who own stock or interest in a qualified small business, while 'non-owners' are family members of direct owners who would not be owners if certain rules were applied. The term '10-percent-or-less direct owner' defines individuals who own a small portion of a qualified small business, either in stock ownership or capital/profits, with a limit of 10 percent ownership. The term 'W-2 wages' refers to the sum of amounts paid for employment of employees by a person during a taxable year. The term 'W-2 wages' excludes amounts not properly allocable to domestic business gross receipts, not deductible under section 162, or not included in a return filed with the Social Security. The term 'W-2 wages' excludes amounts not properly allocable to domestic business gross receipts, not deductible under section 162, or not included in a return filed with the Social Security Administration within 60 days after the due date. Certain partnership distributions in qualified small businesses are treated as W-2 wages. For qualified service-providing partners, W-2 wages are treated as wages paid to them as employees, reducing the partnership's domestic business gross receipts. A qualified partner is a 10% or less direct owner who materially participates in the related trade or business. The Secretary will apply the subsection when a taxpayer acquires or disposes of a major portion of a trade or business during the taxable year. Qualified Domestic Business Income is defined as the excess of domestic business gross receipts over the cost of goods sold and other expenses for the taxable year. The term 'domestic business gross receipts' refers to the taxpayer's gross receipts connected with a trade or business in the US, excluding certain deductions. The term 'domestic business gross receipts' excludes certain types of income for nonresident alien individuals or foreign corporations, such as capital asset sales, royalties, rents, dividends, interest, annuities, and wages. Rules similar to section 199(c) apply for qualified domestic business income and domestic business gross receipts. A qualified small business has fewer than 500 full-time equivalent employees in 2010 or 2011. The determination of full-time equivalent employees for employers not in existence prior to 2012 is based on calendar year 2012. For employers coming into existence during a calendar year, the number of full-time equivalent employees is adjusted accordingly. The determination of full-time equivalent employees for employers not in existence prior to 2012 is based on calendar year 2012. Special rules apply for aggregation of employers and predecessors. The taxpayer may elect not to include certain income as domestic business gross receipts. If a deduction is allowed under this section, it cannot be used for the same gross receipts or W-2 wages under section 199. The taxpayer can elect not to include specific income in domestic business gross receipts. Deductions allowed under this section cannot be used for the same gross receipts or W-2 wages under section 199. Rules similar to section 199(d) apply for qualified domestic business income. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to prevent reorganized taxpayers from being treated as qualified small businesses. This section applies to the taxpayer's first taxable year after December 31, 2011. In 2011, amendments were made to the Internal Revenue Code regarding deductions under sections 199 and 200 for qualified small businesses. Various sections of the Code were amended to include deductions under section 200 in addition to section 199.
