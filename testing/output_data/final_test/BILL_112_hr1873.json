    "content": "The \"Arbitration Fairness Act of 2011\" may be cited as the Act. It includes findings related to arbitration. The Congress finds that the Federal Arbitration Act was originally intended for disputes between commercial entities but has now been expanded to consumer and employment disputes. This expansion limits the choices of consumers and employees, often without their knowledge, and undermines public law due to lack of transparency and judicial review in arbitration. Arbitration is a viable option when consent is voluntary and occurs after the dispute arises, but there are concerns about inadequate judicial review of arbitrators' decisions. Title 9 of the United States Code is amended to include a new chapter on arbitration of employment, consumer, and civil rights disputes. The new chapter in Title 9 of the United States Code defines a civil rights dispute as a disagreement related to discrimination based on race, sex, disability, religion, national origin, or other factors in various areas such as education, employment, and government programs.
