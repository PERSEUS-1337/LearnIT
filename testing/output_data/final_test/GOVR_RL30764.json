    "content": "Prior to the 1960s, the House and Senate lacked a consistent disciplinary mechanism for Members. Allegations of misconduct were investigated by ad hoc committees or the whole House/Senate. Publicity and reelection were seen as the main forms of redress for unethical behavior in Congress. Congress historically operated without a formal ethics process, relying on informal codes of behavior and addressing only the most obvious acts of wrongdoing on a case-by-case basis. Perceptions of wrongdoing or conflicts of interest by Members of Congress have evolved over time. For example, when Daniel Webster served as chair of the Senate Finance Committee in the 1830s, he also worked for the Bank of the United States without much criticism. Concerns over standards of conduct and financial disclosure for government officials did not arise until the 1940s. In 1946, Senator Wayne Morse introduced a resolution to require Senators to disclose sources of outside income to ensure behavior above suspicion. Criticism of congressional investigative procedures increased in 1951, with concerns that Members were avoiding accountability. The 85th Congress in 1957 adopted a Code of Ethics for Government Service. The Code of Ethics for Government Service was proposed in 1951 following an investigation into Sherman Adams. It provides ethical guidance for officials in the three branches of government, although it is not legally binding. The \"club spirit\" and unwritten norms of conduct in Congress persisted until the 1960s. In the 1960s, investigations into misconduct by Bobby Baker and Adam Clayton Powell highlighted the lack of congressional standards of conduct. The Senate and House then established committees to investigate allegations of wrongdoing and recommend penalties. The goal was to be fair to Members and uphold congressional rules and laws. In response to criticism of slow ethics investigations, the House created the Office of Congressional Ethics in the 110th Congress. Senator J. William Fulbright also proposed an ethics commission in the 82nd Congress, but it was not adopted. In the 96th Congress, Senator William Roth introduced S.J.Res. 144 to establish an Independent Investigating Commission on Ethics to investigate allegations of improper conduct by Members of Congress arising from the ABSCAM FBI investigation. In the 96th Congress, Senator William Roth introduced S.J.Res. 144 to establish an Independent Investigating Commission on Ethics to investigate allegations of improper conduct by Members of Congress related to the ABSCAM FBI investigation. The proposal would have allowed senior statesmen to independently receive complaints and initiate investigations, with the Ethics Committees retaining the right to review findings and recommend actions to the full Senate and House. However, S.J.Res. 144 was not further considered. In the 103rd Congress, discussions on non-congressional ethics entities occurred during hearings by the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress. Sitting and former Members of Congress, along with congressional scholars, debated the involvement of external entities in assisting ethics committees with enforcement. During the 105th Congress, the House Ethics Reform Task Force considered the use of \"distinguished private citizens\" in the ethics process to enhance public trust and minimize partisanship. However, concerns were raised about interference with the constitutional responsibility of each House to discipline its Members. No further action was taken on the recommendation to authorize the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to use a panel of non-Members in ethics cases. During the 105th Congress, the House Ethics Reform Task Force considered involving \"distinguished private citizens\" in the ethics process to reduce partisanship. However, concerns about interfering with the House's disciplinary responsibility were raised. In the 109th Congress, there was interest in an independent ethics authority, but proposals were rejected by the Senate. During the 110th Congress, the Senate rejected an amendment to establish a Senate Office of Public Integrity as part of the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2007. The Constitution's \"Speech or Debate\" clause may complicate outside enforcement of conduct provisions against Members of Congress, providing a necessity for internal investigations and punishment. The House of Representatives has a Committee on Ethics to handle violations of chamber rules, federal, and state laws. It was established in 1967 and works alongside the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) created in 2008. The Committee consists of 10 Members from both parties and provides advisory services through its Office of Advice and Education. The Committee on Ethics provides guidance on House rules and conduct, offers training for staff, reviews travel, and certifies financial disclosures. It investigates and adjudicates cases against Members, officers, and employees of the House. Complaints can only be filed by a Member of the House or with written certification by a Member. The Committee on Ethics investigates and adjudicates cases against Members, officers, and employees of the House. Complaints can only be filed by a Member of the House or with written certification by a Member. Non-Members can provide information on potential misconduct to the Office of Congressional Ethics for further review by the Committee on Standards. The Committee on Ethics investigates cases against Members, officers, and employees of the House. An ad-hoc investigative subcommittee is formed if an investigation is deemed necessary. The subcommittee can find violations and transmit formal charges to the Committee on Ethics, which then appoints an ad-hoc adjudicative subcommittee. The subcommittee, consisting of members of the Committee on Ethics, reviews evidence in alleged violations and recommends sanctions if necessary. The adjudicatory process involves determining if violations have been proved by clear and convincing evidence in a hearing, led by the Committee's non-partisan staff attorneys. The staff are the moving party in the proceedings, making a case for the Statement of Alleged Violation. The burden of proof lies with the Committee counsel to establish facts by clear and convincing evidence. The respondent can present their side but is not required to do so, and no negative inference will be drawn if they choose not to. The Adjudicatory Subcommittee acts impartially as finders of fact and law, without bias or partisanship. The committee historically recommended punishments like expulsion, censure, reprimand, and \"Letters of Reproval\" and \"Letters of Admonition\" after subcommittee investigations. About 25 Members have left the House due to court convictions, inquiries, or charges brought by the committee, ending the case as the committee lacks jurisdiction over former Members. The committee's first publicly announced action in 1968 was an inquiry into voting irregularities, attributing the issue to an overworked tally clerk. The House made changes to the ethics process and the Committee on Ethics in recent Congresses, including establishing a bipartisan Ethics Reform Task Force in 1997. The task force recommended reforms to strengthen the committee and ensure equitable treatment of all Members, officers, and employees. The House adopted new rules based on these recommendations in September 1997. The House adopted new rules in response to recommendations from the bipartisan Ethics Reform Task Force in 1997. Changes included requiring non-Members to have a Member certify complaints, reducing the committee size, and establishing a pool of potential appointees for investigative subcommittees. The chair and ranking minority Member must quickly assess complaint validity, and violations of law may be referred to the full House with a two-thirds vote. The House rules in the 109th and 110th Congresses included provisions for the Committee on Ethics to refer violations of law to law enforcement authorities and allowed the ranking minority Member to add matters to the committee's agenda. Changes in investigative procedures were made, such as notifying individuals mentioned in complaints and a 45-day deadline for addressing complaints. During the 110th Congress, the House passed H.Res. 451, requiring the Committee on Ethics to act promptly when a Member is charged with criminal conduct. The rules were later adopted for the 111th Congress, leading to the formation of the Office of Congressional Ethics. The House amended rules regarding the Ethics Committee's role in OCE reviews and clarified Code of Conduct provisions in the 113th and 114th Congresses. The House amended rules to require mandatory ethics training for new Members, Delegates, Resident Commissioners, officers, or employees. A Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement was created to address criticisms of the closed nature of the Committee on Ethics. This task force considered creating an outside enforcement entity and introduced H.Res. 895 to create an office of congressional ethics. The House amended rules to require mandatory ethics training for new Members, Delegates, Resident Commissioners, officers, or employees. A Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement was created to address criticisms of the closed nature of the Committee on Ethics. Chairman Capuano released proposed amendments to H.Res. 895, which created an office of congressional ethics with six board members appointed by House leaders. The House adopted H.Res. 895 on March 11, 2008, and the OCE was established with its first board members appointed in July 2008. The OCE has been reauthorized by the House in subsequent Congresses, and its jurisdiction is limited to House Members, officers, and employees. The Senate does not have a comparable entity, but the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, bipartisan in nature, was established in 1977. The Senate Ethics Committee in the 114th Congress consists of six members, three from each party, with both disciplinary and advisory functions. It does not separate investigative and adjudicatory functions and has no statute of limitations for investigations. Anyone can file a complaint, leading to a multi-stage review and adjudication process for alleged violations. Senators have faced expulsion and censure as consequences of committee actions. The Senate established the bipartisan Senate Ethics Study Commission in 1993 to study the procedures of the Select Committee on Ethics. In 1999, S.Res. 222 streamlined the Senate's ethics enforcement process and required education on laws and regulations for Members, officers, and employees. The Senate implemented changes to streamline the ethics enforcement process, including replacing the two-phase \"preliminary inquiry\" with a single-phase process. Charges are issued if there is substantial evidence of a violation, followed by an adjudicative review to determine appropriate punishment. The Ethics Committee can impose sanctions such as financial restitution, censure, and expulsion, with the flexibility to propose other penalties. Outside groups can still file allegations against Senate members, officers, or employees.

The Ethics Committee can impose sanctions such as financial restitution, censure, and expulsion, with the flexibility to propose other penalties. Public or private \"Letters of Admonition\" can be issued by the Ethics Committee, which are not considered a form of discipline. Evaluations of the committees' work have sparked debates on whether Members of Congress are following the mandate of the Constitution for self-discipline, often linked to perceptions of impropriety and conflicts of interest. The perception of wrongdoing or conflict of interest can trigger investigations, as public servants are expected to avoid both actual and apparent impropriety. The public demands that elected officials uphold high ethical standards, leading to reevaluations and potential changes in enforcement mechanisms by the House or Senate. Since the 1960s, Congress has implemented more stringent ethical standards and self-discipline measures. New laws have been enacted to enhance public confidence, but each new law also introduces new potential offenses."
