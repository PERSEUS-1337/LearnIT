The \"Investing in Our Future Act of 2011\" acknowledges the impact of the 2008 global economic crisis caused by Wall Street, leading to massive profits for them but destabilizing economies worldwide. The crisis has pushed millions into poverty and distorted the national deficit, with Federal deficit spending at a record $1.5 trillion. Additionally, climate change, disease, and ill health further undermine developing nations' economies. The lack of predictable, adequate, and sustainable long-term public funding to address global health and climate change in developing countries is urgently needed. Cutting vital domestic programs to reduce the national debt will harm the country's long-term prosperity. Financial institutions responsible for the financial crisis should provide funds to help developing countries adapt to climate change. A tax on currency speculation by major banks could generate funds to help developing countries mitigate climate change, fight global HIV/AIDS, improve health in impoverished nations, and reduce the national deficit. This tax would curb speculative transactions and bring greater stability to the currency market. A small tax on currency trading would not disrupt legitimate market activities and could help reduce the Federal deficit and fund global health, poverty, and climate change initiatives. The Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development should collaborate to implement a broader currency transaction tax. A currency transaction tax is proposed to be implemented to help reduce the Federal deficit and fund global initiatives. A currency transaction tax is imposed on each transaction by a US person, with an exception for low-value transactions under $10,000 in a calendar year. Coordination with withholding rules applies for transactions exceeding $10,000. The tax imposed on currency transactions is 0.005 percent of the value of the currency acquired. Special rules apply for currency derivatives. The tax on currency transactions is 0.005 percent of the currency's value. Currency derivatives are also subject to special rules for valuation. Currency derivatives include currency notional principal contracts, options, forward contracts, short positions, hedges, or similar financial instruments related to currencies. The tax on currency transactions is 0.005 percent of the currency's value, with liability for tax and withholding falling on the United States person involved in the transaction. United States persons are required to withhold tax on currency transactions unless exempted. United States persons facilitating currency transactions must deduct and withhold a tax equal to the amount imposed under section 4475. Regulations ensure only one person withholds tax per transaction. United States persons must deduct and withhold a tax on currency transactions confirmed and matched by a United States person or settled by a United States person. The withheld amounts are treated as wages paid by an employer to an employee for tax purposes. For tax purposes, all members of an expanded affiliated group are treated as one person. An expanded affiliated group is defined as an affiliated group with more than 50% ownership, excluding certain criteria. Non-corporate entities can be part of an expanded affiliated group if they are controlled by the group. Members of an expanded affiliated group are treated as one person for tax purposes. Non-corporate entities can be part of the group if they are controlled by its members. A clerical amendment is made to the tax code. The amendments in subchapter c. currency transactions apply to transactions after December 31, 2011. Funding for child care is addressed in Section 3. Established in the Treasury is the Child Care Assistance Trust Fund, funded by 10 percent of taxes under section 4475 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The fund is available for expenditures to support child care programs. The Child Care Assistance Trust Fund is funded by taxes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Appropriation Acts are used for expenditures, and management of the fund is treated as provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Child Care Assistance Grants are allocated among states based on the Social Security Act, with funding considered additional. Funding for child care assistance should be additional and not a replacement for other funding sources. SEC. 4. MULTILATERAL GLOBAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. Established in the Treasury of the United States is the Multilateral Global Health Trust Fund, funded by 25 percent of taxes under section 4475 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for global health expenditures.

The grants are given to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, as well as other multilateral health funding mechanisms that meet specific criteria.

The grants require equal involvement of civil society and impacted communities, performance measures for projects, financial accountability, and transparency.

GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION. Global Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Trust Fund established in the Treasury of the United States, funded by taxes under section 4475 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Global Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Trust Fund allows for expenditures to carry out specific programs related to climate change. Contributions from the fund are made to the Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund, established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Contributions under this subsection should be additional funding for global climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives in developing countries, not a replacement for existing funding.
