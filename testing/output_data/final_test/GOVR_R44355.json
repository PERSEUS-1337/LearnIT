    "content": "The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (Central States) is a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan projected to become insolvent by 2026. An application was submitted to the U.S. Department of the Treasury to reduce benefits to two-thirds of plan participants. Multiemployer pension plans pool risk to minimize financial strain, but increasing employer withdrawals have impacted plan assets. Central States is a large multiemployer DB pension plan facing insolvency by 2026 due to withdrawals and declines in plan assets. Insufficient funds may result in the inability to pay benefits to some participants. The plan may be eligible to reduce benefits under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act. Insolvency occurs when a plan can no longer pay any benefits to participants. Central States is at risk of insolvency by 2026, and may reduce benefits under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act to restore solvency. This includes active participants and retirees. Prior to MPRA, pension plans could not reduce benefits. The plan aims to avoid insolvency to ensure future retirees receive benefits. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures participants in multiemployer DB pension plans, providing financial assistance when plans become insolvent. PBGC covers about 10.3 million participants in 1,400 plans, with a maximum benefit of $12,870 per year for individuals with 30 years of service. However, PBGC may not be able to fully cover benefits if a large plan like Central States becomes insolvent. PBGC's multiemployer program receives funds from premiums paid by participating employers and investment income. Premium revenue is held in a revolving fund invested in Treasury securities. If financial assistance exceeds premium revenue, PBGC would pay benefits from the fund. If the fund is exhausted, PBGC can only provide assistance equal to premium revenue. In case of insolvency of a large plan like Central States, PBGC can only pay assistance up to the premium revenue amount. If PBGC becomes insolvent, plans receiving financial assistance may not get full benefits. ERISA states the US is not liable for PBGC's obligations. Central States paid $2.8 billion in benefits in 2014. If PBGC assists Central States, it could go insolvent. Participants in plans getting PBGC assistance may see reduced benefits. Stakeholders assumed Congress wouldn't help PBGC. Table 2 shows PBGC's financial position in multiemployer program. Future assistance to Central States is a liability for PBGC. Under MPRA, only plans in critical and declining status may cut benefits. A plan is in critical status if its funding ratio is less than 65%. Plans in declining status are projected to become insolvent within a specified timeframe. Benefit reductions must be distributed equitably based on factors like participant age, benefit type, and years to retirement. MPRA requires benefit reductions for plans in critical and declining status to restore solvency. Reductions must ensure individuals receive at least 110% of PBGC maximum guarantee. Disabled individuals and retirees aged 80+ are exempt from reductions, while those aged 75-80 may see reduced benefits. Plans must meet specific criteria to implement reductions. The Central States plan is required to reduce benefits under a provision in MPRA. The plan lists three tiers of benefits: Tier 1 for employees with unpaid withdrawal liability, Tier 2 for other benefits, and Tier 3 for UPS employees with a separate benefit plan. Central States plan, under MPRA provision, proposes benefit reductions totaling $1.9 billion in Tier 1, $7.1 billion in Tier 2, and $2.0 billion in Tier 3. About two-thirds of participants face reductions, with a total of 471,186 participants across all tiers. Treasury extended the comment period until December 7, 2015. Treasury extended the deadline for comments on Central States' application until February 1, 2016. They are evaluating the application and must approve or deny it by May 7, 2016, based on specified criteria in MPRA. Treasury may only reject the application if the criteria for benefit suspensions are not met. Under MPRA, Treasury must administer a vote of plan participants within 30 days of approving an application for benefit reductions. If a majority of participants reject the proposal, the plan sponsor can submit a new proposal. For systemically important plans, Treasury may allow benefit suspensions regardless of the participant vote or implement a modified plan to prevent insolvency. At the end of FY2013, PBGC projected Central States would need over $1.0 billion in financial assistance if insolvent. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aims to address potentially insolvent multiemployer DB pension plans, including bills like the Keep Our Pension Promises Act and the Pension Accountability Act. The Pension Accountability Act aims to change the participant vote requirement for plan benefit reductions and eliminate the ability of systematically important plans to implement benefit suspensions without participant approval."
