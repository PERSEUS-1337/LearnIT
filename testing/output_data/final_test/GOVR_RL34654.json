    "content": "The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) amends and establishes programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965. Funding authorization for these programs is provided through FY2014. The HEA authorizes federal student aid programs and aid to institutions of higher education. It is organized into eight titles, with Title IV focusing on student assistance programs. The Higher Education Act of 1965, under Title IV, Student Assistance, authorizes programs for less-advantaged students, international education, and certain graduate degrees. Other programs provide aid to institutions under Title II, Title III, and Title V. The HEA, administered by the U.S. Department of Education, was enacted in 1965 and has been amended multiple times. The Higher Education Act (HEA) has been amended and reauthorized several times, with the last comprehensive reauthorization occurring in 1998. Major amendments to HEA programs have been made through budget reconciliation measures. The Higher Education Act (HEA) has been amended and reauthorized several times, with the last comprehensive reauthorization occurring in 1998. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act (CCRAA) and the Ensuring Continuing Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 (ECASLA) made significant changes to federal student loan programs and the Federal Pell Grant program. In the 110th Congress, the Senate passed S. 1642 to amend and extend the HEA, while the House passed H.R. 4137 with similar provisions. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) was passed by both the House and Senate in 2008, signed into law as P.L. 110-315. It consists of eleven Titles covering various aspects of higher education, including teacher quality enhancement, student assistance, and international education programs. Titles I through VII of the HEOA introduce amendments, extensions, and new programs under the Act. Titles I through VII of the HEOA amend, extend, and authorize programs under the HEA. Title VIII adds new programs, Title IX and X make amendments to other laws, and Title XI establishes study requirements. Amendments are effective from the date of enactment, August 14, 2008. The HEOA amends and authorizes programs under the HEA, with effective dates from the enactment on August 14, 2008. The report is divided into two parts, detailing amendments to the HEA and changes to other laws. Title I of the HEA includes general provisions and definitions, such as institutional reporting requirements and the authorization of a performance-based organization for federal student aid. The HEOA amends Title I of the HEA by adding new lender and institution requirements for education loans. It also prohibits IHEs from using federal funds for lobbying or grant influencing. The HEOA introduces new definitions and amends existing ones, including 'authorizing committees,' 'distance education,' and 'institution of higher education.' The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) amends Title I of the Higher Education Act (HEA) by adding new lender and institution requirements for education loans. It introduces new definitions and amends existing ones, including 'authorizing committees,' 'distance education,' and 'institution of higher education.' The HEOA contains two definitions of \"institution of higher education\" (IHE) for eligibility purposes under the act, with a general definition at HEA, \u00a7 101 and a separate definition for Title IV at HEA, \u00a7 102. Effective July 1, 2010, the HEOA makes changes to these definitions, incorporating provisions previously established through regulations. The definition of an IHE is based on the types of students served, with the HEOA explicitly adding home-schooled students. The HEOA expands the definition of an institution of higher education (IHE) to include home-schooled students and individuals dually enrolled in secondary school. It also adds graduate-only institutions and those offering degrees acceptable for admission to graduate programs. Foreign IHEs are eligible for participation in FFEL programs under specific provisions. The HEOA expands the definition of an institution of higher education to include various types of institutions and foreign schools under specific provisions. Effective July 1, 2008, proprietary foreign nursing schools are now eligible to participate in the FFEL program, contingent on meeting certain requirements. The \"90/10 Rule\" for proprietary institutions is eliminated from the definition of an IHE to prevent for-profit institutions from deriving all their income from Title IV student aid. The HEOA eliminates the 90/10 rule as a condition of institutional eligibility by removing it from the Title I, Part A definition of an IHE. It retains the provision by making it part of the Program Participation Agreement required under Title IV, Part G. The HEOA also amends provisions related to the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity and reauthorizes the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention program. The HEOA reauthorizes the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention program and extends the Protection of Student Speech and Association Rights provisions, emphasizing the importance of diversity in educational missions and the free exchange of ideas on campus. Students should not face discrimination or intimidation, and any sanctions should be fair and objective. This provision is often compared to an \"academic bill of rights.\" The HEOA adds new requirements to Title I, Part B related to college planning and financial aid information for students and families. This includes improving accessibility of department-provided information, collecting and making available online federal aid information, developing websites for members of the Armed Forces, veterans, and STEM students, and including both public and private sources of aid. The HEOA requires the Secretary to publish information on avoiding diploma mills and make data about institutions publicly available, including student enrollment, graduation rates, cost of attendance, and student aid. The HEOA expands data reporting requirements for higher education institutions and prohibits the creation of a federal student record database. It also establishes a grant program for State Higher Education Information Systems. The HEOA establishes a competitive grant program to support state-level postsecondary education data systems. It includes provisions on collecting data on college costs and prices, aiming to address college affordability through enhanced transparency and consumer information. Starting July 1, 2011, the Secretary must annually publish lists related to college affordability by institution sector. The HEOA establishes a competitive grant program to support state-level postsecondary education data systems, including provisions on college costs and prices for enhanced transparency. Lists are published annually starting July 1, 2011, ranking institutions based on net price, tuition and fees increases, and reporting requirements for cost control measures. A new \"maintenance of effort\" provision requires states to maintain funding levels for public and private institutions. The HEOA establishes a competitive grant program to support state-level postsecondary education data systems, including provisions on college costs and prices for enhanced transparency. If a state fails the MOE test, the Secretary is required to withhold the state's allotment of funds for the College Access Challenge Grant Program until corrective actions are taken. State-level data on changes in state spending per student, tuition and fees, and need-based and merit-based aid must be reported. An institution pricing summary page will be added to the College Navigator website, providing data on tuition, fees, net price, and changes in costs. The HEOA requires the development of net price and tuition calculators for students to estimate costs. Textbook publishers must provide price information and copyright dates to faculty. Publishers must also unbundle materials, making textbooks and supplements separate. Institutions must unbundle textbooks and supplements, provide course material information online, and share course schedules with bookstores. HEOA amendments mandate in-state tuition for military members and their families stationed in a state for over 30 days. The HEOA includes amendments related to in-state tuition for military members and their families. It also establishes disclosure and reporting requirements for lenders and institutions regarding federal student loans. Institutions in preferred lender arrangements must disclose maximum Title IV grant and loan aid available to students. Under the HEOA, institutions must disclose information about Title IV grant and loan aid, terms and conditions of loans, and the comparison between federal student loans and private education loans. Lenders of federal student loans must provide written information about loan terms, while lenders of private education loans must disclose detailed loan information to borrowers. Lenders of FFEL program loans must disclose detailed information to borrowers and the Secretary, including expenses paid to institutions. The Secretary, in coordination with the Federal Reserve, will determine minimum information for preferred lender arrangements. A model disclosure form will be developed for IHEs and lenders to provide information on FFEL and DL program loans and private education loans to prospective borrowers. Additionally, a self-certification form will be created for private education loan applicants. A self-certification form for private education loan applicants must be completed with information from the financial aid office of their institution. The form requires details such as cost of attendance, expected family contribution, and estimated financial assistance. It also informs applicants about potential eligibility for other forms of aid and the impact of a private education loan on their aid eligibility. Title II of the HEA authorizes grants for improving teacher education programs, strengthening recruitment efforts, and providing training for prospective teachers. Amendments under the HEOA include grants for these purposes. State and IHEs must report on the quality of teacher education programs. Prior to the HEOA, funds were allocated for State and Recruitment grants, but recent legislation has changed this distribution. Under the HEOA amendments, the State Grant and Recruitment Grant programs are eliminated, and 100% of Title II, Part A funds are authorized for the Partnership Grant program. The eligible partnership under the Partnership Grant program now requires two additional partners: a high-need school or early childhood education program, and a school, department, or program of education within a 4-year institution. The definition of a high-need LEA is also amended. The definition of a high-need LEA is amended to require serving either not less than 20% or not fewer than 10,000 children from families below the poverty line. The definition of a \"partner institution\" now includes two-year IHEs offering dual programs with four-year institutions. Partnership Grant funds can be used for Pre-Baccalaureate Preparation, Teacher Residency, or Leadership Development programs. The HEOA specifies activities for a Pre-Baccalaureate program, including program reforms, clinical experience, induction, early childhood education, recruitment, and literacy training. Funds can also be used for \"performance-based pay\" for teachers. A Teacher Residency program offers a one-year stipend for graduate-level teacher training in exchange for three years of service in a high-need school. Leadership Development Program is also mentioned. The HEOA establishes a Leadership Development Program to prepare students for careers as school administrators and enhances reporting requirements for teacher preparation programs. It increases the non-Federal funds matching requirement for Partnership grants to 100%. The HEOA eliminates the Preparing Tomorrow's Teachers to Use Technology program and establishes new programs, including Preparing Teachers for Digital Age Learners and Honorable Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence. These programs aim to prepare teachers to use modern technology tools, strengthen partnerships in teacher preparation, and assess the effectiveness of teacher training in technology-rich environments. The HEOA amendments introduce new programs like Teach to Reach grants for minority-serving institutions to support teacher quality, Preparing General Education Teachers for Students With Disabilities, and Adjunct Teacher Corps for subject matter experts in schools with shortages. The HEOA amendments establish a program called Graduate Fellowships to Prepare Faculty in High-Need Areas at Colleges of Education, providing fellowships to graduate students preparing to become education professors in STEM, special education, or limited English proficient education. Recipients must teach in a teacher preparation program for each year they receive a fellowship. Titles III and V of the HEA offer institutional support, including grants for minority-serving institutions to enhance their academic, administrative, and financial capabilities. Title III, Part A of the HEOA provides grants to eligible IHEs serving needy students, TCCUs, and ANNHSIs, while Title III, Part B supports HBCUs and HBGIs. Title V funds HSIs, and other MSI programs are authorized by Titles II, VI, VII, and VIII. The grants support activities like improving facilities, faculty development, and student services. The act also establishes three new MSI programs. The HEOA establishes a new Title III, Part A program for Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs), different from HBCUs, with specific eligibility criteria for grants. PBIs are colleges with over 40% black student populations, not founded during segregation. Eligibility includes accreditation, state authorization for undergraduate degrees, enrollment of at least 1,000 undergraduates, and specific expenditures per student. PBIs must meet a two-part test for enrolling underprivileged students: (1) at least 50% of students must receive Pell Grants, come from a family receiving means-tested federal benefits, attend a high school meeting certain criteria under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), or be first-generation college students; and (2) at least 50% of students must be either from low-income families (earning less than 150% of the Census definition of poverty) or be first generation college students. Grants can be used for various educational activities. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) establishes new programs to support underprivileged students at various types of institutions. Grants are to be divided among eligible institutions based on specific criteria, with minimum grant amounts set for each program. The programs aim to improve and expand capacity to serve Native American, Asian American, and Native American Pacific Islander students. The HEOA establishes programs to support underprivileged students at different institutions. Grants are given based on specific criteria to eligible institutions, including American Pacific Islander students. Title III, Part B of the HEA provides assistance to HBCUs and HBGIs to improve capacity to serve targeted students. Amendments require HBCUs to have enrolled Pell Grant recipients, successful graduates, and alumni in underrepresented graduate programs. The HEOA program supports underprivileged students at institutions by providing grants based on specific criteria. It adds six IHEs eligible for HBGI grants, with hold harmless provisions for previously included institutions. Funding above the aggregate amount may be awarded to newly added IHEs. No IHEs can receive HBGI grants if they are also receiving grants under Title V, Part B HSI graduate program or Title VII, Part A HBCU and PBI master's degree programs. Title III, Part C authorizes a grant program to increase endowments for eligible IHEs, with increased award amounts under the HEOA. The HEOA program increases maximum amounts for capital programs, federal bonding authority, and adds new programs like the YES Partnerships Grant Program to encourage minority students in STEM fields. Grants start at $500,000 and require matching non-Federal funds. The HEOA program provides grants starting at $500,000 for STEM fields, which must be matched by non-Federal funds. It also supports Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Other Minority-Serving Institutions with mandatory appropriations. The program eliminates eligibility for for-profit institutions and adds new appropriations for master's degree programs at HBCUs and PBIs. Additionally, the Secretary has waiver authority for IHEs affected by the Gulf Coast Hurricanes of 2005. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) provides grants for STEM fields, supports Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Other Minority-Serving Institutions. It also has waiver authority for institutions affected by the Gulf Coast Hurricanes of 2005. The act increases authorizations for Title III programs through FY2014, in addition to mandatory appropriations. Title IV programs are the main source of federal aid for postsecondary education, including Pell Grants, FFEL and DL programs, AC Grant, SMART Grant, TRIO programs, GEAR UP, FSEOG, LEAP, and FWS programs. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) provides grants for STEM fields, supports Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Other Minority-Serving Institutions. Title IV programs are the main source of federal aid for postsecondary education, including Pell Grants, FFEL and DL programs, AC Grant, SMART Grant, TRIO programs, GEAR UP, FSEOG, LEAP, and FWS programs. The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program, Federal Perkins Loan program, and parent PLUS Loan pilot auction program are authorized under different parts of the HEOA. The Federal Pell Grant program is the largest source of grant aid for postsecondary education funded by the federal government. The AC/SMART grant programs provide additional aid to certain Pell-eligible students. The CCRAA and HEOA amended the Federal Pell Grant Program to provide additional funding for Pell Grant awards through 2017. Maximum Pell Grant award amounts were increased to $8,000 for AY2014-2015. The CCRAA and HEOA increased maximum Pell Grant award amounts to $8,000 for AY2014-2015. The minimum Pell Grant award amount was changed to 10% of the appropriated maximum award amount, with a \"bump\" for certain students. Year-Round Pell Grants were introduced, allowing eligible students to receive a second Pell Grant during a single award year starting July 1, 2009. The HEOA allows for a second Pell Grant to be awarded to students in a single award year, supporting a summer term in addition to the regular academic year. Eligibility requires enrollment on at least a half-time basis in an associate's or bachelor's degree program. Ineligibility is extended to individuals in involuntary civil commitment centers, and there is a limit of 18 full-time semesters for Pell Grant eligibility for students who receive their first grant on or after July 1, 2008. After July 1, 2008, Pell Grant eligibility is limited to 18 full-time semesters. Individuals under 24 or enrolled at an IHE when their parent/guardian died in Iraq or Afghanistan after 9/11 are assigned an auto-zero EFC for Pell Grants. This increases their eligibility for other Title IV aid. The American Competitiveness Grant program offers awards to Pell Grant-eligible students meeting academic requirements. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) provides Pell Grants for first- and second-year undergraduates who completed a rigorous secondary school program, and National SMART Grants for third- to fifth-year undergraduates majoring in specific fields. The HEOA amends the AC Grant program to recognize rigorous secondary school programs and makes technical corrections. It also authorizes Federal Early Outreach and Student Services Programs, including the Federal TRIO programs. The Federal TRIO programs, including Talent Search, Upward Bound, Student Support Services, Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement, and Educational Opportunity Centers, provide support to students through competitively awarded grants. The HEOA extends eligibility to community-based organizations, removes restrictions on secondary schools, and synchronizes grant durations. The HEOA extends TRIO grants to five years, increases minimum grant amounts, requires outcome criteria for evaluation, considers grantee experience, allows multiple grants to campuses, and expands veterans' eligibility. The HEOA expands veterans' eligibility for TRIO grants by updating program authority language, prohibiting denial of student participation based on grade level, and allowing flexibility in defining summer recess periods. It also creates subsections for required and permissible services in each program. The HEOA expands TRIO grants eligibility for veterans by updating program authority language and allowing flexibility in defining summer recess periods. It also includes new requirements for TRIO evaluations, prohibiting the Secretary from implementing an \"absolute priority\" for student eligibility and recruiting students as a control group. The HEOA prohibits requiring grantees to recruit students as a \"control group\" for program evaluation in GEAR UP. The program aims to increase disadvantaged students' school completion and postsecondary enrollment by providing support services and financial aid. Amendments include maintaining a six-year grant period, expanding the application process, and allowing entities to accrue non-Federal funds for the 50% matching requirement. The HEOA amendments allow entities to accrue non-Federal funds for the grant match, modify the match at application or in response to a petition, and clarify eligible activities. Priority students now include homeless youth and disconnected students. State grantees can use less than 50% for scholarships if other funds are shown, must notify students of scholarship eligibility, and provide scholarships upon secondary school completion and college enrollment. The HEOA amendments authorize Grants to States for State Student Incentives, increasing the maximum allowable grant amount to $12,500 or a student's cost of attendance. The Special LEAP program is replaced with a new program called Grants for Access and Persistence (GAP), which provides matching funds to states for state need-based scholarships. Federal funds may be used for scholarships for students in college. Unused funds must be returned to the Secretary. The Grants for Access and Persistence (GAP) program provides matching funds to states for state need-based scholarships. GAP requires partnerships between states, IHEs, philanthropic organizations, and private corporations. GAP grants fund early awareness and outreach activities, support services, and scholarships equal to average tuition and fees at similar public IHEs. Low-income students in grades 7 through 12 are annually notified of financial aid availability, including GAP scholarships. GAP also has a maintenance of effort provision to ensure state contributions do not decrease annually. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) reauthorizes various education programs, including the Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant program and the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker programs. It also amends the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program and the Child Care Access Means Parents in School program. The HEOA clarifies provisions for the Subpart 7, Child Care Access Means Parents in School program, and Subpart 9, TEACH Grant recipients. It explains the differences between the FFEL and DL student loan programs. The HEOA includes amendments to federal student loan programs, providing Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. Amendments also apply to military servicemembers and veterans, excluding Veterans' Education Benefits from Subsidized Stafford Loans as estimated financial assistance. Effective July 1, 2010, veterans' education benefits are excluded from estimated financial assistance for Subsidized Stafford Loans. Borrowers of FFEL and DL program loans who enter military service may have their interest rate capped at 6% under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. For loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2008, interest rates can be capped at 6% during military service under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. Interest above 6% must be forgiven, and repayment cannot be accelerated. DL program loans disbursed after October 1, 2008, do not accrue interest for up to 60 months during active duty or qualifying National Guard duty in hostilities. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) requires the Secretary to offer Consolidation Loans under the Direct Loan program to borrowers seeking to use the no accrual of interest for active duty service members program. The benefit is available for loans first disbursed on or after October 1, 2008. The HEOA also adds requirements for institutions, lenders, and other entities to provide specific information to students and borrowers. Lenders must inform borrowers of the impact of interest capitalization during forbearance, and provide updates every 180 days. Lenders must inform borrowers of the impact of interest capitalization during forbearance, including the accrual of interest, total unpaid principal, and when interest will be capitalized. Borrowers of Consolidation Loans must be informed of potential loss of loan benefits. New requirements mandate detailed disclosure of terms and conditions for Federal Student Loans. The HEOA amendments require lenders to disclose detailed information about FFEL and DL program loans to borrowers at various stages, including approval, disbursement, repayment, and during repayment. Information to be disclosed includes charges, fees, interest rates, interest capitalization on unsubsidized loans, total balance owed, estimated monthly payments, repayment options, borrower benefits, and consequences of default. Guaranty agencies are also required to provide consumer education information. The HEOA amendments require guaranty agencies (GAs) to collaborate with institutions of higher education (IHEs) to develop and offer educational programs on budgeting and financial management for students and families. GAs are prohibited from offering inducements to secure applicants for FFEL program loans or to lenders for loan insurance purposes. Consumer education information activities are now considered default reduction activities under the HEOA. The HEOA amendments prohibit guaranty agencies from offering inducements to secure applicants for loans or loan insurance purposes. The amendments also establish new reporting requirements for voluntary flexible agreements between the Secretary and guaranty agencies. Expansion of Financial Institutions Treated as Eligible Lenders under the FFEL program allows national and state chartered banks and credit unions with assets of less than $1 billion to participate without restrictions on the percentage of consumer credit function related to FFEL program loans. Disqualification as an Eligible Lender for Use of Incentives prohibits offering inducements to institutions of higher education and conducting unsolicited mailings of student loan applications. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) prohibits financial institutions from offering inducements to institutions of higher education and engaging in fraudulent advertising related to student loan applications. Additionally, the HEOA restricts certain forms of incentives, such as consulting arrangements with financial aid offices and compensating employees for service on lender-established entities. The Act also amends provisions related to PLUS loans, including extenuating circumstances for making loans to borrowers with adverse credit histories. The ECASLA amendment specifies extenuating circumstances for PLUS Loans, allowing applicants with specific delinquency periods on mortgage or medical bill payments. The HEOA further refines this provision, effective July 1, 2008, to only include delinquency on mortgage payments for a primary residence or medical bills. The HEOA amends terms for PLUS Loans, allowing deferment for parent PLUS Loans based on student eligibility and deferring repayment for graduate and professional student PLUS Loans. It also extends loan forgiveness programs, including Teacher Loan Forgiveness for Employment in Educational Service Agencies. The HEOA amends terms for PLUS Loans, allowing deferment for parent PLUS Loans based on student eligibility and deferring repayment for graduate and professional student PLUS Loans. It also extends loan forgiveness programs, including Teacher Loan Forgiveness for Employment in Educational Service Agencies and Loan Forgiveness for Service in Areas of National Need. This new program provides loan forgiveness of up to $2,000 per year for borrowers employed full-time in specified areas of national need, with a maximum amount forgiven of $10,000 for five years of service. A new program is established to provide loan repayment to individuals who serve as civil legal defense attorneys for at least three years. The Secretary will make payments of up to $6,000 per year and $40,000 in total on federal student loans. The program is available on a first come, first served basis and is subject to appropriations. The program offers loan repayment to civil legal defense attorneys who serve for at least three years, with payments of up to $6,000 per year and $40,000 in total on federal student loans. Loans can be discharged for borrowers who die, become permanently disabled, or are unable to work due to a physical or mental impairment. The HEOA amends provisions related to IHEs' rates of students defaulting on federal student loans by changing the calculation of cohort default rates to be based on the number of borrowers entering repayment and defaulting within a two-year period. Borrowers determined to be unemployable due to a service-connected condition are considered permanently and totally disabled. The HEOA amends provisions related to IHEs' rates of students defaulting on federal student loans by changing the calculation of cohort default rates. It includes current and former student borrowers of Subsidized Stafford Loans, Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and graduate PLUS Loans who enter repayment and default within a three-year period. The new life of cohort default rate measures the cumulative percentage of borrowers who have defaulted since entering repayment. The HEOA amendments change the calculation of cohort default rates for IHEs, with eligibility loss if rates exceed 25% for 3 years. Starting FY2012, rates exceeding 30% for 3 years lead to loss of eligibility. IHEs can appeal for relief due to exceptional circumstances and must prepare default reduction plans. The Federal Work-Study program offers opportunities for students. Title IV, Part C includes the Federal Work-Study (FWS) program, offering paid employment for students related to their field of study or community service. Amendments under the HEOA allow FWS funds to compensate students in civic education projects, with a federal share of up to 75%. Grants are also authorized for community service job compensation. The Federal Perkins Loan program, under Title IV, Part E, provides low-interest loans to students. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) amends the Federal Perkins Loan program by increasing borrowing limits for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. It also allows institutions to refer defaulted loans to the Secretary without recompense under certain conditions, restricts mandatory assignment of defaulted loans, and treats collected amounts as federal capital contribution. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) increases borrowing limits for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. It also amends requirements for the discharge and cancellation of Perkins Loans, including disability discharge for borrowers unable to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental impairment. Loan cancellation under the HEOA is extended to borrowers of Perkins Loans for various public service roles, with rates ranging from 15% to 30% based on years of service. Additionally, borrowers determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be unemployable due to a service-connected condition are considered permanently and totally disabled. The Federal Perkins Loan program is emphasized as an important part of federal student aid, remaining campus-based at colleges and universities. Title IV, Part F outlines the expected family contribution (EFC) towards postsecondary education costs. The HEOA introduces changes to the need analysis calculation, allowing adjustments for nursing home expenses, adult dependent care, and dislocated workers in determining financial aid awards. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) introduces changes to the need analysis calculation for financial aid. This includes adjustments for nursing home expenses, adult dependent care, and dislocated workers. Additionally, the HEOA allows financial aid administrators to award Unsubsidized Stafford loans to students whose parents have stopped financial support. The Act also makes technical corrections to the independent student definition related to foster youth and treats income from cooperative education programs as excluded income. Effective dates vary for these changes, with some taking effect upon enactment and others on July 1, 2010. The HEOA introduces changes to the need analysis calculation for financial aid, including adjustments for military service members and veterans. For military service members living on base, only board (not room) is included in the total cost of attendance. Housing stipends are not counted as untaxed income. Veterans' education benefits are excluded from income/assets and estimated financial assistance. This allows veterans to potentially receive benefits exceeding their COA. A veteran with three years of active duty since September 11, 2001, is eligible for veterans education benefits under the Post-9/11 Veterans Education Assistance program. This includes tuition and fees coverage, a $1,000 book allowance, and a monthly housing allowance. These benefits are excluded from income and financial aid calculations, allowing veterans to receive substantial assistance without impacting their eligibility for other aid. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) makes technical amendments to provisions governing Title IV student aid programs. It includes changes to the process of applying for student financial aid, such as the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and EZ-FAFSA for qualifying students. These changes do not affect eligibility for need-based and non-need-based aid under Title IV. The section requires streamlining the FAFSA to reduce data elements by 50% and explore using IRS data to pre-populate the form. A group will study alternative approaches for calculating the EFC. The HEOA authorizes a demonstration program for early conditional aid offers based on income for dependent students. States can apply to participate in the program. A group will develop a model format for financial aid offer forms. The HEOA expands student eligibility requirements for federal aid, including drug conviction ineligibility. The HEOA expands student eligibility for federal aid, including drug conviction ineligibility and provisions for students with intellectual disabilities to receive Pell Grant, FSEOG, and FWS aid. Students with drug convictions must pass two random drug tests by a rehabilitation program to regain eligibility. The Secretary is required to study and report on the effects of drug conviction ineligibility. The HEOA expands student eligibility for federal aid, including provisions for students with intellectual disabilities to receive Pell Grant, FSEOG, and FWS aid. It also modifies requirements for satisfactory academic progress and ability to benefit provisions. Additionally, it adds readmission requirements for servicemembers returning from active duty. The HEOA adds readmission requirements for servicemembers returning from active duty, ensuring they are readmitted at the same academic status. It also includes disclosure and reporting requirements for IHEs under Title IV, Part G, expanding information disclosure to current and prospective students. The HEOA adds disclosure requirements for IHEs, including policies on copyright infringement, student body diversity, employment outcomes, graduate education enrollment, fire safety report, and student retention rates. Additionally, IHEs must report reimbursements for financial aid office employees serving on advisory boards. The HEOA requires institutions to report expenses reimbursed to financial aid office employees serving on advisory boards established by private educational lenders. Completion and graduation rate data must be disaggregated based on various student demographics, with exemptions for two-year degree-granting institutions until 2011-2012. The Secretary will convene a group to consider additional measures of student success for these institutions. The HEOA requires institutions to report expenses reimbursed to financial aid office employees serving on advisory boards established by private educational lenders. Completion and graduation rate data must be disaggregated based on various student demographics, with exemptions for two-year degree-granting institutions until 2011-2012. The Secretary will convene a group to consider additional measures of student success for these institutions, including Campus Crime, Emergency Response, and Fire Safety Requirements. This includes expanding the list of crimes for which IHEs must indicate whether the crime committed was a \"hate crime\" and establishing policies related to immediate emergency response and evacuation procedures. IHEs are also required to test their emergency response and evacuation procedures annually. The HEOA mandates that institutions disclose fire safety practices, transfer of credit policies, missing person procedures, and drug policy notifications. IHEs must publish an annual fire safety report and publicly disclose their credit transfer policies. They are also required to develop missing person procedures for on-campus students and provide drug violation penalties to enrolled students. The Higher Education Act (HEA) mandates penalties for drug violations and provides information for students to regain Title IV eligibility. It also requires confidentiality in the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and the development of articulation agreements between institutions. The Higher Education Act (HEA) mandates penalties for drug violations and provides information for students to regain Title IV eligibility. It also requires confidentiality in the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and the development of articulation agreements between institutions. New requirements under the HEOA to the Program Participation Agreement include disclosures to victims of crimes and the addition of the \"90/10 Rule\" for proprietary institutions. This rule is no longer a condition of institutional eligibility for Title IV programs. Proprietary institutions violating the 90/10 rule will be placed on provisional eligibility status for two years. If the violation persists for two consecutive years, they will lose Title IV eligibility for at least two years. The HEOA allows new revenue sources to count towards the 10% non-Title IV requirement, such as revenue from approved non-Title IV programs. The HEOA allows proprietary institutions to have Title IV programs fully paid for by federal student aid, with 90% of total revenue coming from Title IV programs and 10% from non-Title IV programs.
