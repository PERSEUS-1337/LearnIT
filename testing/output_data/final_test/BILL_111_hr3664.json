    "content": "The \"Healthcare Innovation Zone Pilot Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. This Act establishes the Healthcare Innovation Zone Pilot Program. The Healthcare Innovation Zone Pilot Program aims to increase provider integration and align incentives to reduce healthcare costs while improving quality of care for Medicare, Medicaid, and privately insured patients. It includes new clinical initiatives for training healthcare professionals in a cost-effective, high-quality model. The program consists of an HIZ planning grant program and an HIZ pilot project. Within 6 months of this Act, the Secretary will accept applications for HIZ planning grants. Grants will be awarded to groups of clinical entities for researching and preparing an HIZ design plan. Eligible applicants must provide a full spectrum of healthcare services and include a teaching hospital, along with other clinical entities and schools of medicine or health professions. An application for a grant under this section must include a description of the geographic region for the Health Impact Zone (HIZ), expertise in engaging community and clinical leaders for HIZ design, and a proposed budget for creating the HIZ design plan. The Secretary gives preference to grant applications for Health Impact Zones (HIZ) caring for diverse populations with committed partners. Recipients must submit an HIZ design plan within a year, detailing care delivery estimates and the structure of the HIZ Coordinating Entity. The HIZ Coordinating Entity will oversee care provision and manage payments. The plan must outline how care will be provided, reduce healthcare spending, integrate providers, and improve care quality. The plan for the HIZ must include a description of the target population, quality metrics for measuring improvement, training of healthcare professionals, addressing barriers to care provision, and infrastructure details. The plan for the HIZ must include infrastructure for data collection, monitoring health costs, prevention strategies, community involvement, payment options, and start-up costs. The Secretary will award up to 25 planning grants ranging from $250,000 to $1,000,000 each. $25,000,000 is authorized for the first fiscal year, with additional funds for subsequent years. SEC. 4. HEALTHCARE INNOVATION ZONE PILOT PROJECT. The Secretary will establish an HIZ pilot project to test the effectiveness of HIZs in reducing healthcare costs and improving care quality for Medicare, Medicaid, and privately insured patients. The pilot project will last at least 3 years and may be renewed at the Secretary's discretion. Eligible individuals can apply to participate in the project by submitting an application with required information. HIZ providers must meet additional requirements to participate in the pilot project. The HIZ pilot project requires providers to offer comprehensive healthcare services to at least 50% of the HIZ population, maintain or improve service quality, and report on changes in clinical education processes. The Secretary will distribute payments to the HIZ Coordinating Entity for Medicare beneficiaries participating in the project. Medicare beneficiaries in the HIZ pilot project will receive Medicare payments adjusted based on the growth rate of the HIZ. Providers must waive additional reimbursement rights under title XVIII of the Social Security Act for services provided to Medicare patients. The Secretary may waive requirements under titles XI, XVIII, and XIX of the Social Security Act for the HIZ pilot program. A streamlined Medicare or Medicaid waiver application form will be released to facilitate HIZ pilot projects. Antitrust laws will not prohibit lawful provision of health care services in pilot projects. Under this section, individuals authorized to carry out legitimate activities shall not be considered illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade under antitrust laws if following the approved business model. Reports must be submitted by those establishing an HIZ pilot project, and the Secretary must provide evaluations to Congress annually. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.
