The paper introduces the Online Output Kernel Learning Algorithm (OOKLA) for continuous lifelong multitask learning. It addresses memory explosion by proposing budget-limited versions and a two-stage budgeted scheme. Empirical results show superior AUC performance for OOKLA on three datasets. The Online Output Kernel Learning Algorithm (OOKLA) and its budget-limited versions show superior AUC performance over strong baselines in lifelong multitask learning. Learning from multiple tasks leverages relationships among tasks to build better models and transfer knowledge effectively. This paper focuses on continuous lifelong learning where tasks and examples arrive online without a predetermined order. The learner in lifelong learning receives examples from tasks, predicts output labels, updates models based on true labels, and follows an error-driven update rule. Challenges include minimizing prediction errors for all tasks and maintaining computational tractability. The goal is to learn new tasks efficiently by leveraging previous knowledge without forgetting old tasks. The paper addresses lifelong multitask learning by re-estimating task relations and model parameters in a streaming fashion. It introduces the Online Output Kernel Learning Algorithm (OOKLA) to efficiently learn task relationships and avoid memory explosion. The key challenge is adaptively learning model parameters and task relationships with a large number of tasks. The proposed Online Output Kernel Learning Algorithm (OOKLA) efficiently updates task relationships in real-time by computing similarity between new and representative examples, adjusting relationships based on label similarity, and avoiding memory explosion in lifelong learning. The proposed algorithm efficiently utilizes task relationships in lifelong learning by limiting the number of representative examples in the support set. It also introduces a two-stage budgeted scheme to address task-specific budget constraints. Online multitask learning is closely related to lifelong multitask learning, with the key difference being the requirement of specifying the number of tasks beforehand. In this paper, the proposed method for online multitask learning, also known as lifelong learning, is evaluated with various state-of-the-art online learning algorithms. Lifelong learning has applications in optimizing financial trading, email prioritization, personalized news, and spam filtering. The latter involves different types of spam tailored to individual user interests, forming an inter-task relationship matrix. Learning this matrix improves spam filtering models. The primary contribution of this paper is the joint learning of inter-task relationships for estimating per-task model parameters in lifelong learning. Different from existing models, it proposes an intuitive way to automatically learn the task relationship matrix. The paper proposes an intuitive way to learn the task relationship matrix automatically and take into account the learned relationships during model updates. Task relationship prior knowledge is often unavailable or expensive to obtain, especially with a large number of tasks. The model's high computational complexity can be reduced with a different formulation for learning inter-task weights. Our proposed approach learns both positive and negative correlations between tasks for robust knowledge transfer. Recent work in output kernel learning estimates the task covariance matrix in RKHS space, but most methods require access to the entire data, which is not feasible in online or lifelong learning settings. In lifelong learning, task relationships are crucial but challenging to exploit due to the difficulty in learning a positive semi-definite task relationship matrix in large-scale applications. This paper presents an efficient method to learn the task relationship matrix, addressing the limitations of existing approaches. The paper introduces a method to learn the task relationship matrix in lifelong learning, focusing on updating the model only when learner predictions differ from true labels in a mistake-driven approach. The method introduced focuses on updating the model when learner predictions differ from true labels using multitask kernel functions and a support set of stored examples. The online classification function is defined as a weighted sum of kernel combinations from the support set, considering both input space and output kernels. Our objective is to address key challenges in lifelong learning with kernels, focusing on efficiently learning task relationships and managing the support set size to prevent memory explosion. The classification function involves a linear combination of support set examples weighted by input and task similarity kernels. The model updates when learner predictions differ from true labels using multitask kernel functions. The objective function for lifelong learning involves a loss function, regularization on task relationship matrix \u2126, and a regularization parameter \u03bb. Efficient updates to \u2126 are needed to reduce time per time-step. By considering a subset of regularization functions, we can efficiently learn the task covariance matrix. The update function for \u2126 can be obtained by considering entry-wise l p norm or generalized KL-divergence between \u2126 and \u2126 (t\u22121). The update function for the task relationship matrix \u2126 involves computing similarity between new and support set examples to adjust the matrix entries. Positive or negative correlations are reflected based on label similarity and scaled by a regularization parameter \u03bb. The update function for the task relationship matrix \u2126 involves adjusting matrix entries based on similarity between new and support set examples, scaled by a regularization parameter \u03bb. The update equations ensure that the matrix remains positive semi-definite, and Algorithm 1 outlines the key steps in the proposed method for budgeted learning. Algorithm 3: Two-Stage Budgeted Learning introduces a support set removal scheme to address computational issues in lifelong learning caused by unbounded growth of the support set S. Various budget maintenance strategies have been proposed, but they are not directly applicable due to output kernels in the learning formulation. The proposed scheme is based on BID8 and involves removing examples from the support set when it exceeds a specified limit B. In the support set S, when the number of examples exceeds the limit B, an example x r with the highest confidence is chosen for removal. This approach is extended to multitask and lifelong learning settings, where examples are chosen based on confidence and task relationships. The proposed budgeted learning algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art strategies in handling large numbers of tasks and examples. The proposed two-stage budgeted learning algorithm for lifelong learning involves maintaining task-specific support sets and choosing a budget for each task. Examples are removed from the support set when it exceeds the budget, improving runtime complexity compared to previous algorithms. The proposed two-stage budgeted learning algorithm for lifelong learning involves maintaining task-specific support sets and choosing a budget for each task. Examples are removed from the support set when it exceeds the budget, improving runtime complexity compared to previous algorithms. This approach allows for a more efficient selection of examples, especially when dealing with a large number of tasks. The algorithm also offers an alternative to using state-of-the-art budget maintenance strategies, such as the Projectron algorithm, on task-specific sets rather than the entire dataset. Performance evaluation is conducted on three benchmark datasets using 5-fold cross-validation for parameter selection. The Newsgroups Dataset 2 consists of 20 tasks from comp and talk.politics subjects, each with positive/negative classes. The ECML PAKDD 2006 Discovery challenge dataset is used for spam detection, with each user as a task for personalized spam filtering. The dataset used for spam detection includes examples of spam and non-spam messages with 150K features representing word frequencies. User interests are modeled by learning per-user parameters from other users' data. Additionally, product reviews from 25 domains were evaluated, with each domain treated as a binary classification task based on ratings. Reviews with ratings > 3 were labeled positive, < 3 negative, and = 3 discarded. Each review example has 350K features representing word frequencies. For experiments, a small training set of 2000 examples from 20 Newsgroups, 1500 emails for spam, and 2500 reviews for sentiment was used. The datasets had a class-imbalance issue, so AU C was used as the performance measure. The proposed algorithm (OOKLA) was evaluated using the three datasets and compared to 5 baselines, including Perceptron and Passive-Aggressive algorithm (PA) BID9 for online multitask learning. The Perceptron and Passive-Aggressive algorithm (PA) BID9 are baseline models for online multitask learning. Our approach includes FOML, OMTRL, and OSMTL for multitask learning. We compare our proposed methods with OSMTL, which learns a probabilistic distribution over tasks. Our algorithm has two versions with different update rules for the task-relationship matrix. The update rules for the task-relationship matrix, OOKLA-sum and OOKLA-exp, outperform baselines in terms of AU C and nSV. Results show adaptive learning improves performance, with OOKLA and OSMTL consuming less CPU time than baselines considering inter-task relationships. Our proposed methods update the task-relationship matrix independently for each task, outperforming OSMTL in the Newsgroup dataset. Comparisons with different budget schemes and sizes show significant performance improvements in terms of AU C scores and runtime. Our proposed budgeted learning algorithm for online multitask learning outperforms state-of-the-art budget schemes on most settings. It efficiently uses task relationships to select examples for removal, resulting in over 16% improvement in running time compared to other schemes. The two-stage budgeted scheme shows significant performance improvements in terms of AU C scores and runtime. The proposed lifelong learning algorithm using output kernels achieved over 16% improvement in running time compared to the budget maintenance scheme in Algorithm 2. The method efficiently learns both the model and inter-task relationships, with update rules motivated by recent work in output kernel learning. A new budget maintenance scheme was proposed to handle memory explosion by removing least-useful examples using the task relationship matrix. Additionally, a two-stage budget learning scheme was introduced based on the intuition that each task requires a subset of representative examples. The proposed algorithm efficiently learns inter-task relationships by removing least-useful examples based on task relationships. It outperforms competitive baselines in handling large numbers of tasks in real-life applications."
