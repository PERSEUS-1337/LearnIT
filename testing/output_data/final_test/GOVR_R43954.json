In the US, sex offender policy focuses on managing offenders post-conviction, with strategies like civil commitment, residence restrictions, and registration. Federal legislation mainly addresses sex offender registration. Federal legislation on sex offender registration and notification is crucial for tracking offenders before and after their release. All states have registries, but they vary in information collected and offender classification. To comply with federal law, jurisdictions must register incarcerated sex offenders before release or within three days of sentencing. Sex offender notification refers to how jurisdictions disseminate information. The term \"sex offender notification\" refers to how jurisdictions disseminate relevant information about offenders to the community. Legislation like the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) aims to standardize notification practices and create a publicly accessible Internet gateway for offender information. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) established a classification system for sex offenders and requires jurisdictions to inform offenders of their registration duties before release or sentencing. 17 states, 3 territories, and some American Indian tribes have implemented SORNA, while others have objected to its requirements. The sex offender registration system in the United States varies by jurisdiction, with different states using different criteria for classification. As of December 2014, there were approximately 819,218 registered sex offenders in the country, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). However, the accuracy of this data is limited due to potential double-counting of offenders. Some state registries may include individuals who are incarcerated or deported. Some studies have described the demographics of sex offenders residing in the United States, with one study using a sample of over 400,000 registered sex offenders. The study found that they were largely male (98%) and white (66%), with a mean age of 45 years old. While offenders in all registries were over 90% male, race varied widely across states. For example, as of 2010, offenders registered in Alaska were 57% native and 36% white, while offenders registered in California were 46% white, 31% Hispanic, and 17% black. States also varied in how offenses were captured in registries and described to the public. The Jacob Wetterling Act and Megan's Law were passed by Congress in response to concerns over sex offenders. These laws aimed to establish guidelines for states to create and maintain sex offender registration systems and induce law enforcement agencies to release relevant information to the public. The Pam Lychner Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 (Lychner Act; P.L. 104-236) amended the Jacob Wetterling Act to establish a national database within the FBI to track certain sex offenders. It required offenders in states without sufficient registration programs to register with the FBI and notify them of address changes. The FBI can release relevant information collected under state registration programs for permissible purposes. The FBI is required to verify the offender's address and may release necessary information to protect the public. The Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1998 made changes to sex offender requirements for states, including designating a law enforcement agency for registration and participation in the FBI's national sex offender registry. The Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act in 1998 required states to set up procedures for registering out-of-state sex offenders and mandated sex offenders to register in states where they worked or attended school. It also extended registration requirements to federal and military court convictions and directed state courts to consider recommendations from experts, victims' advocates, and law enforcement agencies. Additionally, federal and military authorities were required to notify offenders of the registration requirement. The Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, requires individuals to notify higher education institutions of their sex offender registration status. It also mandates prompt sharing of information with law enforcement and inclusion in state data systems. Additionally, certain institutions must inform the campus community about accessing sex offender registry data. The PROTECT Act of 2003 mandated the release of information on registered sex offenders and the creation of a national website linking state websites with registry data. It also provided funding for states to comply with new requirements. The SORNA law in 2006 replaced earlier registration and notification components. The SORNA law in 2006 absorbed and replaced earlier registration and notification components, establishing the SMART Office within DOJ. It also implemented a 10% funding reduction for non-compliance. The Keeping the Internet Devoid of Sexual Predators Act of 2008 expanded SORNA to require sex offenders to report \"internet identifiers\" to registries. The federal government plays a significant role in sex offender registration and notification by setting requirements for states, providing assistance, maintaining a national website on registered sex offenders, and addressing issues with federal and military sex offenders. The federal government maintains a national website on registered sex offenders and sets standards for sex offender registration, including tier classification, required information, and jurisdictional requirements. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) extends registration requirements to tribal jurisdictions and allows the Attorney General to enforce reporting requirements for offenders convicted before SORNA's enactment. Noncompliant states risk losing 10% of their JAG funds, but many are seeking reallocation for SORNA implementation. The United States Marshals Service is tasked with investigating sex offender registration violations. The US Marshals Service leads efforts to ensure sex offenders comply with registration requirements, working with state and local law enforcement. Through initiatives like \"Operation Safety Net,\" they verify offenders' addresses and apprehend those out of compliance. The National Sex Offender Targeting Center supports the identification and apprehension of noncompliant fugitive sex offenders. The US Marshals Service leads efforts to ensure sex offenders comply with registration requirements, working with state and local law enforcement. They verify offenders' addresses and apprehend those out of compliance. The Center collaborates with SMART and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children to support law enforcement in pursuing noncompliant sex offenders. Federal grants support state agencies in sex offender management, including grants for SORNA implementation. The SMART Office administers the SORNA implementation grant program, which has received continued appropriations, including $20 million in FY2015. The Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website, established under the Adam Walsh Act, is administered by the SMART Office and links all public registry sites in the United States. The FBI operates a national database to track convicted sex offenders. The FBI's Offenders Registry is part of the NCIC and is used for law enforcement purposes. The Attorney General informs jurisdictions about sex offenders entering the US, and it is a federal crime for a sex offender to travel abroad without registering. Sex offenders must report international travel 21 days in advance. Current federal efforts to track international whereabouts of registered sex offenders include USMS, INTERPOL Washington-USNCB, and ICE. They use data from state and local jurisdictions, CBP, and DHS to identify offenders departing the United States. Congress may address issues like notification of offenders' international travel and registration problems. The USMS, USNCB, and ICE collaborate to monitor registered sex offenders' international travel. However, there are challenges with incomplete information and foreign officials not always tracking offenders returning to the US. The FBI is working on a process to notify relevant authorities when offenders travel internationally, but ICE needs to request this information. ICE has not requested automated notifications for registered sex offenders leaving the country via land ports of entry. Congress may address this issue through oversight or legislation, such as the International Megan's Law (H.R. 515) which aims to establish the Angel Watch Center within ICE to track child-sex offenders' travel and maintain relevant information. The three agencies involved in notifying foreign travel do not consistently share information, leading to gaps in notifying foreign counterparts about registered sex offenders traveling internationally. Military sex offense convictions trigger registration requirements, but there is no separate registry for federal and military sex offenders. Individuals convicted of military sex offenses must register in the jurisdictions where they reside, work, and/or attend school following their release from incarceration. The military and federal correctional authorities must notify relevant jurisdictions of the release of sex offenders into their communities. A recent investigation found that some military sex offenders failed to register, prompting Congress to consider additional oversight or creating a separate registry for military offenders. A bill has been introduced to require the Department of Defense to maintain a sex offender registry for military members. Many states have not complied with sex offender registry requirements. Many states have not complied with the sex offender registry requirements, citing reasons such as cost, disagreement with certain requirements, and belief in their own system's effectiveness. Some states, like Texas, have opted to forego federal funds due to unwillingness to comply with the law, citing concerns about the oversimplified registration requirements and high implementation costs. Many states, including Texas and New York, object to SORNA's requirement to register juveniles as sex offenders without judicial discretion. New York emphasizes its policy of rehabilitating juvenile offenders. While Texas has forfeited some JAG funds, New York and other noncompliant states seek reallocation of funds for SORNA implementation efforts. Some researchers question the effectiveness of SORNA's classification scheme and suggest using evidence-based models for sex offender risk assessment. Studies indicate that SORNA implementation may not increase public safety and could cost states more money. GAO found mixed results on the impact of SORNA. The GAO identified mixed results of SORNA implementation, with some positive effects like enhanced information sharing on sex offenders, but also negative effects such as increased workloads and difficulties for offenders. No study has evaluated the impact on public safety, prompting Congress to consider changes to SORNA, including removing penalties for noncompliance or requiring a scientific evaluation of its impact on public safety. Congress may address issues with SORNA implementation through reauthorization of the Adam Walsh Act, which expired in 2009. Reauthorizing the act or amending it may be done to reauthorize certain programs or amend SORNA."
