    "title": "SB 527",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, approved as Proposition 47 in 2014, reduced penalties for nonviolent crimes. State savings are deposited in the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund for crime prevention and support services, including truancy and dropout prevention. 25% of the funds go to the State Department of Education for a grant program to help at-risk students. The funding provided to K\u201312 education under the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act should be used to support nonpunitive programs for at-risk students to improve school engagement and climate. California aims to increase knowledge on effective strategies for improving pupil success and eliminating the school-to-prison pipeline. This includes providing resources to establish community schools and address attendance issues in early grades. Local educational agencies participating in the K\u201312 education grant program are encouraged to report and evaluate outcomes using multiple measures, while sharing successful strategies with other agencies statewide. The Learning Communities for School Success Program is established to implement the K\u201312 education portion of the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act. The program provides grants and assistance to local educational agencies to support evidence-based, nonpunitive programs aligned with pupil goals in local control and accountability plans. Local educational agencies applying for funding under the Learning Communities for School Success Program must submit an application to the department, including information on pupil and school needs, planned activities, alignment with local goals, and outcome measurement strategies. The department may establish requirements for grantees to meet at the end of the first and second years of funding in order to receive funding for the remaining grant period. Grant eligibility and distribution are based on pupil and school needs, number of pupils served, participating schools, challenges faced by the agency, and unique characteristics of small school districts. Before the initial application deadline, the department will offer targeted outreach and technical assistance to local educational agencies likely to receive priority for grants. Assistance with application development may be provided to any agency upon request, including support from external entities contracted by the department. The department will issue application guidelines with information on program evaluation and identifying measures for assessing pupil and school outcomes. The department will consult with stakeholders, including representatives of local educational agencies, teachers, parents, and advocacy organizations, to gather input on grant design and review process. Stakeholders will not determine grant recipients. A local educational agency receiving a grant must use the funds for evidence-based programs to support vulnerable students, in line with their local educational goals. This may include establishing community schools and implementing initiatives to improve attendance and reduce absenteeism. Implementing restorative practices, restorative justice models, social-emotional learning, positive behavior interventions, and trauma-informed strategies. Establishing partnerships with community-based organizations to support nonpunitive approaches for addressing chronic attendance problems. Adding staff to address ongoing truancy issues. The department prioritizes grant recipients based on criteria such as high rates of chronic absenteeism, out-of-school suspension, or school dropout, being located in a high crime community, or having a significant number of foster youth enrolled. A local educational agency receiving a grant must have a significant representation of foster youth among its students. The agency must provide a 20% matching contribution, which can be in cash or in-kind, and is encouraged to exceed this amount. Grant funds should be used to enhance existing services and cannot be used for law enforcement activities. The department will use funding from the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act for administrative costs related to implementing the article, including grant awards, training, and evaluation. The department will provide training and technical assistance to grantees through regional workshops and experts in pupil engagement, school climate, truancy reduction, and supporting at-risk students. They may contract with providers to assist grantees and other educational agencies. Technical assistance will align with support provided for local control and accountability plans. The local educational agency receiving grant funding must evaluate and report results to the governing board and the department. The department will compile information for an overall evaluation of the grant program, assessing benefits and outcomes. Interim and final evaluation reports are due to the Legislature by January 31, 2019, and January 31, 2020, respectively. Reports must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code. Section 10231.5 of the Government Code states that the section will be repealed on January 31, 2024. Definitions for \"community school\" and \"local educational agency\" are provided. The article will only be effective if funds are allocated to the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund. Section 3 of the act will only be in effect if Assembly Bill 1014 from the 2015-16 Regular Session is enacted by January 1, 2017."
