    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Distance Education and Online Learning Act of 2003\". Student eligibility is addressed in Section 2. Section 2 of the Distance Education and Online Learning Act of 2003 amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding student eligibility. It specifies the requirements for institutions of higher education to qualify as eligible programs. Section 481(b) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to allow programs offered predominantly through distance education methods to be eligible if approved by a recognized accrediting agency and if the institution offering the program has not had its participation in programs limited or suspended. The institution must meet certain criteria to be eligible for programs authorized by this title, including not having had programs limited, suspended, or terminated in the past 5 years, not having unresolved audit findings in the past 2 years requiring repayment of over 10% of funds received, and not being found in material noncompliance with the Act in the past 5 years. The institution must meet eligibility criteria, including no past program limitations, unresolved audit findings, or noncompliance with the Act in the past 5 years. Failure to comply with audit report submission or financial responsibility regulations may result in program ineligibility. If accreditation is withdrawn or requirements are not met, the program will cease to be eligible until compliance is restored. The Secretary will establish regulations to determine if a program offering a degree or certificate based on competency assessment is eligible. SEC. 4. RECOGNITION OF ACCREDITING AGENCY OR ASSOCIATION. Section 496 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include accreditation of institutions offering distance education programs within the scope of recognition for agencies or associations that meet the requirements. The Higher Education Act of 1965 now includes accreditation of institutions offering distance education programs within the scope of recognition for agencies or associations. Education programs must demonstrate measures of student achievement, faculty and student preparation, quality of interaction, availability of resources, and integrity of student participation in distance education programs."
