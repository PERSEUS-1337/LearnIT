    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Flight Attendant Certification Act\". The Federal Aviation Administration mandates cabin crew on transport category aircraft to handle emergencies, including medical situations, fires, and security threats. Cabin crew are safety-sensitive employees tested for drug and alcohol use, with regulations on duty time and rest periods. Training quality varies among air carriers, while other safety groups like pilots and mechanics are also certified by the FAA. Certification of cabin crew by the Federal Aviation Administration ensures their qualification for safety and security duties, including pilots, mechanics, and parachute packers. Training programs for cabin crew are outlined in Section 3. Section 44935 of chapter 449 of part A of subtitle VII of title 49, United States Code, is amended to include new training standards for cabin crew members. These standards mandate certification for all cabin crew after completing an air carrier's training program, which covers initial, indoctrination, emergency training, air carrier-specific training, and submission by the air carrier. The Administrator is required to confirm completion of training by the air carrier for cabin crew members. The Administrator cannot grant waivers or exemptions for cabin crew training requirements. To qualify for a cabin crew certificate, members must complete all training requirements established by the Administrator. To qualify for a cabin crew certificate, members must complete transition, recurrent, and requalification training, cabin security and self-defense training, and perform assigned duties with at least 5 hours of initial operating experience under supervision. Initial operating experience for cabin crew members must be conducted on an operating flight without reducing the required cabin crew complement, with a maximum of 2 crew on a narrow-body aircraft or 4 crew on a wide-body aircraft. Deviations, exemptions, and waivers are not allowed. The cabin crew certificate must be numbered and recorded by the FAA, include personal details of the holder and their current employer, and have safety terms determined by the Administrator to remain valid unless suspended or revoked. The cabin crew certificate must include personal details, be numbered, and have safety terms determined by the Administrator to remain valid. Air carrier training programs require approval by the FAA Administrator for consistent training and competency. Only FAA headquarters staff can approve training programs. The FAA Administrator must approve air carrier training programs for cabin crew on transport category aircraft with 20 or more seats. The approval authority cannot grant exemptions or waivers from approved training requirements."
