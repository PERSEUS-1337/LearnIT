    "content": "The Act titled \"Wild Sky Wilderness Act of 2002\" is established. Congress finds that Americans value diverse wilderness ecosystems and wildlife on Federal lands, feeling a moral responsibility to protect this heritage for future generations. The benefits of wilderness areas are enhanced by their diversity in topography, ecosystems, and recreational opportunities accessible year-round. Large blocks of wildlands with varied ecosystems and topography are important for conservation efforts. Certain wildlands in the Skykomish River valley of Washington represent the original forested landscape with diverse ecosystems, including high alpine meadows, rugged peaks, and old-growth forests with large trees. These areas harbor a variety of wildlife and fish species from the 19th century. The Skykomish River valley in Washington is home to diverse wildlife and fish species from the 19th century, including mountain goats, bald eagles, black bear, and endangered species like northern spotted owls and wild salmon. This ecologically diverse wilderness area is accessible year-round and caters to hikers, hunters, anglers, and nature enthusiasts who value clean water and pristine scenery. Congress declares it a policy to protect and serve this diverse wilderness. The policy of the United States aims to protect lower elevation wildlands in the Skykomish River valley of Washington and adjacent lands to the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness. This is in tribute to the ecologically enlightened vision of a former Senator from Washington. SEC. 3. ADDITIONS TO THE NATIONAL WILDERNESS PRESERVATION SYSTEM. The Wild Sky Wilderness in Washington State, totaling approximately 106,000 acres, is designated as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide a map and legal description of the wilderness area to the relevant congressional committees. The Secretary of Agriculture can correct errors in the legal description and map of the Wild Sky Wilderness. These documents will be available for public inspection at the office of the Chief of the Forest Service. SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS. The Secretary of Agriculture shall manage designated wilderness lands in accordance with the Wilderness Act and this Act. A hiking trail plan will be established within two years of enactment to develop a system of trails in or near the wilderness areas. Within two years of enactment, the Secretary of Agriculture will complete a report on the hiking trail plan implementation, identifying priority trails. In the Wild Sky Wilderness, helicopter access may be used to construct a repeater site for communication purposes. Floatplane access on Lake Isabel will be allowed with reasonable restrictions. The Secretary of Agriculture may allow continued activities with reasonable restrictions. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to acquire lands, prioritize \"Priority Acquisition Lands,\" and adjust boundaries of the Snoqualmie National Forest and Wild Sky Wilderness. Access to private inholdings within the Wild Sky Wilderness must be assured. Valuation of private lands for acquisition should not consider restrictions due to wilderness designation. Land exchanges are also permitted. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to exchange lands with the Chelan County Public Utility District, as depicted on a map dated May 22, 2002. If the District offers approximately 371.8 acres within the Snoqualmie National Forest, the Secretary must accept. In return, the Secretary will convey a permanent easement, including helicopter access, to the District. The Chelan County Public Utility District can maintain a snowtel site on 1.82 acres in the Wenatchee National Forest, Washington. The exchange will be finalized if the District conveys acceptable title and there are no hazardous materials on the site. If the District no longer needs the site for monitoring snowpack, the easement will be extinguished, and rights will revert to the United States."
