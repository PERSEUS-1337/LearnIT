The Congress finds that there are approximately 100,000,000 unexploded antipersonnel landmines in over 60 countries, posing a significant global threat. Landmines, like chemical and biological weapons, cause indiscriminate harm. Following a US moratorium on landmine exports, the UN and several countries have also called for international export bans. Despite export moratoriums announced by the US and South Africa, more antipersonnel landmines are being laid than cleared, resulting in at least 1,200 casualties per month, with women and children making up a significant portion. International cooperation is crucial to limit the production, possession, transfer, and use of these deadly weapons to prevent further loss of innocent lives. The United States must show leadership in solving the landmine crisis as preparations for the 1995 Conventional Weapons Convention, including the Landmine Protocol, are underway. The sense of Congress is for the President to actively seek international agreements to prohibit antipersonnel landmines and to pursue interim measures to limit their production and use. Additionally, there is a moratorium on the production and procurement of antipersonnel landmines. (a) Sense of Congress is that a moratorium on the purchase and production of antipersonnel landmines by the United States would set an example for other nations. (b) Effective 90 days after enactment, the US Government will not buy or make antipersonnel landmines. (c) This prohibition will last for one year from the enactment date. (d) The President is urged to persuade major antipersonnel landmine producers to also implement a moratorium during this period. The President may extend the moratorium on antipersonnel landmines for major producers listed, including Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Authorization of $25,000,000 for demining activities in fiscal year 1995, including humanitarian efforts, education, training, and support for clearing landmines. Contributions to UN funds and NGOs for the same purpose. Analysis of costs and effects of antipersonnel landmines. The Administrator of the Agency for International Development and the Secretary of State must submit a joint report to Congress within six months of the enactment of this Act. The report will analyze the social, economic, and environmental costs and effects of antipersonnel landmines in at least three countries. The Secretary of Defense will also submit a report on the total number of military personnel. Congress requires a report detailing the number of US Armed Forces members killed or wounded by antipersonnel landmines in various conflicts. The Secretary of Defense must submit this report alongside another required report. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.
