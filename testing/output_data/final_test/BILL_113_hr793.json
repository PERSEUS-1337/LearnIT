The grant program established by the Attorney General allows law enforcement agencies to conduct anti-violence campaigns, gun safety campaigns, and firearms buyback programs.

The program ensures that firearms obtained will be disposed of appropriately and none of the grant funds will be used for promoting firearm sales.
