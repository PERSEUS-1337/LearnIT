    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers various programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty, venture capital, contracting, direct loan, and management assistance programs. Congressional interest in these programs has grown due to their role in stimulating economic activity and job creation. This report analyzes SBA appropriations since FY2000. Since FY2000, SBA appropriations have varied significantly across different spending categories, including disaster assistance, business loan credit subsidies, and other programs. The variation in disaster assistance funding is mainly due to supplemental appropriations for addressing disasters. Total available funding includes carryover from previous fiscal years, account transfers, and sequestration. Actual and anticipated expenditures for SBA's entrepreneurial development noncredit programs are also provided for comparison. The variation in SBA appropriations since FY2000 is largely due to supplemental funding for disaster assistance and business loan credit subsidies. Business loan credit subsidies represent the net present value of cash flows for SBA loan portfolios, affected by factors like default costs and revenue from fees. The variation in subsidies is primarily influenced by changing economic conditions impacting guaranteed loan portfolios. During economic slowdowns, SBA fees and collateral liquidation may not cover the cost of purchasing defaulted guaranteed loans. This shortfall is due to increased loan purchase costs and constrained revenue from loan liquidation. Additional appropriations are required to cover these expenses, guaranteed by the \"full faith and credit of the United States.\" Since FY2000, appropriations for SBA programs in the other programs spending category have increased to enhance small businesses' access to capital during economic changes. The SBA's appropriations have varied significantly, ranging from $571.8 million in FY2007 to $2.359 billion in FY2018. Appropriations for SBA programs have varied significantly since FY2000, ranging from $571.8 million in FY2007 to $2.359 billion in FY2018. The volatility is primarily due to variations in disaster assistance and business loan credit subsidies, with supplemental appropriations provided for major hurricanes. During economic downturns, revenue from fees and collateral liquidation may not cover the costs of purchasing defaulted loans in SBA's loan portfolios. Appropriations for SBA's other programs have varied significantly since FY2000, with temporary increases in funding to enhance small businesses' access to capital during and after the Great Recession. Appropriations for the SBA's other programs have consistently exceeded inflation rates from FY2000 to FY2019. Table 1 shows the SBA's total available funds, with carryovers and account transfers helping to stabilize the budget. Disaster assistance appropriations play a role in evening out the budget over multiple fiscal years. The section further analyzes appropriations for salaries and expenses, business loan administration, the Office of Inspector General, the Office of Advocacy, and entrepreneurial development noncredit programs within the SBA. The SBA's salaries and expenses account funds office operating budgets, agency-wide costs, employee compensation, and reimbursable expenses. Adjustments were made for meaningful comparisons over time, such as separating ED program appropriations into their own account. Table 2 deducts appropriations for ED programs and earmarks from reported salaries and expenses to focus on administrative expenses. Advocacy's funding prior to FY2012 was under salaries and expenses, now has its own account for comparisons. The SBA's appropriations for salaries and expenses have varied over the years, increasing from $176.490 million in FY2000 to $267.500 million in FY2019, exceeding the rate of inflation. Funding for Advocacy through the salaries and expenses' executive direction subaccount was 79% of its total cost in FY2003-FY2005, with estimates for FY2006-FY2010 derived by multiplying total program costs by 79%. The SBA's appropriations for business loan administration increased from $129 million in FY2000 to $155.150 million in FY2019, exceeding inflation. The SBA has authority to transfer appropriations from the business loan administration account to the salaries and expenses account, which has been done every fiscal year from FY2000 to FY2018.
