    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, Imperial Japanese forces cut off communication to the Armed Forces and Filipino troops in the Far East. Corregidor fell on May 6, 1942, followed by the surrender of American forces on May 10, 1942, on the island of Mindanao. In April 1942, General Wainwright surrendered Allied Forces in the Philippine Archipelago. Despite being cut off, troops bravely defended Bataan for over 4 months, changing the war's momentum and delaying the Japanese invasion. During the Bataan Death March in April 1942, Major General Edward King surrendered troops from the United States and the Philippines to the enemy. Thousands of soldiers were taken prisoner and forced to march 65 miles without food, water, or medical care, resulting in many deaths from starvation, lack of medical care, and exhaustion. Conditions at the prisoner of war camps, particularly Camp O'Donnell, were appalling, leading to high death rates due to disease and malnutrition. Nearly 26,000 Filipino prisoners died at Camp O'Donnell, with survivors gradually paroled from September to December 1942. Survivors of the death march were later shipped north for forced labor between September 1942 and December 1944. During World War II, prisoners of war were subjected to horrific conditions, including forced labor on \"hell ships\" where many perished. The sinking of the Arisan Maru alone claimed nearly 1,800 lives. The University of Santo Tomas was converted into an internment camp by the Japanese, where army and navy nurses were held until their liberation. Prisoners in the camps endured mistreatment, malnutrition, and lack of medical care. The veterans of Bataan endured mistreatment, malnutrition, and lack of medical care until their liberation in 1945. They represented diversity and were honored in memorials. The US Navy named ships after them, including the USS Bataan (LHD-5), in memory of their valor against Japanese forces. Many survivors have passed away. Many survivors of Bataan have passed away, but those remaining continue to share their stories. The US and Philippines are grateful for their courage during WWII and their perseverance during years of captivity. The US and Philippines are grateful for the courage of Bataan survivors during WWII and their perseverance during years of captivity. Congressional Gold Medal.
