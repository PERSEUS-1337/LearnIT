    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Geothermal Initiative Act of 2007\". Congress recognizes the potential of domestic geothermal resources to provide clean, renewable energy to the United States. Federal policies and tax modifications are crucial to support geothermal development. Research programs are needed to increase energy production and develop technologies for commercial use. A national resource assessment is necessary. A comprehensive national resource assessment is needed to support policymakers and industry needs for increased geothermal energy production. Additionally, a national exploration and development technology center should be established. Implementation of geothermal and other renewable initiatives on public land in the United States is critical, in line with relevant laws. The national goal is to achieve 20 percent of total electrical energy production in the United States from geothermal resources by 2030. Definitions for terms like \"Initiative\" and \"Secretary\" are provided in the Act. The Act establishes a national geothermal initiative. The national geothermal initiative aims to achieve a 20 percent share of total electrical energy production in the US from geothermal resources by 2030. Federal agencies will prioritize programs to support this goal, including characterizing the geothermal resource base and sustaining a 10 percent annual growth rate in geothermal power usage. The national geothermal initiative aims to achieve a 20 percent share of total electrical energy production in the US from geothermal resources by 2030. Federal agencies will prioritize programs to support this goal, including demonstrating state-of-the-art energy production, achieving new power production in at least 25 states, and developing tools for geothermal power plants. A report to Congress will be submitted every 3 years to track progress towards these goals. The Secretary will carry out a geothermal research program to achieve the national goal, prioritizing funding for resource discovery and drilling, and establishing a research center for this purpose. The university research center selected by the Secretary will support the development and application of new geothermal exploration technologies, disseminate geological data, and collaborate with States and regional initiatives to expand knowledge of the geothermal resource base in the United States. The curr_chunk discusses improving high-temperature and high-pressure drilling technologies for geothermal well construction, demonstrating geothermal applications in noncommercial settings, and researching engineered geothermal systems techniques for commercial use. The curr_chunk discusses funding for geothermal technologies and applications, including tracer development, 3-dimensional tomography, and seismic effects of deep drilling. Authorization of appropriations includes $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, $110,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2012, and necessary sums for fiscal year 2013 onwards. The Secretary of the Interior is required to conduct a nationwide geothermal resource assessment by 2010 and submit the results to Congress. Planning and leasing activities must align with the national goal established by the Act. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary of the Interior to carry out geothermal resource assessment: $15,000,000 for 2008, $25,000,000 annually from 2009 to 2012, and necessary sums from 2013 to 2030. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to authorize $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2013 and necessary funds from 2014 to 2020 for the Intermountain West Geothermal Consortium. Additionally, there is support for international markets in developing geothermal energy. SEC. 7. INTERNATIONAL MARKET SUPPORT FOR GEOTHERMAL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT. The United States Agency for International Development, along with other agencies, will support international geothermal development, including the African Rift Geothermal Development Facility. The United States Trade and Development Agency will also support this initiative by encouraging U.S. firms to participate and providing financial support for studies. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the implementation of this section."
