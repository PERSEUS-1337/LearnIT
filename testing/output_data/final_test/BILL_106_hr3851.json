    "content": "Election for special tax treatment of certain S corporation conversions. A qualified electing S corporation may elect special tax treatment for an eligible corporate conversion by transferring to a partnership without recognizing gain or loss for shareholders. Other distributions of money or property will be treated as payment in exchange for stock. An eligible corporate conversion allows a qualified electing S corporation to transfer assets to a partnership without recognizing gain or loss for shareholders, as long as certain conditions are met. An eligible corporate conversion allows a qualified electing S corporation to transfer assets to a partnership before December 31, 2005, meeting specific requirements, including maintaining business continuity for 5 consecutive taxable years or paying a corporate conversion recapture. The continuity of the qualified electing S corporation's business is defined as either the continuation of historic lines of business or the use of a significant portion of historic business assets in an active trade or business. The term \"corporate conversion recapture tax\" refers to a recomputation of tax as if a partnership were an S corporation, with its stock owned like partnership capital, and the S corporation dissolved with assets distributed to shareholders. The corporate conversion recapture tax involves liquidating the partnership at the end of the taxable year, with basis rules applying to property in the partnership's hands post-conversion. The special tax treatment for an eligible corporate conversion requires the qualified electing S corporation to file a written election with the timely information return for the taxable year in which the conversion occurs."
