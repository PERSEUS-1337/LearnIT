Liability Exemption: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 is amended to provide Small Party Liability Relief. A person not impeding response actions or natural resource restoration at a facility or vessel shall not be liable solely based on certain conditions related to waste disposal. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 is amended to provide Small Party Liability Relief for residential property owners, small businesses, and small non-profit organizations. A small business is defined as employing no more than 100 individuals according to the Small Business Act. This subsection does not affect the liability of any other person. SEC. 3. INNOCENT LANDOWNERS. Environmental Site Assessment requirements for innocent landowners who acquired real property after April 15, 1994, include conducting an environmental assessment meeting specific criteria within 180 days prior to acquisition. The assessment must adhere to ASTM Standard E1527-94 or alternative standards approved by the Administrator, deemed commercially reasonable and generally accepted. The Administrator must study commercial and industrial practices before issuing alternative standards. The Administrator must consider various requirements when issuing standards for property contamination assessments, including interviews with stakeholders and reviewing historical sources to determine past uses of the property. The property contamination assessment involves reviewing various sources like easements, leases, restrictions, aerial photographs, and government records to identify past uses and potential contamination sources. Additionally, the assessment includes checking for environmental cleanup liens and investigating sites likely to cause contamination. The property contamination assessment includes reviewing investigation reports, records of activities likely to cause contamination, and government environmental records. It also involves a visual site inspection of the real property and its facilities. The property contamination assessment involves reviewing investigation reports, adjacent property inspections, hazardous substance practices, landowner expertise, purchase price relation to property value, known information about the property, presence of contamination, and public record availability. The property contamination assessment requires appropriate inquiry, including maintaining a compilation of information gathered during the environmental site assessment and taking steps to address hazardous substances found on the property. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) amendment requires full cooperation and access to conduct response actions or natural resource restoration at contaminated facilities. An exception is provided in Section 107(b)(3)(a) for exercising due care, except as provided in subsection (p). The amendment to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) includes changes to Section 101(35) regarding the assertion of liability by facility owners or operators. The amendment specifies conditions for asserting acts or omissions of previous owners or operators and requires all appropriate inquiry as specified in section 107(p) for acquisitions. The amendment to CERCLA includes changes to liability assertion for facility owners or operators, requiring all appropriate inquiry for acquisitions before April 15, 1994. SEC. 4. LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY FOR RESPONSE COSTS FOR PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS. Limitations on Liability for Prospective Purchasers under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9607) include conditions such as being a bona fide prospective purchaser, not impeding response actions, and providing required notices for hazardous substances. The facility must exercise appropriate care regarding hazardous substances, including stopping ongoing releases, preventing future releases, and limiting exposure to previously released substances. Full cooperation, assistance, and facility access must be provided to authorized persons conducting response actions. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 is amended to include provisions regarding prospective purchasers and windfall liens. This includes protection for purchasers who did not contribute to contamination and are not liable for response costs at the facility. The United States may have a lien on a facility under the National Contingency Plan if the owner is not liable, with the amount not exceeding the costs of response or the property's fair market value increase due to the response action. The United States may have a lien on a facility under the National Contingency Plan, arising when costs are first incurred for a response action. The lien continues until satisfaction or recovery of all costs incurred, and can be settled at any time. Conditions for the lien are specified in subsection (l)(3). The Common Sense Superfund Liability Relief Act of 1999 defines a \"bona fide prospective purchaser\" as someone who acquires a facility after the enactment of the Act and carries out a response action that increases the facility's fair market value. The Common Sense Superfund Liability Relief Act of 1999 allows a person to establish pre-acquisition disposal of hazardous substances at a facility and compliance with inquiry standards to qualify for liability relief. The Common Sense Superfund Liability Relief Act of 1999 allows a person to establish compliance with inquiry standards for liability relief. Alternative standards designated by the President shall satisfy the requirements for residential property purchases by noncommercial entities. Legally required notices and appropriate care must be exercised regarding hazardous substances at the facility. The person must exercise appropriate care by taking steps to stop ongoing releases, prevent future releases, and limit exposure to hazardous substances. They must also provide full cooperation, assistance, and facility access to authorized persons conducting response actions. The person must provide cooperation and access for the installation, integrity, operation, and maintenance of response actions at the facility. They are not liable for response costs at the facility if they have no direct or indirect familial, contractual, corporate, or financial relationship with potentially liable parties."
