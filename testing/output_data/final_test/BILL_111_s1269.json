    "content": "The \"Food Safety Rapid Response Act\" is the short title of the Act. It includes provisions for enhanced foodborne illness surveillance. The \"Food Safety Rapid Response Act\" mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to strengthen foodborne illness surveillance systems to prevent outbreaks and improve response efforts. A foodborne illness outbreak is defined as cases of human illness caused by a specific pathogen found in multiple states, suggesting contamination of a commercially distributed food product. The Secretary is required to enhance foodborne illness surveillance systems to improve data collection, analysis, and reporting on illnesses associated with foods. This includes coordinating surveillance and environmental assessment systems to produce better information on sources and risk factors for infections by emerging pathogens. The FDA, Food Safety and Inspection Service, and local agencies collaborate with the food industry and the public. Improvements include better attribution of foodborne illness outbreaks, identifying contributing factors, and developing tools for data collection and case classification. The FDA and other agencies collaborate with the food industry and the public to improve foodborne illness surveillance and environmental assessment systems. This includes developing tools for data collection, case classification, and pathogen discovery efforts. Timely access to de-identified surveillance data and annual reports on findings are also emphasized. The FDA and other agencies collaborate with the food industry and the public to improve foodborne illness surveillance and environmental assessment systems. This includes exploring the establishment of registries for long-term case follow-up and increasing the participation of public health officials at all levels in national networks to share laboratory findings and identify foodborne illness outbreaks. Improving State Surveillance Capacity includes supporting outbreak investigations with specialty expertise, disseminating findings, and enhancing surveillance in States. This involves collaborating with academic centers of excellence and establishing a flexible mechanism for scientific research support. The curr_chunk discusses identifying and supporting model practices at the State and local level for facilitating rapid shipment of clinical isolates, conducting standardized interviews for enteric pathogens, evaluating healthy control persons, and providing environmental assessment tools during foodborne illness outbreak investigations. The curr_chunk focuses on sharing information timely among public health and food regulatory agencies, conducting a systematic review of data sharing barriers, developing training curricula for foodborne illness surveillance, and integrating molecular diagnostic tools for parasites into Web-based services. The curr_chunk focuses on accelerating identification of foodborne infectious agents, developing new subtyping methods for pathogens, determining core competencies for public health labs, facilitating regional lab partnerships, and providing technical assistance to public health and food regulatory agencies. The curr_chunk emphasizes collaboration with the FDA to enhance foodborne illness surveillance, outbreak investigation, and standardizing response procedures. The curr_chunk introduces the establishment of Food Safety Centers of Excellence. The Secretary, in consultation with a working group, will establish 5 regional Food Safety Centers of Excellence at selected State health departments to serve as resources for public health professionals. Eligible entities must be State health departments partnering with institutions of higher education with relevant expertise. The Secretary will establish a diverse working group of experts and stakeholders to make recommendations regarding designations of the Regional Centers of Excellence. The Secretary may designate additional regional Food Safety Centers of Excellence, in addition to the 5 designated under subsection (a). Each Center of Excellence, based out of a selected State health department, will provide assistance to other health departments through activities such as interviewing individuals for surveillance, analyzing foodborne disease surveillance and response activities, and providing epidemiological training. The Secretary may designate additional regional Food Safety Centers of Excellence to provide training, fellowships, and research activities focused on food safety. Within 2 years of enactment, a report to Congress detailing these efforts must be submitted. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of Centers of Excellence and provide legislative recommendations or additional resources needed. $20,000,000 is authorized for this section and will remain available until expended."
