    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 50199.10 of the Health and Safety Code designates the committee as the sole housing credit agency for allocating low-income housing credits under federal law. The committee is responsible for determining and allocating the state ceiling for housing credits annually, in accordance with federal regulations. This includes entering into regulatory agreements for awarded projects. The committee develops application forms for housing credit applicants and adopts procedures for submission and review, including fees to cover administrative costs. Fees may be charged as a condition of submitting an application or receiving an allocation of the state's housing credit ceiling. Additionally, the committee may reserve a portion of the anticipated housing credit ceiling for future applicants. The committee may require housing credit applicants to deposit money as a good-faith undertaking. Policies will determine when deposits are needed, procedures for return, and conditions for forfeiture if the allocation is not utilized timely. The committee can allocate the state's housing credit ceiling to applicants with conditions to comply with federal and state laws, additional requirements, and potential legal action for breach of contract. No allocations or reservations will be made for projects that do not meet the qualified allocation plan requirements or the requirements of Section 42 of Title 26 of the United States Code. The committee may establish fines for violations of terms and conditions, regulatory agreements, or program regulations, up to $500 per violation or double the financial gain. Property owners have 30 days to correct violations before fines are imposed, with the option to appeal to the committee. The committee can establish fines for violations, with fines deposited into the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Fund. If a fine is not paid within six months, a lien may be recorded against the property."
