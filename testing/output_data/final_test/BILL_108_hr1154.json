    "content": "The Act is titled the \"American Servicemember and Citizen Protection Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to the act. The Congress finds that in 1998, a diplomatic conference in Rome proposed the Statute of the International Criminal Court for ratification by member states, with the requirement of 60 ratifications for the Statute to take effect. In April 2002, the 60th member state ratified the Statute of the International Criminal Court, allowing jurisdiction over individual United States citizens. President George W. Bush later rejected the United States' signature on the Statute, stating the country could no longer be a party to the Court. According to the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the United States cannot be bound by the Statute of the International Criminal Court as it has not consented to it. The Statute is considered an unauthorized act by the United Nations, enacted in contravention of the powers of the Security Council. The Statute of the International Criminal Court is criticized for claiming jurisdiction over US citizens without consent, violating principles of government by consent, separation of powers, federalism, and trial by jury as guaranteed by the US Constitution. The International Criminal Court is seen as illegitimate, putting US citizens at risk of unlawful prosecution, especially members of the US Armed Forces. United States citizens, including members of the Armed Forces, deserve full protection under the Constitution, the very law they risk their lives to defend. The United States prohibits the use of government funds for the International Criminal Court. Any action by the ICC against US Armed Forces members or citizens is considered aggression or an offense against the law of nations, respectively. Penalties are imposed for violations. Any person who knowingly violates section 3 of the law shall face a fine of up to $50,000, imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both."
