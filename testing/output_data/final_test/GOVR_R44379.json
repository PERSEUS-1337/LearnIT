    "content": "The Administration proposed a total budget of $619.5 billion for National Defense-related activities in FY2017, with 95% allocated to military activities of the Department of Defense. The remaining budget includes funds for defense-related nuclear energy activities and activities of other agencies, with a portion allocated to the FBI. Discretionary spending for National Defense totals $609.9 billion, provided by annual appropriations bills, while $9.6 billion is mandatory spending for entitlement programs and other payments. The DOD budget for FY2017 is divided into base budget activities and non-base budget activities. The discretionary budget totals $582.7 billion, with $523.9 billion for the base budget and $58.8 billion for non-base budget activities. The base budget request is compliant with spending caps set by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. The base budget request for FY2017 is $2.2 billion over the FY2016 enacted budget, but $23.4 billion below the amount forecast for FY2017 by the President's FY2016 request. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established caps on discretionary budget authority for defense and nondefense programs. The most recent changes to the caps on defense programs occurred with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, raising the FY2017 cap to $548.1 billion. The FY2017 DOD base budget request includes reductions in Military Personnel accounts and increases in Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) accounts. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised the FY2017 cap for defense programs to $548.1 billion, with an imputed cap of $526.3 billion on DOD discretionary appropriations. The President's FY2017 OCO request matches the nonbinding level provided by the BBA, including funding for activities not covered in the base budget. The FY2017 OCO request includes funding for U.S. presence in Afghanistan, operations against ISIS in the Middle East, capacity building for Iraqi and Syrian opposition forces, and support for partner nations in counterterrorism efforts. It also allocates $3.4 billion for the European Reassurance Initiative to enhance U.S. presence in Eastern Europe. The budget proposes a reduction in active duty military personnel, with the Army decreasing by 15,000 and the Navy by 4,400. The budget proposes a revision of TRICARE for military healthcare, increasing some user costs while decreasing others, yielding net savings to DOD in FY2017 of about $500 million and total savings through FY2021 of $6.9 billion. The Administration proposed modifications to the military retirement system and requested funding for the recapitalization of nuclear-armed weapons and development of a new strategic bomber. The Air Force requested $1.4 billion for the long-range strategic bomber project, reflecting a reduced cost estimate. The Air Force requested $1.4 billion for the long-range strategic bomber project, reflecting a reduced cost estimate due to competition. The request also includes funding for a new bomber-launched missile, the Long Range Stand-Off Weapon (LRSO), and for a new class of ballistic missile-launching submarines. The budget includes funding for new land-based ICBM development, Ground-based Mid-course Defense system deployment, long-range missile detection radar development, and European Phased Adaptive Approach Phase III. Additionally, funds are allocated for a new satellite launch vehicle to replace Russian-built engines. The Administration's FY2017 budget request of $296.6 million for the Army, not informed by recommendations from the Commission on the Future of the Army, prioritized readiness over modernization. The budget included transferring Apache attack helicopters and the possibility of amendments after weighing the Commission's proposals. The Administration's FY2017 budget request prioritized readiness over modernization, with a significant reduction in funds for Army aircraft procurement. The request included funding for DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, Virginia-class submarines, and Littoral Combat ships. The Administration's FY2017 budget request includes $1.3 billion for two Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs), allowing the Navy to fund a second ship in FY2017 while preserving the 40-ship ceiling. Additionally, the budget request would amend current law to deactivate one of the Navy's ten carrier air wings. The Navy's FY2017 budget request includes reallocating aircraft from Air Wing 14 to improve readiness in other wings, saving $80 million. Proposed legislation would allow the Navy to modernize and return Aegis cruisers to service, saving upwards of $200 million with total savings projected through FY2021 of $3 billion. Congressional defense committees have rejected similar proposals in the past. The FY2017 budget request includes funds for 63 Joint Strike Fighters, with a reduction in F-35A procurement for the Air Force but an increase in F-35B for the Marine Corps. The budget also includes funds to upgrade earlier generation fighters to compensate for delays in F-35 fielding. The FY2017 budget request includes funds for various military programs, such as replacing Navy F/A-18s, modernizing Air Force F-16s, and keeping A-10 ground-attack planes in service. The budget also includes funds for military construction and family housing. The FY2017 budget request includes $7.6 billion for military construction and family housing, a decrease from previous years. The OCO portion of the request shows a shift in DOD construction funding from the Middle East to Europe. The FY2017 OCO military construction request of $172.4 million includes airfield improvements in Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland, as well as facilities in Iceland and Germany for Navy's P-8A Poseidon and Air Force's F/A-22 Raptor aircraft. The remaining funds are for projects in Djibouti."
