    "content": "In the weeks leading up to Operation Odyssey Dawn, the uprising in Libya against Muammar al Qadhafi's government sparked debates on international military intervention. On March 17, 2011, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1973, establishing a no-fly zone in Libyan airspace to protect civilians from attacks. This led to intensified policy debates in the US, allied countries, and the Middle East. The authorization and launch of U.S. and coalition military operations in Libya have raised concerns about the capacity of opposition forces to dislodge Qadhafi. Resolution 1973 calls for a cease-fire and dialogue, posing a challenge for the U.S. in reconciling regime change with enforcing the resolution. The use of force for regime change may have unpredictable consequences for the region's stability. The report provides an overview of military operations in Libya under U.S. command from March 19 to March 29, 2011, and the transfer of command to NATO on March 30. NATO's Operation Unified Protector aims to protect civilians from the Gaddafi regime by enforcing an arms embargo and a no-fly zone over Libya. Operation Unified Protector, commanded by Canadian Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, enforces a UN-mandated arms embargo, a no-fly zone over Libyan territory, and protects civilians from attacks by Qadhafi regime forces. NATO member states, including the United States, have committed military forces to the mission. President Obama has called for Qadhafi to relinquish power and leave the country. The President and his Administration supported UN Security Council Resolution 1970, imposing an arms embargo and sanctions on Qadhafi. Resolution 1973 demanded a cease-fire in Libya, raising questions about US actions to end Qadhafi's rule. Military operations in Libya began on March 19. On March 19, military operations in Libya began following discussions among civilian defense officials and military officers about political and operational considerations shaping the Administration's decision-making process regarding a possible no-fly zone. Defense Secretary Gates emphasized the importance of strong regional support, while U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice publicly supported further international steps, including Security Council discussions. On March 17, 2011, discussions were held by the Security Council regarding international steps, including a no-fly zone, in response to the conflict in Libya. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz stated that establishing a no-fly zone would take about a week and would require neutralizing Libyan anti-aircraft sites. Ambassador Rice explained the U.S. vote in favor of Resolution 1973 as a response to the Libyan people's plea for help. President Obama, in response to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973, emphasized the need for a cease-fire in Libya to protect civilians. He stated that Qaddafi must halt attacks, withdraw troops, and provide essential supplies to areas in need. Humanitarian assistance must be allowed, and compliance with the resolution is non-negotiable, with military action as a consequence for non-compliance. President Obama emphasized the need to protect civilians in Libya through military action to enforce Resolution 1973. The focus is on preventing atrocities by the Qaddafi regime and stabilizing the region to avoid a humanitarian crisis. The United States is prepared to act as part of an international coalition and provide unique capabilities to support the enforcement of the resolution. The United States is enforcing Resolution 1973 in Libya to protect civilians by providing unique capabilities to allies and partners. Ground troops will not be deployed, and force will only be used for the specific goal of civilian protection. Military operations began on March 19, with a focus on preventing a humanitarian catastrophe and establishing a no-fly zone. The President authorized limited strikes to enforce U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 in Libya, emphasizing U.S. military support for international coalition efforts. Congressional approval was sought under the War Powers Resolution. Senator John McCain introduced S.Res. 102 calling for recognition of the Libyan Transitional National Council as the legitimate governing authority, implementation of a no-fly zone in Libya with international support, and a comprehensive strategy to remove Qaddafi from power. Representative Ron Paul introduced H.Con.Res. 31 expressing the need for congressional authorization before any military intervention in Libya. The resolution expresses Congress's belief that the President needs specific authorization for using US Armed Forces in response to civil unrest in Libya, including possibly imposing a no-fly zone. Senator Lugar doubts the benefits of a no-fly zone and suggests seeking a declaration of war for a full Congressional debate. Senator Kerry supports the Arab League's call for a UN no-fly zone in Libya to support democracy. The Security Council should act now to heed the Arab League's call for international involvement in Libya. Debate within the Senate Foreign Relations Committee revealed differences of opinion on the need for intervention, establishment of a no-fly zone, congressional authorization for military forces, and the potential threat of Al Qaeda. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 was adopted on February 26, 2011. Resolution 1970, adopted on February 26, 2011, did not authorize the use of force in Libya. Debate ensued regarding military intervention and on March 17, Resolution 1973 was adopted, allowing Member States to take necessary measures to protect civilians. Resolution 1970 (2011) established an arms embargo on Libya to protect civilians, banned all flights in Libyan airspace except for humanitarian and evacuation flights, and called for enforcement measures to prevent the movement of mercenary forces. Resolution 1973 authorized member states to conduct humanitarian, evacuation, and protection flights for the benefit of the Libyan people. Flights must be coordinated with the U.N. and Arab League Secretaries General. Member states are called to provide assistance for implementing the no-fly zone and civilian protection operations. The enforcement of the resolution's provisions was unclear after its passing. The Security Council adopted Resolution 1973 following international diplomacy on military intervention in Libya. Libyan officials warned of counter-attacks if foreign military action occurs. The League of Arab States endorsed a no-fly zone and safe areas for Libyan civilians. The Arab League endorsed preventive measures to protect Libyan people and residents from shelling, with international observers viewing regional support as crucial for any direct intervention. The U.S. government called the decision \"important,\" while some regional observers supported the statement, expressing concerns about insufficient support for the Libyan opposition. However, there were warnings of underlying dissension among regional governments regarding specific military interventions and strong opposition to foreign military involvement. The Arab League endorsed preventive measures to protect Libyan people from shelling, with regional citizens showing strong opposition to foreign military intervention. Coalition military strikes in Libya drew criticism from some Arab leaders, with Resolution 1973 calling for Arab League member states to cooperate in protecting Libyan civilians. The Obama Administration seeks active Arab partnership and financial support for the measures taken. Some Arab League members have contributed to coalition military efforts. Following the passage of UNSCR 1973 on March 19, 2011, U.S. and allied forces established a no-fly zone over major cities and air bases near the Libyan coast. French aircraft conducted the first offensive operations by striking armored units near Benghazi. The no-fly operation involved the use of Tomahawk and Tactical Tomahawk cruise missiles, B-2 Spirit bombers, and British Tornado GR4 aircraft. By March 23, 2011, the no-fly zone had expanded to cover the entire Libyan coastline. On March 28, 2011, DOD announced that A-10 and AC-130 aircraft had begun operations over Libya on March 26. The A-10 is optimized to destroy armored vehicles, while the AC-130 provides close air support and air interdiction, increasing U.S. capability to counter Libyan ground forces. Operational considerations influencing the scope of Operation Odyssey Dawn include the need to remove air defense capability to establish a no-fly zone. To establish a no-fly zone over Libya, the air defense capability would need to be removed, making it a military operation. Libya's air defense system relied on outdated Soviet and Russian technology, with defenses focused on the seacoast and major cities. The effectiveness of the communication and control network linking radar and missile sites was difficult to determine. Some SAM sites were in areas controlled by anti-Qadhafi forces, limiting the government's access. As of March 22, coalition operations had neutralized Gadhafi's long-range air defenses. As of March 22, coalition operations had significantly reduced Gadhafi's air force effectiveness. Libya's air force, with mostly outdated Soviet-era fighters and a few French Mirage jets, remained largely grounded. Most of Libya's 180 fighter and attack aircraft are believed to be inoperable, with pilots averaging only 85 flight hours per year. Two Mirage jets were flown to Malta by Libyan Air Force colonels and interned. As of March 23, 2011, Libya's air force remained grounded with no confirmed flight activity by regime forces. One Libyan jet was destroyed by a French fighter after flying a mission near Misrata. Most of Libya's major urban centers and air defense assets are located along the Mediterranean coast, allowing carrier-based and naval forces to establish and enforce a no-fly zone. The United States has operated from Sigonella, Sicily, and Souda Bay, Crete in the past for military operations. Italy has cleared partners to base their assets at various facilities including Gioia del Colle, Amendola, Aviano, Trapani, Sigonella, and Decimomannu. NATO CAOC in Poggio Renatico is fully operational, with other C4I installations heavily involved in Operation Odyssey Dawn strikes on mechanized forces, artillery, and mobile surface-to-air missile sites. Marine Corps Commandant General James F. Amos highlighted Libya's helicopter forces in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee. Marine Corps Commandant General James F. Amos identified Libya's helicopter forces as the primary threat to anti-Qadhafi forces, indicating that enforcing no-fly zones over air bases may not be enough. Operations throughout Libya's airspace may be necessary, as stated in Resolution 1973. U.S. Air Force units involved in Operation Odyssey Dawn include B-2 stealth bombers, F-15Es, and F-16CJs. The US Air Force units involved in Operation Odyssey Dawn include F-16CJ defense-suppression aircraft, EC-130 Commando Solo psychological operations aircraft, KC-135s for air refueling, C-130Js for airlift, A-10 attack fighters, and AC-130 gunships. The B-2s targeted combat aircraft shelters at Ghardabiya Airfield, while F-15Es and F-16CJs attacked ground forces loyal to Qadhafi in Benghazi. KC-135s refueled the strike aircraft en route to a forward air base, and C-130Js transported ground equipment and personnel. The US Navy ships involved in Operation Odyssey Dawn include Arleigh Burke-class destroyers USS Stout and USS Barry, submarines USS Providence, USS Scranton, and USS Florida, amphibious ships USS Kearsarge and USS Ponce, command ship USS Mount Whitney, and support ships Lewis and Clark, Robert E. Peary, and Kanawha. Naval and Marine aviation assets include AV-8B Harrier fighters, CH-53 Super Stallion helicopters, MV-22 Osprey aircraft, KC-130J tanker aircraft, EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft, and P-3 Orion sub-hunters. The United States took initial operational command of coalition operations to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1973, with Army General Carter F. Ham serving as theater commander for Operation Odyssey Dawn. Tactical operations were coordinated by a Joint Task Force under Admiral Samuel J. Locklear III onboard the USS Mount Whitney, with UK and French naval officers and liaison officers from other countries also present. The coalition for Operation Odyssey Dawn includes forces from 13 nations, with non-U.S. coalition aircraft flying the majority of sorties. France and the UK have been leading proponents of action against Qadhafi in Libya, sponsoring UNSC Resolutions and pushing for sanctions. French President Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Cameron have both called for Qadhafi to relinquish power. On March 10, France recognized the Libyan Transitional National Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people. President Sarkozy then convened a meeting in Paris to endorse the deployment of military aircraft to stop Qadhafi forces from attacking Benghazi and establish a no-fly zone. French fighter planes attacked Qadhafi forces on the outskirts of Benghazi during the meeting. French officials faced criticism for launching air strikes before a meeting was over, but they claim the strikes were necessary to prevent an imminent attack on Benghazi. The operation was planned with key allied militaries, including the United States and UK, and the meeting was crucial for maintaining coalition unity and Arab League support for military operations in Libya. Only the United States and NATO have the command and control capabilities for enforcing the no-fly zone and protecting civilians on the ground. During the initial planning and operational phases of the mission in Libya, there was discord within Europe and NATO regarding the flexibility of NATO forces to protect civilians. French officials wanted to strike ground forces threatening civilians, while Turkish officials opposed targeting ground forces. Germany abstained from UNSCR 1973 and withdrew naval assets from NATO command, causing strain within NATO. Other European allies like Italy and Norway also expressed frustration. Allies, including Italy and Norway, are frustrated with lack of agreement within NATO for the mission in Libya. Norway refuses to deploy fighter jets unless under NATO command. Concerns exist about NATO-led mission leading to criticism of western motives in the region, potentially eroding support from Arab countries. French and other allies emphasize the importance of maintaining Arab endorsement and involvement in ongoing military operations. NATO and partner countries established the Libya Contact Group to provide leadership in diplomatic efforts and military operations in Libya. NATO's North Atlantic Council will continue to provide political direction to military operations. NATO has been conducting 24-hour air surveillance of Libyan territory since March 8. Since March 8, NATO has been conducting 24-hour air surveillance of Libyan territory and the Central Mediterranean to enforce the arms embargo against the Libyan regime. NATO assets, including naval vessels and aircraft, are monitoring the Central Mediterranean off the Libyan coast and are authorized to interdict any vessels suspected of carrying illegal arms or mercenaries. Ten allies have pledged more than 25 ships and submarines for this operation. NATO allies, including Spain, Turkey, the UK, and the United States, have pledged ships, submarines, fighter jets, and surveillance planes to enforce the arms embargo in Libya. Italian Vice Admiral Rinaldo Veri will command the maritime operation, while air operations will be overseen by Allied Air Component Command in Izmir, Turkey. NATO has expanded its mission to include protecting civilians through possible air strikes on forces loyal to Qadhafi, a controversial aspect of the new mission. French military operations against Qadhafi's forces, under the codename Operation Harmattan, began on March 19 with attacks on ground forces. French fighter jets played a significant role in establishing a no-fly zone and targeting Qaddafi's forces. Approximately 20 French fighter jets were deployed during the first three days of operations. French fighter jets conducted over 55 sorties in Libyan airspace, neutralizing five armored vehicles. Operations expanded to hit a Libyan air base 250 kilometers south of the coastline. A French Rafale fighter jet targeted a Libyan plane in Misrata for breaching the no-fly zone. French officials reported an increase in daily sorties to 150-200, with assets including 20 combat aircraft and the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. France, led by President Sarkozy, has been actively involved in military operations in Libya. The country deployed the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle with 26 aircraft, including 16 fighter jets, and four frigates off the Libyan coast. France was the first to recognize the Libyan Transitional National Council, host an international conference on Libya's future, and launch attacks on Libyan ground forces. Despite domestic challenges, Sarkozy has public support for his handling of the situation in Libya. British military operations in Libya, under Operation Ellamy, began on March 19. The Royal Navy submarine HMS Triumph launched Tomahawk missiles, while Tornado GR4 attack aircraft from eastern England conducted airstrikes. A second Tornado mission targeting Qadhafi's compound was aborted due to civilian presence. UK airpower in the region includes Eurofighter Typhoons and Tornados based in Italy. The 906 Expeditionary Air Wing, based at Gioia del Colle air base, includes Typhoons participating in combat missions for the first time. The 907 Expeditionary Air Wing at RAF Akrotiri airbase supports with various aircraft. Two UK frigates and a Royal Navy submarine are in the Mediterranean off Libya. British parliament overwhelmingly supports government action in Libya. Concerns raised about new commitment given existing troop deployments in Afghanistan. The UK government faces concerns over the cost and duration of the Libya operation, with the first four days already costing \u00a328.5 million. Chancellor George Osborne plans to fund the operation from treasury reserves. Italy has provided airbases and combat aircraft for the coalition's mission in Libya. Italy, Canada, and Spain have contributed aircraft and resources to enforce the no-fly zone in Libya. Italy, a former Italian colony, has economic and political ties with Libya and expressed concerns about potential refugee influx. Canada deployed six CF-18s, two tanker aircraft, two reconnaissance aircraft, and a frigate for the mission. Spain deployed four F-18s, a frigate, and a submarine for the same purpose. Several countries have deployed aircraft and resources to enforce the no-fly zone in Libya, including F-18s, frigates, and submarines. Belgium, Denmark, and Norway have committed F-16s for the mission, while Luxembourg and Sweden may also contribute forces. Regional bodies like the Arab League and the African Union are concerned about the conflict in Libya. Qatar has deployed Mirage fighter aircraft and C-17A aircraft for the no-fly zone and relief efforts. Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Morocco have pledged fighter aircraft for the no-fly zone operation in Libya. Members of Congress are discussing the need for congressional authorization for Operation Odyssey Dawn based on the War Powers Resolution. On November 7, 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution, stating that the President can only introduce U.S. forces into hostilities with a declaration of war, specific authorization, or national emergency. The resolution requires the President to consult with Congress before deploying forces and report any such deployment. The War Powers Resolution, enacted in 1973, requires the President to consult with Congress before deploying forces and report any such deployment. Congress must authorize the use of force within 60 to 90 days or the forces must be withdrawn. Presidents have argued that the statute infringes on their authority as Commander in Chief, but the courts have not directly addressed this issue. Recent operations, such as U.S. participation in NATO military operations in Kosovo and UN-authorized operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, have raised questions about the resolution's applicability. Regarding NATO operations, Article 11 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that its provisions are to be carried out by the parties \"in accordance with their respective constitutional processes,\" implying that NATO Treaty commitments do not override U.S. constitutional provisions regarding the role of Congress in determining the extent of U.S. participation in NATO missions. Section 8(a) of the War Powers Resolution states specifically that authority to introduce U.S. forces into hostilities is not to be inferred from any treaty, ratified before or after 1973, unless implementing legislation specifically authorizes such introduction and says it is intended to constitute an authorization within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution. Regarding UN-authorized operations, for \"Chapter VII\" operations, undertaken in accordance with Articles 42 and 43 of the UN. Section 6 of the U.N. Participation Act authorizes the President to negotiate special agreements with the UN Security Council for Chapter VII operations, without needing further congressional authorization. However, no such agreements have been made yet. Given past disagreements between the President and Congress over military actions, establishing a \"no-fly zone\" on the President's authority alone would likely be controversial. The President's authority to take military action without congressional authorization, especially preemptively, could be controversial. The War Powers Resolution allows for 60-90 days of military action before seeking approval from Congress. U.S. military operations in Libya have cost $550 million, with $340 million spent on munitions like TLAMs. The Defense Department may seek statutory authority from Congress after initiating military actions. The Defense Department expects ongoing operations in Libya to cost about $40 million more in the next three weeks, with a weekly average of $13 million. Future costs are projected to be around $40 million per month, with a decrease in expenses expected due to lower operating tempo and munitions costs. Total incremental costs for Libya-related operations in FY2011 could reach approximately $800 million. The Defense Department expects to cover the added operational costs temporarily through reallocating funds within the defense budget. The munitions expended are being drawn from current inventories. U.S. costs of continued enforcement of a no-fly zone might be limited if allies carry out most of the ongoing flight operations. U.S. contributions might be restricted to providing surveillance and air traffic control. U.S. contributions for a no-fly zone may be limited to providing surveillance and air traffic control capabilities, potentially supplemented by allies' resources. Costs could increase if ground attacks continue, with U.S. strike aircraft preferred due to their precision capabilities and experience in recent conflicts. The U.S. may provide surveillance and air traffic control for a no-fly zone, using assets like the Global Hawk UAV and JSTARS aircraft. Continued attack missions could increase risks and costs, as seen in past operations like Operation Noble Anvil in Yugoslavia. The air attacks in the operation focused on military infrastructure and strategic targets, lasting two and a half months from March 24 to June 10, 1999, costing $1.8 billion. Operation Southern Watch (OSW) cost over $700 million per year, while Operation Northern Watch (ONW) cost about $123 million per year. The OSW mission covered a large area with occasional strikes against Iraqi air defense sites, imposing a burden on U.S. Air Force units. Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia-Herzegovina involved a range of air operations including enforcing a no-fly zone, attacking Bosnian-Serb forces, and providing air support for Croatian ground operations. The costs for Air Force and Navy totaled $298 million in FY1995 and $446 million in FY1996. These operations may have helped shift the balance of power in Bosnia towards a political settlement. The costs of air operations in FY1996 were substantial, with inflation increasing costs by about 50%. Military personnel and operation costs have also grown by about 50% above inflation over the past 15 years. Initial operations in Libya cost $550 million and could reach $800 million if continued through September 30, 2011. The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments estimated the cost of initial operations and establishing a no-fly zone in Libya. Initial operations could cost between $500 million and $1 billion, with ongoing no-fly zone costs ranging from $15 million to $300 million per week. The Department of Defense spent approximately $440 million in the first 10 days of operations, mainly on replacing Tomahawk missiles. The estimated costs for the initial operations in Libya include potential replacement costs for Tomahawk missiles and JDAMs, as well as the cost of replacing F-15E strike fighter aircraft lost due to mechanical failures. These hardware costs could total about $360 million, with munitions accounting for 70% of the total. Daily munitions costs are expected to decrease if Libya cannot rebuild its air defense network. Allied countries took over the combat air patrol portion of operations on March 30, 2011, reducing U.S. expenses. The Air Force and Navy may need to replace some hardware used in Libya operations, such as F-15E fighter aircraft and Tomahawk missiles. New criteria for war-related funding prohibit requests for items already scheduled for replacement. The Navy is buying new Tomahawk missiles to expand its inventory, with some older variants being replaced. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead stated that the Tomahawks will be replaced from the existing inventory. The Administration could re-direct funds for Libya-related hardware costs from existing sources or accept temporarily reduced inventory levels for munitions. DOD may request about $75 million to replace the lost F-15E, but the Air Force budget already includes funds for attrition in its aircraft inventory. The budget includes funds for attrition in the aircraft inventory, covering costs for munitions and operational/military personnel for combat air patrols and strike missions using various fighter aircraft. Most operational costs are paid for from the Air Force's FY2011 Operations & Maintenance account. The Navy does not assume additional ship operating costs for operations in the Mediterranean. According to Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead, the operations have not been particularly costly. The Navy's operations in the Mediterranean have not been costly so far, with expenses including additional flying hours and Tomahawk missiles. Future costs may be different as the no-fly zone is now in place, and allies are taking on the bulk of coalition operations. The United States is mainly contributing to air surveillance with AWACS. The U.S. is mainly contributing to air surveillance with AWACS in the no-fly zone over Libya. Congress may address strategic objectives, anti-Qadhafi forces, coalition coordination, and funding for Libyan operations. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports related to war, authorizations for the use of military force, funding cutoffs, preemptive military force, and U.S. policy towards Libya."
