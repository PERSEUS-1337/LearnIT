    "content": "The Border Crossing Deterrence Act of 2008 mandates the expansion of Operation Streamline to all 20 border sectors by December 31, 2009. $500,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2018 for this purpose. Mandatory minimum sentences for illegal entry are also established. Section 275 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include criminal penalties for aliens apprehended entering the US at improper times or places. Penalties range from 10 days to 2 years of imprisonment depending on the number of violations. The amendment to Section 275 of the Immigration and Nationality Act imposes imprisonment of 90 days to 3 years for aliens apprehended entering the US at improper times or places. SEC. 4. MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR ILLEGAL REENTRY. Section 276 (8 U.S.C. 1326) is amended to read as follows: \"SEC. 276. REENTRY OF REMOVED ALIEN.\" Any alien who has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed, and subsequently enters the United States shall be fined and imprisoned. Criminal offenders with multiple misdemeanors or a felony face harsher penalties upon reentry. Any alien reentering the United States after being convicted of a felony faces harsh penalties, including fines and imprisonment ranging from 2 to 20 years depending on the severity of the offense. Any alien convicted of murder, rape, kidnapping, or felony offenses related to peonage, slavery, or terrorism faces fines and imprisonment for 5 to 20 years. Reentry after multiple removals results in fines and imprisonment for 2 to 10 years. Prior convictions are essential elements of the crimes and determine the penalties imposed. Aliens convicted of specified crimes face fines and imprisonment. Reentry after multiple removals results in penalties. It is an affirmative defense if the alien had obtained consent from the Secretary of Homeland Security before reapplying for admission. In criminal proceedings, aliens cannot challenge prior removal orders unless they can prove they exhausted all administrative remedies and were under 18 without a criminal record during the previous exclusion, deportation, removal, or denial of admission. In cases of reentry after removal, aliens must serve the remaining term of imprisonment without parole or supervised release unless the Secretary of Homeland Security consents to their reentry. Homeland Security has consented to the alien's reentry, subject to penalties for reentry of removed aliens. Providing emergency humanitarian assistance to aliens without compensation is not prosecutable. The term 'felony' is defined as any criminal offense punishable by imprisonment of more than 1 year. The term 'misdemeanor' refers to a criminal offense with a maximum 1-year imprisonment under US, State, or foreign laws. 'Removal' encompasses denial of admission, deportation, or any agreement for exclusion. 'State' includes US States, District of Columbia, and territories. SEC. 5. MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR DESTROYING BORDER BARRIERS OR INFRASTRUCTURE. Amends Section 1361 of title 18, United States Code to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of not less than 5 years for any alien who damages or destroys fencing or infrastructure along the US international border."
