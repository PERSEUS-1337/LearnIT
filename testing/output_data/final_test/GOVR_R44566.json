    "content": "The U.S. Coast Guard is the nation's primary law enforcement authority on U.S. waters, with missions including maritime safety and security, environmental protection, search and rescue, drug interdiction, fisheries enforcement, and defense readiness. Legislation and appropriations bills specify the Coast Guard's responsibilities, with recent issues related to safeguarding maritime transportation discussed in House and Senate authorization bills for FY2018 and FY2019. The Coast Guard's safety mission involves interacting with key maritime safety institutions such as harbor pilots, vessel traffic services, and classification societies. In 2004, Congress directed the Coast Guard to establish an inspection regime for towing vessels, including structural standards and crew qualifications. Section 409 of the 2004 act authorized the Coast Guard to evaluate crew hours-of-service limits on towing vessels. The final rule was delayed but a rule on vessel inspection was issued in 2016. This will double the number of vessels inspected by the Coast Guard. New safety requirements for towing vessels are being implemented due to increased transportation of oil and chemicals by barge. According to Coast Guard data from 1995 to 2011, barges spilled more oil than tanker ships in U.S. waters. The number of oil spill incidents and amount spilled annually has decreased for both barges and tankers. The Coast Guard proposed rules on work hours for towing vessels, citing fatigue concerns over a multi-day voyage. Barge operators opposed addressing hours of service, while maritime unions supported a mandatory eight-hour rest period. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) also filed comments on the issue. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) supports an 8-hour rest period for barge crews, which could require a 10-hour rest period. Experts suggest a rotating schedule of 6 hours of work followed by 6 hours of rest. The Coast Guard is reexamining crewing requirements for articulated tug-barges (ATBs), which could impact the economics of barge transportation. Articulated tug-barges (ATBs) are coastal tank barges designed for open seas with capacities ranging from 50,000 to 340,000 barrels of oil. They have speeds of about 10 knots and operate with smaller crews compared to tank ships. The Coast Guard determines crewing requirements based on the tug's tonnage, leading to ATBs typically having 6 to 12 crew members. Articulated tug-barges (ATBs) have smaller crews compared to tank ships, typically ranging from 6 to 12 members. The Coast Guard's crewing requirements are based on the vessel's advanced technology level. Increasing crew sizes for ATBs could diminish their economic advantage over tankers, as seen with integrated tug barges in 1981. Since 1980, coastal ships in domestic commerce have seen a 72% decline in cargo carried, while coastal barges have increased by 35%, now carrying more cargo than ships. Some stakeholders criticize the crewing distinction between ships and ATBs, as it encourages less efficient barges over ships. U.S. maritime policy aims to develop skills for building and crewing oceangoing ships, potentially requiring reduced manning. The Howard Coble Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 requested an independent review of Coast Guard requirements for U.S.-flag vessels compared to international standards. A 2016 report found that stricter U.S. equipment requirements could deter ship owners from registering under the U.S. flag, as most manufacturers do not build equipment to meet these requirements. The 2016 report recommended that the Coast Guard adopt international practices for \"reduced manning\" of engine room operations and rely more on independent vessel classification societies for inspections of U.S.-flag vessels. The report also highlighted the sinking of the container ship El Faro in 2015 as a tragic example. In October 2015, a commercial fishing vessel sank near Puerto Rico, resulting in the loss of all 33 crew members. Congress is debating the extent to which commercial fishing vessels should be inspected by classification societies, with concerns over the cost of independent inspections. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) centers may not be effectively reducing vessel accidents in harbors due to lack of workforce experience. Recommendations to improve VTS centers focus on personnel training and qualifications. S. 1129 (\u00a7405) requires the Coast Guard to assess the feasibility of establishing a VTS center in the U.S. The Coast Guard is required to examine the feasibility of establishing a VTS center in U.S. arctic waters. The agency has faced challenges in providing effective safety oversight due to rotating staff practices. To address this issue, the Coast Guard revamped its safety program by creating additional civilian safety positions and receiving additional funds from Congress. The Coast Guard revamped its safety program by creating additional civilian safety positions and developing a long-term career path for inspectors and investigators. Congress may question the effectiveness of these changes in light of recent NTSB findings on Coast Guard VTS personnel. The Coast Guard's preferred strategy for Arctic operations includes relying on mobile assets and seasonal bases rather than pursuing a permanent port. Increased maritime activity in the Arctic, due to less sea ice during late summer, has led to the need for enhanced safety oversight in the Bering Strait. The west coast of Alaska serves as a key waterway for ships traveling the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage. The Northern Sea Route is more commonly used for cargo ships, while the Northwest Passage sees an increase in cruise vessel excursions. The Coast Guard has established a shipping lane in the Bering Strait and is focused on improving its Arctic operations, including search and rescue capabilities. Additionally, the Coast Guard played a role in developing an IMO code for ships in the Arctic. The Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010 requires cruise ships to have technology for capturing images of passengers falling overboard. Most cruise lines use video cameras for this purpose, as other detection systems are not reliable yet. Congress is debating whether smaller passenger vessels should also have similar technology. The 2015 Coast Guard Authorization Act mandates that smaller passenger vessels built in 2016 or later and operating in cold waters must be equipped with lifeboats or inflatable rafts to keep passengers out of the water. Congress has also requested the Coast Guard to improve marine casualty reporting based on recommendations from the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General. The 2015 Coast Guard Authorization Act mandates smaller passenger vessels in cold waters to have lifeboats or inflatable rafts. The lack of a \"near-miss\" reporting system hinders learning from past incidents. The USCG lacks processes to investigate and enforce regulations related to marine accidents, delaying corrective actions and new standards development. The Inspector General found that two-thirds of accident inspectors and investigators at 11 visited sites did not meet Coast Guard qualification standards. This shortage of qualified personnel would be worsened by the new towing vessel safety regime. The NTSB also discovered that personnel at Coast Guard VTS centers were not properly recording interventions and near-miss events, despite a policy requiring monthly activity logs. Congress has tasked the Coast Guard with determining U.S. pilotage rates for foreign trading vessels in the St. Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes. The Coast Guard increased pilotage rates for the Great Lakes system to attract enough pilots and avoid traffic delays. American pilots now receive $326,000 per year with 10 days off each month during the shipping season. This rate exceeds daily operating costs for ships in the Great Lakes, causing concerns about competitiveness. Great Lakes ports have sued the Coast Guard over its methodology for setting pilotage rates. Great Lakes ports sued the Coast Guard over pilotage rate methodology, which was transferred back to the Coast Guard in 1998. The Coast Guard's primary function includes installing and maintaining aids to navigation for vessels in harbor and waterway channels. The Coast Guard maintains over 50,000 visual aids for navigation in harbors, including 134 buoys and fixed aids. Despite electronic navigation aids like GPS, mariners still rely on physical markers. The Coast Guard is testing electronic aids to navigation on the west coast and the Mississippi River to improve accuracy for ships. E-navigation could potentially save costs, but questions remain about reliability, accessibility to recreational craft, and cybersecurity concerns. Congress is interested in the feasibility of using e-navigation in U.S. areas, which will impact the Coast Guard's budgetary needs in the future. In FY2016, Congress provided an additional $12 million for the use of UAS aboard national security cutters. The Coast Guard has tested hand-held and larger UAS for surveillance missions, including in the Arctic for ice conditions, environmental monitoring, safety, and search and rescue. Congress is interested in a detailed plan on how the Coast Guard can utilize this technology efficiently. The unmanned aircraft being tested can be launched from land or a Coast Guard cutter. H.R. 2518 requests a study on how drone aircraft could enhance the Coast Guard's maritime awareness. The bill places restrictions on Coast Guard's pursuit of UAS, dependent on lack of funding for Offshore Patrol Cutters and UAS procurement by Defense and Homeland Security. US has established a 200-mile perimeter from its coastlines for emission reduction by ships using cleaner-burning fuel enforced by the Coast Guard. Ocean carriers are concerned about the costs of cleaner fuels. The House Appropriations Committee requested information on ECA enforcement actions and waivers granted to vessels due to cleaner-burning fuel availability. The drop in fuel prices has lessened the economic impact of ECA requirements, but upcoming emission caps in 2020 could increase shipping costs. Some ships have experienced loss of propulsion when switching to cleaner fuel, possibly due to thermal shock. The Coast Guard issued a safety alert about loss of propulsion due to thermal shock when switching to cleaner fuel. A collision in March 2015 was likely caused by a switch to low-sulfur fuel. LNG as a ship fuel may help meet emissions requirements in emissions control areas. Some cargo ships serving U.S. noncontiguous trades have converted to LNG. Operators of vessels in ECA waters are interested in LNG. Various companies have launched LNG-fueled ships for different trade routes. The Coast Guard is developing regulations for LNG fuel tanks on vessels and refueling operations in ports. Carnival Cruise Lines has ordered LNG-powered cruise ships for delivery starting in 2019. In February 2015, the Coast Guard issued voluntary guidelines for using LNG as vessel fuel, including training of personnel, safeguards during fuel transfer operations, and design of barges carrying LNG for fueling operations. These guidelines are not new regulations but identify existing regulations pertaining to the carriage and storage of LNG. In April 2012, the Coast Guard issued guidelines for LNG engines and fuel system machinery on vessels. LNG-fueled ship engines are not entirely new, as LNG tankers often have engines fueled by \"boil-off\". The Coast Guard issued guidelines for using LNG as vessel fuel in February 2015, focusing on training, safeguards during fuel transfer, and barge design. These guidelines aim to inform industry and Coast Guard officials about existing regulations for LNG use. However, uncertainties remain regarding LNG bunkering, such as different safety needs for shoreside fueling facilities compared to cargo terminals. Existing regulations may not address simultaneous operations like loading cargo while refueling LNG-fueled ships. The Coast Guard issued guidelines in February 2015 for using LNG as vessel fuel, focusing on training, safeguards during fuel transfer, and barge design. Uncertainties remain regarding LNG bunkering, as current regulations may not address simultaneous operations during refueling. LNG fuel suppliers are required to conduct a risk assessment, but spill response regulations are not easily adaptable to LNG. Local Coast Guard captains often make final determinations based on port-specific information. In June 2015, the IMO finalized safety standards for ships using LNG as fuel, known as the \"IGF code.\" The Coast Guard conducted a study on buffer zones between wind farms and shipping routes along the Atlantic Coast, noting increased traffic density and collision risks. Offshore wind energy projects are in various stages of development. The Coast Guard study on buffer zones between wind farms and shipping routes along the Atlantic Coast has been criticized for being overly restrictive towards wind farms. H.R. 2518 requests a report on the Coast Guard's actions to implement recommendations from its port access route study. Maritime pilots play a crucial role in ensuring safety during harbor transits by providing navigational expertise and giving instructions to steer ships through harbors. Maritime pilots play a crucial role in ensuring safety during harbor transits by providing navigational expertise. Pilots direct tugboats and maneuver ships through harbors, constantly monitoring the ship's response to commands. Factors like ship characteristics, weather, and water conditions influence how a ship turns. While the pilot navigates the ship, the captain retains ultimate responsibility for its safe passage. Pilots use technology like laptops with charts and ship tracking to aid in navigation. Maritime pilots use technology like laptops to incorporate ship's navigation technology into their navigation software. A \"pilot card\" is used to inform pilots about ship navigation particulars. Hiring a pilot is compulsory in most U.S. ports, but in some cases, it may be voluntary. If a captain is confident in navigating the ship, they may choose not to hire a pilot, but the shipping line will still be charged a pilotage fee. Language barriers can hinder communication between pilots and captains. Maritime pilots are required in most U.S. ports for navigation, but in some cases, it may be voluntary. Shipping lines may still be charged a pilotage fee even if a pilot is not compulsory. Docking pilots, who are former tugboat captains, take over when docking the ship in some east coast ports. River pilots may also be required in Louisiana, depending on how far up the Mississippi River the ship is transiting. Large ships may need to hire multiple pilots. Pilots typically work as independent contractors through the pilot association at a given port. Pilot associations at ports handle administrative functions, assign pilots to ships, and regulate pilotage fees. A pilot board oversees pilot qualifications, fee setting, and performance reviews. Fees are based on vessel draft, tonnage, and sometimes distance traveled. Pilotage fees are determined by vessel draft, tonnage, and sometimes distance traveled. Pilot associations act as local monopolies, selecting enough member pilots to meet traffic demands. Federal government controls pilotage for ships in domestic trade, while state and local governments oversee pilotage for foreign trading ships. Sea captains in domestic trade may have Coast Guard pilot authorization on their license, eliminating the need to hire a pilot upon entering a harbor. Federal pilot authorization is common for harbor pilots, with some independent federal pilots offering services at specific ports. Ship captains need a pilot license for each port they visit regularly. State and local pilots licensed for foreign trade vessels usually also hold a federal license for domestic trade. Federal pilot's license is granted to anyone who qualifies, unlike state licenses which have limits based on perceived need. Marine Exchanges and Vessel Traffic Services assist in pilotage. The Coast Guard has established vessel traffic services (VTSs) in many ports to assist pilots and crews with safe navigation. VTSs operate 24/7 and use electronic communication, radar, DGPS, surveillance cameras, and binoculars. They are staffed by both uniformed and civilian Coast Guard watchstanders. Currently, there are VTSs in 12 U.S. ports, staffed by civilian and active-duty personnel. Ports without a Coast Guard-led VTS have a maritime exchange providing similar services. Maritime exchanges, also known as Vessel Traffic Information Services (VTIS), provide VTS-like services and are funded by user fees and port authorities. Originally used to alert ship service providers of pending arrivals, they now offer VHF radio communication and radar systems for pilots and captains. In the 1970s, Vessel Traffic Information Services (VTIS) were established in various ports after Congress passed the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972. Participation in VTIS became mandatory with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. VTIS operate similarly to air traffic control towers but do not direct maritime traffic. Vessel Traffic Information Services (VTIS) operate like air traffic control towers but do not direct maritime traffic. VTIS provide advisory services to vessels in harbors, offering monitoring, information, advice, and rare directives for safe navigation. The level of VTIS involvement in harbor navigation varies. The Vessel Traffic Information Services (VTIS) provide advisory services to vessels in harbors, offering monitoring, information, advice, and rare directives for safe navigation. In busy harbors or those with a drawbridge, VTIS may enforce a harbor traffic management plan. They could potentially exert more control over harbor traffic in bad weather conditions. The Coast Guard has authority to restrict vessel movements during hazardous weather conditions, but does not regularly do so. Congress directed the Coast Guard to establish a process for marine exchanges to send relevant navigation information to vessels via the Automatic Identification System. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) establishes standards for ocean carriers in terms of safety, pollution prevention, and security. Key conventions adopted by the 168 IMO member nations include the Safety of Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS), which was revised multiple times since its adoption in 1912. The United States Coast Guard represents the US at the IMO and advocates for shipping safety and security amendments. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) establishes standards for ocean carriers, including conventions like SOLAS, MARPOL, and STCW. Ratifying nations enforce these standards, with the US Coast Guard enforcing them for ships arriving at US ports. Most major maritime trading nations, including the US, lack the ability to enforce IMO regulations as a \"flag state\" due to ships being registered under \"flags of convenience.\" Most ship owners register their ships in \"open-registry\" countries like Panama, Liberia, and the Bahamas for tax and regulatory advantages. This practice complicates regulatory enforcement as ships may be owned, operated, and managed by different companies in different countries. Classification societies are independent third parties that inspect and certify ships to meet design and operation specifications. They play a crucial role in ensuring ships are safe and seaworthy for commercial service, as required by insurance companies, banks, and regulations. The credibility of classification societies has been questioned in the past due to potential conflicts of interest with vessel owners. Some insurers and banks hired their own inspectors to survey ships in addition to class inspection due to conflicts of interest with classification societies. These societies also have a for-profit side, leading to competition and the possibility of leniency in enforcing standards. To address concerns, a trade association was established in 1969. In 2004, Congress mandated that the Coast Guard only accept certifications from approved classification societies. Members of trade associations must be approved by the Coast Guard under specific criteria, including avoiding conflicts of interest."
