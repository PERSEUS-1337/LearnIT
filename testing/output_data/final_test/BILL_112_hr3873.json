    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Enhancing the Quality of Parental Legal Representation Act of 2011\". Congress found in the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act of 2000 that courts are crucial in the child welfare system. Quality legal representation for all parties improves child outcomes and court effectiveness, as shown in programs in New York and Michigan. A pilot program in Washington to enhance parent representation resulted in a 53.3 percent improvement. In New York, high-quality legal representation for parents led to a 53.3% increase in the rate of reunification. Children in foster care with well-represented parents spent 4.5 months in placement compared to the statewide average of 2.5 years, with re-entry rates of 1% versus 15% statewide. The cost per family for quality legal services was $6,000 over the case's life, much lower than the $29,000 to $66,000 for a year of foster care in New York City in 2010. Training and standards are essential for qualified representation. According to the Bar Association Center on Children and the Law, parental representation is often inadequate, leading to due process failures and unnecessary separation of children from their parents. Many families are permanently severed due to lack of proper legal representation, as most states do not have standard training requirements for attorneys representing parents. AMENDMENTS TO THE COURT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. Amendments to the Court Improvement Program include providing legal representation for parents and legal guardians in child welfare cases. This involves amending Section 438 of the Social Security Act to ensure legal representation in relevant proceedings.
