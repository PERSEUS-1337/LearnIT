    "content": "The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) examines and approves applications for patents and administers trademarks. It is funded by user fees and was mandated to have all fees collected credited to a specific account in 1980. The USPTO became fully fee funded in 1990 through legislation to cover operating costs, with fees set by Congress and a surcharge added to meet the institution's needs. The USPTO was fully fee funded in 1990 with fees set by Congress and a surcharge added. Additional receipts were deposited in a special fund, controlled by appropriation acts, and considered discretionary funding. The surcharge provision expired in FY1998. During the eight years of OBRA provisions, the USPTO collected $234 million more in fees than budget authority allowed. Between FY1991 and FY1998, $338 million in excess fees were collected. Congress later increased fees to compensate. Budget authority for the USPTO came from current and carry-over funds until FY2001. Between FY1999 and FY2004, the USPTO faced limitations on spending current year collections due to a \"ceiling\" set by annual appropriations legislation. However, in FY2001, this restriction was removed, allowing all funds raised by fees to be considered \"offsetting collections.\" Despite generating excess fees totaling $406 million during this period, the USPTO's budget authority was consistently less than the total fees collected each fiscal year. Between FY1990 and FY2011, a total of $1.688 billion in fees collected by the USPTO were not made available for use by the office. This includes $747.8 million diverted for unrelated programs between FY1990 and FY2004, and $260.7 million withheld in FY2010 and FY2011. The USPTO's budget for FY2016 was $3.231 billion, with a requested budget authority of $3.244 billion for FY2017. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act establishes a fee reserve fund for USPTO fees, allowing the office to access funds withheld in the past. The Act also grants USPTO authority to set or adjust fees. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act grants the USPTO authority to adjust fees and establish a fee reserve fund. This allows the office to access funds withheld in the past, providing flexibility in adjusting fee schedules without congressional intervention. The America Invents Act allows the USPTO to adjust fees and establish a fee reserve fund for flexibility in fee schedules without congressional intervention. Critics argue that limits on spending fee collections hinder the office's efficient operation by not allowing all fees to cover necessary activities. The America Invents Act allows the USPTO to adjust fees and establish a fee reserve fund for flexibility in fee schedules without congressional intervention. However, the office still needs congressional authority to use any excess funds generated. Issues arise regarding the use of fees collected and the FY2013 sequestration of fees paid to the USPTO, with differing opinions on whether these fees are subject to sequestration. The American Intellectual Property Law Association and other organizations question the legality of subjecting USPTO fees to sequestration, citing exemptions in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The American Bar Association supports exempting USPTO fees from sequestration due to the unique funding mechanism and congressional mandates."
