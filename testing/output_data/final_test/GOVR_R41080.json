    "content": "Children are a vulnerable segment of society during disasters, with over 38.5 million households in the US having children under 18 years. These households could be directly affected by disasters, leading to various perils such as separation from family, school closures, health care shortages, and psychological impacts. Despite the growing number of children affected by disasters, there is a gap in including them in community disaster planning efforts. Planning, along with medical preparedness, response, and other activities, can help address the challenges children face during and after disasters. The National Commission on Children and Disasters was established by Congress to address the needs of children in disasters. The Commission's interim report contains recommendations for enhancing disaster response, recovery, and mitigation capabilities. Congress is considering amending the Stafford Act and the Child Safety, Care, and Education Continuity Act to better address the safety and educational needs of children in disasters. The National Commission on Children and Disasters was established by Congress to address the needs of children in disasters. Recommendations include amending the Stafford Act and the Child Safety, Care, and Education Continuity Act to better address children's safety and educational needs. Congress may also consider expanding legislation to include these recommendations and assess the need to amend the Homeland Security Act to emphasize children's needs in emergencies. The National Commission on Children and Disasters, established by Congress under the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act of 2009, is bipartisan and consists of 10 members appointed by the President and congressional leaders. The Commission, supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is tasked with assessing and making recommendations about children's needs in disasters. Congress authorized $1.5 million for each of FY2008 and FY2009 for the Commission to conduct a comprehensive study on children's needs in natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters. The Commission is directed to submit a report to the President and Congress with its findings, conclusions, and recommendations to address identified gaps. The National Commission on Children and Disasters, established by Congress, is tasked with assessing children's needs in disasters. The interim report was provided to the President and Congress in October 2009, with the Final Report projected for October 2010. Children under 18 make up over 25% of the population, making them vulnerable in disasters. Hurricane Katrina highlighted the challenges faced by children, with many still lacking housing, education, and essential services. The Commission aims to identify gaps in research and emergency management practices. The National Commission on Children and Disasters was established by Congress to assess children's needs in disasters. The Commission is bipartisan and includes experts in assisting children in disasters. It conducts a study on children's needs in preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation of disasters. The Commission makes recommendations on child physical health, mental health, trauma, and child care in all settings. The National Commission on Children and Disasters focuses on child physical health, mental health, trauma, child care, education, sheltering, transportation, juvenile justice, evacuation, and emergency management. It has four subcommittees that address different aspects such as education, child welfare, juvenile justice, evacuation, transportation, housing, human services recovery, and pediatric medical care. Each subcommittee operates under a specific statement of purpose outlining its goals and objectives. The Subcommittee on Evacuation, Transportation and Housing focuses on recommending minimum standards for the care of children during disaster situations, aiming to ensure safety and accessibility regardless of service provider. It will investigate best practices internationally and domestically to address existing gaps and promote collaboration among stakeholders. The Human Services Recovery Subcommittee will focus on optimizing recovery efforts after disasters to meet the long-term essential needs of children and safeguard their well-being, addressing issues such as access to child care, schools, after-school programs, and healthcare services. The Subcommittee on Pediatric Medical Care aims to improve acute medical care for children in disasters and enhance the emergency medical response system for children. Congress authorized $1.5 million for activities of the Commission in FY2008 and FY2009. In FY2008 and FY2009, Congress authorized $1.5 million for Commission activities. HHS provided $500,000 in FY2008 and received $1.5 million in FY2009. H.R. 3293 proposes $1 million for FY2010. No funding proposals for FY2011. Congress directed a final report in October 2010. The Commission has held meetings and testified at congressional hearings. The Commission testified at congressional hearings on various disaster recovery and children's needs topics in 2009. They also submitted an interim report to the President. The Commission submitted an interim report to the President and Congress in October 2009, outlining 11 categories of recommendations for disaster management and recovery, mental health, child physical health, emergency services, child care, education, child welfare, sheltering, housing, and evacuation. The recommendations focus on integrating children's needs into disaster planning documents at all levels of government. The Commission recommends integrating children's needs into disaster planning activities and operations, emphasizing the development of a National Disaster Recovery Strategy with a focus on children's physical and mental health, education, housing, and human services. They highlight the importance of distinguishing planning for children from other vulnerable populations in disaster planning documents. Congress may consider amending Section 408 of the Stafford Act to address the needs of children specifically. The Commission recommends amending Section 408 of the Stafford Act to address the needs of children specifically in disaster planning. They also suggest elevating the needs of children in the National Response Framework Emergency Support Functions to distinctly address children in disasters. The Commission recommends integrating mental and behavioral health for children into disaster preparedness and response activities. They also suggest enhancing research and training for pediatric disaster mental and behavioral health. FEMA administers Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training program for mental health support after disasters. The Commission recommends extending mental health services beyond nine months and ensuring access to pediatric medical countermeasures for CBRNE threats at all levels of government. The Commission recommends enhancing medical capabilities for federally funded response teams to address pediatric-specific needs during disasters, including access to physical and mental health services for children during recovery. They also suggest reviewing existing federal programs, like those under the Stafford Act, to potentially expand eligibility for clinics providing health services. The Commission recommends expanding eligibility for federal funds to include for-profit facilities providing essential services to children in disasters. They also suggest improving emergency medical services' capacity to transport pediatric patients and provide pre-hospital care during daily operations and disasters. The Commission recommends establishing a dedicated grant program for EMS and providing additional funding for the Emergency Medical Services for Children program to increase pediatric emergency preparedness during disasters. Congress should consider extending federal assistance provisions to pediatric transport during disasters and establishing a holistic federal disaster case management program for children and families in disaster areas. After Hurricane Katrina, Congress recognized the need for a coordinated disaster case management program. FEMA is the lead agency in this effort, working with HHS to implement a holistic disaster case management model. The Commission recommends addressing child care needs in disasters by improving disaster planning capabilities for child care providers and enhancing the ability to provide child care services in the aftermath of a disaster. The Child Care Bureau at HHS encourages states to develop emergency preparedness plans for child care programs. In 2008-2009, 31 states reported developing such plans. The Bureau also allows flexibility in federal child care funds to support families during emergencies. The Commission recommends establishing a school disaster preparedness program and appropriate funds to the U.S. Department of Education for state- and district-level disaster response planning, training, and enhancing school personnel's ability to support children recovering from disasters. Federal support is available to assist local educational agencies in developing emergency management plans. The U.S. Department of Education and DHS offer funding for emergency management planning to LEAs. The REMS program provides funds to improve emergency management plans for schools, while DHS administers programs for state and local governments. The Commission recommends providing guidance and model plans for child welfare agencies to collaborate with emergency management stakeholders. The Commission recommends collaboration with state and local emergency management, courts, and other key stakeholders for disaster planning and preparedness among juvenile justice systems. States must have procedures in place to address children's safety during disasters, as mandated by P.L. 109-288. One recommendation is to provide a safe and secure mass care shelter environment for children with access to essential services and supplies. The recommendation includes developing national standards for mass care shelters, ensuring age-appropriate essential supplies, training shelter workers, and screening volunteers. The Stafford Act authorizes federal resources for sheltering needs, with the NRF guiding the federal role. Food and essential needs distribution in shelters is managed by organizations like the American Red Cross. Implementing national shelter standards faces challenges due to local provision of sheltering needs during disasters. The challenge in establishing national shelter standards lies in ensuring compliance among local community organizations that may not receive federal funding, especially during large-scale disasters when non-traditional shelter providers may step forward. Awareness among these providers may be lacking, making enforcement of standards difficult without federal assistance. The Commission recommends prioritizing families with children for disaster housing assistance and expedited transition into permanent housing, especially those with disabilities or special needs. Family reunification is crucial during evacuations, as seen after Hurricane Katrina when over 5,000 children were reported missing. The Commission recommends developing a national evacuee tracking and family reunification system for children in disasters, similar to the NEFRL system for families. Congress may consider establishing a coordinator within FEMA to address the needs of children in disaster situations. The Commission recommends a national evacuee tracking and family reunification system for children in disasters. Congress may need to consider policy options such as the role of federal agencies and federal grants-in-aid in disaster assistance coordination. FEMA and HUD have distinct roles in community recovery, with HUD programs focusing on economic development initiatives. Development initiatives focus on redeveloping and rejuvenating the economic base of communities, while FEMA programs prioritize short-term recovery and hazard mitigation. FEMA assistance aims to provide immediate shelter and restore critical infrastructure, with grant programs offering partial reimbursement for losses. Challenges may arise in aligning different recovery philosophies and program goals in disaster coordination. The role of FEMA, HUD, and HHS in disaster case management is unclear due to differing program goals and recovery philosophies. Clarity in definitions may help determine agency jurisdictions, but could also limit flexibility in providing assistance for disasters of varying scale. Congress may need to clarify the federal role in disaster case management to align program objectives of relevant agencies. The challenge in disaster assistance is determining when states can resume coordinating disaster assistance, as outlined in the Stafford Act. The federal government provides assistance when states exceed their capacity, but questions remain on when coordination should transition back to state and local governments. The Disaster Recovery Working Group established by President Obama may offer insights into this transition. The Commission established by President Obama may provide insight into transitioning disaster assistance coordination to states. Congress could use the Commission's work to identify transition points for federal disaster assistance programs for children. The Commission recommends prioritizing grant funding for projects involving children, but some entities like private schools and daycare centers may not be eligible for assistance. Eligibility for federal disaster assistance is limited to certain government agencies and tribes as per the Stafford Act. Expanding federal grant eligibility to include private entities like child care facilities and health clinics may be justified to fill gaps in resources. Private businesses providing emergency medical services during disasters are currently ineligible for many federal grant programs. The FEMA Public Assistance program requires private nonprofits to provide essential governmental services to qualify for assistance. Expanding federal grant eligibility to include private entities providing essential governmental services during disasters may increase federal expenditures. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress includes provisions for child safety and education continuity in disasters, as well as changes to federal programs addressing community preparedness and mitigation. Congress may consider implementing the recommendations of the Commission to address gaps in resources. Expanding provisions of S. 2898 to address recommendations on mental health, emergency medical services, pediatric transport, disaster case management, sheltering standards, and housing. H.R. 3377 provides for implementing congressional committee recommendations, including federal assistance for states to enhance mitigation activities. Congress may consider incorporating evacuation and sheltering recommendations into other committee provisions to protect vulnerable populations like children during disasters. The increasing frequency and scale of disasters have highlighted the critical need to address the needs of children in disaster planning. Evaluating the role of various stakeholders in funding and coordinating emergency management activities for children remains a question. Congressional intervention may be necessary to ensure special provisions are made for children in disasters. Evaluating the recommendations of the Commission within the context of existing statutory and regulatory provisions may provide insight into gaps in funding and coordination for children affected by disasters."
