    "content": "The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) was established in 1972 by the Consumer Product Safety Act to protect the public from risks associated with consumer products. The CPSC uses consumer monitoring, research, investigations, safety standard-setting, and enforcement powers to achieve its objective. While the CPSC can issue mandatory safety rules, it often defers to voluntary standards developed by private industry. The Commission provides technical assistance to help industry groups develop voluntary standards more frequently than issuing mandatory safety standards. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) enforces safety standards and can order recalls after conducting administrative hearings. The CPSA is broadly interpreted to protect consumers, and the CPSC negotiates voluntary corrective actions with companies before resorting to involuntary recalls. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) enforces safety standards for consumer products, covering a wide range of products manufactured domestically and imported into the U.S. The CPSC estimates that these products contribute to over $1 trillion in costs annually through deaths, illnesses, injuries, and property damage. Congress closely monitors the CPSC through oversight hearings and introduces bills that impact the Commission regularly. In the 115th Congress, bills have been introduced to expand the CPSC's regulatory jurisdiction and mandate safety rules for certain products. The CPSA has been amended multiple times, with significant changes made in 1981 and 2008 with the CPSIA. The CPSIA was passed in response to the \"Year of the Recall\" in 2007, requiring the CPSC to convert voluntary standards into mandatory safety rules more efficiently. The report provides a legal overview of the CPSC's structure, jurisdiction, and statutory powers under the CPSA, as amended. It discusses the CPSC's authority to create consumer safety rules, establish a product safety database, and enhance enforcement powers. Additionally, it covers the Commission's ability to conduct consumer monitoring, research, and investigations to inform rulemaking and enforcement actions. The report also examines the Commission's authority to issue mandatory product safety rules and bans as outlined in the CPSA. The report analyzes the CPSC's enforcement powers, including self-reporting requirements, product inspections, corrective actions, designation of \"Imminently Hazardous Consumer Products,\" and penalties for violators of the CPSA. The CPSC is composed of up to five commissioners appointed by the President for seven-year terms, with no more than three commissioners from the same political party. The CPSC is composed of up to five commissioners appointed by the President for seven-year terms, with a limit of three commissioners from the same political party. Commissioners can only be removed by the President for neglect of duty or malfeasance. The Chairman, appointed by the President with Senate approval, has executive and administrative responsibilities, including hiring personnel and delegating duties. The Commission has six main offices for various functions. The CPSC has various offices including Hazard Identification, Import Surveillance, International Programs, and Compliance. In FY2017, it had 560 employees and received $126 million in appropriations. The jurisdiction under the CPSA is defined by the term \"consumer product,\" which includes articles produced for consumer use in households, schools, recreation, or personal enjoyment. The Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) defines a \"consumer product\" as an article produced for consumer use in households, schools, recreation, or personal enjoyment. The definition is broadly interpreted to protect consumers from unsafe products, including distinct articles of commerce or component parts sold directly to consumers for personal use. The Consumer Product Safety Act defines a \"consumer product\" broadly as an article produced for consumer use in households, schools, recreation, or personal enjoyment. The D.C. Circuit has clarified that products do not have to be primarily sold to consumers, but there must be significant marketing for consumer use. Congress has excluded items like tobacco, motor vehicles, pesticides, and firearms from the CPSC's jurisdiction. The CPSC's jurisdiction covers a wide range of products, excluding items like tobacco, motor vehicles, and firearms. They oversee approximately 10,000 types of products, aiming to protect the public from injury risks and promote safety standards. The CPSC is empowered to monitor consumer markets, investigate product dangers, and develop safety regulations to prevent product-related deaths and injuries. They rely on industry-developed voluntary safety standards and only implement mandatory safety standards in limited circumstances. The Commission may impose mandatory recalls, product bans, and corrective measures when necessary. The CPSC has the authority to impose mandatory recalls, product bans, and penalties when necessary. They monitor consumer product-related injuries through the NEISS database to estimate the total number of injuries each year. The CPSC utilizes the NEISS database to estimate annual consumer product-related injuries and societal costs. They also track accidental deaths related to consumer products by contracting with states and the District of Columbia. This data informs CPSC activities such as investigations, research, and enforcement actions. The CPSC utilizes data to identify hazardous products and reduce hazards. In FY2016, reports were issued on consumer harms related to ATVs and carbon monoxide poisonings, as well as studies on flame retardants and crumb rubber impact on health. Research activities on nanotechnology were also conducted. Collaborative efforts with governmental and nongovernmental entities are authorized by the CPSA to advance research, with resulting data helping CPSC develop measures to detect and eliminate product hazards. The CPSC develops safety standards and rules for consumer products to reduce safety risks. These standards cover labeling, packaging, and performance measures. Congress mandates some safety rules, such as for infant products and toys, while the CPSC defers to industry-developed voluntary safety standards in other cases. The CPSC defers to industry-developed voluntary safety standards unless they do not adequately reduce the risk of injury. The 1981 amendments to the CPSA added procedural steps for issuing mandatory safety rules, potentially making it more difficult for the CPSC to do so. The CPSC primarily relies on voluntary standards over mandatory safety rules, but can ban products if necessary. Finalizing voluntary standards requires consensus and can take years. The CPSC follows specific procedures to ban products from the market. The CPSC has promulgated around 40 mandatory safety rules and product bans since 1972. Most rules were implemented before 1981 amendments that required deferral to voluntary safety standards. Four rules were made following APA procedures instead of CPSA Section 2058. The CPSC must follow specific procedural steps before implementing mandatory consumer safety rules or product bans, including issuing a detailed final regulatory analysis that includes a cost-benefit analysis and justification for not adopting alternative rules. The Commission must also substantiate factual findings to show the rule is necessary, imposes the least burdensome requirement, and has benefits that outweigh costs. The CPSA allows the CPSC to issue rules or product bans if benefits outweigh costs, with the option for impacted parties to challenge in court under the APA for unlawful actions. The Commission must provide substantial evidence to support its findings for a rule or ban to be affirmed. The court may provide relief to parties challenging CPSC rules, including attorney's fees. States are generally barred from implementing safety standards that address the same risks as CPSC rules, but interpretation varies due to CPSA Section 2074. The CPSA does not relieve liability under common law or state statutory law. Courts have generally followed the Geier decision, which limits preemption of state law claims. The CPSA is seen as setting a minimum safety standard and not intended to completely preempt state law. The CPSA does not completely replace state law and its preemption provisions do not apply to voluntary safety standards. Manufacturers of consumer products subject to CPSC rules must test and certify compliance before entering the market. Children's products face heightened standards and must be tested and certified by accredited third parties. The CPSC often defers to voluntary safety standards rather than issuing mandatory rules. Voluntary safety standards are developed by private industry organizations like ANSI, UL, and ASTM International. Interested parties volunteer to participate in creating these standards, allowing for divergent views to be expressed and consensus to develop. The CPSC often provides recommendations and technical assistance during the standard development process. The CPSC issues reports on its involvement in creating voluntary standards but lacks legal authority to enforce them. Non-compliance can influence the Commission's decision to use enforcement powers, including ordering product halts, refunds, and seeking civil penalties. The CPSC has enforcement powers under the CPSA to seek injunctive relief, civil penalties, and criminal penalties for violations. Industry must notify the Commission of product hazards, and the Commission can conduct compliance inspections. The CPSC works with other agencies to inspect products for safety standards and negotiate corrective actions before formal enforcement actions. The CPSA mandates reporting requirements for consumer products, allowing the CPSC to inspect, negotiate corrective actions, and impose penalties for non-compliance. Manufacturers must report hazards immediately, failure to do so can result in penalties. These reports help identify products needing safety standards, recalls, or other corrective actions. A Substantial Product Hazard occurs when a product does not meet safety standards, poses a risk of injury to the public, or has a defect that could cause harm. Defects can occur at any stage of production and can involve labeling, instructions, construction, or contents. The CPSC does not consider a product defective simply because it poses a risk of harm, but rather looks at specific factors outlined in the CPSA and its regulations. The CPSA and its regulations outline factors for determining if a product needs to be reported as a Substantial Product Hazard to the CPSC. Factors include product usefulness, harm severity, target users, and risk visibility. Reports should include product description, contact info of manufacturers, nonconformance explanation, and safety standard violations. The CPSA authorizes the CPSC to inspect factories and warehouses to ensure compliance with safety rules and recalls. The Commission may release information from reports, except for confidential details, after giving affected parties a chance to contest the disclosure. The CPSA authorizes the CPSC to inspect imported consumer products for compliance with safety rules and may request the Secretary of the Treasury to deny entry for non-compliant products. The CPSC focuses on inspecting foreign products as they are more likely to be subject to corrective actions than domestically manufactured products. The CPSC utilizes a risk-based system and data from U.S. Customs to prioritize imported product inspections. They coordinate with state and local governments for compliance inspections and provide training for partners and importers. If a product is deemed a Substantial Product Hazard, public disclosure may be necessary for protection. The CPSC may order manufacturers, distributors, or sellers to implement a recall for products deemed a Substantial Product Hazard. The process for this designation and corrective action can be time-consuming, involving administrative hearings and potential challenges in federal court. As a result, the CPSC often works with companies to develop mutually agreeable plans for addressing hazards. Companies cooperate with the CPSC to address potential hazards by negotiating corrective action plans. CPSC staff review industry-issued product hazard reports to determine if a product poses a substantial hazard, classifying it as Class A, B, or C based on the level of consumer harm. Class A hazards are likely to result in severe harm, while Class B and C hazards have varying degrees of potential harm. The CPSC works with companies to classify hazards as Class A, B, or C based on potential harm levels. Companies can use the Fast Track Product Recall Program for voluntary corrective actions. If negotiations stall, the CPSC can intervene. The CPSC can designate a product as a Substantial Product Hazard and order a mandatory corrective action plan after conducting a hearing with interested parties. They may seek a preliminary injunction to stop product distribution and enforce corrective action plans through judicial means. Parties affected by a CPSC order designating a product as a Substantial Product Hazard can challenge it in federal court. The Commission, with input from relevant parties, develops tailored corrective action plans to remove defective products from the market, inform the public of potential harm, and rectify the issue. Actions may include halting distribution, notifying officials and the public, issuing hazard notices, and fixing or modifying the product for compliance. The CPSC develops corrective action plans for products designated as Substantial Product Hazards, which may involve rectifying defects, ensuring compliance with safety standards, replacing noncompliant products, providing refunds, and communicating potential hazards to the public. Additionally, the Commission has the authority to seek court-ordered relief for Imminently Hazardous Consumer Products that pose a risk of death, serious illness, or severe harm. The CPSC can seek court-ordered relief for Imminently Hazardous Consumer Products that pose a risk of death, serious illness, or severe harm, including issuing public notices and seizing products. Any corrective action order issued by the CPSC must be rescinded if the court determines the product does not pose an imminent hazard. The CPSC can seek court-ordered relief for Imminently Hazardous Consumer Products that pose a risk of death, serious illness, or severe harm. The Commission's use of this authority is rare due to the difficulty in proving a product as Imminently Hazardous. Section 2068 of the CPSA prohibits various activities related to non-compliant consumer products, with violations leading to civil and criminal penalties. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) can take legal action against products that pose imminent hazards. Section 2068 of the CPSA prohibits certain activities related to non-compliant products, with penalties for violations. The CPSC has the authority to take legal action against products that pose hazards, with penalties for violations including civil penalties of up to $100,000 for each knowing violation of Section 2068, and up to $15,000,000 for multiple related violations. The CPSC can enter into settlement agreements or file actions in federal court to seek penalties. Factors considered in determining penalties include the violator's business size and the severity of the violations. The CPSC can seek criminal penalties for violations of Section 2068, with individuals facing up to a five-year prison term for knowingly and willfully violating the law. Officers, directors, and corporate representatives can also be held personally liable for authorizing others to violate Section 2068. The CPSA allows for the forfeiture of assets associated with violations for which fines or imprisonment are imposed. The CPSA allows individuals to sue violators of CSPC-issued rules for damages and attorneys' fees. Individuals and state Attorneys General can also seek injunctive relief through federal district courts against violators of consumer product safety rules and Substantial Product Hazard orders."
