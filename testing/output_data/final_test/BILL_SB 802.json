    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 41030 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended by the Office of Emergency Services annually to determine a surcharge rate effective on January 1 to fund 911 costs. The surcharge rate for 911 costs is determined annually by the Office of Emergency Services, based on estimated costs and charges for intrastate telephone communications services and VoIP service. The rate cannot exceed three-quarters of 1 percent or be less than one-half of 1 percent. The surcharge rate for 911 costs is calculated annually by the Office of Emergency Services, based on estimated costs and charges for intrastate telephone communications services, prepaid mobile telephony services, and VoIP service. The rate cannot exceed three-quarters of 1 percent or be less than one-half of 1 percent. The Office of Emergency Services calculates the surcharge rate for 911 costs for prepaid mobile telephony services based on the method developed by the Public Utilities Commission. The Office of Emergency Services determines surcharge rates for Next Generation 911 technology and services, including text to 911 service, based on Section 319 of the Public Utilities Code. The office notifies the board of the surcharge rate imposed under this section annually by October 1, and the surcharge rate for prepaid mobile telephony services by October 15. The Office of Emergency Services prepares a summary of the calculation of the proposed surcharge at least 30 days before determining it annually by October 15. The summary includes prior year revenues, projected expenses, revenues from all sources, and rationale for adjustment to the surcharge. Section 41032 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require the board to publish the new surcharge rate by November 15 each year and notify service suppliers by mail or other means. Section 42010 is also amended. On January 1, 2016, a prepaid MTS surcharge will be imposed on prepaid consumers in California, collected by sellers at the time of each retail transaction. The surcharge will be a percentage of the sales price and will replace other existing charges for prepaid mobile telephony services. The surcharge rate will be calculated annually by the board by November 1 each year. The board will post the combined total of prepaid MTS surcharge rates and local charges for each local jurisdiction on its website by December 1 each year. This combined rate will apply to all retail transactions starting on April 1 of the following year. The board will post recalculated rates for local agencies if notified of inaccuracies or rate decreases, effective the first day of the following calendar quarter. Starting January 1, 2016, certain notification requirements for prepaid mobile telephony services will not apply. The board must post individual rates for various surcharges and charges on its website. Sellers can rely on this information for collecting and remitting prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges. All prepaid MTS surcharges and local charges collected by sellers must be remitted to the board, except for amounts retained as specified. Sellers providing lifeline service and selling prepaid mobile telephony services directly to customers must remit the prepaid MTS surcharge to the board, minus any applicable exemptions. A seller, whether direct or not, can deduct and retain 2 percent of prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges collected from consumers. Direct sellers must remit the prepaid MTS surcharge to the Public Utilities Commission as required. The prepaid MTS surcharge, including the emergency telephone users surcharge, must be remitted to the board as per the Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act. Local charges should be remitted to the local jurisdiction. Direct sellers should refer to the amounts posted by the board when remitting payments to the Public Utilities Commission and local jurisdictions. A prepaid MTS provider must offer the option for additional payment at their retail location or website. The surcharge and local charges must be separately stated on the invoice provided to the consumer. Any unreturned amounts collected from the consumer as part of the surcharge constitute debts owed by the seller to the state. Any unreturned amount collected from a prepaid consumer for mobile telephony services constitutes a debt owed by the seller to the state and local jurisdiction for collection and payment of local charges. A seller can refund any excess prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges to a prepaid consumer, even if the surcharge has already been paid to the board. The seller may also repay the amount of the surcharge paid along with the refund. Every prepaid consumer of mobile telephony services in this state is liable for the prepaid MTS surcharge and any local charges until paid to the state. Payment to a registered seller relieves the consumer from further liability. Unremitted surcharges and local charges are debts owed to the state. Sellers are not obligated to enforce collection of surcharges or local charges. The state has the authority to enforce the collection of surcharges or local charges imposed by this section. A credit is allowed against prepaid MTS surcharge and local charges for prepaid mobile telephony services, not exceeding the amount paid for emergency telephone users charges, state utility regulatory commission fees, state universal service charges, or local charges in other states or the District of Columbia. The credit is apportioned based on the amounts of those charges. A seller is relieved from collecting the prepaid MTS surcharge if accounts are deemed worthless and charged off for income tax purposes. The seller can deduct the amount charged off and if any accounts are later collected, the surcharge must be paid with the return. The board may promulgate rules regarding uncollected or worthless accounts for fair administration. This act is urgent for implementing new telephony service surcharge regulations."
