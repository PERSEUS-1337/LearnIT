    "content": "The People's Republic of China's robust international engagement since 2000 has sparked American disagreement and debate over its foreign policy motivations. This expansion of international economic engagement, known as China's \"charm offensive,\" is seen as potentially increasing political influence. Some believe that China is comfortable working with undemocratic governments, including key U.S. allies. China's foreign policy has evolved significantly since its founding in 1949, moving away from Chairman Mao Zedong's \"self-reliance\" policy to a more globally engaged approach. This shift has raised concerns among U.S. policymakers about the implications for U.S. economic and strategic interests. The focus is on China's diplomatic activities worldwide rather than its security policy. The Communist government's legitimacy led to international isolation, with many countries recognizing Taiwan as China's rightful government. However, in the early 1970s, the PRC gained recognition in the international community, especially after President Nixon's opening to China and the U.N.'s decision to recognize the PRC as China's legitimate representative. Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 1978 furthered China's economic and diplomatic engagement with the world. Since Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 1978, China has actively sought foreign investment, technology, and expertise, becoming an international export powerhouse. The country has expanded its participation in global organizations and embraced norms of the global economic system. Beijing has increased its diplomatic efforts since 2000, engaging in high-level exchanges, trade initiatives, and investment agreements with foreign governments. China's security policy has also undergone significant changes in parallel with its diplomatic and economic growth. China's security policy has evolved in response to new challenges since the mid-1990s, including the decline of the Soviet Union, U.S. global dominance, Taiwan's pro-independence activism, and China's rapid economic growth. The new security concept emphasizes mutual trust, equality, and cooperation in a post-Cold War order. China's new security concept focuses on assuring that its economic development and military growth do not pose a threat to its neighbors or the world. It aims to defuse international instabilities, expand China's wealth and influence without threatening neighbors, and balance U.S. global power in a way that serves China's interests. This approach presents a unique challenge to U.S. policymakers. China's international engagement poses a challenge to U.S. policymakers due to uncertainties about China's foreign policy goals and decision-making processes. The lack of consensus on whether China has a strategic plan or is pursuing tactical advantages raises questions about its intentions to replace the U.S. as a global power or focus on national development. The ambiguity surrounding China's strength and confidence on the international stage remains unresolved. China's foreign policymaking in China remains uncertain and lacks consistency in analysis or prediction. U.S. officials are often left in the dark about China's crisis management processes and decision-making, with many unknown variables influencing their foreign policy decisions. The uncertainties surrounding China's foreign policy decision-making processes, including the balance of power between internationalists and hardliners in Chinese politics, competing interests of PRC bureaucracies, and lack of transparency in Chinese foreign aid and investment agreements, make it challenging for the U.S. to address the challenges posed by China to U.S. and global interests. China's outward foreign direct investment in 2005 was 5 percent that of the United States, with 80 percent going to tax havens. PRC foreign assistance lacks oversight and is not tracked by a single government entity. The aid includes loans, debt forgiveness, public facility construction, and trade agreements, not meeting the traditional definition of overseas development assistance. PRC assistance is not provided in regularized annual allotments but follows a funding schedule determined by Beijing's diplomatic priorities. Beijing is reluctant to reveal the totals of its foreign assistance due to fear of domestic objection or because much of it may be returned back to China as foreign investment. The extent of PRC foreign assistance to other countries cannot be accurately determined. China is eligible for World Bank lending as a developing country in East Asia and the Pacific. China is the largest recipient of World Bank lending in Asia, receiving $1.51 billion in FY2008. Cumulative Bank lending to China since 1981 was approximately $42.2 billion. China is also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment among developing countries. There are ongoing debates in the U.S. about the strategy towards China's rise. The mid-1990s saw a divide between American hard-liners (Blue Team) and advocates for cooperation with China (Red Team). Views on China's threat to the U.S. vary, with some seeing it as a military menace while others advocate for cooperation. The debate influences military budgets and the potential for conflict with China. U.S. Administrations have generally favored cooperation with China to integrate it as a responsible stakeholder in the global system. The debate over U.S. policy towards China revolves around whether to view China as a potential economic partner or a strategic threat. This debate hinders American consensus on how to address the challenges posed by China's international engagement. The report aims to provide a framework for congressional policymakers to understand China's role in the global system and its implications for U.S. interests. The term \"soft power\" was coined by Harvard Professor Joseph S. Nye, Jr. in 1990 to describe the ability to shape preferences through attraction rather than coercion. Nye argues that soft power is crucial in world politics and goes beyond national culture, emphasizing the importance of utilizing this power effectively. American soft power is derived from the attractiveness of its culture, political ideals, and policies. It includes international trade practices, investments, development assistance, diplomacy, culture, aid, education, and tourism. While some believe in its continued strength, others argue that American soft power has declined in the 21st century. Some believe the perceived decline in American soft power is due to US policies and actions, with one official suggesting that soft power reserves are non-renewable. Global surveys show a downward trend in international views of the US, leading to reduced ability to achieve goals. The decline in American soft power is attributed to the rise of China as a global competitor projecting an alternative economic development model attractive to authoritarian governments. Some argue that soft power is temporary and the US has recovered from loss of influence before. China's soft power gains should not be exaggerated. China's policy direction is difficult to predict due to conflicting objectives and internal disagreements among political and bureaucratic players in the PRC system. Strong economic development remains a key focus amidst uncertainties about Beijing's international outreach. China's strong economic development is a primary objective for the PRC leadership to raise living standards, address social disaffection, and sustain regime legitimacy. With annual growth rates in double digits, China's rapid economic growth has driven international trade and investment agreements, particularly in energy resources where it became a net importer in 1995. China's energy demands are increasing at a rate of four to five percent annually, compared to one percent in industrialized countries. China has sought trade agreements, oil and gas contracts, and multilateral security arrangements with countries worldwide, focusing on access to energy resources to fuel domestic growth. China has exploration contracts and deals with various countries, including Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Burma. China's oil exploration interests extend to countries like Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Burma, Vietnam, and Malaysia. China's economic outreach into various regions also includes a political dynamic aimed at isolating Taiwan diplomatically. Taiwan has lost diplomatic relationships to China in recent years due to China's economic growth and influence. China has lost diplomatic relationships with several countries in recent years, including Malawi in 2008. The Taiwan factor plays a significant role in China's global relationships, particularly in Africa and the Pacific Islands. However, it is not as important in China's relations with Central Asian and Southeast Asian countries. Periodic tensions with the United States and Europe over Taiwan also impact bilateral relations. China's relationships with the U.S. and EU are affected by their statements and actions regarding Taiwan. Taiwan's competition with China is most prominent in Latin America and the Caribbean, where Taiwan maintains official diplomatic ties. The region's proximity to the U.S. allows Taiwan's leaders to request transit stops during official visits, which could be impacted if Taiwan's relationships in the region diminish. Taiwan also plays a role in China's interactions with U.S. allies in Asia, such as Japan, Australia, Korea, and the Philippines.

Taiwan's competition with China is most prominent in Latin America and the Caribbean, where Taiwan maintains official diplomatic ties. The region's proximity to the U.S. allows Taiwan's leaders to request transit stops during official visits, which could be impacted if Taiwan's relationships in the region diminish. Taiwan also plays a role in China's interactions with U.S. allies in Asia, such as Japan, Australia, Korea, and the Philippines. While all of these countries recognize the PRC and not Taiwan, as U.S. allies and hosts of U.S. military facilities they potentially could become a factor in any U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan. In 2005, for instance, the United States and Japan declared for the first time that Taiwan is a mutual security concern, implying a new Japanese willingness to confront China over Taiwan. It is in China's interests to use its diplomatic and economic activities to exert quiet pressure on these U.S. allies to stay out of any possible conflict over Taiwan. Maneuvering against Taiwan\u2014and ultimately \"recovering\" it\u2014provides one of the key contradictions in China's foreign policy objectives, as it is an issue that appears to trump other key policy goals. Chinese officials have said that they will \"pay any price\" to prevent Taiwan independence, although this would jeopardize the otherwise key imperative of assuring strong economic growth, not to mention risking armed conflict. China's policies towards Taiwan have evolved over time, offering economic incentives and emphasizing the importance of a peaceful international environment for sustainable economic development. PRC leaders seek to reassure other countries that China's economic growth is an opportunity, not a threat. Chinese leaders have reassured neighboring countries through various means, such as characterizing investments as \"win-win\" situations and resolving border disputes. Beijing has also cooperated on regional initiatives and prioritized stable relations with the United States, emphasizing China's \"peaceful rise\" on the world stage. China aims to enhance its global stature and influence while limiting US interference. Beijing seeks international partnerships to secure its economic growth and deter counterbalancing alliances. Beijing aims to secure opportunities not taken by the US, avoiding formal alliances to limit risks. The PRC relies on various frameworks for global interactions, establishing partnerships and agreements worldwide. China has established various economic relationships with recipient countries through initiatives like the \"Confucius Institute\" and Approved Destination Status (ADS). They have also increased participation in international organizations previously seen as U.S.-dominated. China now confidently participates in various international organizations, employing a \"Gulliver Strategy\" to constrain the U.S. in international agreements. They have successfully joined regional groupings in Asia and Latin America, including APEC, ARF, and FOCALAE. China has joined various international organizations in Asia and Latin America to expand its influence, excluding the United States. This includes the East Asia Summit (EAS) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The United States is not a participant in these new institutions. China has expanded its influence by joining international organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Forum (FOCAC) to enhance economic and security cooperation with Central Asian countries and African nations. Membership in these organizations excludes the United States. China's expanding influence is evident through its participation in international organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Forum (FOCAC). Many observers highlight China's competitive soft power strengths compared to the United States, suggesting that China's economic and political influence globally may surpass that of the U.S. However, a closer examination reveals potential downsides to China's perceived assets, as recipient governments are attracted to Chinese investments without considering potential drawbacks. China's expanding influence is evident through its participation in international organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Forum (FOCAC). China's economic and political influence globally may surpass that of the U.S. Chinese investments are attractive to recipient governments due to the lack of good governance requirements, human rights conditions, and environmental regulations. China markets this as a competitive advantage over Western capital. Chinese investments are seen as a competitive advantage over Western capital due to their efficiency and lack of bureaucracy. African leaders have found dealing with Chinese authorities to be quicker and more effective compared to international organizations like the World Bank. This has led to a preference for swifter solutions and unrestricted investments from China. China's \"no strings\" approach to investments in foreign countries, particularly in authoritarian regimes, may have negative consequences in the long term. The lack of standards and transparency in Chinese state-owned corporations could potentially counterbalance any soft power advantages gained from their investments. Unlike U.S. corporations, Chinese investments are carried out by state-owned entities with government backing, operating without the constraints of issuing annual reports. Chinese state-owned companies have the luxury of taking a longer-term, strategic view without the need to demonstrate short-term profits, unlike U.S. corporations investing overseas. This lack of discipline can lead to paying above-market prices for contracts and entering unprofitable arrangements to improve bilateral relations. Chinese SOEs have a high retained earnings rate and avoid paying dividends to government-controlled shareholders, raising concerns about this trend. The Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission enacted regulations in 2004 and 2005 to increase dividend payouts by state-owned enterprises. China's rapid international expansion poses challenges to American and global interests. Recognition of limitations in China's overseas activities can inform a more effective U.S. response. China's global involvement is overshadowed by the United States, which is already deeply entrenched in many regions. Beijing has had to adjust to the strong U.S. presence, as seen in the East Asian Summit where other participants resisted Chinese dominance by including counterweights like India, Australia, and New Zealand. Despite China's efforts, its actions in certain countries do not always achieve desired outcomes. China's foreign policy efforts, such as supporting the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti and forming the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, have not always been successful in countering U.S. influence. Despite China's attempts to expand its influence, countries it courts often have other foreign policy interests that limit Beijing's success. Additionally, increased trade dependence on China does not necessarily translate to support for Chinese interests in the United Nations. China's international interactions are based on a self-interested \"win-win\" approach. China's approach to international interactions is self-interested, focusing on issues where all sides can agree. Trade and investment agreements are prioritized, but lack depth in overall relationships. China's lack of transparency raises doubts about aid and investment levels, as seen in the discrepancy between reported and actual tsunami assistance to Indonesia. The PRC provided $22.6 million in tsunami assistance, but its foreign policy achievements may be limited if it continues to underdeliver. U.S. observers should be cautious of initial headlines about PRC involvement and consider the follow-through. Beijing's soft power potential from a \"win-win\" strategy is overshadowed by the U.S.'s capacity for global aid efforts. There is skepticism about Beijing's willingness to embrace altruism in its international engagements. Beijing's international engagement, despite a \"win-win\" strategy, brings complications like cultural backlash, kidnappings, and murders due to Chinese workers and companies operating overseas. This has led to attacks on PRC oil drilling sites and workers in Africa and Central Asia. China's international activities have led to concerns in Central Asia about energy asset acquisitions and push-back in some Asian countries with large ethnic Chinese populations. These confrontations may increase, causing unfavorable publicity for China and political problems for policymakers. The increasing availability of information through the Internet and cell phones allows Chinese citizens to learn about China's overseas investments, which could create tensions as domestic unemployment rises. China is investing millions in overseas projects, causing concerns about domestic unemployment and infrastructure development. Beijing's strong state-owned companies give it an advantage over the US in overseas activities, attracting international attention and enhancing its soft power. The US, however, has a substantial global private-sector presence that China lacks. The US has a substantial global private-sector presence with diverse institutions and values scattered worldwide. This presence, although uncoordinated, leaves a significant global footprint and can trigger anti-American sentiments. China's assertive diplomacy and improved relationships with regional neighbors hint at increasing competition with the US for resources, power, and influence globally. The first East Asia Summit (EAS) included 16 Asian and Pacific powers, excluding the United States. The second EAS meeting in 2007 focused on agreements for a free-trade bloc and signed the Cebu Declaration on East Asian Energy Security. Prior to the mid-1990s, Sino-ASEAN relations were marked by territorial disputes and concerns about China's military ambitions and economic competitiveness. The 2005 EAS meeting is part of a trend in growing Sino-ASEAN regional cooperation, with China signing a free trade agreement with ASEAN in November 2004. Trade between China and ASEAN increased to over $160 billion in 2006. China also signed a new trade agreement on services with ASEAN in 2007, moving towards a free trade agreement. China's unique relations with Burma involve military, economic, and infrastructure development assistance. China's relations with Burma involve substantial military, economic, and infrastructure development assistance. Beijing is constructing naval bases in Burma to gain access to the Indian Ocean. China vetoed a U.S.-sponsored U.N. Security Council resolution criticizing Burma's human rights record in 2007. Additionally, China has improved its relationships with India and Central Asia, signing agreements for defense cooperation. China has strengthened its defense cooperation with Central Asian countries through joint military exercises and agreements within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. It has also pursued energy deals with Australia and explored a free trade agreement, leading to concerns in Australia about a perceived hard-line U.S. policy towards China. This growing regional and global importance of China has caused a public backlash in Australia. Improvements in Sino-Japanese relations began with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to China in 2006, marking a shift from past tensions over visits to the Yasukuni Shrine. President Hu Jintao's successful visit to Japan in 2008 led to proposals for enhanced cooperation and cultural exchanges. China and Japan have expanded trading relations, with China surpassing the United States as Japan's largest trading partner in 2004. However, political tensions persist due to Japan's past conquest and occupation of China during World War II. Chinese leaders are wary of Japan's efforts to become more assertive diplomatically and militarily. Economic competition, especially for access to Siberian oil, has further strained relations between the two countries. China and Japan have tensions over territorial claims in the East China Sea, particularly in the Chunxiao Gas Field. Despite competition for Siberian oil access, in 2008, China and Japan reached a consensus on joint oil exploration in the East China Sea. Energy resources and security issues also play a significant role in China's relations with Russia. In 2006, Russian President Putin and PRC President Hu Jintao discussed opening a gas pipeline to China within five years. Regular bilateral visits have continued, with President Medvedev visiting China in 2008. China has been reliant on arms purchases from Russia due to Western restrictions, but there has been a 62% drop in arms imports from Russia in 2007. In 2005, Russia and China established national security consultations, with China considering Russia its main partner for strategic cooperation. They conducted joint military exercises in 2005 and 2007 as part of their security cooperation. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) conducted anti-terrorist military exercises, which are now regular events. China and Russia, despite historical tensions, are seeking common ground as a counterweight to U.S. global power. China has intensified its relations with the European Union (EU), with the EU considering China a \"strategic partner\" and prioritizing Sino-EU ties in foreign policy objectives. On January 18, 2007, the European Commissioner for External Relations called for the EU arms embargo against China to be lifted, despite U.S. opposition. In November 2007, the EU and China reaffirmed their commitment to the \"one-China\" policy at the Tenth China-EU Summit in Beijing. They agreed to cooperate on political dialogue, human rights, non-proliferation, disarmament, and climate change, supporting a strong multilateral system led by the United Nations. China has been selling missile technology and sensitive materials to countries like Iran, Syria, Libya, and Iraq. They are also increasing their presence in the Middle East as a major energy player, signing significant oil deals with Iran and increasing trade with Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Additionally, China values its relations in Africa, with President Hu Jintao making multiple trips to the continent. China places a premium on its relations in Africa, with President Hu Jintao making his third trip to the continent in three years on January 30, 2007. The China-Africa Cooperation Forum was established in 2000 to promote mutual economic development and cooperation, with representatives from 45 African countries attending the first Ministerial Conference in October of that year. China has faced pressure from Western countries to address the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, but has vowed to use its U.N. Security Council position to block stronger sanctions on Sudan. China has targeted resource-rich African nations for energy-related development, including Sudan and Angola. They have also shown interest in iron ore deposits in Liberia and Gabon. Some observers suggest a political dynamic to China's push into Africa, as four of the 23 countries that still maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan are in Africa. China's expanding economic and trade relationships with Latin America and the Caribbean are also influenced by political dynamics. China's expanding economic and trade relationships with Latin America and the Caribbean have political and economic consequences for the United States. China's presence in the region includes sending forces to Haiti and signing a Free Trade Agreement with Chile. Energy concerns also drive China's diplomacy in Latin America, with significant deals in Venezuela and Brazil. In November 2004, a $10 billion energy deal was announced. Following visits between Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Chinese officials, agreements were signed committing China National Petroleum Corporation to invest over $400 million in Venezuelan oil and gas reserves. Concerns arise about potential diversion of oil from the US due to poor US-Venezuelan relations. Additionally, China signed agreements with Canada on energy cooperation, including gas, nuclear, clean energy, and oil sources. Canada and China have prioritized energy cooperation, focusing on gas, nuclear, clean energy, and oil sources, particularly Alberta's \"oil sands.\" Enbridge plans a $4 billion pipeline project to transport oil from Alberta to the west coast for export, with PetroChina initially involved but later withdrawing. The PRC's international activities are seen as a legitimate pursuit of economic growth within the global system. China's rise within the global system, led by the United States, has sparked debate on its impact on U.S. interests. While some advocate for further integration of China into the system, others fear its growing international influence may impede American global interests. Historical examples of conflict between reigning and rising powers are cited as cause for concern, especially regarding China's presence in Latin America and the Caribbean. The presence of China in Latin America and the Caribbean is concerning as it could strengthen anti-U.S. political leaders, disrupt U.S. military operations in the region, and pose challenges for U.S. policymakers in terms of competition for influence and economic relationships. The current debate revolves around the impact of China's influence on U.S. relationships with allies and non-alliance countries. Questions arise about the effects of PRC investments on governance and corruption, as well as its advantages in international business competition. The focus is on persuading China to align with international norms and the implications for U.S. global objectives if China competes as an international lender. The United States must prepare for potential military confrontation with China as it expands its military power to protect its international interests. Additionally, the U.S. needs to address competition with China for energy resources, commodities, and space exploration. The U.S. should consider reassessing its policy towards Taiwan in light of China's rise and be mindful of global perceptions of U.S. disengagement. The United States must consider how to respond to China's expanding global presence. If policymakers believe the current approach is sufficient, little action is needed. However, if they see a need to compete with China, there are numerous policy options to consider. In response to China's global activities, the United States could counter by reinvigorating engagement worldwide, including in Asia by participating more actively in regional economic and political forums like the SCO, EAS, and ASEAN. Additionally, the US could propose policies to strengthen its influence in the Asia-Pacific region through organizations like APEC. The United States could enhance its influence in Africa through increased bilateral cooperation, trade, and military relations, involving China and African governments in dialogue to address mutual interests and urgent challenges such as armed conflicts and health crises. This could be achieved by creating an observational status within the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation for the US and other countries to participate in consultations and learn about policy priorities. The United States could play a more active role in addressing global issues such as climate change and energy conservation. It could also enhance cooperation with Russia, China, the EU, and other powers to assist fragile states in achieving independence and security. Additionally, the US could strengthen programs to promote the rule of law and good governance in China by encouraging support for a rule-based global legal environment and signing agreements for public-private sector governance initiatives. The United States aims to collaborate with China on improving its foreign aid structure, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and efficiency. This includes differentiating grant-based aid from trade subsidies, monitoring aid effectiveness, harmonizing reporting with other donors, and promoting best practices. The U.S. also suggests utilizing the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue for broader bilateral and multilateral issues. The United States could improve its knowledge base and pursue its foreign interests more competitively by maintaining transparency in China's international efforts. This includes publicizing accurate information on PRC assistance, promoting democratization and human rights values, re-evaluating Free Trade Agreements, streamlining assistance and investment processes, and countering PRC efforts to isolate Taiwan. The United States aims to counter China's efforts to isolate Taiwan by leveraging U.S. innovation to actively support the developing world."
