    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System Act\". It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that the United States and its territories have 169 hazardous volcanoes, with eruptions since 1980 causing loss of life and property damage. Ash eruptions pose a threat to jet aircraft, as seen in incidents like the 1989 eruption of Redoubt Volcano in Alaska. International and domestic flights over certain regions are at risk of engine failure due to volcanic activity. The United States and its territories have 169 hazardous volcanoes, with various risks such as mudflows, lava flows, toxic gas emissions, explosions, and seismic unrest. Modern technology allows for early warnings before eruptions, enabling emergency response agencies and the public to prepare and minimize potential damage. The efficacy of volcano monitoring is demonstrated by successful forecasts and warnings of various eruptions, including Augustine Volcano, Redoubt Volcano, and Mt. Spurr. The United States Geological Survey and its partners operate observatories in Alaska, Washington, and Hawaii. The United States has three main volcano observatories: the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory in Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory in Yellowstone National Park spanning Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and the California Volcano Observatory in Menlo Park. A survey has identified significant monitoring gaps in the country's volcano monitoring system, leaving it vulnerable to preventable damage from large volcanic eruptions. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nIn this Act:\n(1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United States Geological Survey.\n(2) System.--The term ``System'' means the National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System established under section 4(a)(1). The Secretary will establish the National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System within the United States Geological Survey to monitor and protect citizens from volcanic activity. The System aims to modernize and unify monitoring systems of volcano observatories in the US. The National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System in the United States aims to unify observatories into a single system to monitor all volcanoes in the country. It includes a national volcano watch office, data center, and grants program for research in volcano monitoring. The objective is to upgrade existing networks on monitored volcanoes and install new networks on unmonitored ones. The National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System in the United States aims to modernize monitoring activities with emerging technologies like digital broadband seismometers, GPS receivers, radar interferometry, and gas emission spectrometry. The Secretary must submit a 5-year management plan to Congress within 90 days of the Act's enactment, including cost estimates for modernization and operation. The Secretary will establish an advisory committee and may form partnerships with institutions of higher education and State agencies for the National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System. The Secretary will coordinate activities with relevant Federal agencies, including the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration. An annual report describing the activities under this Act will be submitted to Congress. SEC. 5. FUNDING. Authorization of Appropriations for fiscal years 2016 through 2026 to carry out this Act. Amounts under this section supplement, not supplant, Federal funds for US Geological Survey hazards activities."
