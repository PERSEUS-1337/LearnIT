    "content": "The \"Imported Ethanol Parity Act\" is the short title of the Act. The Act includes findings related to imported ethanol. Congress finds that the United States tariff on ethanol serves as an offset to an excise tax credit, with the purpose of protecting the United States taxpayer. The Renewable Fuels Association and American Coalition for Ethanol have expressed their views on the tariff. The American Coalition for Ethanol, American Farm Bureau Federation, National Corn Growers Association, National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, National Sorghum Producers, and Renewable Fuels Association support the blender tax credit for ethanol blending, regardless of origin. Congress proposed reducing the excise tax credit for blending ethanol but extending the temporary duty on imported ethanol. The legislation proposes to increase the import duty on ethanol to $0.09 per gallon, making it more expensive for ethanol imports in the US market. California is implementing a Low Carbon Fuels Standard to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels, while the Energy Independence and Security Act requires the use of advanced biofuels with lower emissions than gasoline. Ethanol's emissions vary based on production methods and feedstocks. The differences in ethanol production methods and feedstocks impact its use for meeting low-carbon fuel requirements in California and under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Sugar cane ethanol plants have lower fossil fuel input compared to corn-to-ethanol processes. A 2007 report found that sugar-based ethanol has 68% lower greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline, while corn-based ethanol from the Midwest has 15-28% lower emissions than gasoline. Ethanol production costs vary by region and can be competitive with gasoline. A global biofuels marketplace allows for beneficial trade between regions to stabilize fuel and food prices. The US and Brazil formed an alliance in 2007 to advance biofuel research and production in the Western Hemisphere. President Bush emphasized the importance of Central America becoming energy producers to spread prosperity in the region. A study by MIT in 2008 found that the current ethanol distribution system in the US is not efficient in supplying ethanol to the East Coast markets. The President is required to reduce the temporary duty on ethanol to match any reduction in Federal income or excise tax credits under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code, ensuring that the duty is equal to or lower than any applicable tax credit."
