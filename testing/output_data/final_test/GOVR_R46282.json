    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Caregiver Support Program was established to assist seriously disabled veterans from conflicts like OEF/OIF who require extended care. In OEF/OIF, seven out of eight seriously injured servicemembers survived, often needing complex medical care and rehabilitation for polytraumatic injuries. The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-163) required VA to establish specific supports for caregivers of veterans who often shoulder the burden in the rehabilitation of returning veterans with physical and mental health injuries. Family members and friends relocate and act as caregivers, sometimes leaving their jobs to support veterans receiving treatment in hospital settings. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) offers caregiver support through two programs established by the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010: a Program of General Caregiver Support Services and a Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. The general caregivers program provides basic support like education and training, while the family caregivers program offers health care benefits and a monthly stipend to caregivers of veterans seriously injured in the line of duty on or after September 11, 2001. These programs are collectively known as the Caregiver Support Program and are distinct from other VA programs as the beneficiary is a nonveteran with a relationship to a living veteran. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 expanded eligibility for caregiver services to caregivers of veterans of all eras in two phases. Veterans injured before May 7, 1975, are eligible first, followed by veterans injured between May 7, 1975, and a later date. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 expanded caregiver services eligibility to veterans injured before May 7, 1975, in the first phase, and veterans injured between May 7, 1975, and September 11, 2001, in the second phase. The upcoming expansion is expected to increase enrollment and may require changes to the family caregivers program due to the older age and different disabling conditions of the newly eligible population. The Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-163) established two caregiver support programs for veterans: the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers and the Program of General Caregiver Support Services. These programs are collectively known as the Caregiver Support Program under Title 38 of the United States Code. The Caregiver Support Program, established under the Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010, provides medical care, counseling, mental health services, lodging, and subsistence for caregivers of veterans. The VA MISSION Act expanded services, implemented new IT systems, and extended eligibility to caregivers of veterans from all eras. The program includes two caregiver designations: general caregiver and family caregiver, with a primary designation within the family caregiver category. The VA Caregiver Support Program, established under the Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010, provides medical care, counseling, mental health services, lodging, and subsistence for caregivers of veterans. The program includes two caregiver designations: general caregiver and family caregiver, with primary and secondary designations within the family caregiver category. Caregiver designation is based on eligibility for either program, with supports provided accordingly. The general caregivers program does not require a formal application process or clinical evaluation for benefits. The family caregiver, designated under the family caregivers program, provides personal care services to a veteran enrolled in the VA health care system who is unable to perform daily activities or needs supervision/protection. The caregiver does not have to live with the veteran and must contact a local VA medical center for services. Caregivers are recognized as collaborative partners in the veteran's care, and both veterans and caregivers undergo an eligibility determination process for program designation. The VA family caregivers program requires individuals to complete a joint application with the veteran to be designated as primary or secondary caregivers. Eligibility is based on meeting statutory definitions of a veteran or being a servicemember with a medical discharge date. Veteran eligibility is typically based on a serious injury incurred in the line of duty on or after September 11, 2001. The VA family caregivers program is for post-9/11 veterans who need personal care services for at least six months due to specific clinical criteria. The veteran's primary care team must clinically determine their participation in the program, and they cannot receive care from another individual or entity simultaneously. The VA family caregivers program is for post-9/11 veterans who need personal care services for at least six months due to specific clinical criteria. The veteran must agree to receive care at home from the family caregiver and ongoing care from a primary care team after VA designates a family caregiver. VA recognizes seven ADLs for eligibility, including eating, grooming, bathing, and dressing. The VA family caregivers program is for post-9/11 veterans who need personal care services for at least six months due to specific clinical criteria. VA recognizes seven ADLs for eligibility, including bathing, dressing, toileting, prosthetic adjustment, and mobility. The VA family caregivers program requires veterans to demonstrate the inability to perform specific activities of daily living (ADLs) for at least six months to qualify for enrollment. The program also considers the need for supervision or protection in cases of seizures, difficulty in planning and organizing, safety concerns, sleep regulation issues, and delusions/hallucinations. The veteran must demonstrate inability to maintain safe behavior due to delusions or hallucinations, recent memory impairment, and affective/behavioral dysregulation to qualify for enrollment in the family caregivers program. A caregiver must be at least 18 years old and either a family member or living with the veteran. To apply for the family caregivers program, an individual must be at least 18 years old and either a family member or someone who will live with the veteran upon approval. The individual does not need to have a familial relationship with the veteran and can certify that they will live with the veteran. Veterans meeting the eligibility criteria are encouraged to apply using VA form 10-10CG, which can be mailed to the VA Health Eligibility Center or submitted to the caregiver support coordinator at the local VA medical center. The application for the family caregivers program requires identifying up to three caregivers, undergoing evaluation for eligibility based on the veteran's injury, and completing an initial assessment, education, and training. VA aims to complete the approval process within 45 days of application submission. The 45-day deadline for the family caregivers program application can be extended under certain circumstances. A VA primary care team assesses caregiver applicants to ensure they can complete education and training, as well as understand and follow the veteran's care needs and treatment plan. The team also determines the veteran's eligibility based on specific criteria. The VA assigns veterans to tier levels based on personal care service needs. Prospective caregivers are eligible for the Veterans Transportation Service program. VA administers a training program covering 10 core competencies for caregivers. The VA administers a training program covering 10 core competencies for caregivers, including medication management, infection control, and communication skills. Prospective caregivers can be reimbursed for travel expenses through the VTS or VA beneficiary travel program. VA also provides respite care for veterans if needed before an initial home care assessment is conducted. The clinician or clinical team visits the veteran's home to assess caregiver competency, measure the veteran's well-being, ability to complete daily tasks, special care needs, vital signs, signs of abuse or neglect, health risks, and screens for depression. They report findings to the primary care team and can recommend follow-up care referrals. This assessment must be completed within 10 days of caregiver certification. The VA conducts home care assessments for veterans and caregivers within 10 days of returning home. Approval for caregivers is independent of each other, and appeals can be made if deemed ineligible. Ongoing monitoring is required for those enrolled in the family caregivers program. The VA conducts home care assessments for veterans and caregivers within 10 days of returning home. Approval for caregivers is independent of each other, and appeals can be made if deemed ineligible. Ongoing monitoring is required for those enrolled in the family caregivers program, with assessments every 90 days through various methods including in-person, telehealth, or phone, and an annual in-home visit. The purpose is to monitor the veteran's health, well-being, and the adequacy of personal care services provided by the family caregiver. Caregiver status can be revoked if eligibility criteria are not met or if it is no longer in the veteran's best interest. If revoked due to improvement, death, or institutionalization of the veteran, benefits continue for 90 days. The caregiver designation can be revoked by either the family caregiver or the veteran, with different termination timelines. If a new primary family caregiver is designated within 30 days, the benefits of the revoked caregiver will end the day before. Table 1 outlines the services available under the caregiver support programs. The three categories of caregiver status determine eligibility for specific services and benefits. General caregivers have limited services, while primary family caregivers receive the most benefits. Table 1 outlines these services based on Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations and VHA Directive 1152(1). General caregivers have access to the VA caregiver support line, peer mentoring, education, training, telehealth, counseling, and respite care. The caregiver support line is available to general and family caregivers, as well as individuals seeking information about services and eligibility. It serves as a resource referral center, provides emotional support, and hosts monthly education calls. The peer support mentoring program facilitates mentor/mentee relationships for caregivers of veterans enrolled in VA health care. VA offers mentoring programs for caregivers, including the Building Better Caregivers program and REACH VA, providing education, training, and support. Mentees commit to at least six months of mentoring, with one-time connections available for those needing brief support. Building Better Caregivers offers online workshops with weekly lessons and group support, while REACH VA provides individual coaching to help caregivers develop caregiving skills. The individual coaching program for caregivers is specifically for those caring for veterans with certain diagnoses. Coaches offer four hour-long sessions over two to three months, with additional sessions available if needed. Telehealth services benefit caregivers by allowing veterans to receive medical care without needing assistance for transportation. Caregivers can access VA mobile applications for support. The VA offers counseling services for caregivers, including consultation, professional counseling, marriage and family counseling, training, and mental health services. These services are available if deemed necessary for the veteran's treatment plan. Caregivers can also receive 30 days of respite care per calendar year. Veterans are eligible for 30 days of respite care per calendar year, providing short-term relief for caregivers. This care can be given in various settings and must be medically and age-appropriate. Secondary family caregivers receive the same benefits as general caregivers, with additional mental health services and travel reimbursement. Secondary family caregivers can receive mental health services regardless of the medical benefit to the veteran. Services include individual and group therapy, counseling, and peer support groups. Mental health services are limited to outpatient care and do not include medication. Travel reimbursement through the VA Beneficiary Travel program is available for secondary family caregivers related to the veteran's medical treatment. Reimbursement includes expenses for lodging, meals, and travel to medical appointments. Primary family caregivers are eligible for benefits such as lodging, meals, and travel to medical appointments. They can also receive health care through CHAMPVA and a monthly stipend based on the veteran's care needs. Enrollment in the family caregivers program does not automatically provide health care services, as caregivers must meet additional criteria to be eligible for CHAMPVA. CHAMPVA is a health insurance program for enrolled veterans where care is provided by private sector providers. Veterans are assigned to one of three tier levels based on personal care service hours required. Monthly stipend levels for primary family caregivers are determined by multiplying the assigned tier level hours by the hourly wage for a home health aide. The monthly stipend for primary family caregivers is based on the hourly wage index for home health aides in the region where the veteran and caregiver live. Stipend amounts vary by tier level and location, with caregivers not considered VA employees and the stipend not taxable. The administrative structure of the Caregiver Support Program and historical funding details are outlined, referencing VHA Directive 1152(1). The Caregiver Support Program is structured based on VHA Directive 1152(1) and is funded through VA congressional budget submissions. The program is administered by a central office within VHA, with national offices like the Health Eligibility Center and Office of Community Care playing significant roles. Regionally, each VISN ensures medical centers employ Caregiver Support staff. The VISN ensures each medical center has a Caregiver Support Coordinator who administers the program locally. The VISN lead provides guidance and support to coordinators, who manage the family caregiver program at the operational level. The coordinator advocates for caregivers and veterans internally. The Caregiver Support Coordinator advocates for caregivers and veterans internally, ensures services and benefits are available, and develops programs. Expenditures for the Caregiver Support Program have stabilized since FY2015, with a decrease in expenditures in FY2019. VA attributes decreasing enrollment to lower application approval rates and increasing costs. Enrollment in recent years may be declining due to lower application approval rates and increased revocations for veterans and caregivers who do not meet eligibility requirements. The monthly stipend for primary family caregivers is the largest expenditure under the Caregiver Support Program, totaling $347 million in FY2019. The expansion of the program to pre-9/11 veterans is expected to drive up costs, with estimates of $710 million in FY2020 and $1.2 billion in FY2021. The eligibility expansion depends on the certification of a new IT system in Phase 1 of the VA MISSION Act. The VA is working on certifying a new IT system to administer the Caregiver Support Program. Phase 1 will cover veterans with serious injuries before May 7, 1975, and Phase 2 will expand eligibility to all eras two years later. Potential issues include delays in IT system implementation and increased costs. VA published a proposed rule on March 6, 2020, to implement changes required under the VA MISSION Act. The VA is working on certifying a new IT system to administer the Caregiver Support Program as required by the VA MISSION Act. The public comment period for the proposed rule ends on May 5, 2020. The IT system must be implemented to support the family caregiver program, but VA has not yet certified it. The IT system used to support the family caregivers program, called the Caregiver Application Tracker (CAT), was found inadequate under the VA MISSION Act. Attempts to improve CAT with a project called CAT Rescue failed, leading to its termination in April 2018. The replacement system, Caregivers Tool (CareT), also faced deficiencies and was terminated in February 2019. A third effort to acquire a new system, based on a commercial product, began in March 2019. The VA is deploying the Caregiver Record Management Application (CARMA) in three phases to replace the existing IT system supporting the family caregivers program. The first two phases have been completed, with the third phase expected to finish in summer 2020. This phase includes updating legacy systems, enabling online application submission, and enhancing reporting functionality. Certification of the system is expected at the end of phase 3, with the first eligibility expansion to occur then. The program serves around 20,000 post-9/11 veterans and their caregivers. The VA's family caregivers program serves around 20,000 post-9/11 veterans and their caregivers. Expansion of eligibility to pre-9/11 veterans injured before May 7, 1975, is projected to add approximately 83,000 more veterans and caregivers. The largest cost driver in the program is the monthly stipend to family caregivers, with expenditures totaling $347 million in FY2019. With VA's projected expansion, stipend payments are estimated to reach $870 million in FY2021 and nearly $1.2 billion in FY2022. Other program components may also require additional resources to meet the increased demand. The VA's family caregivers program is projected to require additional resources to meet the increased demand from eligible veterans and caregivers. The program currently requires ongoing monitoring in a veteran and caregiver's home, with a VA clinical team visiting each home at least annually. VA's funding requests have significantly increased in recent years to support the expansion of eligibility. The President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors focused on providing services and supports to family caregivers of veterans injured in Afghanistan and Iraq. Recommendations included strengthening family support programs and providing training and counseling for families of servicemembers requiring long-term personal care. The VA Advisory Committee on OEF/OIF Veterans and Families was established in April 2007 to assess the needs of veterans and families. The committee recommended increasing support for caregivers, including mental health counseling services for those caring for severely injured veterans. The VA established a Caregiver Advisory Board in June 2008 to provide mental health counseling, financial support, and education for caregivers of severely disabled veterans. The board oversees pilot programs aimed at improving caregiver assistance for veterans with specific conditions like dementia and traumatic brain injuries. The 111th Congress debated legislative proposals to support family caregivers of veterans, leading to the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010. This legislation aimed to provide assistance to caregivers of veterans injured in conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. The 111th Congress debated legislation to support family caregivers of veterans, leading to the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010. Senator Daniel Akaka introduced a bill in 2006 to improve caregiver assistance services for veterans, emphasizing the challenges faced by caregivers of veterans with severe injuries. The legislation aims to provide comprehensive assistance to caregivers of veterans, including a pilot program to improve caregiver support in home-based settings. This initiative was authorized under the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare, and Information Technology Act of 2006 and extended through the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008. The Family Caregiver Program Act of 2009 (S. 801) introduced by Senator Akaka aims to provide health care improvements for veterans by supporting their family caregivers. The legislation targets caregivers of veterans with disabilities from recent wars, including those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Senator Akaka emphasized the importance of assisting family members who care for veterans. A full-fledged permanent program is needed in VA to support caregivers of seriously injured veterans, providing education, grants, counseling, and other services. An amended version of S. 801 was reported by Senator Akaka, authorizing VA to waive emergency care costs for caregivers, create a comprehensive assistance program, pay for lodging and travel expenses, and conduct a national survey of family caregivers. The House introduced legislation to assist caregivers of OEF/OIF veterans, passing the Caregiver Assistance and Resource Enhancement Act (H.R. 3155) on July 27, 2009. The bill required VA to provide support services to eligible caregivers of veterans with severe service-connected disabilities or illnesses. The Senate introduced a bill, S. 801, to provide support for caregivers of veterans who require hospitalization or nursing home care. However, the bill was put on hold. Senator Akaka later introduced a new bill, S. 1963, which included provisions from S. 801 and was passed by the Senate. The bill waived charges for caregivers, provided assistance and training, mental health services, stipends, and lodging for family caregivers. It also required a survey on caregivers to be conducted by the VA in coordination with DOD. The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010, signed into law by President Obama on May 5, 2010, provided programs and services to support caregivers of veterans. Legislative efforts followed to expand eligibility for the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers to veterans of all eras, leading to the enactment of the VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-182, as amended) was enacted to strengthen VA internal systems and networks."
