Data-efficient recognition may be possible with representations that make natural signal variability more predictable. Contrastive Predictive Coding is improved to enable generalization from small labeled data amounts. With only 1% of ImageNet labels, the model achieves 73% Top-5 accuracy, outperforming supervised networks by 28% and semi-supervised methods by 14%. This representation also shows promise for object detection on the PASCAL-VOC 2007 dataset. Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) enables data-efficient recognition, outperforming supervised networks with only 1% of ImageNet labels. ResNet trained on CPC achieves high accuracy on the PASCAL-VOC 2007 dataset, showing promise for object detection. The difference in data-efficiency between biological and machine vision is attributed to structured representations. The difference in data-efficiency between biological and machine vision is attributed to structured representations. An alternative hypothesis suggests that intelligent systems can learn about the world's structure in an unsupervised manner. Good representations should make natural signals more predictable, as human perceptual representations linearize temporal transformations in natural videos. In this work, the authors hypothesize that spatially predictable representations, such as those learned through Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC), can improve data-efficiency in artificial systems. CPC is an unsupervised technique that has shown strong performance in various modalities like speech, natural language, and images. Its generality and effectiveness in downstream tasks make it a promising candidate for further investigation. Our work revisits Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and improves its architecture, resulting in a significant increase in ImageNet classification accuracy. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of CPC representations in training deep networks with very few labeled images, outperforming other unsupervised methods and even surpassing supervised methods on the entire ImageNet dataset. Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) is revisited and its architecture enhanced, leading to a notable boost in ImageNet classification accuracy. The effectiveness of CPC representations is demonstrated in training deep networks with minimal labeled images, outperforming other unsupervised methods and even surpassing supervised methods on the entire ImageNet dataset. Linear classification accuracy may not always predict low-data classification accuracy, highlighting its importance as a standalone benchmark for unsupervised learning. Additionally, CPC representations show state-of-the-art performance in object detection on PASCAL-VOC 2007. Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) improves ImageNet classification accuracy by predicting future observations from past ones using neural networks. The architecture divides input images into patches encoded into vectors, with predictions made using a masked convolutional network. This approach prevents trivial solutions and enhances representation learning. Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) enhances ImageNet classification accuracy by predicting future observations from past ones using neural networks. The architecture divides input images into patches encoded into vectors, with predictions made using a masked convolutional network. The prediction task involves predicting 'future' feature vectors from current context vectors, evaluated using a contrastive loss to recognize the target among randomly sampled feature vectors. The framework for semi-supervised learning with Contrastive Predictive Coding involves unsupervised pre-training with a spatial prediction task. An image is divided into patches encoded independently, aggregated with a context network for linear prediction, and used for a classification task after training the encoder network. The Contrastive Predictive Coding framework involves training a classifier network for supervised learning tasks, fine-tuning the encoder network for classification, and using the latents as representations for downstream tasks. The CPC objective maximizes mutual information between latent variables and negative samples from other locations in the image. The Contrastive Predictive Coding framework involves training a classifier network for supervised learning tasks and using the latents as representations for downstream tasks. The dataset of unlabeled images used for pre-training is the full ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 training set. Linear classification is the standard benchmark for evaluating the quality of unsupervised image representations. Efficient classification tests whether the CPC representation enables visual learning from few labels using an arbitrary deep neural network. The labeled dataset is a subset of ImageNet, ranging from 1% to 100%. The supervised loss is cross-entropy, and data augmentation techniques are applied during training. Transfer learning tests the generality of the representation by applying it to a new task and dataset, such as image detection on the PASCAL-2007 dataset using the Faster-RCNN architecture and loss. Various data augmentation techniques are used for training, including color-dropping and scale-augmentation. The feature extractor can be kept fixed for linear classification or fine-tuned for the supervised objective. In data-efficient learning, the feature extractor and classifier are initialized with previous solutions and trained for the supervised objective. Representation learning and semisupervised learning are used to make use of unlabeled data. Generative modeling and generative adversarial models have been successful in representation learning. Generative adversarial models have been successful in representation learning, leading to gains in linear classification accuracy. Self-supervised techniques involve formulating tasks with learned representations, such as recognizing spatial layouts in images. Tasks like color prediction, image orientation, and data augmentation invariance have also been shown to be useful for representation learning. Additionally, leveraging video cues has been explored beyond single images. Self-supervised tasks utilize various cues like object tracking, frame ordering, object boundaries, camera motion, scene geometry, and sound for representation learning. Contrastive methods like CPC maximize mutual information between latent representations using InfoNCE. Two methods, Contrastive Multiview Coding and Augmented Multiscale Deep InfoMax, have been proposed using the same loss function as Noise-Contrastive Estimation. AMDIM predicts representations across layers in the model and limits the receptive field by constraining spatial convolutions. Label-propagation is an alternative approach for improving data efficiency. Label-propagation, whether discrete or continuous, involves training on labeled data and then using the model to label unlabeled data, with predictions constrained to be smooth. Representation learning and semi-supervised learning can be combined effectively, focusing solely on representation learning in this paper. The effectiveness of CPC in enabling data-efficient learning is questioned, as unsupervised metrics may not reflect downstream performance. Implementation details have been shown to be crucial. In section 4.1, the CPC model is evaluated using linear classification to align with best practices in representation learning. The best performing model is selected in section 4.2 to assess efficient classification. The generality of the results is investigated through transfer learning in section 4.3. The new model design aims to increase the scale and efficiency of the encoder architecture while maximizing the supervisory signal from each image. The model's performance is impacted by four axes: increasing model capacity, improving training efficiency, increasing task complexity, and performing extensive patch-based augmentation. Recent work has shown that networks and more effective training improve self-supervised learning. Recent work has shown that larger architectures deliver larger improvements in self-supervised learning with more efficient training, self-supervised losses, and patch-based augmentations. Additionally, the use of layer normalization is highlighted as a key factor in training efficiency, with early works using batch normalization for context prediction with patches. In contrast to using batch normalization for context prediction with patches, the study finds that batch normalization hinders the performance of large models in CPC. Layer normalization is proposed as a more effective alternative, leading to improved accuracy for both smaller and larger architectures. Additionally, larger architectures are at a higher risk of overfitting, which is addressed by demanding more from the network. To address the risk of overfitting in larger models for context prediction with patches, the study proposes asking more from the network by predicting patches using context from above, to the right, and to the left. This approach results in up to four times as many prediction tasks and improves model accuracy. Limiting the range of prediction length to {2, 3} performs better than {2, ..., 5}. The prediction length range of {2, 3} outperformed {2, ..., 5} in the original CPC model. Patch-based augmentation techniques were implemented to enhance low-level pattern recognition. Color dropping and horizontal patch flipping were found to improve model accuracy, especially for the larger model. These changes led to a significant improvement in the CPC model's performance. The changes made to the original CPC model resulted in a substantial improvement in performance, making it competitive with recent approaches and outperforming prior methods. Training the patch-based architecture from scratch in a fully supervised manner also showed high accuracy, indicating CPC's effectiveness in utilizing architecture and data for image recognition. The study evaluates the performance of purely-supervised networks on varying sizes of labeled datasets, finding ResNet-152 to be the best performer. Despite efforts to optimize the supervised model for low-data classification, the accuracy only reaches 44.1% when trained on 1% of the dataset. Contrastive Predictive Coding models in different spatial directions are also analyzed. The study evaluates the performance of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) for data-efficient learning by using CPC latents z instead of raw image pixels x for classification, showing significant improvements in data-efficiency compared to purely supervised networks. Model specifications in Section 4.1 are crucial for low-data classification, with predictable representations enabling efficient classification across different data-regimes. Increasing the predictability in the representation of CPC latents improves low-data classification performance, as shown by ablating model parameters and comparing linear classification results. Not all modifications that enhance linear classification also benefit low-data classification. Increasing the predictability in the representation of CPC latents improves low-data classification performance. Different architectural specifications also affect task performance. The VAT + Entropy Minimization parameters do not show correlation with performance in other tasks. Comparisons with other unsupervised representations are made in Table 2. Table 2 compares our best model with other works on efficient recognition, including self-supervised learning with rotation prediction, BigBiGAN, and AMDIM. Rotation prediction achieves 57.5% Top-5 accuracy with 1% of ImageNet data, while BigBiGAN and AMDIM show stronger linear classification accuracy. Their performance on efficient classification is not reported. For efficient classification evaluation, BigBiGAN and AMDIM representations were tested with a ResNet classifier. Fine-tuned representations showed marginal gains over fixed ones. BigBiGAN achieved 55.2% Top-5 accuracy with 1% of ImageNet data, similar to rotation prediction. Contrastive prediction methods like AMDIM outperform other approaches in efficient classification experiments, achieving 67.4% accuracy. Linear classification performance does not always correlate with these results. Other semi-supervised techniques aim to propagate knowledge from labeled to unlabeled examples efficiently. Contrastive prediction methods like AMDIM outperform other approaches in efficient classification experiments, achieving 67.4% accuracy. These methods, such as Unsupervised Data Augmentation, Virtual Adversarial Training, entropy minimization, and pseudo-labeling, achieve high accuracy with limited labeled data. CPC representations alone can enable accuracy comparable to these methods, and combining them could be a promising area for future research. Transfer performance on object detection on the PASCAL-2007 dataset is also investigated. On the PASCAL-2007 dataset, a Faster-RCNN image detection architecture was used with a pre-trained feature extractor on ImageNet. Results show that leveraging larger unlabeled datasets can improve performance up to 67.8%. The proposed method achieves 72.7% accuracy using a ResNet-161 feature extractor, showing significant improvement in image recognition with small amounts of labeled data. The study demonstrates that CPC enhances results even with ImageNet-scale labels, indicating potential for improvement through simple modifications like augmentation, optimization, and network architecture. Evaluation of unsupervised representations through linear classification is only partially indicative of recognition performance, suggesting a need for a standalone benchmark. These findings pave the way for research in areas with limited data, such as medical imaging or robotics. Unsupervised representation learning methods pre-train on ImageNet or YFCC100M datasets. Results are reported in mean average precision (mAP). Various transfer methods from labeled and unlabeled data are compared, with Faster-RCNN trained on CPC v2 achieving the highest mAP of 72.7. Other methods include Exemplar, Motion Segmentation, Colorization, Relative Position, Instance Discrimination, Deep Cluster, Deeper Cluster, and Local Aggregation. Unsupervised representation learning is crucial in various domains beyond images, such as language, audio, video, and robotic manipulation. Self-supervised tasks tailored for specific domains may not easily transfer, but contrastive prediction methods offer a task-agnostic approach that can unify different modalities in real-world environments. Unsupervised representation learning is essential for various domains like language, audio, video, and robotics. Integrating different modalities and tasks can lead to unsupervised representations rivaling biological efficiency. Pseudo-code for InfoNCE objective calculations is provided, involving latent vectors and image tensor normalization. The model uses a tensor for the image, normalizes features with Batch-Normalization, and applies a 1x1 convolution for classification. Inception preprocessing is used for extracting crops, and optimization details include Adam Optimizer with a learning rate of 5e-4. Model architecture variations include ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152. The study explores different model architectures using the 'v2' variant, finding larger architectures perform better with less data. They utilize a DropOut layer, Inception pre-processing pipeline, and optimize with varying learning rates, weight decay, DropOut rates, and batch sizes. The best performing models are selected for each training subset and tested on the ImageNet validation set."
