    "content": "Mali is facing multiple crises, including a separatist rebellion by the MNLA and a coup in 2012 that led to the collapse of the military and state presence in the north. Islamist extremist groups took advantage of the chaos to expand their presence. The civilian-led interim government under President Dioncounda Traor\u00e9 has faced internal divisions and limited popular legitimacy. Mali's leaders are dealing with internal divisions, military interference, and limited popular legitimacy, along with years of corruption and mismanagement that have weakened state institutions. A national recession and revenue crisis, as well as a regional food security crisis worsened by population displacements, are causing suffering. Islamist extremist groups have taken control of northern Mali, running training camps, connecting with other extremists, and recruiting members. Islamist extremist groups in northern Mali run training camps, connect with other extremists, bolster arms stocks, recruit new fighters, and impose harsh behavioral codes on local residents. They carry out amputations, executions, and recruit child soldiers. France launched military operations in northern Mali in 2013 after Islamist fighters advanced towards the south and defeated Malian forces in Konna. France's intervention marked a significant shift in international response. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande justified the intervention in Mali based on the government's request for help to prevent the capital from falling into terrorist hands and protect French residents. French forces have reclaimed cities in the north with U.S. logistical support. French and Chadian troops have engaged in intense combat operations in AQIM strongholds in northern Mali, reportedly killing several hundred insurgents, including a senior AQIM regional commander. Despite these successes, recent insurgent attacks in Gao and Timbuktu indicate potential challenges in the region. The difficult terrain and social complexity of northern Mali pose particular difficulties for counterinsurgency operations. The Tuareg rebel conflict continues, hindering the extension of Malian state authority to areas cleared by French forces. The future role of French forces in Mali is uncertain as President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande plans to withdraw troops. African troops deployed under AFISMA may have limited capacity to counter insurgency or prevent terrorist attacks due to poor human rights records of some regional militaries. Tuareg communities are divided over religious ideology and separatism. The U.N. Security Council is considering transitioning AFISMA into a fully U.N.-conducted operation in Mali. U.S. policy attention to the Sahel region escalated in 2012 due to attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, and other incidents in North-West Africa. The U.S. has concerns about terrorism in North-West Africa, particularly with AQIM being viewed as the primary transnational terrorist threat. The In Amenas siege and links between AQIM and the Benghazi attackers have raised alarm. U.S. policy on Mali overlaps with global counterterrorism strategies and assessments of political stability in West Africa. President Obama's National Strategy for Counterterrorism emphasizes the need to counter AQIM closely integrated with broader U.S. efforts. The U.S. is focused on countering AQIM in North-West Africa, aligning with broader regional strategies. Divergent assessments of the terrorist threat in the Sahel region intersect with U.S. policy debates on approaching cross-border terrorist actors. Recent developments in Mali and North Africa have intensified these debates amid political instability and limited capacities of West African states. The United States is involved in countering multiple conflicts and struggles in Mali, supporting French and African military operations, enhancing surveillance capacities, and providing aid to neighboring states. There are considerations to add terrorist individuals in the region to a U.S. target list, signaling a potential shift in approach to AQIM. U.S. officials are urging Mali to organize a peace process and hold elections for a more legitimate national government. The U.S. is considering a more direct role in countering violent extremists in Mali and neighboring states, evaluating the threat posed by AQIM and associated groups. There are disagreements among Administration officials regarding legal authorities for U.S. kinetic strikes in the region and the potential unintended consequences of such actions. Congressional authorization is required for any significant U.S. intervention, which could lead to diplomatic friction with regional allies. Congress may assess previous U.S. security engagement in Mali and explore options for future aid and policy initiatives. The U.N. Security Council is discussing transitioning AFISMA into a fully U.N.-conducted operation, which has implications for U.S. policy and resource budgeting. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) estimates AFISMA mission cost at $950 million, with the United States being a leading donor of humanitarian aid to Mali and the Sahel region. Concerns over humanitarian access and terrorist diversion of aid could rise on the international policy agenda. Mali, a recipient of U.S. development aid, was seen as a democratic success before the coup, despite governance challenges and public resentment towards corruption. U.S. military training in Mali emphasized civilian control and respect. The U.S. military professionalization training in Mali emphasized civilian control and respect for human rights. Recent developments have raised concerns about the effectiveness of these programs and have jeopardized accomplishments in these areas. Mali's instability is attributed to internal and external factors such as poor governance, drug trafficking, military fragmentation, and regional arms flows from Libya. High-level corruption and public dissatisfaction with the government also played a role in the coup against President Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9. The military in Mali remains dysfunctional due to internal tensions, political uncertainty, and erosion of personnel levels and equipment stocks. Mismanagement, defections, desertions, and collapse of operational command have further weakened the military. Factionalization within the military and police has led to violent clashes and reports of abuses. Despite improvements in human rights due to the withdrawal of violent extremists from northern towns, challenges persist in the military's effectiveness. The withdrawal of violent extremists from northern towns in Mali has led to some human rights improvements. However, the path to reintegrating the north into the Malian state in a sustainable way remains unclear, with deepening ethnic tensions hindering national reconciliation. Tuareg grievances over cultural rights and political autonomy persist, but the community is internally divided over issues of political Islam and ethnic separatism. President Traor\u00e9 is willing to negotiate with the MNLA despite opposition from many Malians. Efforts by Burkina Faso and Algeria to facilitate talks with the MNLA and Islamist armed groups have stalled due to limited Malian government commitment. ECOWAS and AU's response to Mali's crisis is hindered by regional divisions and a lack of military capacity. The MNLA has reasserted its authority in the Kidal region. The Kidal region, under MNLA authority after French operations against extremists, poses challenges for national reconciliation. Malian military hasn't deployed due to MNLA objections, with France and Chadian troops conducting counterterrorism operations. Future tensions may arise from clashes with Arab militias. MNLA leaders aim to be Western counterterrorism partners, but opportunism seems to drive their actions. AQIM, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, has taken advantage of instability in North Africa and Mali to increase its regional influence. The group, primarily Algerian-led, has been present in northern Mali for over a decade. Leader Abdelmalek Droukdel is based in northeastern Algeria. AQIM, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, has expanded its influence in North Africa and Mali. The group has been involved in kidnappings for ransom and attacks on military and government targets in the Sahel region. They have ties to Boko Haram and other extremist groups in the region. In December 2012, the United States designated MUJWA and its leaders as \"Specially Designated Global Terrorists\" (SDGT). Ansar al Deen, linked to AQIM, was also designated as an FTO and SDGT. Analysts note divisions within AQIM over leadership, goals, and tactics. AQIM, a loose affiliation of actors with unclear connections to Al Qaeda, has debated capacity and intentions. While threatening attacks against Western powers, particularly France, they have yet to carry out attacks outside North-West Africa. Analysts and policymakers debate AQIM's threat level to U.S. and Western interests, with conflicting assessments on their capabilities and intentions. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper testified that AQIM's focus remains on local, US, and Western interests in North and West Africa. U.S. officials are concerned about AQIM sharing funds with other extremist groups due to reported contacts. AQIM has amassed tens of millions of dollars through ransom and smuggling, leading some to call it \"Al Qaeda's best-funded affiliated organization.\" The group's resources vary, and its spending rate is unclear. Violent extremist groups in North-West Africa are on the rise, contrasting with the weakened \"core\" Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda in Africa is leveraging regional political and security instability, with uncertain links between groups. AQIM in Mali has cultivated ties with local populations, while conservative Islamic movements are gaining momentum in the region. Conservative Islamic movements like Ansar al Deen and MUJWA have gained momentum in Mali, particularly in the Tuareg-dominated Kidal region and Gao. Many Malians oppose extremists' ideology and their ties to drug traffickers. AQIM in Mali has been advised to build bridges with all ethnic communities and not rush to impose sharia, but some local commanders have ignored this. Mali is seen as the least willing or capable of countering AQIM compared to Niger and Mauritania. In the aftermath of the March 2012 military coup in Mali, ECOWAS brokered an agreement for political transition, with elections planned for July 2013. However, key issues like the voter registry remain unresolved. The upcoming elections in Mali present a policy dilemma due to unresolved issues like the voter registry and voting procedures for displaced Malians. While elections are necessary for forming a legitimate government and security sector reform, there are concerns about ethno-regional divisions and lack of credibility. Captain Sanogo, a former U.S.-trained officer, holds no formal position but continues to play a role in the political landscape. Captain Sanogo, a former U.S.-trained officer, holds significant influence in Mali despite not holding a formal government position. He ordered the resignation of interim Prime Minister Diarra and has been accused of serious abuses. Sanogo's allies hold key cabinet positions, and he leads a commission on security sector reform, potentially influencing international military aid. The African-led International Support Mission to Mali (AFISMA) was established in 2012. The AFISMA mission in Mali, authorized by U.N. Security Council Resolution 2085, aims to support Malian defense forces, recover territory from terrorists, and protect civilians. Originally planned for 3,300 regional troops, it now requires over 9,000 due to terrain challenges and the limitations of Malian forces. Deployments have been accelerated following French intervention. About 6,000 African troops, including over 2,000 Chadians, have arrived in Mali to support French forces in combat operations. Concerns remain about regional troops' ability to work together, uphold human rights, and defend against insurgents. The EU is training and restructuring Malian security forces, but this process may take years. The future role of French forces in Mali is unclear, with focus on AFISMA's potential exit strategy and long-term unity efforts. The U.N. Security Council is considering transitioning AFISMA into a U.N.-conducted peacekeeping operation in Mali, with estimated costs of $950 million. The United States may be obligated to pay roughly 27% of the expenses if authorized, compared to current voluntary contributions. The AU has requested the Security Council authorize a U.N. \"peace enforcement\" operation in Mali, but the U.N. Secretary-General opposes tasking any U.N. operation with combat operations against terrorist groups. It is uncertain if AFISMA will transition into a U.N.-conducted operation or if a separate counterterrorism force will remain active. Questions remain about the effectiveness of deploying a U.N. stabilization operation in Mali amidst ongoing counterterrorism operations and a volatile security environment. International troops may face asymmetric attacks, and terrorist groups have threatened to target troop-contributing countries. Insecurity in Mali has worsened a regional food security crisis, with thousands of Malians displaced internally and as refugees. Despite some good harvests, over 4 million Malians require humanitarian assistance, including 500,000 in the north. Security threats have hindered aid efforts in the region. The United States is a major humanitarian donor to the Sahel region, providing over $519 million in aid to drought-affected countries like Mali. However, overall donor pledges have fallen short of U.N. funding appeals. Security threats in Mali have disrupted aid delivery and regional commerce, with concerns that local violence may escalate when displaced Malians return home. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) received 70% of its 2012 CAP for the Sahel region. The 2013 U.N. CAP of $1.5 billion for the drought-affected Sahel represents a decrease from the previous year. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson highlighted the crisis in Mali as one of the most challenging in West Africa in the past two decades, emphasizing the need to address violent extremists, political transition, reconciliation, and the humanitarian crisis comprehensively. The United States has supported French and African military operations in Mali to combat AQIM and other extremists. There have been discussions about potential direct U.S. targeted strikes on terrorist targets. Vice President Joseph Biden expressed U.S. support for France's intervention, stating that fighting AQIM is in America's interest. The U.S. has urged Mali to hold peace talks, elections, and provide humanitarian aid. A travel ban has been imposed on individuals involved in the 2012 coup. The Administration supported an African-led approach to Mali before France's intervention and pledged $96 million to support AFISMA, with $86 million from the State Department's Peacekeeping Operations funds. The U.S. has provided funds for airlift, training, and supplies for AFISMA personnel in Mali. Additional funding has been allocated for training Formed Police Units. The Defense Department has also airlifted Chadian troops to support French operations. Administration officials have expressed varying assessments of the threat from northern Mali. Prior to the coup, the United States was a major donor to Mali, focusing on various aid programs including food security, health, education, governance, counterterrorism, and military professionalization. Bilateral foreign aid appropriations totaled around $100 million-$140 million annually in recent years. The United States provided significant bilateral foreign aid to Mali, totaling $100 million-$140 million annually. However, aid programs were restricted following a military coup, leading to the termination of the Millennium Challenge Corporation compact and limitations on State Department-administered assistance to the Malian security forces. Defense Department spending on training and equipping the Malian military was approximately $41 million between FY2009 and FY2012. The coup-related restrictions in Mali do not apply to elections-related or humanitarian aid, indirect assistance, or funding from U.S. agencies other than the State Department and USAID. Some U.S. foreign assistance and humanitarian aid have continued or been approved to resume, totaling $70.4 million and $148 million respectively. The U.S. approach to terrorism threats in the Sahel has focused on training and equipping security forces in the region. The State Department-led Trans Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP) aims to enhance security cooperation in the region, combat religious radicalization, and improve intelligence sharing and border control through Operation Enduring Freedom-Trans Sahara (OEF-TS). U.S. funding for TSCTP activities totals around $120 million-$150 million annually, with claims of improved regional security cooperation as a result. The Trans Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP) aims to enhance regional security cooperation and combat religious radicalization. However, the program lacks a comprehensive strategic design, struggles with interagency coordination, and faces challenges in measuring outcomes. Disruptions in funding due to political or human rights concerns in partner countries, like Mali, have hindered program continuity and capacity building efforts. Critics question TSCTP's effectiveness in promoting stability and civilian control of armed forces, with some accusing the program of focusing too much on military assistance at the expense of other types of U.S. engagement. Critics argue that the focus on military assistance in the Sahel region has led to a \"militarization of U.S. policy\" and a misallocation of resources that could potentially fuel extremism. Issues with U.S. security assistance in Mali have sparked debates on the effectiveness of counterterrorism efforts in the region. Despite Mali being a target for TSCTP activities due to its democratic reputation, its limited capacity to counter AQIM has raised doubts about the program's value. International policymakers are facing complex challenges in addressing the deteriorating situation in Mali. International policymakers are grappling with the intertwined political and security crises in Mali, unsure if Malian forces and regional troop contributors can effectively secure liberated territory. Concerns also exist about potential backlash from northern communities, terrorist attacks, and internal military frictions. The path to territorial reunification is uncertain, with debates ongoing about the effectiveness of counterterrorism efforts in the region. The effectiveness of TSCTP in Mali is uncertain, with debates continuing on how to respond to security threats. Congress is examining the legal and policy environment for U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the Sahel region. Key policy questions include the importance of Mali compared to other U.S. priorities, the scope of French operations in Mali, and the role of the United States in these operations. Security gains, the impact of Western military intervention on local extremism, and benchmarks for progress are also being considered. The impact of international military operations in Mali on local extremism and the role of U.N.-conducted stabilization or peacekeeping operations are being debated. Key questions include the capabilities of regional troop contributors, funding lessons from African-led military operations, and the threat posed by AQIM to regional security and the United States. Additionally, the reactions of AQIM to international military strikes and their capabilities are being assessed.
