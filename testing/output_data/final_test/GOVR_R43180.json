    "content": "In 2008 and 2012, TransCanada applied for a Presidential Permit to build the Keystone XL Pipeline, transporting Canadian oil sands and Bakken region crude oil to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. The U.S. Department of State evaluates the project's national interest based on factors like energy security, foreign policy, and environmental impacts. President Obama introduced a \"Climate Action Plan\" on June 25, 2013. President Obama announced a national \"Climate Action Plan\" in 2013 to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. He mentioned that the evaluation of the Keystone XL Pipeline's impact on climate change would influence the State Department's decision on whether to allow its construction. Both supporters and opponents of the pipeline reacted positively to the President's comments. The Keystone XL Pipeline's impact on climate change is still under intense debate, with a focus on assessing GHG emissions from construction, operation, and oil transportation. Factors like data availability, industry scope, and modeling assumptions play a crucial role in this assessment. Assumptions about modeling activities impact assessments of GHG emissions from the construction and operation of the proposed pipeline and the crude oils transported through it. Various factors such as global crude oil markets, refinery inputs, transport options, economics, policy considerations, and end-use consumption of petroleum products influence these estimates. Publicly available studies have assessed GHG emissions from Canadian oil sands deposits and the crude oils transported through the pipeline, with the State Department producing one assessment in its March 2013 Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Keystone XL Pipeline. The State Department's Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Keystone XL Pipeline analyzes GHG emissions from oil sands crudes and the proposed pipeline. It supplements its analysis with additional information and comments on methodologies and conclusions from published studies. The DEIS includes an assessment of the GHG emissions attributable to the pipeline. The State Department's Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Keystone XL Pipeline analyzes both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. Indirect emissions are defined as incremental emissions from the production and use of oil sands crudes transported through the pipeline. The analysis compares the full GHG emissions profile of oil sands crudes to other reference crudes, estimating the difference with and without the pipeline. The State Department's analysis of the Keystone XL Pipeline includes direct emissions from its operation and their impact on indirect emissions. Approval or denial of the project is unlikely to significantly affect oil sands development or heavy crude oil refining in the Gulf Coast. If the pipeline is not built but other proposed pipelines are, there could be a slight reduction in Canadian oil sands production and a decrease in indirect GHG emissions by 2030. The DEIS reports that the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline would result in incremental GHG emissions ranging from 0.07 to 5.30 MMTCO2e annually. This would represent a small increase over the total domestic GHG inventory for the United States in 2010. The proposed Keystone XL Pipeline would result in incremental GHG emissions ranging from 0.07 to 5.30 MMTCO2e annually, equivalent to emissions from over 1 million passenger vehicles or a quarter million homes in the US. The State Department calculates this estimate through a life-cycle assessment of the Canadian oil sands resource. Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) are used to evaluate the environmental impacts of products, such as the climate change implications of petroleum resources. LCAs quantify and track carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, expressing them as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per unit of fuel. This \"emissions intensity\" can be used to compare different fuels or production methods. LCAs have boundaries known as \"cradle-to-grave\" and can assess emissions intensity at various stages of a fuel's life cycle. The State Department has chosen a Well-to-Wheels (WTW) assessment for the DEIS to evaluate the emissions associated with the entire life-cycle of transportation fuels like petroleum. Different boundaries such as Well-to-Tank (WTT) or Well-to-Refinery Gate (WTR) can be used to compare the impact of oil sands crudes against reference crudes, with the combustion phase contributing up to 70%-80% of emissions. A number of publicly available studies have assessed the life-cycle GHG emissions intensity of oil sands crudes, with the State Department using four LCAs in its analysis. These studies employ different parameters and data, resulting in slightly different findings. The GHG emissions intensities of oil sands crudes vary among different studies. The U.S. Department of Energy's assessment looks at mining and in situ production techniques, reporting an average emissions intensity of 106.3 gCO2e/MJ LHV gasoline. This is compared to a baseline value of 91 gCO2e/MJ LHV gasoline. Overall, LCAs estimate emissions for oil sands production techniques in the range of 101-120 gCO2e/MJ LHV gasoline. The State Department's DEIS reports that fossil fuels, including oil sands crudes, are a significant source of global GHG emissions contributing to climate change. Oil sands crudes emit 17% more GHGs than the average US refined crude in 2005. The DEIS relies on third-party sources for data, presenting variations in findings and assumptions. Life-cycle assessment is influential in comparing GHG emissions intensities. Life-cycle assessment is a methodology used to analyze GHG emissions of hydrocarbon resources, but it has uncertainties due to complex fuel life-cycles and analytical design features. The NETL 2009 LCA, used for estimates on oil sands crudes, has outdated data and exclusions criticized by opponents of the Keystone XL Pipeline. The DEIS mentions the potential increase in emissions from WCSB oil sands compared to US crude oils. Proponents of the Keystone XL Pipeline highlight advancements in energy efficiency and GHG mitigation by Canadian oil sands producers, including the formation of COSIA and Alberta's policies to reduce GHG emissions. The State Department's analysis includes a GHG intensity reduction program for industrial emitters, a fund for clean energy investment, and funding for carbon capture facilities. These advancements aim to align GHG emissions from oil sands with other crudes. The analysis also calculates total GHG emissions attributable to crude oils transported through the pipeline based on barrels per day throughput. The State Department's analysis does not report the total annual GHG emissions from crude oil transported through the proposed pipeline. Third-party estimates could be used to determine these emissions. For example, IHS CERA's 2012 study provides insights on GHG emissions related to oil sands and U.S. oil supply. The study \"Oil Sands, Greenhouse Gases, and U.S. Oil Supply: Getting the Numbers Right-2012 Update\" compares data from various LCAs to determine WTW GHG emissions for oil sands and other reference crudes on a per barrel basis. IHS CERA estimates emissions for oil sands crudes refined in the U.S. in 2011 to be 517-547 kg CO2e/barrel, 9%-12% higher than the average. If the full 830,000 bpd pipeline capacity is used to transport only oil sands crudes to Gulf Coast refineries, total life-cycle GHG emissions would range from 157 to 166 MMTCO2e/year, representing a 2.3%-2.4% increase over the total domestic GHG inventory for the U.S. in 2010. The State Department considers the incremental life-cycle GHG emissions of the proposed pipeline, comparing oil sands crudes to other crude oils processed at Gulf Coast refineries. If oil sands crudes are more emissions-intensive, they would be responsible for additional GHG emissions equivalent to the annual emissions from millions of vehicles and homes in the United States. The DEIS compares GHG emissions profiles of Canadian oil sands crudes to reference crudes like Venezuelan Bachaquero, Mexican Maya, and Middle Eastern Sour. Oil sands crudes have higher GHG emissions than the reference crudes, indicating potential displacement of current heavy crudes in U.S. refineries. If Gulf Coast refinery capacity remains constant, the increased use of oil sands crudes would lead to additional GHG emissions. The DEIS calculates the difference in GHG emissions from oil sands crudes if the proposed pipeline displaces reference crudes in Gulf Coast refineries. Uncertainty remains on which reference crudes would be displaced, resulting in a range of 3.3 to 20.8 MMTCO2e of additional GHG emissions per year. The DEIS calculates that oil sands crude could result in 3.3 to 20.8 MMTCO2e of additional GHG emissions per year, equivalent to emissions from 770,800 to 4,312,500 passenger vehicles or energy for 190,400 to 1,065,400 homes. Adjustments based on refinery capacity and input mix are needed to assess the pipeline's climate impact accurately. The assumption that refinery capacity and crude oil inputs are constant is supported by the State Department's market analysis, indicating minimal impact on heavy crude oil refining in the Gulf Coast area. Refinery throughput has remained steady, with investments geared towards processing heavy crudes. Refiners have economic incentives to obtain such crudes, leading to no new significant changes in refinery operations. The DEIS determines that no new capacity would be added on the Gulf Coast to refine additional crude oils from the proposed pipeline. Refineries optimized for heavy crudes would only process heavy crudes, and oil sands imports would displace other heavy imports. Critics argue that increased transport of oil sands crudes could optimize operating capacity at Gulf Coast refineries or encourage investment expansion. Critics argue that increased transport of oil sands crudes could optimize operating capacity at Gulf Coast refineries or encourage investment expansion, leading to higher GHG emissions. The State Department's analysis leaves open the determination of which reference crudes would be displaced at Gulf Coast refineries, impacting the use of oil sands crudes and GHG emissions in the sector. The emissions intensities of reference crudes, like Bakken tight oil, are uncertain due to data quality and transparency issues. Comparisons with Canadian oil sands crudes are complicated by changing emissions factors and recovery techniques. The State Department calculates GHG emissions of oil sands and considers market factors' impact on production. They aim to compare emissions with and without the Keystone XL Pipeline to determine the incremental GHG difference. The State Department calculates incremental GHG emissions for the proposed Project based on market projections and modeling assumptions from various sources like the U.S. Department of Energy and Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. The business-as-usual scenario assumes industry and market reactions based on normal commercial incentives. The State Department assumes projects will proceed as planned with adequate takeaway capacity for Canadian oil sands producers. The DEIS must calculate the effects of not constructing enough capacity, considering the lack of new pipeline additions since 2011 and potential delays in other proposed projects. The State Department assesses a \"no expansion\" scenario for pipeline capacity and considers the need for rail expansion to accommodate Canadian oil production growth. The State Department reviews the recent examples of rail takeaway for crude oil and coal, concluding that the rail logistics system can continue to scale up over many years. The DEIS estimates the cost for rail transport to the Gulf Coast at $15.50 per barrel, compared to $8-$9.50 per barrel for pipeline transport. Future cost savings are projected for rail transport. The DEIS concludes that the incremental increase in cost of rail compared to pipeline transport is $5 per barrel. Assessing the impact of this cost on oil sands production, the State Department uses market projections to calculate changes in production volume for every $5 increment in price. The DEIS determines that a $5 cost increase would lead to a 2%-4% reduction in Canadian oil sands production by 2030. Specifically, if the Keystone XL Pipeline is not built, there would be a 0.4% - 0.6% reduction in production volume. The DEIS calculates that if the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline project is not built, there could be a 0.4 to 0.6 percent reduction in WCSB production by 2030. This would result in incremental GHG emissions of 0.07 to 0.83 MMTCO2e annually for the proposed project. If all pipelines were not constructed, annual incremental GHG emissions would range from 0.35 to 5.3 MMTCO2e, representing a 0.001%-0.078% increase over the total domestic GHG inventory in the United States in 2010. This is equivalent to the annual GHG emissions from the energy used in 14,500 to 1,104,100 passenger vehicles or the annual CO2 emissions from the energy used in 3,600 to 272,700 homes in the United States. The State Department's market analysis is based on 2011 projections for the 2030 production profile of oil sands and other benchmark crudes under the \"reference case\" scenario. The State Department's market analysis focuses on how industry and market forces may react to the denial of a proposed pipeline in the medium to long term. It concludes that if the pipeline is denied, the rate of development in the oil sands and heavy crude oil refined in the Gulf Coast area is unlikely to be substantially impacted as the market would likely add comparable transport capacity over time. This is supported by the assumption that rail and other non-pipeline transport options can accommodate future growth of the oil sands. The State Department's market analysis focuses on the capacity argument for future oil sands growth, noting proposed pipeline projects and potential delays. The analysis assumes that non-pipeline transport options can accommodate future growth if the proposed pipeline is denied. The State Department's market analysis examines the potential for future oil sands growth, considering proposed pipeline projects and non-pipeline transport options. Critics argue that expanding transport capacity would require significant infrastructure development. The State Department warns of possible short-term shut-ins of WCSB heavy crude due to delays in rail car deliveries and terminals. Market analyses suggest that without needed pipelines like Keystone XL, there could be persistent price discounts and slow sector expansion. Goldman Sachs estimates rail capacity peaking at 500,000 bpd in the next few years, with most shipments being light crude, not oil sands. The State Department reviews breakeven costs for oil sands projects, considering potential impacts on production costs. A long-term increase in costs could raise breakeven costs for producers, affecting new projects. The State Department reviews breakeven costs for new oil sands projects, referencing the Canadian NEB's cost estimates. NEB reports breakeven costs ranging from $51-$96 per barrel for different project types. The State Department compares these costs to price projections for benchmark crudes, concluding that prices are projected to remain above breakeven costs through 2035. The DEIS concludes that most oil sands projects have low breakeven costs, indicating that incremental increases in production costs would not hinder future development. Critics argue that the analysis fails to consider a full range of potential market scenarios, pointing out the growing discounts for the heavy grade WCS compared to Brent. The WCS discounts have deepened over the years, reaching $50-$60 per barrel recently. The severe pricing discounts for heavy grade WCS compared to Brent have widened to $50-$60 per barrel recently, hindering access to coastal markets like the Gulf Coast. Critics argue that the State Department's market analysis fails to consider the short- to medium-term effects of these discounts on future production estimates, as well as increased oil sands production costs and lower benchmark crude oil price projections. The State Department's market analysis focuses on the year 2030, where market forces may resolve short-term obstacles to oil sands development. Critics emphasize shorter-term analyses showing higher costs and lower prices, suggesting ongoing challenges for investment in the sector. The outcome depends on various projections and variables. President Obama's evaluation of the Keystone XL Pipeline's impact on climate will influence the State Department's decision. Proponents argue that the pipeline's approval or denial won't significantly affect oil sands development or crude oil refining in the Gulf Coast due to strong global demand. Proponents believe that strong global demand for petroleum products will ensure Canadian oil sands production continues, regardless of the route for shipment. They argue that future investment and current production will only be affected if the global oil price drops below production costs for an extended period. Additionally, there are 5.4 million bpd of oil sands projects under construction or review, indicating ongoing development under current conditions. Oil sands producers and governments believe leaving oil in the ground is unnecessary, as market forces will provide transport capacity. They argue a single pipeline won't impact long-term oil sands development or GHG emissions. Emissions intensities are comparable to other heavy crude oils, and efficiency improvements will decrease emissions over time. Critics argue Canadian oil sands are the most GHG intensive due to extraction energy intensity. Critics argue that future oil sands deposits will be more difficult and costly to access, leading to challenges in the financial environment for current projects. They highlight uncertainties in oil market projections and transportation options, emphasizing the potential impact of the Keystone XL Pipeline on expansion. Critics argue that key variables differ from the State Department's assumptions, including lower global oil prices, higher rail and project costs, and increased competition from shale oil. They claim these factors could impact breakeven costs, investment in the industry, and the timing of new oil sands projects. Any decrease in production could affect global GHG emissions and the transition to renewable technologies. The proposed Keystone XL Pipeline is seen as a crucial decision for U.S. energy policy by some stakeholders, who advocate for a shift away from fossil fuels. They view the pipeline as a long-term commitment to a carbon-based economy and increased greenhouse gas emissions. EPA warns that the pipeline could result in up to 935 additional CO2 emissions over its 50-year lifespan. Opponents of the Keystone XL Pipeline argue that meaningful climate policy action is hindered, making single action initiatives like infrastructure permits crucial. They fear that allowing the pipeline to proceed without being held accountable for its indirect greenhouse gas emissions could set a dangerous precedent. The State Department's Final Environmental Impact Statement in 2014 included revised estimates, indicating that the pipeline could contribute up to 935 million metric tons of additional CO2 emissions. The Final Environmental Impact Statement for the XL Pipeline contained revised analysis and estimates, including potential greenhouse gas emissions. See CRS Report R43415 for more details."
