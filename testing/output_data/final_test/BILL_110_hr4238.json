    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bottle Recycling Climate Protection Act of 2007\". The Congress finds that recycling beverage containers can reduce energy consumption, municipal solid waste, and emissions. Millions of beverage bottles and cans are wasted daily, with a significant amount ending up in landfills or as litter. In 2006, a large portion of aluminum beverage cans and plastic water bottles were not recycled, leading to the wastage of tons of materials that take centuries to biodegrade. A national system for requiring a refund value on beverage containers would incentivize individuals to clean up the environment, increase reuse and recycling rates, and reduce costs and environmental dangers associated with waste management. States with bottle bills have high container recycling rates, ranging from 60% to over 90%, compared to the national average of 34%. This system aligns with the intent of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Subtitle K--Beverage Container Recycling is added to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, introducing definitions related to beverage container recycling. Subtitle K--Beverage Container Recycling is added to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, introducing definitions related to beverage container recycling. The term 'beverage' includes various drinks for human consumption, excluding dairy products. A 'beverage container' is a sealed container made of metal, glass, or plastic up to one gallon in capacity. A 'beverage distributor' sells beverages in containers for resale in interstate commerce. The curr_chunk defines terms related to beverage container recycling, including 'beverage retailer,' 'consumer,' 'refund value,' and 'wine cooler.' These definitions are important for understanding the regulations outlined in Subtitle K of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. A beverage can be plain, sparkling, or carbonated water with nonalcoholic beverage, flavoring, coloring materials, fruit juices, fruit adjuncts, sugar, carbon dioxide, and preservatives. Required beverage container labeling mandates that no beverage distributor or retailer can sell a beverage in interstate commerce without a clear 5 cent refund value statement on the container. The Administrator will set standards for the statement's size and location, with the 5 cent amount subject to adjustment. The origination of the refund value is outlined in the following section. ``SEC. 12003. ORIGINATION OF REFUND VALUE.\n\nFor each beverage in a container sold in interstate commerce, the distributor collects the refund value from the retailer. The retailer then collects the refund value from the consumer. Only specified persons can collect a deposit on a beverage container.\n\n``SEC. 12004. RETURN OF REFUND VALUE. Retailers must promptly pay the refund value stated on an empty and unbroken beverage container, unless it contains hazardous waste, exceeds 600 containers per day for small retailers, or is contaminated. If a retailer occupies a space greater than 5,000 square feet, they can refund up to 1,800 individual beverage containers per day. Beverage distributors must pay the refund value on returned containers plus at least 3 cents per container for handling costs. This does not prevent individuals from returning containers to other parties. No agreements in this subtitle can prevent these refund processes. Agreements can be made between distributors, retailers, or other parties to establish centralized beverage collection centers. Retailers can refund up to 1,800 beverage containers per day if their space is over 5,000 square feet. Beverage containers can be crushed or bundled, and opening a container as designed does not constitute breaking it if the refund value statement is still readable. SEC. 12005. ACCOUNTING FOR UNCLAIMED REFUNDS AND PROVISIONS FOR STATE RECYCLING FUNDS. At the end of each calendar year, beverage distributors must pay each State the total refund value of all containers sold for resale that exceeds the amount paid to individuals in that State. Unclaimed refunds received by the State can be used for programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If payments made by a distributor exceed the total refund value, the excess amount will be credited for future payments to the State. The beverage distributor must pay the State the total refund value of all containers sold for resale at the end of each calendar year. Unclaimed refunds can be used for greenhouse gas emission reduction programs. Any excess payments made by the distributor will be credited for future payments to the State. Additionally, the distributor can designate a subsequent calendar year for distribution to the State. SEC. 12006 prohibits retailers, distributors, or their agents from disposing of labeled beverage containers or related materials in landfills. SEC. 12007 provides exemptions for certain states. The provisions of sections 12002 through 12005 and sections 12008 and 12009 do not apply to states that have implemented beverage container deposit laws before the enactment of this subtitle or have achieved specific recycling rates for beverage containers. The Administrator may notify a State if it fails to maintain the required recycling rate for beverage containers, leading to the application of specific provisions until a new determination is made. States cannot impose a tax on the refund value of beverage containers if they already tax the sale of such containers. The subtitle does not affect state laws on refund values for containers other than beverage containers or on redemption centers. The Administrator must create regulations within 12 months of this subtitle's enactment, defining 'beverage retailer' and adjusting the specified amounts for inflation every 10 years. Penalties can be increased after 5 years. The penalties for violating specific sections range from $1,000 to $10,000 per violation. The effective date for this subtitle is 2 years after enactment. Subtitle K--Beverage Container Recycling includes definitions, required labeling, refund value origination and return, accounting for unclaimed refunds, prohibitions on disposal, exempted States, regulations, and penalties. Effective date is 2 years after enactment."
