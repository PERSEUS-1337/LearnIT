    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Backcountry Landing Strip Access Act\". The Congress finds that aircraft landing strips play a crucial role in emergency safety, providing access to remote areas, aiding in search and rescue missions, firefighting, and disaster relief. They recommend a nationwide policy for managing backcountry aviation issues on Federal lands. SEC. 3. PROCEDURE FOR CONSIDERATION OF ACTIONS AFFECTING AIRCRAFT LANDING STRIPS. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture cannot permanently close or render any aircraft landing strip on Federal land without approval from the State's aviation department, publication in the Federal Register, a 90-day public comment period, and consideration of received comments. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture must consider input from the State's aviation department and adopt a nationwide policy for managing backcountry aviation issues on Federal land within two years of this Act's enactment. The policy required by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture must state that the Federal Aviation Administration has sole authority over aviation and airspace in the United States. It should also seek and consider comments from State governments and the public. Additionally, the Secretaries must consult with State aviation departments and interested parties to ensure that aircraft landing strips on Federal land are maintained in a manner consistent with resource values. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture may enter cooperative agreements for aircraft landing strip maintenance on Federal land. Closure or neglect of landing strips cannot be a condition for Federal property acquisition. The Act does not authorize new landing strips and defines \"permanently close\" as a long-term closure. The Act applies to established aircraft landing strips on Federal lands and certain actions, policies, exchanges, and acquisitions. It does not affect the FAA's authority over aviation or airspace."
