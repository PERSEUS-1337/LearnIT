    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Institute on Minority Health Act\" and includes findings related to minority health. The Congress finds disparities in health outcomes among minority populations, including higher rates of heart disease, strokes, diabetes, AIDS, infant mortality, and low birthweight babies compared to White Americans. In 1988, death rates from homicides were significantly higher among young Black males compared to young White males. Biomedical research often excludes minorities, and the representation of minorities in medical professions is lower than in the general population. The ratio of physicians to inhabitants in minority or low-income neighborhoods is much lower than in predominantly White neighborhoods. The establishment of the National Institute on Minority Health is outlined in Part C of the Public Health Service Act, with the purpose of addressing healthcare disparities in minority and low-income communities. The National Institute on Minority Health conducts research, training, and health information dissemination for minority health conditions, focusing on opportunities for minority health professionals. The term 'minorities' refers to minority groups, and 'minority health conditions' include diseases more prevalent in minorities. Research on minority health focuses on health conditions prevalent in minorities, with factors and interventions that may differ or are unknown for minorities. The National Institute on Minority Health conducts research on minority health conditions. The curr_chunk mentions \"certain authorities.\" The Director of the Institute is responsible for recommending research agendas, identifying projects, promoting collaboration, and ensuring minority representation in clinical research. The Director of the Institute is responsible for monitoring the health care system's effects on minorities and promoting sufficient allocation of resources for research. They also ensure minority representation in clinical research and assess the impact of health benefit plan policies on minority health. The Director of the Institute advocates for the health of minorities by monitoring proposals, determining health benefits, promoting training opportunities for minority health professionals, and facilitating their placement. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include the National Institute on Minority Health."
