Congress finds that sequestration is severely impacting the Nation's air traffic control system, with a $637 million funding reduction for the FAA. The FAA plans to furlough the majority of its employees, including 15,000 air traffic controllers, for one day every two weeks until September 30, 2013. This has led to hundreds of flight disruptions. The FAA's furloughs are causing significant flight delays nationwide, with over 1,200 flights delayed on April 22, 2013. More delays are expected during the peak summer travel season, impacting airlines and passengers. The effects of these delays can be compounded as planes arrive late at other airports, affecting over 700 million passengers annually. The commercial air transportation system in the United States is crucial for businesses of all sizes, with civil aviation accounting for 10 million jobs and contributing $1.3 trillion to the economy annually. Flight delays for business travelers and air cargo transportation can disrupt business operations and impact the economy. The FAA's plans to close 149 air traffic control facilities could further exacerbate these issues. The FAA plans to close 149 air traffic control towers at small airports on June 15, 2013, due to sequestration. This poses a serious threat to public safety as experienced controllers are necessary to prevent accidents during air travel. The FAA's closure of 149 air traffic control towers due to sequestration threatens public safety. Sequestration of funds for air traffic control interferes with the efficiency of the nation's air transportation system. It is recommended that the operation of air traffic control towers by the FAA be exempted from sequestration. Exemption from sequestration for operation of air traffic control towers. Exemption from sequestration for operation of air traffic control towers. Section 255 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to exempt funds for air traffic control tower operations from reduction.

The amendment applies to the Presidential sequestration order for fiscal year 2013. Section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows for sequestration orders to be issued."
