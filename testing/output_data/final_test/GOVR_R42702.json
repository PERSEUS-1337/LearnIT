    "content": "When a state faces a major disaster, the governor can request federal assistance. FEMA assesses the damage and recommends to the President whether to issue a declaration. The number of disaster declarations has increased over the years, with 97 declarations in 2011 being the highest on record. Congressional concern has been raised over this trend. The rising number of major disaster declarations, with 97 in 2011 being the highest on record, has raised congressional concerns over associated costs and the need for new budgetary mechanisms to offset disaster assistance spending. Critics argue that thresholds for declarations may be set too low, leading to an increase in \"marginal incidents\" receiving declarations. Questions have also been raised about whether incidents are increasing or if the federal government is being more generous in its interpretation of disaster criteria. The report provides a historical overview of disaster declarations, discussing factors contributing to the increase in declarations and policy options to reduce them. Prior to 1950, state and local governments had to wait for Congress to act on their requests for federal assistance after disasters. The Disaster Relief Act of 1950 transferred the authority to provide federal disaster assistance from Congress to the President, allowing the President to issue declarations for federal aid in incidents. The first disaster declaration was made by President Eisenhower in 1953 for damages caused by a tornado in Georgia. The Act has undergone reforms and amendments, but the President's authority to issue declarations has been retained. Today, the President's declaration remains the principal authority governing federal assistance for emergencies and major disasters in the United States. The Robert T. Stafford Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) is the primary authority for federal assistance in emergencies and disasters in the United States. FEMA, under the Department of Homeland Security, coordinates the federal response. The Act authorizes Fire Management Assistance Grant Program (FMAG) declarations, emergency declarations, and major disaster declarations. The President issues emergency and major disaster declarations, while the FEMA Regional Director can issue FMAG declarations. Governors must follow specific procedures before requesting federal disaster assistance. Prior to requesting federal disaster assistance, a governor must determine if state resources are overwhelmed and federal resources are needed. The gubernatorial request is essential for the President to issue emergency or major disaster declarations. A \"turndown\" refers to the denial of a gubernatorial request for federal assistance. The report analyzes federal assistance requests by governors, known as \"turndowns,\" since 1953. It includes data on approved and denied FMAG, emergency, and major disaster declarations by the President. The analysis breaks down declarations by incident and state, based on levels of assistance. FMAG declarations can be issued by the President or FEMA Regional Director, authorizing federal aid like equipment and grants for state or local governments. FMAG declarations provide equipment, personnel, and grants to state or local governments for fire control on forest or grassland. They aim to prevent fires from becoming major disasters and involve a \"Principal Advisor\" for technical assessment. FEMA assesses the situation before granting assistance. The state must meet cost thresholds for individual fires or cumulative state-wide fires to be eligible for Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAG). Criteria for evaluating wildfires include threat to lives and property, availability of resources, fire danger conditions, and economic impacts. FEMA uses individual and cumulative fire cost thresholds to determine eligibility for assistance. The Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAG) eligibility criteria include cost thresholds for individual fires and cumulative state-wide fires. Threshold amounts vary by state and are based on population. For example, Pennsylvania's individual fire threshold is $908,220, calculated based on the state's population. If a wildfire in Pennsylvania costs $908,220 or more in damages, the state would meet or exceed the individual fire threshold. The cumulative fire threshold for states varies based on population, with the formula being $500,000 or three times the individual fire threshold, whichever is greater. In Pennsylvania, the cumulative threshold is $2,724,660, while in Alaska it is $500,000. FMAG declarations have increased since the late 1990s. FMAG declarations have been increasing since the late 1990s, with a peak of 114 in 2011, surpassing the previous high of 86 in 2006. These declarations aim to prevent fires from turning into major disasters and may save federal dollars by reducing the need for major disaster declarations. The first FMAG was issued in 1970, but they were rare until the 1990s. In the 1990s, an average of 21.6 FMAGs were declared per year, increasing to an average of 55.2 per year in the 2000s. Unlike emergency and major disaster declarations, data on turndowns are not comprehensive. From 2000 to 2015, the average annual number of FMAG requests not recommended by FEMA for presidential declaration was 11.6. Texas received the most FMAG declarations (236), followed by California (166), Oklahoma (90), and Washington (89). Emergency declarations authorize activities to help states and communities with essential services and activities to reduce future damage, but do not provide assistance for infrastructure repairs. They can be declared before an incident to save lives and prevent loss. Local governments take steps to lessen the impact of storms and prevent disasters. The Stafford Act defines an emergency as a situation requiring federal assistance to save lives and protect property. The number of emergency declarations varies each year, with 2005 having the highest number due to Hurricane Katrina. The average number of declarations issued from 1974 to 2016 was 8.8 per year. The average number of emergency declarations from 2010 to 2016 was 10.6 per year, with denials of gubernatorial requests remaining fairly static at 2.7 per year. There is a slight decrease in denials during presidential election years, with New York receiving the most emergency declarations at 22. Since 1980, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has been the lead federal entity for drought assistance, with FEMA providing supplemental assistance. Major disaster declarations offer a broader range of assistance to state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and individuals for infrastructure repair and restoration. A major disaster declaration provides assistance for the repair or restoration of public infrastructure after natural catastrophes or other severe events in the United States. This includes programs for temporary housing, disaster unemployment assistance, crisis counseling, and community disaster loans. The frequency of major disaster declarations has increased since the 1990s, with an average of 58.7 per year from 2010 to 2016. The President has the authority to deny gubernatorial requests for federal disaster assistance, with an average of 11.3 denials per year in recent times. The frequency of major disaster declarations has increased since the 1990s, with an average of 58.7 per year from 2010 to 2016. Denials of requests for major disaster declarations have become more static, averaging 11.3 denials from 2010 to 2016. Emergency managers may dissuade governors from making requests if they believe the per capita threshold is too low. Floods, tornadoes, winter storms, and hurricanes account for the majority of major disaster declarations. Texas, California, Oklahoma, New York, and Florida have received the most major disaster declarations. The Sandy Recovery and Improvement Act allowed Native American groups to request disaster declarations directly from the President, instead of going through state governments. This change was made to respect tribal sovereignty and address issues where states were reluctant to request assistance for damage on tribal land. The Sandy Recovery and Improvement Act allowed Native American groups to directly request disaster declarations from the President, respecting tribal sovereignty and addressing challenges in receiving assistance for damage on tribal land. Language barriers, physical isolation, and the desire for equal management abilities as states posed challenges for emergency management in tribal areas. The provision in the Stafford Act allows tribal governments to submit requests for declarations, ensuring they can receive assistance even if a separate declaration is made for the state. The provision in the Stafford Act allows tribal governments to retain local government status for disaster declarations, with limited use so far. FEMA is developing policies for tribal authority implementation. Factors influencing increased declarations include more severe weather incidents and changes in federal policies. The Subcommittee on Global Change Research found evidence of increased frequency and intensity of heavy downpours. Severe weather data from 1974 to 2016 showed a rising trend in weather incidents, with fluctuations in the number of declarations compared to reported incidents. Since 2010, there has been more parity between emergency declarations and severe weather events. Since 2010, there has been more parity between emergency declarations and severe weather events. Some argue that the increase in reported severe weather incidents may be due to advancements in weather tracking technology. Further studies are needed to establish a link between historical weather patterns and declarations. The population of the United States doubled from 1953 to 2016. Population growth in the United States from 1953 to 2016 has led to increased density in communities and development in previously uninhabited areas. This growth has also resulted in more citizens living in disaster-prone areas, with some states encouraging development despite the risks. Coastal development has become a lucrative economic force due to population growth and the appeal of coastal areas. This has led to increased pressure on landowners to sell or develop, exacerbating the financial recovery capacity of states from disasters. The costs of recovering from disasters have grown due to population growth, increased standards of living, and reliance on expensive technical systems. Federal policy changes since 1953, including legislation and FEMA policies, have contributed to the increase in disaster declarations. The federal role in disaster response expanded from 1950 to 1980 through legislation and executive action. In the 1950s, federal disaster assistance was less comprehensive, focusing on initial repairs, modest aid to families, and loans for homeowners and businesses. Legislation in the 1970s addressed specific disaster problems, leading to the creation of FEMA in 1978 by President Jimmy Carter. Over thirty years, federal policy evolved towards giving administrators a more decisive role in emergency management, spurred by natural disasters like the Alaska earthquake and Hurricane Betsy. By 1978, federal disaster policy had evolved towards coordination of federal and nonfederal action. The 1980s were relatively quiet in terms of large disaster events, but significant changes were made with the passage of P.L. 100-707 in 1988, which established the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program and federal/state cost-share for the Public Assistance program. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 established a pre-disaster mitigation program to reduce risk, separate from the President's Disaster Relief Fund. It also allowed increased funding for states under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. However, home repair costs were capped at $5,000 per household. The Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act of 2006 included significant changes to disaster relief administration. The Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act of 2006, P.L. 109-295, made changes to Stafford Act authorities, increasing aid for post-disaster recovery. It repealed the $5,000 cap on assistance and allowed states to provide case management services and transportation aid. The Sandy Recovery and Improvement Act of 2013, P.L. 113-2, also amended the Stafford Act, including a tribal declaration policy and adjustments to disaster relief administration. The legislation made significant changes to the Public Assistance program and Stafford Act authorities, including a tribal declaration policy. FEMA has implemented policy changes that may increase disaster declarations, such as handling snowstorms differently and using pre-landfall declarations for hurricane preparations. An example is FEMA's adjustment in snow policy in 2009, providing federal assistance for snow removal costs for a longer period. Since 2009, FEMA has revised its snow policy to align more closely with the Stafford Act, considering most snow-related events as major disasters. This change allows snowstorm events to be evaluated for major disaster declarations under FEMA regulations. The final Snow Assistance Policy by FEMA, in response to comments on the 2008 proposed policy, no longer limits major disaster declarations for snow events. In FY2010, the policy change led to 22 \"snow emergencies\" being declared as \"snow disasters,\" increasing major disaster declarations by one-third. In 2011, there were 14 major disaster declarations. In 2010, FEMA changed its Snow Assistance Policy, leading to a one-third increase in major disaster declarations for snow events. In 2011, there were 14 major disaster declarations for severe winter storms or snow storms, reducing the total number of declarations for the year from 97 to 83. FEMA began recommending emergency declarations in advance of hurricanes in 1999 to strengthen state evacuation efforts and reduce hurricane impact. FEMA policy guidance now governs emergency declarations for hurricanes, with an increase in declarations before major storms like Hurricane Irene in 2011. These declarations are made for states immediately threatened by category 3, 4, or 5 hurricanes, with the President retaining discretion on the decision. This change in policy has led to more declarations being issued. The FEMA policy change has increased the number of disaster declarations over the last two decades. The process is considered transparent at the local level but becomes opaque as it moves up through FEMA and DHS management to the White House. Damage assessments are done publicly with federal, state, and local officials working together to determine eligible damage amounts. Governor's letters requesting federal help are usually available to the public. FEMA provides a template for state emergency management offices to anticipate disaster response. FEMA provides a template for state emergency management offices to anticipate information needed for disaster declarations, including legal language and program cost shares. The agency has increased transparency in the disaster declaration process by detailing factors considered in evaluating a governor's request and making preliminary damage assessment reports available on their website dating back to 2008. The move towards greater transparency at FEMA may have changed how recommendations for federal assistance are made to the President. Prior to this, FEMA officials could privately discuss various factors when determining a state's financial capacity to respond to an incident without federal assistance. These factors, such as economic well-being and budget surplus, are subjective and difficult to quantify, making certain recommendations harder to justify. Some argue that using per capita thresholds exclusively for disaster assistance recommendations may make the process seem fairer, but it overlooks important factors. The move towards transparency at FEMA may have changed how recommendations for federal disaster assistance are made. Critics argue that using per capita thresholds exclusively may overlook important factors that establish state capacity, potentially leading to fewer requests being denied. Critics also suggest that Presidents are more likely to issue a declaration during a presidential election year. The data shows a slight increase in emergency and major disaster declarations during presidential election years, with an average of 54.3 declarations compared to 52.1 in non-election years. There is also a decrease in declaration turndowns during election years, with an average of 14.5 turndowns compared to 16.0 in non-election years. This variation may suggest political influence on declaration decisions during election years. The data suggests a slight increase in emergency and major disaster declarations during presidential election years, with a decrease in declaration turndowns. However, it is challenging to prove that political reasons significantly influence declaration determinations. The differences between presidential and non-presidential election years are statistically insignificant, with more nonelection years in the sample potentially skewing the results. Other variables may also contribute to the increase in declarations during presidential election years. Some argue that presidential decisions on disaster declarations may be influenced by political considerations, such as issuing declarations around election years to gain media coverage and voter approval. Studies have shown differing conclusions on this issue, with some suggesting that states politically important to the President have a higher rate of disaster declaration. States politically important to the President have a higher rate of disaster declaration, and disaster expenditures are higher in states with congressional representation on FEMA oversight committees. Election year impacts are also observed. Some argue that the increase in declaration approvals and denials may not solely be due to political motivations, as factors like weather patterns, development, and population changes have evolved over time. During President Reagan's presidency, the number of approvals for gubernatorial requests for disaster assistance was low, with a high rate of turndowns, reflecting a conservative approach to governing in disasters. The low number of natural disaster events during his term may have contributed to this trend. Additionally, the number of emergency and major disaster declarations in 2012 was the lowest since 2006, regardless of it being an election year. The rise of 24-hour news networks has also influenced the President's decision-making process for issuing disaster declarations. The increase in news coverage of emergencies and disasters since the 1980s is attributed to technological advances in electronics and satellite communications. This has led to the rise of 24-hour news networks providing live coverage. The availability of footage through miniaturization of cameras and video via cell phones has also contributed to increased media coverage of disasters. Some suggest that Presidents now take a greater interest in disasters as a meeting point of politics and public policy. It is now customary for a President to visit major disaster sites. The increase in media coverage of emergencies and disasters since the 1980s is attributed to technological advances. Presidents now visit disaster sites to demonstrate responsiveness and empathy towards victims. Media coverage of disasters puts political pressure on the President to show compassion and strong decision-making skills. Public officials use the news media to demonstrate sympathy for disaster victims and criticize slow emergency response efforts. Scholars argue that a President's handling of a disaster can impact their image and political outcomes. The intensity of national news coverage can influence the President's decision to provide federal aid for disasters. The President may be compelled to provide federal aid based on news coverage of the event. State-level factors such as budget shortfalls and the professionalization of emergency management have made states more likely to request disaster declarations. The recession starting in 2007 caused fiscal stress for states, leading to tax increases and expenditure reductions to balance budgets. In 2016, state general fund expenditures and revenues exceeded pre-recession levels. Economic contraction led states to seek federal funds for disaster costs. Budget constraints have made states more reliant on federal assistance for disaster relief. Since 2001, states have increasingly created emergency management agencies and academic programs in the field. Wayne Blanchard noted a growth in emergency management programs from 95 to 113 between 2003 and 2004, with more programs in development. This expansion has led to increased awareness of incidents that may qualify for a presidential declaration of emergency or disaster. The number of emergency management programs has significantly increased from 95 to 310 between 2003 and 2016. This growth has led to graduates who are more knowledgeable about the declaration process and state emergency managers being better equipped to request disaster declarations due to technological advances in information technology. The increase in emergency management programs has led to more knowledgeable graduates and state emergency managers better equipped to request disaster declarations. This changing environment may result in more confidence in advocating for a declaration, but also raises concerns about federal costs. Congress may consider limiting the number of declarations or the amount of spending after a declaration to address these issues. The increase in emergency management programs has led to more knowledgeable graduates and state emergency managers advocating for disaster declarations. Concerns over federal costs may lead to debates on limiting the number of declarations or assistance provided. Some argue that the increase in declarations is justified due to inclement weather and population growth, while others believe it is necessary to help regions recover economically. The increase in emergency management programs has led to more knowledgeable graduates and state emergency managers advocating for disaster declarations. Concerns over federal costs may lead to debates on limiting the number of declarations or assistance provided. Some argue that the increase in declarations is justified due to inclement weather and population growth, while others believe adjustments should be made to limit federal assistance once a declaration is issued. Policy mechanisms are being considered to decrease the number of declarations, such as changing definitions in the Stafford Act and adjusting the per capita formula for determining disaster assistance eligibility. The Stafford Act's presidential declaration authority is seen as enhanced due to vague definitions of emergencies and major disasters. The Stafford Act's definitions are vague, allowing for broad presidential declaration authority. FEMA used a $1 per capita damage amount for disaster assessments until 1999, impacting the number of disasters qualifying for declaration. Factors for declaration were not made public until 1999. In 1999, FEMA began to disclose factors considered for disaster declaration, which were previously kept confidential. The per capita damage amount was used in assessments but not widely known. Adjusting the amount for inflation only started over a decade later. Congress passed a law in 1986 preventing any area from being excluded from receiving assistance. The Stafford Act prohibits excluding areas from receiving assistance based solely on income or population. In 2001, the GAO recommended FEMA develop more specific criteria for disaster declarations, such as using a state's total taxable resources instead of per capita measures. The state's Total Taxable Resources (TTR) is a better measure of state funding capacity as it includes various resources potentially subject to state taxation. TTR is currently used to target federal aid to low-capacity states in certain programs. Adjustments for TTR in FEMA's Public Assistance program would provide a more realistic estimate of a state's ability to handle disasters. The use of Total Taxable Resources (TTR) for disaster declarations could provide a more accurate assessment of a state's ability to respond. TTR could be used alongside other criteria, potentially reducing federal costs by denying assistance for marginal incidents. Some policymakers suggest using expert panels to assist in major disaster determinations. The Disaster Recovery Act of 2011 proposed using expert panels to recommend declaring catastrophic incidents for federal assistance. The panels would assess severity and state response capabilities, but opinions differ on whether this would improve objectivity or slow down the process. The panel's recommendation may impede the President's authority to issue a declaration, but it could also be argued that the President would retain this authority. To reduce the number of declarations and costs, incentives like converting federal assistance into low-interest recovery loans could dissuade states from requesting assistance. This could allow states to handle incidents without federal aid and avoid reimbursement. The CDL program provides financial assistance to local governments after disasters by offering federal loans to compensate for lost revenue. The SBA Disaster Loan Program offers low-interest loans to businesses for physical and economic damages after a declared disaster. The SBA Disaster Loan Program provides loans to individuals and households to repair and replace homes and personal property after a disaster. Policymakers could consider expanding the program to include recovery loans for states and local governments at low interest rates. Potential changes to the Stafford Act, such as repealing Section 320, could establish thresholds for states to qualify for federal assistance. One potential change to the Stafford Act is to amend Section 404 to tie mitigation assistance to state codes, incentivizing mitigation efforts and potentially reducing federal costs in the future. This amendment could set different federal cost shares based on states meeting certain standards, encouraging proactive mitigation work. The Stafford Act could be amended to limit declarations or assistance, require congressional approval for cost-share adjustments, and tie federal assistance to state programs. This could increase state capacity and incentivize proactive mitigation efforts. The Stafford Act could be amended to discontinue snow removal assistance without Congress approval, potentially shifting more costs to states and local governments. Currently, states cover 25% of disaster costs while the federal government covers at least 75%. There is no limit on the number of people assisted after a disaster. The federal government provides unlimited funds for repairing state and local infrastructure after a disaster, with no cap on expenses. Some suggest increasing the state's 25% share of costs due to the federal government's financial situation. Another option is to make cost-sharing arrangements fixed without adjustments. Assistance for emergencies could be in the form of loans, and post-disaster aid could be converted to low-interest or no-interest loans for states. The federal government may require states to reimburse a portion of disaster recovery funding. States could qualify for larger federal shares or lower interest rates by implementing preparedness measures. The number of disaster declarations is expected to increase due to severe weather patterns, population growth, and development trends. Some argue for policy adjustments in response to the causes of the increase, while others believe the declaration process should remain unchanged. The increase in disaster declarations may require adjustments in federal policies or a shift in responsibility to states and localities. If the increase is due to federal policies, constraints on the President's discretion or FEMA reform may be necessary. If state policies are the cause, incentives like loans could help reduce state requests for assistance. The government's role in disaster assistance is debated, with questions on fiscal responsibility between federal and state governments. Policy options may shift more costs to states and localities, potentially impacting disaster victims and officials. Reducing declarations and limiting assistance could affect states' recovery abilities. The government's role in disaster assistance is debated, with questions on fiscal responsibility between federal and state governments. Policy options may shift more costs to states and localities, potentially impacting disaster victims and officials. Disrupting the state's ability to recover from an incident or adjust to changes by reallocating state resources could have significant consequences."
