    "content": "The Act titled \"United States-Caribbean Partnership Act of 2014\" defines the term \"appropriate congressional committees\" as the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate. Congress finds that the countries of the Caribbean are important partners for the United States, and cooperation on commerce, security, and energy must be strengthened. The Caribbean countries are key members of the Organization of American States, and there are five countries in the region with which the US has diplomatic relations but no permanent presence: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Diplomatic relations with these countries are managed through the US Embassy in Bridgetown, Barbados. Due to the absence of US diplomats in Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, citizens must travel to Barbados for consular services. Embassy officials have to fly from Barbados to these countries for meetings, which can be costly and inconvenient. US citizens in these countries lack full consular services and may face challenges during emergencies. Due to the absence of US diplomats in Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, United States citizens may be stranded without full consular services during emergencies. This lack of diplomatic presence also hinders officials from attending key events, establishing close relationships with local representatives, and participating in important meetings and ceremonies. Due to the absence of US diplomats in five countries, official diplomatic interactions are often limited to phone, fax, or email, reducing substantive dialogue. This lack of presence also hinders public diplomacy efforts in these countries. The Secretary of State will establish US embassies with consular services in Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines within five years to provide consular services and engage in direct diplomacy. The Secretary of State must submit annual progress reports to Congress on implementing the Act, with a possible one-year delay if needed. Funding for the Act can only come from specific State Department accounts."
