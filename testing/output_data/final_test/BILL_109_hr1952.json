SEC. 2. WITHHOLDING OF ASSISTANCE; WITHHOLDING OF ACCESS TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; SPECIAL MEASURES. Withholding of Bilateral Assistance and Opposition to Multilateral Development Assistance: 50% of US assistance for countries of concern listed in the report must be withheld, and the US Executive Director of multilateral development banks must vote against any loans to these countries. The Secretary of the Treasury may require domestic financial agencies to take special measures with respect to countries of concern identified in the report, including financial institutions operating outside the United States. Institutions outside the US engaging in financial transactions with nationals or entities of a country may be subject to measures if the Secretary of the Treasury certifies to Congress that certain conditions are met. The United States provided technical assistance to the country to comply with the Convention, and the country has taken adequate steps to enforce laws and regulations to prohibit offenses under the Convention. The country has taken steps to enforce laws and regulations to prohibit offenses under the Convention, including identifying, freezing, and seizing assets used in the commission of offenses, investigating and prosecuting offenders, and regulating financial systems and institutions. The country has taken steps to enforce laws and regulations to prohibit offenses under the Convention, including identifying, freezing, and seizing assets used in the commission of offenses, investigating and prosecuting offenders, and regulating financial systems and institutions. For financial and high-value commodity markets, and remittance services, the vital national security interests of the United States may require assistance to be provided to a country that would not otherwise qualify for certification. The President must provide written notification to Congress before terminating bilateral assistance to a country. The certification must include a description of vital national security interests at risk if assistance is terminated. Development bank assistance is not provided to a country if special measures are imposed, and a risk assessment is required weighing the country's non-compliance against US national security interests. Congressional review is triggered if a joint resolution disapproving the President's determination is enacted within 30 days. Consequences for countries decertified include the Secretary of the Treasury not making a certification. If the Treasury does not certify a country or Congress disapproves the certification, funds for US assistance cannot be obligated or expended for that country. Voting against multilateral development bank assistance and other requirements apply until conditions are met for recertification. The Treasury's certification is required for US assistance to a country. If the certification is not made or is disapproved by Congress, funds cannot be used for that country. Certain conditions must be met for recertification. If there is a fundamental change in conditions or if Congress approves the certification, US assistance can be provided to a country. Any certification under paragraph (2)(A) must justify the certification. Joint resolutions under this section will be considered in the Senate following specific procedures. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Convention\" refers to the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury."
