The pilot program for screening individuals with unescorted access at airports will follow the same standards as passenger screenings, with at least one airport using a private screening company. Additionally, each participating airport will designate a screening lane for the program. The pilot program for screening individuals with unescorted access at airports will include alternative screening methods such as biometric technology, behavior recognition programs, and canines at one of the participating airports. The pilot program for screening individuals with unescorted access at airports includes measures such as targeted physical inspections, video cameras, increased vetting, training, and awareness programs. Vulnerability assessments of participating airports will focus on access badge and uniform controls. Airport operators will assess screening technology and report results to the Assistant Secretary. The Assistant Secretary will compile and provide operational assessments to airports in the pilot program, evaluating security effects, wait times, personnel needs, and impact on other security activities.
