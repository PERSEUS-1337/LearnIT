The \"Wasatch Wilderness and Watershed Protection Act of 2010\" designates certain Federal lands in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forests in Salt Lake County, Utah as wilderness areas, adding approximately 4,627 acres to the Lone Peak Wilderness and certain lands near Mount Olympus. The \"Wasatch Wilderness and Watershed Protection Act of 2010\" designates additional wilderness areas in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forests in Salt Lake County, Utah. This includes the addition of approximately 813 acres to the Mount Olympus Wilderness, 2,342 acres designated as the Bear Trap Wilderness, and 7,759 acres designated as the Wayne Owens Grandeur Peak/Mount Aire Wilderness. The Secretary of Agriculture will file and make available maps and descriptions of these designated lands. The Chief of the Forest Service, on behalf of Agriculture, must submit maps and legal descriptions of designated wilderness areas to the House Committee on Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. These documents will be available for public inspection and have the same legal force as if included in the Act, with the Secretary of Agriculture allowed to correct errors. SEC. 3. HELISKIING SPECIAL MANAGEMENT AREA, UINTA-WASATCH-CACHE NATIONAL FORESTS, UTAH. Designation of certain Federal lands in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest as the \"Heliskiing Special Management Area\" comprising approximately 10,479 acres. The Secretary of Agriculture will file a map and legal description with the relevant committees after the enactment of this Act. The Senate designates the \"Heliskiing Special Management Area\" in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest, covering 10,479 acres. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide a map and legal description for public inspection. The management aims to preserve the area's wilderness character and potential for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System, with prohibitions on permanent roads. The Heliskiing Special Management Area in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest prohibits permanent roads and the use of motorized vehicles, except for authorized Heliskiing activities allowed by the Secretary of Agriculture. Temporary roads are also prohibited in the area to preserve its wilderness character. The Heliskiing Special Management Area allows authorized Heliskiing activities on Federal lands without impacting future permit processes. Activities within the area must comply with applicable law. The area will eventually be designated as wilderness. Upon termination of commercial helicopter-assisted skiing or snowboarding activities, the Heliskiing Special Management Area will be renamed as the \"Wasatch Mountain Wilderness\" as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS. The term \"covered land\" includes wilderness areas designated by sections 2 and 3, and the Heliskiing Special Management Area. Land designated as wilderness shall be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture in accordance with the Wilderness Act and this Act. Any reference in the Wilderness Act to its effective date is deemed to be the date of this Act's enactment. The Act designates the Wasatch Mountain Wilderness and clarifies that the effective date refers to the Federal Register notice. It also states that the State of Utah retains jurisdiction over wildlife. The Act prohibits the creation of buffer zones around covered land and allows nonwilderness activities outside the boundary of the covered land. The Act withdraws covered land from various forms of entry, disposal, and mining activities. Any land acquired by the US within covered land boundaries becomes part of a wilderness or special management area. SEC. 5. LAND EXCHANGE, UINTA-WASATCH-CACHE NATIONAL FOREST. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to expedite a land exchange between Snowbird Corp and the Secretary involving land in specific areas of the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest. The exchange should be completed within one year to ensure continued recreational opportunities for the public. The Secretary of Agriculture will manage acquired land to maintain its wilderness character and potential for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Snowbird Corp will acquire private property adjacent to their ski resort operations. Snowbird Corp will expand ski resort operations on acquired lands, including chairlifts and tramway facilities. Prohibited activities on the acquired land include permanent roads, motorized vehicles, and ski resort expansion with chairlift construction. The Secretary of Agriculture may allow avalanche control devices like GAZEX to be installed on the acquired Flagstaff Area land for public safety. The acquired land is withdrawn from various forms of entry, appropriation, and disposal under public land laws, as well as mining and mineral leasing laws. SEC. 6. WATERSHED MANAGEMENT. The Act allows motorized access, road maintenance, and necessary vegetation management by the Forest Service and local government entities in designated wilderness areas to ensure the viability of watershed facilities and prevent water supply degradation. The Act allows vegetation management activities to prevent degradation of the water supply mainly due to fire, disease, and insect infestations in designated wilderness areas."
