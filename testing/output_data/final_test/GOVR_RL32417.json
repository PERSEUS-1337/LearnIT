    "content": "The Department of State released its Patterns of Global Terrorism report in 2004, with revised data showing minimal change in the number of terrorist attacks worldwide in 2003. Anti-U.S. attacks declined, while worldwide deaths decreased by 14% and the number of wounded increased by 81%. Asia had the highest number of attacks and casualties in both 2002 and 2003. The 2004 Patterns of Global Terrorism report showed a decrease in anti-U.S. attacks, with Asia experiencing the highest number of attacks and casualties. The report includes data on terrorist incidents, designated foreign terrorist organizations, and countries on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. The U.S. maintains a list of state sponsors of terrorism, including Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. Sanctions and export controls are imposed on these countries to reduce their support for terrorism. The Anti-Terrorism and Arms Export Amendments Act of 1989 prohibits the export of dual-use items and military sales to these countries. Foreign aid is also restricted under the Foreign Assistance Act. The 1979 Export Administration Act prohibits foreign aid to designated countries and requires Congress to be notified before exporting equipment for terrorist or military purposes. Sanctions also include denying foreign tax credits. Iran is characterized as an active supporter of terrorism, while Syria is closer to the middle of the spectrum in supporting terrorist activities. Iran is designated as the \"most active\" state sponsor of international terrorism, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard and Ministry of Intelligence and Security involved in planning and supporting terrorist acts. Iran, designated as the \"most active\" state sponsor of international terrorism, supports terrorist acts by providing safe haven and resources to groups like Al Qaeda, HAMAS, and Hizballah. Iranian officials have detained Al Qaeda operatives but resisted transferring them. Despite announcing international inspections of nuclear sites, Iran is unlikely to be removed from the Terrorism Sponsors List. North Korea, part of the \"axis of evil,\" is also involved in supporting terrorism. North Korea, part of the \"axis of evil,\" announced plans to sign antiterrorism conventions but did not cooperate in combating terrorism. While its support for international terrorism seems limited, its nuclear program and proliferation of missile technology suggest removal from the terrorism list is unlikely soon. Iraq, under Saddam Hussein, provided safe haven for terrorist groups and prepared for attacks on civilian and military targets. Iraq, under Saddam Hussein, supported terrorist groups and planned attacks on civilian and military targets. President Bush suspended sanctions against Iraq in 2003, putting it on par with non-terrorist states. Iraq is expected to be removed from the terrorism list once it has a government that pledges not to support terrorism. The report highlights the blurred line between insurgency and terrorism in Iraq, with attacks on civilian targets increasing. Coalition forces detained over 300 suspected foreign fighters in Iraq by the end of 2003. In 2003, Libya reassured the U.N. Security Council of renouncing terrorism, sharing intelligence, and eliminating weapons of mass destruction. Despite curbing support for international terrorists, Libya maintained contact with some past terrorist clients. President Bush lifted sanctions against Libya in April 2004. President Bush lifted sanctions against Libya on April 23, 2004, after successful intelligence cooperation on WMD issues and efforts by Libya to resolve compensation for Pam Am flight 103 survivors. Syria continued to support Palestinian rejectionist groups and allow Iran to use Damascus as a transhipment point for resupplying Hizballah in Lebanon. President Bush imposed economic and trade sanctions against Syria on May 11, 2004, under the Syrian Accountability Act. Cuba remains on the terrorism list due to opposition to the US-led war on terrorism. Sudan is likely to be removed from the list due to increased cooperation with the US, but concerns remain about terrorist groups operating in the country. Some critics question the influence of political and economic agendas on the Patterns report, particularly in the designation of state sponsors of terrorism like Cuba and North Korea. They argue that the focus on state sponsors may not be as relevant in a world where terrorism is often not state-supported. Additionally, concerns are raised about the effectiveness and unilateral nature of sanctions imposed on nations by the US and its allies. Some critics argue that criticisms of the Patterns report focus too much on policy issues and state sponsors of terrorism, rather than on the data and analysis presented. They suggest that the report provides valuable information on trends in terrorist activity and background on terrorist organizations. Additionally, concerns are raised about the politicization of the report and the need to address incitement to terrorism by nation states. Patterns 2003 has been criticized for downplaying counterterrorism cooperation and progress of certain nations, such as Pakistan's alleged support for Kashmiri militants and Saudi Arabia's perceived lack of effort in curbing terrorism activities. Despite citing Saudi Arabia as a nation focusing on fighting terrorism, critics argue that the report may be biased towards portraying relationships in a positive light to improve cooperation. The issue of informing Congress and giving countries credit in Patterns for cooperation in intelligence or renditions, while maintaining secrecy for domestic political reasons, remains unresolved. Suggestions include producing a classified annex to the report, but this poses challenges in preparation. Some propose that Patterns reports should focus more on the ideological and economic impact of terrorism on nations and the global economy, rather than solely quantifying terrorist success in terms of physical damage. The focus of Patterns reports on quantifying terrorist success in physical damage may not reflect the broader economic and political criteria that terror groups may be measuring success by. Some suggest that the reports should shift towards analyzing the data for meaning rather than just presenting statistics. This could benefit Congress and the counterterrorism policy community by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of terrorism. Patterns 2003 has faced criticism for potential shortcomings in data completeness, accuracy, and relevance. Some argue that incidents with major political or economic impacts on target nations may not be adequately included. Henry A. Waxman raised concerns about the decline in non-significant terrorist attacks reported in Patterns 2003, contrasting with independent analyses. The Patterns 2003 report has faced criticism for potential data shortcomings, with concerns raised about the decline in non-significant terrorist attacks reported. Independent analysis contradicts the data, showing a 20-year high in significant terrorist attacks in 2003. The data used in Patterns 2003 is questioned for completeness and accuracy, leading to the transfer of data provision from the CIA to the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC). The TTIC is issuing an errata sheet to correct incomplete data. The final report of the 9/11 Commission recommends the creation of a National Counterterrorism Center, which President Bush also plans to establish. The center will serve as a central knowledge bank for information on terrorists, coordinate counterterrorism efforts, and prepare daily terrorism reports for senior officials. The Chairmen of three House Committees have raised concerns about data discrepancies in the Patterns 2003 report and forwarded a letter to Secretary of State Colin Powell. The House Committees have requested a comprehensive review of definitions of terrorist acts from the State Department, with results due by October 1, 2004. This review is in response to concerns raised about data discrepancies in the Patterns 2003 report. The primary threat from terrorism has evolved from state-sponsored to Al Qaeda affiliated groups and non-state sponsors. The report on Patterns of Global Terrorism has expanded in length and scope, being widely recognized as a key resource. However, due to data issues, there are calls for a thorough review of the report's structure and content. The data on terrorist incidents has been transferred to the Terrorist Threat Integration Center. Requests for access to the data have not been fulfilled. In 2003, businesses were the most targeted (40%) with bombing being the most common method (67%). Casualties include dead and wounded, with high casualties in anti-Russian attacks in 2002. The reason for the increase in attacks is unclear."
