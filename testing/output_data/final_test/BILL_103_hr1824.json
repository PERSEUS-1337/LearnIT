    "content": "The Act titled \"Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Improvement Act of 1993\" is cited as the short title. Congress finds that the US transportation system needs diversification for economic competitiveness, with biking and walking overlooked as modes of transportation. There is potential to increase bicycle and foot commuting, as many Americans live close to their workplace. A transportation system including facilities for biking and walking offers numerous benefits. Bicycle and pedestrian transportation offer various benefits such as reducing traffic congestion, air pollution, dependence on imported oil, and accidents. It also promotes health, conserves energy, and preserves natural habitats. Traffic congestion costs the country billions of dollars in travel delays and increased fuel consumption. Traffic congestion causes travel delays, increased fuel consumption, and higher auto insurance premiums. It currently results in over 2 billion hours of delays per year and is projected to increase by 400% on highways and 120% on urban roads in the next 14 years. Expanding roadways alone cannot meet transportation needs, with one-half of urban space already dedicated to motor vehicle facilities. For instance, Interstate Route 95 between Miami and Orlando would need to be expanded to a 40-lane highway to accommodate expected traffic flows by 2005. Motor vehicles also contribute significantly to air pollution. Reduced reliance on cars and trucks can significantly reduce air pollution, as they generate 80% of carbon dioxide emissions. Diminished reliance on motor vehicles also decreases America's dependence on foreign oil, with 63% of imported oil used for transportation. Additionally, constructing bicycle and pedestrian facilities is more cost-effective than building new roadways. Constructing bicycle and pedestrian paths is more cost-effective than building new roadways. A one-mile stretch of these paths costs approximately $46,000, while one mile of a 4-lane highway costs around $1,000,000. The purposes of this Act include diversifying the transportation system, reducing deaths and injuries of bicycle and pedestrian commuters, alleviating traffic congestion, air pollution, dependence on foreign oil, and preserving natural environments. The Act aims to diversify transportation, reduce deaths and injuries of bicycle and pedestrian commuters, alleviate traffic congestion, air pollution, dependence on foreign oil, and preserve natural environments. Section 217 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to require each State to obligate a minimum of 3 percent of funds for various transportation projects authorized by different subsections. SEC. 4. RIGHT-OF-WAY ACQUISITION. Amends Section 109(f) of title 23, United States Code by replacing \"bikeways\" with \"bicycle and pedestrian facilities\". SEC. 5. PROTECTION OF EXISTING BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC. Amends Section 109(n) by including bridge projects, severance reduction, and changing \"major\" to \"potential\". SEC. 6. HAZARD ELIMINATION. Amends Section 152(a) by adding \"bicyclists\" after \"motorists\". SEC. 7. OTHER USES. Amends Section 217(h)(3) by adding \"and electric golf carts\" after \"motorized wheelchairs\". SEC. 8. NATIONAL HIGHWAY SAFETY ADVISORY COMMITTEE. SEC. 8. NATIONAL HIGHWAY SAFETY ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The third sentence of section 404(a)(1) of title 23, United States Code, is amended to include ``of bicyclists and pedestrians'' after ``owners''."
