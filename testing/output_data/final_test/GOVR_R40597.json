    "content": "A discussion draft of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was released by Representatives Waxman and Markey in 2009. The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 proposes a \"cap and trade\" system to control carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Covered entities would need permits to emit gases, with allowances gradually reduced to cut emissions by 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. The draft bill aims to reduce emissions by 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. It includes provisions for compensating certain industrial sectors and requiring retail electricity suppliers to use renewable resources for a percentage of their power load. However, key issues like allocation of emission allowances and support for affected workers and consumers are still under discussion. The March 31 Waxman-Markey discussion draft includes provisions for reducing emissions by 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. Controversy surrounds the renewable energy mandate for electricity suppliers. The summary excludes detailed analysis and focuses on general descriptions of the provisions. Establishes a federal Renewable Electricity Standard requiring retail electricity suppliers with annual sales of 1 million megawatt-hours or more to earn or acquire Renewable Electricity Credits (RECs) for a portion of their sales. The portion starts at 6% in 2012, increasing to 25% by 2025 and remaining at that level until 2039. RECs can be traded or banked and can be earned from various renewable energy resources. \"Distributed generation\" qualifies for three RECs for each mwh of eligible renewable electricity. Up to 20% of the RECs can be obtained by complying with federal regulations. The draft establishes a federal Renewable Electricity Standard requiring retail electricity suppliers to earn or acquire Renewable Electricity Credits (RECs) for a portion of their sales, starting at 6% in 2012 and increasing to 25% by 2025. Up to 20% of the RECs can be provided by complying with the Federal Energy Efficiency Resource Standard. Alternative compliance payments can substitute for RECs, with a new Renewable Electricity Deployment Fund collecting payments and redistributing them to suppliers. The Secretary of Energy must incorporate best practices of state-level programs and cooperate with states to minimize administrative costs. Within 120 days of enactment, a report must be submitted to Congress by the EPA Administrator, Secretary of Energy, and other relevant federal agencies. The Administrator must submit a report to Congress outlining a strategy to address legal barriers to carbon capture and sequestration. Regulations to minimize the risk of carbon dioxide release must be promulgated within two years. The Administrator is required to deliver reports on geologic sequestration in the United States and other North American countries. Regulations for carbon dioxide geologic sequestration wells must be developed, including requirements for financial responsibility. A task force will report on the legal framework for geologic sequestration sites within 18 months. The task force, consisting of various experts and officials, will study federal and state environmental laws related to carbon dioxide sequestration sites. The study will also assess the need for pipelines to transport carbon dioxide for sequestration or enhanced hydrocarbon recovery, considering regulatory and financing options to mitigate market risks. The Secretary is required to submit a report within 180 days on options to mitigate market risks for pipelines dedicated to carbon dioxide transportation. A Carbon Storage Research Corporation is authorized to accelerate the availability of carbon capture and storage technologies through grants and contracts to eligible entities. Industry organizations may conduct a referendum for the creation of the corporation. The creation of a Carbon Storage Research Corporation through a referendum conducted by industry organizations, approved by two-thirds of fossil fuel-based electricity providers, and managed by a Board of up to 15 members affiliated with the Electric Power Research Institute. If 40% of State regulatory authorities oppose, the Corporation will not be established. The section establishes requirements for board members, compensation, and terms of service for the Edison Electric Institute, the American Public Power Association, and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. It also provides details on the administration of the corporation, including grants, contracts, intellectual property, budgeting, audits, and assessment rates for different fuel types. Specific provisions are made for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The section outlines provisions for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), including methods for determining fossil-fuel-based electricity deliveries. It mandates a report to Congress within five years on the Corporation's activities, project selection, and funding adequacy. A technical advisory committee is established to provide independent assessments and recommendations. The EPA Administrator must promulgate regulations within two years to distribute authorized funds to support commercial activities. Regulations establish a program to distribute funds for carbon capture and sequestration technologies in power generation and industrial operations. Eligibility requires units with a capacity of 250 MW or more using coal or petroleum coke, or industrial sources emitting over 250,000 tons of CO2 annually. The section amends the Clean Air Act with performance standards for new coal-fired power plants. Covered plants must derive at least 30% of their heat input from specified fuels. The regulations set emission limits for covered units using coal or petroleum coke, with stricter limits for units permitted after 2020. Compliance is required within four years of certain conditions being met regarding carbon capture and sequestration technology. The Administrator will review emission standards for new covered units every five years starting in 2025, reducing the maximum carbon dioxide emission rate based on demonstrated technology. Additionally, regulations will be implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuel. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuel, including fuels for motor vehicles, nonroad vehicles, aircraft, and potentially ocean-going vessels. The program sets limits on emissions intensity per unit of energy, with a baseline established for 2005. Emissions must not exceed the baseline from 2014 to 2022, with a 5% reduction required after 2022 and a 10% reduction for 2030 and beyond. The renewable fuel standard (RFS) will be eliminated after 2022. In 2030 and beyond, emissions must be 10% below the baseline. Regulations must be based on average emissions intensity, allowing fuel providers to generate credits for exceeding reduction requirements. The Administrator can determine conditions for credit use, duration, and trading. Waivers may be granted if LCFS implementation harms the economy or environment, or if there is insufficient low-carbon fuel supply. Deficits can be carried forward to the following year for offset. Electric utilities must develop plans to support plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) and pure plug-in electric vehicles (EVs), including infrastructure like charging stations and fast-charging. State regulatory authorities and utilities need to establish protocols for integrating plug-in vehicles into the electrical distribution system, including billing and crediting electricity use. State regulatory authorities must set standards for integrating plug-in vehicles into the grid and consider cost recovery. The Secretary of Energy will establish a program for deploying plug-in vehicles, with financial assistance available for various purposes. The Secretary of Energy will provide financial assistance to automobile manufacturers for the production of plug-in vehicles, including retooling and purchasing domestically produced batteries. Assistance will be granted if manufacturers cannot finance the project on their own, with a preference for facilities in areas with the greatest need. The Secretary of Energy will provide financial assistance to facilities in areas with the greatest need for clean energy. The Department of Energy will establish a State Energy and Environment Development Fund for states to manage federal financial assistance for clean energy, energy efficiency, and climate change purposes. States can deposit appropriations from various programs into the SEED Fund. The SEED Fund can receive funds from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for grants, loans, and revolving loan programs. The Energy Secretary and EPA Administrator will assess smart grid capable appliances for Energy Star labeling. Smart grid appliances can communicate with a home's smart meter to regulate electricity usage during peak periods. The utility can control smart grid-capable appliances during peak periods to save costs. Appliances must be labeled for savings only if utility has smart grid technology. Load serving entities must reduce peak electricity demand by 2012 and 2015 without specific targets in the draft bill. The draft bill requires load serving entities to reduce peak electricity demand by 2012 and 2015 without specific targets. Goals should be achievable with an aggressive effort to deploy Smart Grid and peak demand reduction technologies. Goals can be set by individual entities, states, or regional entities, and do not necessarily require smart grid technology for implementation. The draft bill mandates load serving entities to reduce peak electricity demand by 2012 and 2015 without specific targets. Goals can be set by individual entities, states, or regional entities, and do not necessarily require smart grid technology for implementation. FERC is ordered to implement a program in coordination with state demand response and peak reduction programs, with no penalty for failure to reach goals. Grant programs are authorized to help achieve peak reduction aims, and energy efficiency programs are modified to focus on smart grid technology and extended to 2020. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes an energy efficiency appliance rebate program to include appliances with smart grid capabilities. Federal funds can now cover 100% of the rebate amount. The Federal Power Act is amended to establish a voluntary transmission planning process overseen by FERC, which will receive and consolidate regional plans, resolve conflicts, and report to Congress on planning efforts. No specific regional planning entities are designated, and no special treatment is given to transmission projects in final plans. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes an energy efficiency appliance rebate program with smart grid capabilities. Federal funds can cover 100% of the rebate amount. The Federal Power Act is amended to establish a voluntary transmission planning process overseen by FERC, focusing on facilitating renewable and zero-carbon power sources. Transmission planning should consider non-transmission solutions like energy efficiency and distributed generation. FERC is to establish planning principles within a year and participants must submit plans within 18 months. The draft authorizes funding for FERC to assist in planning processes, including technical expertise and dispute resolution services. Federal agencies can contract for renewable energy for up to 30 years, excluding municipal solid waste. The Federal Energy Management Program will publish a standardized agreement for federal agencies to purchase renewable energy. DOE must update national building energy codes every three years, with a target of 30% energy savings for updates after enactment, increasing to 50% after January 1, 2016. The draft authorizes funding for FERC to assist in planning processes and renewable energy procurement for federal agencies. States receiving federal training and funding assistance must certify their code updates and compliance with DOE. A Retrofit for Energy and Environmental Performance (REEP) program is created for energy efficiency improvements in existing buildings, with EPA developing standards for residential buildings and DOE for commercial buildings. EPA and DOE are required to use existing programs like Energy Star for Buildings. The REEP program involves developing standards for a retrofit policy for commercial buildings. DOE delegates authority to the Director of Commercial High-Performance Green Buildings to designate and fund a High-Performance Green Building Partnership Consortium. Federal financial assistance is provided to each state's SEED Fund. DOE administers financing for the program, granting rebates to low-income families for Energy Star-rated manufactured homes. EPA is directed to establish a building energy performance labeling program. The EPA is directed to establish a building energy performance labeling program for residential and commercial buildings to promote energy efficiency. Lighting standards are set for outdoor luminaires to increase efficiency over time. The EPA is directed to establish a building energy performance labeling program for residential and commercial buildings to promote energy efficiency. Lighting standards are set for outdoor luminaires to increase efficiency over time, with manufacturers required to meet specific standards for various types of light fixtures by certain deadlines. By January 1, 2012, energy efficiency standards are set for water dispensers, commercial hot food holding cabinets, and portable electric spas. The Department of Energy is directed to consider revisions to these standards and publish a final rule by January 1, 2013, with revised standards taking effect on January 1, 2016. Additionally, efficiency standards are established for commercial furnaces with specific input heat rates, requiring minimum combustion efficiencies for gas-fired and oil-fired furnaces. The criteria for prescribing new or amended standards now include factors like reduced emissions of greenhouse gases, impact on consumer energy prices, and energy efficiency from Smart Grid technologies. Manufacturers of covered products must provide annual reports to the DOE on compliance, economic impact, and other data. The text chunk discusses annual shipments, facility energy and water use, sales data, and the definition of \"energy conservation standard\" for covered equipment. It also addresses state and local building codes, test procedures, waivers, federal preemption, and a deployment program to reward retailers for selling high-efficiency equipment and appliances. The DOE program aims to promote high-efficiency consumer electronics and household appliances by offering bonus payments to manufacturers of top-performing products. The program also includes bounties for retailers to replace and recycle old, inefficient appliances, with the size of the bounty based on energy savings. Additionally, the DOE may require the retirement of old products when a new product receives a bonus. The DOE program offers bonus payments to manufacturers of high-efficiency products and bounties to retailers for replacing old appliances. A bonus program is established for manufacturers of new \"superefficient best-in-class\" products. DOE can set standards for mass-producible products even if they don't exist yet. Products eligible for a federal tax credit under sec. 45M are not eligible for bonus payments. The Energy Star program helps consumers choose energy-efficient products that are cost-effective. The President must use current authorities to set motor vehicle GHG standards that align with CAFE standards and California's requirements. The EPA Administrator must also establish GHG standards for heavy-duty vehicles, non-road vehicles, and aircraft based on emissions contributions and costs. The Administrator has the authority to establish provisions for averaging, banking, and trading emissions reduction credits within or across classes of vehicles and engines. States must submit goals and plans to stabilize transportation-related GHG emissions in a designated year and update goals every four years. Failure to submit goals or a plan may result in the prohibition of federal highway funds. Metropolitan planning organizations in areas with a population exceeding 200,000 must update transportation plans and programs to achieve these goals. The EPA Administrator may award competitive grants to Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) for transportation plans and programs to reduce GHG emissions. Priority is given based on GHG reductions and other factors. The SmartWay program is codified, promoting technologies to reduce petroleum consumption and emissions. Measurement protocols and promotion of SmartWay technologies are required. The EPA Administrator is required to establish a SmartWay Transport Partnership and a SmartWay Financing Program to promote efficient shipment of goods and provide funding for low-GHG technologies. Additionally, a new section is added to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act to set energy efficiency goals for gas and electric utilities. The DOE sets annual savings goals for 2012 through 2020, with objectives for years after 2020 to be established in 2018. Mid-course corrections can be made in 2014 and every ten years thereafter to increase targeted savings. DOE will establish regulations for the program and review utility reports annually to verify achieved savings. Utilities failing to meet goals face substantial civil penalties. The utility played a significant role in achieving claimed savings, but state utility commissions do not require rate adjustments for energy efficiency programs. Utilities can purchase energy savings through bilateral contracts with other utilities. There is no market for energy efficiency credits. DOE can delegate program administration to states, with reviews every four years. Industrial plant energy efficiency development is directed by DOE. DOE is directed to develop industrial plant energy efficiency certification standards and establish a monetary award program for owners and operators of electric power generation facilities. The award aims to encourage innovative means for recovering thermal energy as a byproduct of electric power generation. The DOE is directed to regulate thermal energy byproduct businesses of electric utilities and provide SEED Fund loans. Amendments to the National Energy Conservation Policy Act require competition for energy savings contracts and increase financial limits for not-for-profit hospitals. The \"Safe Climate Act\" is suggested. The Clean Air Act is amended to address global warming threats and the importance of controlling greenhouse gas emissions. The text discusses the importance of controlling greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate global warming. It outlines specific emission reduction goals for the U.S. by certain years and directs the EPA to regulate and reduce emissions from capped sources. The text outlines emission reduction goals for capped sources, including transferring emission allowances to support international deforestation reduction efforts. It establishes a process for scientific review by the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Sciences will conduct scientific reviews and prepare reports every four years on climate change science, GHG emission mitigation efforts, and global climate change initiatives. Federal agencies must address any identified shortfalls and the President must submit a plan for additional reduction efforts if targets are not met. The President must submit a plan outlining additional reduction efforts for greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, and others. The EPA can designate and revise GHGs, with a registry established for federal GHG emissions data. The enactment establishes a federal GHG emission registry, including data on emissions, fuel production/importation, and electricity for carbon-intensive industries. Reporting entities must submit data by specific deadlines, with quarterly submissions thereafter. EPA will disseminate data to states and tribes and publish online. EPA will also establish emission allowances starting in 2012, each with a unique identification number. The enactment establishes a federal GHG emission registry with unique identification numbers for emission allowances. EPA may adjust annual caps based on specified assumptions. Covered entities must have one emission allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent of GHGs emitted. Compensatory allowances are provided for activities that do not lead to emissions. The EPA establishes a federal GHG emission registry with unique identification numbers for emission allowances. Covered entities must have one emission allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent of GHGs emitted. Compliance provisions are phased in by entity, with EPA reviewing the emission threshold for relevant covered entities in 2020 and every eight years thereafter. EPA may lower the emission threshold after considering factors such as cost-effectiveness. Entities can use offset credits to meet compliance obligations, with 1.25 offsets equaling one emission allowance. In 2012, 30% of an entity's obligation can be met with offsets, increasing to 66% by 2050. Penalties are imposed for noncompliance, with entities required to pay for each missing allowance based on emissions exceeding allowances held. EPA must provide education and outreach for compliance assistance. Entities can use offset credits to meet compliance obligations, with penalties for noncompliance. Covered entities must submit allowances to cover excess emissions from the previous year. Allowances can be held by both covered and non-covered entities, with the option to retire them. Allowance transfers require written certification. Unlimited banking of emission allowances is allowed for future compliance. Entities can borrow emission allowances from the following year without interest, creating a rolling two-year compliance period. Covered entities may also borrow at interest, limited to 15% of their obligation. Entities can borrow emission allowances at interest allowances from up to five future vintage years. EPA will create a strategic reserve of 2.7 billion allowances, conducting quarterly auctions for covered entities only. Auctions have a reserve price, replenished by unsold allowances, with proceeds used to purchase international offsets. The curr_chunk describes the procedural requirements for sources subject to the Clean Air Act, including the filing of a certificate of representation and the process for multiple owners or leasing arrangements. It also outlines the conditions for selling international offsets at the strategic reserve auction and the certification process for using international allowances for compliance. Additionally, it allows EPA to modify the percentage of international offsets that covered entities can use for compliance. The curr_chunk discusses the creation of an Offsets Integrity Advisory Board by the EPA to recommend eligible offset types and evaluation methodologies for compliance. The Board will provide analyses and recommendations every five years. EPA is directed to establish a program for issuing offsets within two years, consulting with federal agencies and considering the Board's recommendations. The agency must ensure verifiability, permanence, and avoidance of negative effects for offsets, and set up an offset registry. Fees may be collected by the agency. The EPA is directed to develop a list of eligible offset project types and consider Advisory Board recommendations. Persons can petition to add or remove project types. Regulations must include project-specific standards and a process for offset reversals. Crediting periods are specified between five and 10 years, except for sequestration projects. The EPA is required to develop a list of eligible offset project types and consider Advisory Board recommendations. Offset project representatives must submit a petition with specified information for approval. EPA must respond within 90 days and establish an appeal process. A voluntary pre-approval review process will be an option for project developers. Third-party verification is required, with EPA accrediting third-parties. EPA will determine required information and schedule for verification submission. Offset issuance determinations must be made within 90 days of receiving third-party verification reports. The EPA may issue offset credits for approved projects within 90 days of receiving third-party verification reports. Offset credits are only for reductions, avoidance, or sequestration that have already occurred. EPA will assign a unique serial number to each offset credit and conduct random audits of offset projects. EPA is required to review various components of its offset program every five years and may issue offset credits for offsets issued under other programs if specific conditions are met. The EPA issues offset credits for projects meeting specific conditions, such as starting after January 1, 2001, with credits only for reductions after January 1, 2009. Projects must be verified by a state agency or third-party, and offsets cannot be used for state law compliance. Forestry projects must address concerns like biodiversity and invasive species. The EPA issues offset credits for projects meeting specific conditions, such as starting after January 1, 2001, with credits only for reductions after January 1, 2009. Projects must be verified by a state agency or third-party, and offsets cannot be used for state law compliance. Concerns for forestry projects include biodiversity, invasive species, and non-native species. Offset ownership initially lies with the entity represented by the project representative, and credits can be sold, traded, or transferred. EPA is authorized to issue international offset credits in consultation with the Department of State, under certain conditions. EPA may issue international offset credits on a sectoral basis in developing nations to ensure U.S. emissions integrity. The EPA is authorized to issue international offset credits for projects that reduce deforestation, with specific conditions and requirements outlined. The United States must be part of a bilateral or multilateral agreement with the nation hosting the offset project, and a national deforestation baseline must be established. Credits can only be issued after deforestation activities have been verified. The EPA must verify deforestation reduction before issuing credits, using various methods like ground-based inventories and remote sensing. Country-specific adjustments are required, and developing nations must demonstrate the ability to monitor carbon fluxes. Reducing deforestation is cost-effective and yields secondary benefits like biodiversity. Regulations will be created for a program to allot emission credits. The EPA is authorized to support emission reduction efforts in developing nations to reduce deforestation, aiming for a 6 billion ton reduction by 2025. Projects must meet specific standards to ensure effectiveness and accountability. The EPA is directed to establish national baselines for deforestation and develop a publicly available registry of supplemental emission reductions. A review of the program is required every four years, assessing emission reductions per participating nation and related factors. The program does not affect restrictions imposed by federal law on interactions between entities in the United States and other countries. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is tasked with regulating the cash market in emission allowances and offsets. FERC must establish regulations within 18 months to prevent fraud, market manipulation, and excessive speculation. Participants are limited to a 10% position in any regulated allowance class, with FERC having the authority to penalize violators. The President will delegate regulatory authority for the derivatives market to an appropriate agency based on recommendations from an interagency working group. The President will delegate authority to agencies to regulate markets for regulated allowance derivatives, similar to the cash market. Each designated federal agency will have enforcement authority. Amendments to the Clean Air Act include definitions and the allocation of emission allowances for reduction efforts and deforestation projects. Vintage year allowances will receive a percentage of allotments from 2012 to 2050. The program allocates varying percentages of emission allowances annually from 2026 to 2050 to meet reduction objectives. Unused allowances are auctioned the following year, with proceeds going to a Strategic Reserve Fund. EPA is directed to allocate and auction allowances, with regulations for exchanging older allowances. The EPA will establish a process for exchanging emission allowances issued before December 31, 2011, by California or the RGGI for allowances under this title. The exchange may not be one-to-one, and allowances will be deducted from the auction pool. Auctions will be held quarterly, starting by March 31, 2011, with a single-round, sealed-bid format. EPA will offer current and future vintage allowances at each auction. The EPA will conduct auctions in a single-round, sealed-bid format open to any person. Participants may not purchase more than 5% of allowances offered. EPA can revise auction design if needed. Allowance holders can request EPA to auction their allowances, with the option to set a reserve price. Foreign allowance holders from avoided deforestation projects cannot set a reserve price. EPA must implement regulations within 24 months of enactment. The EPA is required to promulgate regulations within 24 months of enactment to implement new Clean Air Act provisions. It includes a revised definition of \"stationary source\" and mandates the EPA to establish New Source Performance Standards for certain uncapped stationary sources emitting over 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually. The schedule for NSPS promulgation is not subject to judicial review, and sources of enteric fermentation are exempt. EPA must consider allowance prices when setting NSPS to ensure costs do not exceed projections. Greenhouse gases cannot be listed as criteria air pollutants. The Clean Air Act prohibits listing greenhouse gases as criteria air pollutants or hazardous air pollutants based on their climate change effects. It also restricts their inclusion in New Source Review and Title V permitting provisions. A separate cap-and-trade program is established for reducing hydrofluorocarbon emissions. The Clean Air Act establishes a cap-and-trade program for reducing hydrofluorocarbon emissions, placing 20 HFC substances in a new regulated category. Producers and importers must hold allowances for each CO2-equivalent ton of substance, with a steadily decreasing cap on allowances from 2012 to 2038. Auctions for consumption allowances begin at 20% in 2012 and increase to 100% in 2020. Only covered entities can participate in the auctions, with the remaining allowances offered for sale by the EPA. Allowances can be banked for future use, and regulations also cover substances used in motor vehicle air conditioners. EPA is required to submit a report to Congress on these regulations. The Clean Air Act establishes a cap-and-trade program for reducing hydrofluorocarbon emissions, with regulations covering substances used in motor vehicle air conditioners. EPA is required to submit a report to Congress on black carbon abatement. States are prohibited from implementing GHG emission caps that cover federally capped emissions from 2012 to 2017. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the Clean Air Act, including provisions for motor vehicle emissions, GHG controls, citizen suits for climate change, judicial review for federal agency failures, and a rebate program for energy-intensive industries. It also lists environmental and economic purposes for the amendments. The curr_chunk discusses a rebate program for gas-intensive, trade-exposed industries affected by emissions reduction costs under title VII of the Clean Air Act. Eligible companies will receive rebates based on a two-part formula and the program will be phased out over a 10-year period starting in 2021. A report on carbon leakage and program effectiveness will be submitted to Congress one year after the program's initiation. Eligible entities no longer engaged in eligible sectors will no longer receive rebates. The EPA will no longer provide rebates to companies in eligible sectors. Part 2 defines covered goods and aims to achieve environmental goals through international agreements on climate change. The President must report to Congress on the impact of Clean Air Act compliance costs on industries manufacturing covered goods by June 30, 2017. Title VII compliance is still having adverse economic and environmental effects, leading to the initiation of Part 2. This part requires individuals to submit international reserve allowances when importing covered goods into the United States. EPA will establish rules for pricing and distribution of these allowances within 24 months. The program aims to address production cost imbalances due to Clean Air Act implementation. Exemptions are provided for certain countries based on emissions levels. Grants may be awarded by the Secretary of Education. The Secretary of Education may competitively award grants to eligible partnerships for developing programs focused on emerging careers in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and climate change mitigation.

The Interagency Group will establish criteria for project selection and the Secretary of State will monitor project performance. The President is required to submit annual reports on assistance from the program. Parts 1 and 2 support assessments of vulnerabilities to climate change, development of adaptation strategies, and funding for adaptation. Part 1 establishes domestic programs with interagency coordination bodies, funding mechanisms, and reporting requirements. Part 2 addresses an international adaptation assistance program. The National Climate Change Adaptation Council, chaired by NOAA, coordinates federal agencies for assessing and adapting to climate change. A National Climate Change Program within NOAA aims to enhance federal adaptation efforts, including producing a quadrennial National Assessment on the nation's vulnerability to climate change effects. Regional Assessments and a National Synthesis are key components of the Assessment. The National Climate Change Adaptation Council, chaired by NOAA, coordinates federal agencies for assessing and adapting to climate change. It establishes a National Climate Service within NOAA to provide information on climate change effects and adaptation. Agencies must prepare detailed adaptation plans for approval within one year of each National Assessment. The National Climate Change Adaptation Council coordinates federal agencies for assessing and adapting to climate change. A National Climate Change Adaptation Fund will be established to provide financial assistance for projects reducing vulnerability to climate change effects. Federal policy aims to assist public health professionals in adjusting health systems to address climate change impacts. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a national strategy to mitigate public health impacts of climate change. The federal policy aims to assist natural resources in becoming more resilient to climate change and ocean acidification. A Program is established to achieve this goal, with the Council on Environmental Quality advising the President on the development and implementation of a Natural Resources Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. Each federal natural resource agency must produce an Adaptation Plan within one year of the Strategy. A new Natural Resources Climate Change Adaptation Panel is created to coordinate federal agencies' adaptation strategies, plans, programs, and activities. The law mandates the inclusion of heads of five additional agencies within 90 days and the development of a Natural Resources Climate Change Adaptation Strategy within two years. A Program is established to provide technical assistance, research, and tools for adaptation strategies, with funding available for states to implement plans. The law mandates the inclusion of heads of five additional agencies within 90 days and the development of a Natural Resources Climate Change Adaptation Strategy within two years. Funding from a new Natural Resource Climate Change Adaptation Fund requires states to prepare a State Natural Resources Adaptation Plan with performance measures, to be reviewed and updated every five years. The Fund directs percentages to support various agencies, governments, and programs. An International Climate Change Adaptation Program will be established within USAID to assist developing countries vulnerable to climate change. Foreign aid can be given to assist with adaptation plans, projects, investments, research, capacity building, resilience, and engagement with communities and stakeholders. The Administrator of USAID must report annually to the President and Congress on priorities, vulnerabilities, fund allocation, and cooperation with other countries and organizations. 40-60% of program funds must be distributed to international funds meeting specific criteria, with performance goals and effectiveness evaluations required."
