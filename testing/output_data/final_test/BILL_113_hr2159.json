The Harvard Graduate School of Education's report \"Pathways to Prosperity\" and national advisory groups emphasize the need to equip young adults with skills for the 21st-century workforce. Reports highlight the importance of raising student achievement in STEM fields to maintain competitiveness in the global economy. The need to raise student achievement in STEM fields is emphasized to maintain competitiveness in the global economy. The top 30 fastest growing occupations require science, technology, engineering, or mathematics skills. American students lag behind their international peers in mathematics and science performance, with too few graduating high school prepared for STEM degrees in college. Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new STEM Grant Program under Part D. This program aims to address the need to improve student achievement in STEM fields to stay competitive in the global economy. The STEM Grant Program under Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 provides grants to local educational agencies to enhance STEM education and prepare students for careers in STEM fields. To apply for a grant, the agency must partner with a STEM employer and offer dual-credit courses. The local educational agency receiving a grant under the STEM Grant Program must use the funds to partner with employers for internships, develop STEM curriculum, and collaborate with higher education institutions for dual-credit courses. The STEM Grant Program funds can be used to provide tutoring, mentoring, attend STEM events, offer after-school and summer programs for students. The STEM Grant Program funds can be used by local educational agencies to purchase education materials or equipment for STEM instruction. Agencies must provide a 50% non-Federal match, which can be in cash or in kind. They can partner with public or private entities to meet this requirement, and the Secretary may waive it if it causes financial hardship. The STEM Grant Program funds provided to local educational agencies must be used to supplement, not supplant, existing funds for authorized activities. Grant recipients can request a waiver if the matching requirement causes financial hardship. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal year 2014 and beyond. \"Part D--STEM Grant Program authorizes a grant program for local educational agencies to supplement existing funds for authorized activities, with a waiver option for financial hardship. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal year 2014 and beyond.\""
