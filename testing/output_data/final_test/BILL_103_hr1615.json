    "content": "The Act titled \"Telecommunications Drug Enforcement Act of 1993\" allows for the discontinuance of mobile radio service under court order as per Section 335 of the Communications Act of 1934. An application for an order to discontinue mobile radio service can be made by an attorney for the Government or a State law enforcement officer to a court of competent jurisdiction. The application must include the identity of the applicant and law enforcement agency, as well as a statement of facts justifying the request. An application for an order to discontinue mobile radio service can be made by an attorney for the Government or a State law enforcement officer to a court of competent jurisdiction. The application must include circumstances relied upon by the applicant, the identity of the user of the mobile radio unit, the telephone number assigned to the unit, and the electronic serial number of the unit. The court shall enter an ex parte order requiring a mobile radio services licensee to discontinue service if there is probable cause to believe the unit is being used for illegal activities. An order under this section may be issued to discontinue mobile radio service in connection with illegal activities involving controlled substances. The order must specify the identity of the user, telephone number, electronic serial number of the unit, and the effective date of service discontinuance. Additional evidence may be required by the court for the application. The court order to discontinue mobile radio service due to illegal activities must be implemented no earlier than 10 days after issuance. Customer notification must be provided within three days of the court order. The affected person has the right to seek legal remedies in Federal or State court. No liability can be imposed on mobile radio service providers for complying with the court order. The Federal Communications Commission will establish operating standards for mobile radio service licensees within 180 days of enactment. This includes minimum operating standards and cooperation with law enforcement for detecting illegal activities. Good faith reliance on a court order is a complete defense against legal action. The Federal Communications Commission will establish operating standards for mobile radio service licensees, including minimum recordkeeping requirements and procedures for verifying compliance with regulations."
