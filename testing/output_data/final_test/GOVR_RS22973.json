    "content": "The systematic violation of human rights in North Korea has been well documented, with the Bush Administration initially focusing on it before shifting towards nuclear negotiations. Congress has consistently criticized North Korea's human rights record, questioning the executive branch's approach. The Obama Administration's stance on human rights in North Korea remains unclear, despite continuing nuclear negotiations. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (H.R. 4011; P.L. 108-333) was passed to address these issues. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (H.R. 4011; P.L. 108-333) and its reauthorization in 2008 (H.R. 5834, P.L. 110-346) are key legislative actions addressing human rights in North Korea. The reauthorization bill criticizes the implementation of the original law and emphasizes human rights as a major priority in U.S. policy towards North Korea. Geopolitical sensitivities in East Asia complicate U.S. attention to North Korean human rights and refugees, with China and South Korea expressing reservations about U.S. involvement. The U.S. administration is concerned about North Korean refugees and human rights violations, with efforts to avoid instability or collapse in North Korea. Criticism of Seoul and Beijing's approach to human rights could disrupt negotiations on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons. North Korean refugees transit through other Asian countries, posing diplomatic, refugee, and security challenges. The Bush Administration criticized Pyongyang's human rights practices, but did not propose negotiations with North Korea during the Six-Party talks in 2007. The Bush Administration did not propose negotiations with North Korea over human rights during the Six-Party talks in 2007. The Six-Party Agreement called for bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea to resolve issues after the nuclear problem is settled. Some observers noted a shift in focus towards the nuclear issue after the agreement was signed in February 2007. The 108th Congress passed the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004, authorizing funding for assistance to North Korean refugees, promoting human rights and democracy, and appointing a Special Envoy. It also emphasized the importance of human rights in negotiations with North Korea and conditional humanitarian aid. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 emphasizes the distribution of food, support for radio broadcasting into North Korea, and China's obligation to provide UNHCR with access to North Koreans. Advocates see it as a message that human rights will shape U.S. policy towards North Korea, driven by the moral responsibility to stand up for those under repressive regimes. Critics fear it may strain relations with South Korea and China, hindering diplomatic unity needed for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 raised congressional interest in North Korean human rights and refugee issues, but some activities were already authorized. State Department programs and Korean-language broadcasting by Radio Free Asia and Voice of America were in place before the law. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 has led to enhanced activities, particularly in the admission of North Korean refugees for resettlement in the United States. The State Department and other executive branch bodies have taken steps to promote human rights in North Korea, with funding allocated for democracy promotion and media freedom programs. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 has led to increased activities in admitting North Korean refugees to the United States. The US government has sponsored UN resolutions condemning North Korea's human rights abuses and supported organizations like UNHCR for refugee assistance. As of January 2009, 71 North Korean refugees have been resettled in the US. The NKHRA calls for increased Korean-language broadcasts by RFA and VOA to North Korea, with the BBG currently broadcasting ten hours per day. The budget requests for FY2008 and FY2009 were $8.1 million and $8.5 million, respectively, to support the 10-hour broadcast schedule. The FY2009 budget includes $8.5 million to maintain a 10-hour broadcast schedule by the BBG. Content consists of news briefs, interviews with North Korean defectors, and international commentary on events in North Korea. The BBG aims to expand medium wave broadcast capability into North Korea. VOA and RFA are broadcast from various stations. The reauthorization bill renews funding, criticizes the executive branch's implementation pace, and reaffirms key legislation tenets. The reauthorization bill criticizes the executive branch's slow implementation pace of the original law, particularly regarding resettlements of North Korean refugees. It renews funding through 2012 for human rights and democracy programs, freedom of information initiatives, and assistance for North Korean refugees. Additional reporting requirements include U.S. efforts in processing refugees and progress towards increasing Korean language broadcasting. The role of the Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues is highlighted. The reauthorization bill emphasizes the need for a full-time Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues, criticizing the current part-time position held by Jay Lefkowitz. The bill also clarifies the Envoy's responsibilities, stating they should participate in policy planning and implementation on North Korean refugee issues. The Obama Administration has yet to appoint a new Special Envoy. Jay Lefkowitz, a public profile, was active in advocating for human rights issues, attending international conferences and testifying at congressional hearings. He raised concerns about labor practices at the Kaesong complex in North Korea. His visibility declined in 2007 during nuclear negotiations. In 2008, he criticized denuclearization talks, sparking controversy. In his final report to Congress in January 2009, Jay Lefkowitz criticized aspects of U.S. handling of refugee admissions and critiqued North Korean policies of South Korea, China, and Japan. Some argue that implementing NKHRA's refugee provisions may be counterproductive, as it could send a dangerous message to North Koreans that admission to the U.S. as a refugee is guaranteed, potentially leading to risky incursions into U.S. diplomatic missions overseas. State Department officials warn that storming U.S. facilities could result in injury or death for refugees seeking asylum. The granting of asylum status to North Korean refugees involves a complex vetting process due to the lack of official relations with the United States. Close coordination with South Korea is necessary for effective implementation of the NKHRA. Funding for assistance to North Korean refugees is challenging due to the need for discretion in reaching the vulnerable population. Refugees often hide from authorities, and regional governments avoid drawing attention to their role in transferring North Koreans. South Korea is the primary destination for North Korean refugees, with a streamlined resettlement program and support for defectors. Over 14,000 defectors have resettled in South Korea since 1953, with a faster process compared to the U.S. South Korea refrained from criticizing North Korea to foster better ties until recently. South Korea's approach towards North Korea shifted under President Lee Myung-bak in 2007, linking assistance to denuclearization progress and openly criticizing North Korea's human rights record. This new stance led to South Korea voting for UN resolutions on North Korean human rights and conditioning aid on improved distribution to avoid benefiting Pyongyang's elite. This change in policy has strained North-South relations since Lee's presidency. President Lee's approach has strained North-South relations by linking assistance to denuclearization progress and openly criticizing North Korea's human rights record. A joint statement with President Bush in August 2008 highlighted the need for progress in improving North Korea's human rights, marking the first mention of such a concern."
