    "content": "Before the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, Bosnia and Herzegovina was one of Yugoslavia's six republics with an ethnically mixed population. The rise of hardline nationalism in Serbia and Croatia posed a threat to Bosnia's unity. The secession of Slovenia and Croatia upset the balance of power, leading to conflicts between Croat forces and Serb irregulars. Bosnian Serb nationalists wanted Bosnia to remain part of a Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia, while Bosnian Croat nationalists threatened to secede if Bosnia stayed in Yugoslavia. Croat nationalists threatened secession if Bosnia remained in Yugoslavia, while Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic tried to find a compromise solution amidst pressure from Milosevic and Tudjman regimes. Izetbegovic's hand was forced by the EC's decision to grant recognition to former Yugoslav republics that held a referendum on independence. Bosnian Serb leaders warned against international recognition. In March 1992, Bosniaks and Croats voted for independence in a referendum, while Serbs boycotted. Serbian forces attacked civilians to claim ethnically mixed areas. Over 96,000 people were killed, and 2.3 million were displaced in the Bosnian War. The Bosnian War, which ended in 1995, saw fighting between Croats and Bosniaks leading to \"ethnic cleansing\" by both sides. The conflict also strengthened organized crime groups and hindered Bosnia's postwar recovery. NATO airstrikes were conducted against Bosnian Serb positions in response to civilian deaths in Sarajevo, leading to the war's conclusion. In 1995, Bosnian Serb forces were defeated, leading to a cease-fire agreement. Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian leaders met in Dayton, OH, to negotiate a peace agreement mediated by the US, EU, and Russia. The final peace agreement was signed in Paris on December 14, establishing Bosnia-Herzegovina as an internationally recognized state with two semi-autonomous entities. The Bosnia-Herzegovina peace agreement established two semi-autonomous entities: the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska. The town of Brcko separates the Republika Srpska into two parts and divides it from Serbia, making it strategically important. Brcko was directly administered by the international community and later awarded to both entities jointly as a self-governing district. Each entity has its own parliament and government with wide-ranging powers. The Bosnia-Herzegovina peace agreement established two semi-autonomous entities: the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska. Each entity has its own parliament and government with wide-ranging powers. The central government has responsibility for foreign policy, foreign trade, and monetary policy. The Federation is divided into 10 cantons, each with control over areas such as policing and education. The U.N.-appointed Office of the High Representative oversees civilian peace implementation efforts. The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) provides political guidance to the Office of the High Representative (OHR) through a Steering Board composed of key countries and institutions. The High Representative was granted \"Bonn powers\" in 1997 to enforce the peace agreement in Bosnia. A peacekeeping force, initially NATO-led and later EU-led, implements the military aspects of the accord. The United States and the EU have pushed for strengthening the Bosnian central government since 1997, citing the Dayton institutions as too cumbersome for long-term stability. Progress has been made in merging armed forces and creating central government institutions, but has often required pressure from the High Representative. Bosniak politicians have supported international efforts, while Serbian leaders have resisted. The state consolidation process in Bosnia faced setbacks in 2006 when a constitutional reform package was defeated in parliament. Efforts to restart constitutional reform in 2008 and 2009 were unsuccessful, with nationalist tones hindering progress. Another round of talks in late 2009, brokered by the US and EU, also did not lead to an agreement. After failed constitutional reform talks in late 2009, a new Bosnian central government was formed in February 2012, with Vjekoslav Bevanda as the chairman of the Council of Ministers. The political stalemate was due to disagreements between the leading Croat parties, HDZ and HDZ 1990. However, the new government's effectiveness was short-lived as political squabbling resurfaced in May 2012. The political squabbling in Bosnia resurfaced in May 2012 between two Bosniak parties, the SDA and the SDP. The SDP managed to convince Croat and Serb parties to replace the SDA in the central government, leading to criticism of weakening central government institutions and the judiciary. The Alliance for a Better Bosnia, led by a controversial business tycoon, replaced the SDA in the government. The political squabbles in Bosnia have hindered reforms and economic growth, with parliamentary majority having less significance due to ethnic group veto power. The lack of support in Republika Srpska for a central government is a major issue, with RS President Milorad Dodik accused of obstructing Bosnian governance. RS President Milorad Dodik aims to obstruct Bosnian institutions to push for Republika Srpska's independence. He criticizes foreign interference in Bosnia and supports peaceful dissolution. Despite challenges like party defeats and economic issues, Dodik's position may be weakening. In March 2011, the Federation parliament approved a new government led by the SDP, causing disputes with small Croatian parties. The legality of the government was questioned, but the High Representative overruled the Central Election Commission's decision, allowing the new government to continue working. The HDZ and HDZ 1990 did not see the new government as legitimate due to concerns about its legality and representation of Croat interests. A reshuffle in November 2012 aimed to include them in the Federation government, but President Zivko Budimir's refusal to dismiss ministers from these parties led to calls for his resignation. These political intrigues highlight deeper structural issues within the Federation government. The division of powers and bureaucratic overlap between the Federation government and the 10 canton governments in Bosnia has hindered economic development and threatens fiscal collapse. Constitutional reform at the Federation level is suggested to improve the situation and potentially lead to reforms at the central government level. Croat leaders are wary of streamlining the Federation, fearing it may give more power to Bosniaks. Some Bosnian Croats have proposed a separate Croat entity, but the international community opposes this idea. Opinion polls in Bosnia show widespread dissatisfaction with the current situation. Opinion polls in Bosnia reflect citizens' discontent with the political class and the country's direction. Despite high levels of dissatisfaction, ethnically based parties continue to dominate elections due to the Dayton system and election laws favoring such politics. Bosnia's economic growth has been hindered by a cumbersome governing structure, large government bureaucracies, and issues with organized crime and corruption. Despite these challenges, living standards improved before the global economic crisis, with real wages and GDP seeing significant increases. However, the crisis caused a drop in GDP in 2009, leading to economic stagnation in Bosnia since then. Bosnia's economy stagnated after a 3.1% GDP growth in 2009. Real GDP increased by 0.7% in 2010 and 1.3% in 2011, but fell back into recession in 2012 with a 0.5% shrink. The double-dip recession, influenced by the Eurozone crisis, negatively impacted trade, remittances, and foreign investment. Budget deficits rose, leading to unpopular cuts in veterans' benefits and government salaries to meet IMF targets. IMF provided a $522 million stand-by loan in recognition of fiscal consolidation efforts, but austerity measures may worsen the situation. Bosnia's economy stagnated after a 3.1% GDP growth in 2009, with real GDP increasing by 0.7% in 2010 and 1.3% in 2011 before falling back into recession in 2012. Unemployment in Bosnia was 28% in 2011, with youth unemployment at 57.9%. There is a debate about the future role of the international community in Bosnia, with the Peace Implementation Council eager to end direct international oversight through the OHR due to political fatigue. The High Representative has been reluctant to use his Bonn powers since 2007 due to a lack of political support. The international community aims to end direct oversight in Bosnia to encourage local leaders to take more responsibility. The closure of the OHR is tied to meeting specific objectives, including decisions on state and defense property, implementing the Brcko Final Award, ensuring fiscal sustainability, and strengthening the rule of law. This move is crucial for Bosnia to join NATO and the EU as fully sovereign states. The PIC and OHR have demanded action and legislation to strengthen the rule of law in Bosnia. The EU appointed a single representative to support the country's EU integration, potentially reducing the role of the OHR. In August 2012, the OHR office in the Brcko district was closed due to reforms and EU's desire to reduce OHR's role. OHR lifted bans on Bosnian politicians in June 2011, but many believe OHR lacks credibility and should be eliminated. Some countries, like the US, want to keep OHR until objectives are met. EU officials face persuasion to address the issue. The EU Council approved a decision in March 2011 to impose travel bans and asset freezes on individuals threatening Bosnia's sovereignty and security. EUFOR Althea, a peacekeeping force in Bosnia, has around 600 troops from various countries, with Austria, Hungary, and Turkey providing the core contingent. An \"over-the-horizon\" capability is in place for crisis situations. An \"over-the-horizon\" capability is available to support EUFOR in crisis situations. The international community is encouraging reform in Bosnia through aid, advice, and the potential for NATO and EU membership. NATO has invited Bosnia to join its Partnership for Peace program and upgrade its relationship through an \"Intensified Dialogue.\" Bosnia has been permitted to join the Membership Action Plan program, but NATO requires agreement on the registration of defense installations under the central government. The main stumbling block in Bosnia's path to NATO membership is Dodik's refusal to register military installations on RS territory as central government property. Despite efforts to join NATO, Republika Srpska's commitment is questionable. Dodik renounced his earlier support in 2012. Bosnia has 53 troops in ISAF and participates in training Afghan military police with other countries. Dodik's dedication to NATO membership is in question as he renounced his support in 2012 and advocates for demilitarization of Bosnia, which is incompatible with NATO. Public support for NATO membership in Republika Srpska is low. Bosnia has not withdrawn from the MAP process and signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU in 2008, but it has not entered into force due to failure to meet EU conditions. The EU has budgeted 111.8 million Euro for Bosnia in 2013 for political and economic reform under IPA. The EU is discussing funding for the IPA program for 2014-2020, with potential reductions due to financial difficulties. Bosnia must meet EU conditions for membership, including adopting laws on state aid, holding a new census, and amending its constitution. The EU has raised concerns about Bosnia's political system, stating that it violates human rights by allocating seats based on ethnicity. While Bosnia has made some progress in meeting EU criteria, little headway has been made on the issue of ethnic representation. Any potential agreement between ethnic parties is likely to be a technical fix rather than a genuine shift towards a less ethnically-based political system. Compliance with the ECHR will require a solution that avoids explicit references to ethnic groups but still ensures equal representation for all major ethnic groups. The EU has not made deeper constitutional reforms a condition for Bosnia's EU membership candidacy, but changes may be required during the accession process. The EU may be hesitant to propose specific details for constitutional reform at this stage, fearing opposition from certain political figures. In its October 2012 report, the European Commission criticized Bosnia's limited progress towards EU membership. The European Commission criticized Bosnia's limited progress towards EU membership, with the EU Council promising continued support. The US has supported Bosnia's integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions, but its role has declined in recent years. The Obama Administration has emphasized its close working relationship with the EU on Bosnia. The United States has provided significant aid to Bosnia, totaling nearly $2 billion between FY1993 and FY2010. Aid levels were high post-war but have gradually declined, with current aid being relatively modest. In FY2011, Bosnia received $42 million in aid for reforms, $4.491 million in military financing, $0.986 million in military training funds, and $1.25 million in nonproliferation and antiterrorism funds. In FY2012, Bosnia was expected to receive around $39 million in assistance. In FY2012, Bosnia was set to receive $39 million in assistance for political and economic reform, including funds from various accounts such as FMF, IMET, and NADR. The U.S. aid focuses on strengthening state-level institutions, supporting police organizations, improving judiciary and border controls, and creating a better regulatory environment for economic growth. For FY2013, the Administration requested $28.556 million for economic support, $6.735 million for narcotics control, $4.5 million for military financing, $1 million for military training, and $4.75 million for NADR funding. The objective of U.S. military aid in Bosnia is to improve its military capabilities and make it interoperable with NATO. Vice President Biden emphasized the need to stop nationalist rhetoric and warned of poverty and violence if Bosnia does not change its path. He supported Bosnia's integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions with a functioning central government. Biden emphasized the need for Bosnia to have a functioning central government that controls the national army, has an inclusive electoral system, and the power to negotiate with the EU. The United States will not support the closure of OHR until specific objectives are met. There have been efforts to promote talks among local leaders on reforming the Federation for more efficiency. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo, Croatia, and Albania in 2012, emphasizing US and EU goals for Bosnia to become a stable, prosperous, multiethnic democracy integrated into Euro-Atlantic organizations. She criticized Bosnian leaders for lack of progress and warned that the country risked being left behind in EU integration. In 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Bosnia and emphasized the need for the country to integrate into Euro-Atlantic organizations. She urged Bosnian leaders to resolve issues hindering their progress, warning of being left behind. The threat of Islamic extremism was highlighted by an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo in October 2011, where Mevlid Jasarevic opened fire with an AK-47. Jasarevic was arrested, and Bosnian police detained two other Islamic fundamentalists in central Bosnia. In December 2012, Mevlid Jasarevic was convicted by a Bosnian court and sentenced to 18 years in prison for the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo. The international community has reduced its direct role in Bosnia, aiming for Euro-Atlantic integration as an incentive for progress. It remains uncertain if these incentives will prompt Bosnian leaders, particularly Dodik, to change their policies. The international community aims to achieve policy objectives in Bosnia, with a key focus on avoiding widespread violence or the breakup of the country. Potential consequences of failure include endangering EUFOR, requiring a military response from the US and NATO, and potentially involving neighboring Serbia and Croatia. Increased regional instability could also impact Kosovo. The current political environment in Bosnia differs from the 1990s, with arguments that a renewed conflict is unlikely. The current political environment in Bosnia is focused on building prosperous democracies integrated with Europe, unlike the nationalist regimes of the 1990s. Bosnia's army is smaller now, with little support for violence in support of nationalist causes. Renewed conflict is most likely if the RS attempts to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The current impasse in Bosnia, caused by RS obstructionism, may destabilize the country without secession. The international community has not considered brokering a peaceful breakup despite Bosnia's state shortcomings not solely being due to the Dayton accords or Bosnian politicians. Many failures in Bosnia stem from the fact that a large minority never wanted to be part of an independent Bosnia. Bosniaks oppose partition due to being surrounded by unsympathetic neighbors, while Bosnian Serb and Croat nationalists seek union with Serbia and Croatia. The international community may feel a moral debt to Bosniaks for their suffering during the 1992-1995 war. The international community aims to avert destabilization in the Balkans by preventing the partition of Bosnia, where Bosniaks were the main victims of the 1992-1995 war. Efforts include encouraging political and economic reforms to integrate Bosnia into NATO and the EU, despite deep-rooted structural issues. NATO and the EU may consider advancing Bosnia's candidacies to help stabilize the country."
