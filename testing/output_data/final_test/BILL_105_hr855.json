    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Access to College Education (ACE) Act of 1997\". The Congress finds that tuition at 4-year public colleges and universities has increased significantly in the past 15 years, while household income and the cost of consumer goods have not risen as much. The share of schools' revenues provided by tuition has also increased. It is crucial for America's future to have a well-educated workforce for high-tech, high-wage jobs, and parents need assistance to save for their children's higher education through prepaid college tuition programs. Title X of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to establish a new part for administrative support for state prepaid tuition programs, authorizing a grant program. The Secretary will establish a grant program to support State prepaid tuition programs, with each State eligible for a single grant. States must submit an application with a State plan for offering parents the opportunity to prepay tuition at State postsecondary institutions. The State plan for prepaid tuition at State postsecondary institutions must include details on the type of plan offered, tuition and expenses covered, cost calculation method, parent payment options, fund investment, and disbursement methods. The State plan for prepaid tuition at State postsecondary institutions must include details on disbursement methods, State student aid eligibility calculation, regular actuarial projections disclosure, and investment information. An application under this section should include an agreement for regular disclosures of tuition cost projections and fund investments. The State can use grant funds for administrative expenses, office space, equipment, public disclosure, advertising, and public education on the importance of saving for higher education. States receiving grants must provide information to the Secretary to assist other States in establishing prepaid tuition programs. The Secretary may request information from prepaid tuition programs to collect and correlate data on variables like state population, number of postsecondary institutions, and program participants. Studies on prepaid college tuition programs will be collected and shared with states applying for grants to help them administer successful programs. Authorization of Appropriations: $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1998 and necessary sums for the following 3 years."
