    "content": "In cognitive psychology, humans use similarity for object categorization. This study adapts similarity notions with weak labels to improve classification performance. By incorporating intermediate losses and weak labels at multiple hierarchy levels, the approach outperforms a classification baseline by over 17% on CIFAR10 and a fine-grained classification dataset. By incorporating intermediate losses and weak labels at multiple hierarchy levels, the approach outperforms a classification baseline by over 17% on a subset of Birdsnap dataset. The importance of similarity in object categorization in humans is highlighted in cognitive psychology. Humans categorize objects based on similarity, grouping them into prototypes. This explains the fuzzy boundaries between classes, where new objects may be similar to multiple prototypes. For example, a dolphin, while technically a mammal, visually resembles a fish, leading to misclassification. Research suggests that similarity should play a central role in object classification in humans. Image classification in computer vision has shown remarkable progress, achieving superhuman performance on multiple datasets using softmax-based loss functions and one-hot labels. Despite assumptions of disjoint and equally dissimilar classes, state-of-the-art models continue to use cross-entropy loss. Ensembles of image classification models produce soft labels that challenge these assumptions. Ensembles of image classification models produce soft labels that define a rich similarity structure over the data. Can similarity-based metrics improve classification performance in convolutional neural networks? Previous work has explored this question in various applications, including metric learning, clustering, and hierarchical classification. Some methods, like using a contrastive loss for end-to-end clustering with weak labels, show promising results on simpler datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10. However, these approaches may not scale well to more complex datasets. A new loss function called magnet loss has been proposed to learn a representational space where distance corresponds to similarity, enabling effective clustering and performance improvements. In this work, a contrastive loss is used to enhance the classification performance of randomly initialized convolutional neural networks on fine-grained classification tasks by improving the model's understanding of similarity. The approach aims to address the challenge of learning a good representation versus finding a mapping between existing representations and labels. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of teaching a model different measures of similarity in a hierarchical class structure. It highlights the need for capturing both intra-class and inter-class similarities at various levels of the hierarchy. However, it points out that reducing similarity to a single value across all levels can lead to biased classification and poor performance. The curr_chunk discusses overcoming limitations in capturing similarity levels by applying an intermediate pairwise contrastive loss at different network levels. This allows for encoding hierarchical information without the need for an explicit hierarchy. The evaluation of representations learned by a clustering algorithm is also addressed. The curr_chunk proposes evaluating clustering representations by using them as a \"warm start\" for classification. It suggests using a contrastive loss in a convolutional neural network to learn similarity across labels and using the accuracy of a model pre-trained for clustering and fine-tuned for classification as an evaluation metric. The curr_chunk discusses using pairwise contrastive losses in a model pre-trained for clustering and fine-tuned for classification to evaluate clustering algorithms. It focuses on learning complex invariances for image classification and using weak labels in the form of pairwise relationships. The curr_chunk discusses using Kullback-Leibler divergence and hinge loss in a pairwise contrastive loss formulation for encoding similarity levels in network representations. A margin value of two is found effective, and different ways of applying the loss to achieve this goal are explored. This is part of evaluating clustering algorithms in a model pre-trained for clustering and fine-tuned for classification, focusing on learning complex invariances for image classification with weak labels in the form of pairwise relationships. In the context of evaluating clustering algorithms in a pre-trained model for image classification with weak labels, different variants of applying intermediate losses at various levels of the network are explored. This includes applying contrastive-loss at the penultimate layer and using weak labels based on fine-grained and coarse-grained distinctions in different network layers. The network is augmented with a skip layer to handle contradicting losses between instance pairs. To improve network training efficiency, a skip layer is added around the second-to-last layer for applying coarse-grained loss. This approach provides additional information without affecting subsequent layers directly. The concept is demonstrated on AlexNet and a variant of LeNet with three fully-connected layers. Pairwise constraints are efficiently handled by feeding softmax outcomes and similarity constraints to a contrastive loss function, eliminating the need for redundant data passes in a Siamese network formulation. The contrastive loss function efficiently handles pairwise constraints within a mini-batch, extending to multiple layers with minimal overhead. PyTorch 2 is used for implementation, evaluating on CIFAR10 with LeNet and Birdsnap34 with AlexNet. Birdsnap34 is a subset of Birdsnap dataset with 34 classes. In this work, a fine-grained classification dataset with 500 classes and over 40,000 images is annotated using the scientific classification of each bird. A 34-class subset, Birdsnap34, is curated to address the challenge of using a pairwise loss with a large number of classes. The dataset used in the study, referred to as Birdsnap34, consists of 2982 training images and 158 test images divided into 34 fine-grained and 18 coarse-grained classes. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, purity, and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). The experiments involve training each model for a fixed number of epochs and reporting the top performing results out of 5 runs. Details on parameters and setups are available in Appendix B. The study evaluates representations learned by clustering loss as a warm start from classification training. Using LeNet on CIFAR10 and AlexNet on Birdsnap34, the Hungarian algorithm is employed to assess clustering accuracy. Results show that applying the loss to the final layer in CIFAR10 almost matches classification performance, but this pattern does not hold in the more complex Birdsnap34 dataset. The study explores the impact of applying clustering loss in machine learning models. Results suggest that while applying the loss to the final layer in CIFAR10 aligns with classification performance, this pattern does not hold in the more complex Birdsnap34 dataset. The experiment investigates the potential of applying pairwise losses at different levels of the network to improve clustering outcomes. In this experiment, two variants of LeNet and AlexNet are trained using the pairwise contrastive loss at different layers. Performance on CIFAR10 remains consistent across all settings, but significant improvements are seen on Birdsnap34 for the clustering models with the intermediate loss version. However, this improvement does not translate to classification accuracy. Previous work has shown that adding structure to the embedding space can validate its integrity and improve outcomes. Adding a hierarchical-label-based contrastive loss to LeNet and AlexNet variants C and D improves classification performance, as shown in experimental results. Performance on CIFAR10 remains consistent, while there is a significant spike in performance for Birdsnap34 with AlexNet C and D. This enhancement is attributed to the hierarchical structure's ability to improve embedding spaces. The dataset Birdsnap34 shows a spike in performance for AlexNet C and D, exceeding classification metrics. The hierarchical labels in the dataset contribute to learning good representations. The choice of hierarchy can impact performance, with AlexNet C outperforming AlexNet D, which is unexpected. Further investigation is planned to understand this discrepancy. Clustering networks were tested for sensitivity towards network size by doubling the number of filters and fully-connected layers in AlexNet. The modified networks, denoted with a \"Double\" suffix, showed improved clustering and classification performance compared to baseline models. However, AlexNet C variant outperformed the double capacity network, highlighting the effectiveness of weak labels and intermediate losses in achieving better results. In this work, the effectiveness of weak labels and intermediate losses in improving image classification models is demonstrated. The use of similarity-based losses as a warm start boosts performance, especially when applying a pairwise contrastive loss to intermediate layers. Training with hierarchical labels yields the highest performance, surpassing models with more parameters. This approach extends performance over complex datasets without increasing neural network capacity. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of weak labels and intermediate losses in enhancing image classification models. Using similarity-based metrics as a warm start improves performance, particularly with pairwise contrastive loss. Training with hierarchical labels achieves the highest performance, surpassing models with more parameters. Future work includes expanding the approach to the entire Birdsnap dataset and other fine-grained classification datasets, as well as conducting further analysis on the quality of learned embedding spaces. The study aims to improve classification tasks by using clustering representations as a warm start, particularly with the CIFAR10 and Birdsnap34 datasets. Preprocessing steps for CIFAR10 involve converting images to YUV format and normalizing channels, while for Birdsnap34 dataset, further experiments are conducted. The study focuses on enhancing classification tasks by utilizing clustering representations as a warm start, specifically with CIFAR10 and Birdsnap34 datasets. For CIFAR10, images are converted to YUV format and channels are normalized. For Birdsnap34, standard normalization is performed using mean and standard deviations for R, G, and B channels."
