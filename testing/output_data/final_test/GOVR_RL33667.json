    "content": "Presidential signing statements are official pronouncements issued by the President when signing a bill into law. They are used to interpret statutory language, assert constitutional objections, and announce how the law will be administered. This practice has sparked controversy, especially during the George W. Bush Administration, due to the increasing use of signing statements to challenge congressional enactments. The George W. Bush Administration sparked debate over signing statements, with the American Bar Association criticizing them as undermining the rule of law and separation of powers. However, there are no inherent constitutional or legal issues with signing statements themselves. The focus should be on the assertions of presidential authority and executive actions related to the laws in question. The report focuses on the use of signing statements by recent administrations, particularly George W. Bush and Barack Obama. There is no explicit constitutional provision for signing statements, but Presidents have issued them since the Monroe Administration. The key issue is the view of presidential authority governing the administration's actions. Presidents have issued signing statements since the Monroe Administration, with little constitutional or legal support for constraints on the President's ability to issue such statements. The first controversy arose in 1830 when President Jackson objected to an appropriations bill related to road examinations and surveys. President Tyler also expressed doubts about the constitutionality of a bill regarding congressional district apportionment in 1842. The use of signing statements by Presidents has evolved over time, with early Presidents like Polk and Pierce apologizing for their use, noting it departed from traditional practices. President Grant also acknowledged the unusual nature of signing statements in 1875. While signing statements were rare in the 19th century, they became more common by 1950, with President Truman issuing nearly 16 per year on average. The use of signing statements to voice constitutional objections to acts of Congress has increased over the past 60 years, starting during the Reagan Administration. President Reagan significantly expanded the use of signing statements, issuing 250 of them, with 34% objecting to statutory provisions. Reagan aimed to establish signing statements as part of the legislative history of enactments. The use of signing statements to establish them as part of legislative history and persuade courts to consider them in judicial rulings. Attorney General Edwin Meese III entered an agreement with West Publishing Company for inclusion in legislative histories. This strategy saw success in two Supreme Court cases during this time period. The Court has challenged the constitutionality of congressional practices like legislative vetoes and provisions of the Gramm-Rudman Deficit Reduction Act. While signing statements have been cited as constitutional presidential instruments, they were not relied upon significantly by the Court. The Reagan Administration faced a significant conflict over a presidential signing statement accompanying the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, where the President objected to provisions delegating powers to the Comptroller General. The Court has not heavily relied on signing statements in its decisions. President Reagan objected to a provision in the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 that prohibited the award of government contracts during Comptroller General investigations. The Office of Management and Budget instructed agencies not to cooperate with the Government Accountability Office's efforts to implement the act. A judicial ruling in 1985 upheld the agencies' actions, impacting contractors. The Administration of President George H. W. Bush continued to use signing statements to expand presidential powers, issuing 228 statements, with 47% raising constitutional or legal objections. Deputy Attorney General William P. Barr identified 10 categories of legislative actions as constitutionally problematic, leading to objections from the Administration. The Bush I Administration used signing statements to protect presidential authority under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, objecting to provisions in bills that exceeded Congress's appointment authority. President Bush declared certain appointee requirements as unconstitutional and stated he would not enforce them. President Bush objected to certain appointee requirements in bills, declaring them unconstitutional and refusing to enforce them. He directed the Attorney General to prepare legislation to bring the act into compliance with the Constitution. Congress passed a bill to remedy the challenged provisions. Additionally, President Bush signed the Dayton Heritage Preservation Act of 1992 but objected to language directing appointments based on local officials' recommendations, citing noncompliance with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. President Clinton, like his predecessors, utilized signing statements to assert presidential prerogatives, issuing 381 during his administration. This approach was in line with the philosophies of the Reagan and Bush I Administrations, despite potential differences in policy aims. President Clinton used signing statements to assert presidential prerogatives, issuing 381 during his administration. Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger supported the use of signing statements to make legal pronouncements and asserted the President's authority to refuse to enforce unconstitutional statutes. The Dellinger memorandum supported the President's authority to resist unconstitutional provisions but advised that if the President believes the Supreme Court would uphold a provision as constitutional, he should execute the statute. The President has the authority to decline to execute a statute if he determines it violates the Constitution and believes the Court would agree. The memorandum advises weighing the effect on constitutional rights and executive authority when deciding to refuse to enforce a law. Some encroachments may not be justiciable. The memorandum advised the President to protect the constitutional role of the presidency by refusing to enforce laws that violate the Constitution. President Clinton's signing statements often included broad constitutional pronouncements similar to previous administrations, asserting his authority to recommend legislative measures and supervise his subordinates. President Clinton, like his predecessor, guarded presidential appointment prerogatives and objected to provisions he saw as impinging on executive authority. In a statement with the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1997, he objected to a provision requiring the designation of commission members from persons recommended by local officials or organizations, citing the Appointments Clause. Clinton directed the Secretary of Transportation to disregard this provision. President Clinton expressed concerns about the structural arrangements and limitations on the Secretary of Energy's control within the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) while signing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. The act established the NNSA as a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy to oversee nuclear weapons laboratories. President Clinton raised concerns about the limitations on the Secretary of Energy's control over the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) while signing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. He objected to the isolation of NNSA personnel from department officials, restrictions on the Secretary's authority, uncertainty regarding environmental law compliance, loss of authority over classified programs, and creation of redundant support functions. President Clinton expressed concerns about the limitations on the Secretary of Energy's control over the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) while signing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. He directed the Secretary to assume the duties of the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security to address perceived deficiencies and mitigate risks to the chain of command. The President indicated that a nominee for Under Secretary for Nuclear Security may not be submitted until Congress takes action to remedy identified deficiencies and harmonize authorities. President Clinton's statement on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 directed the Secretary of Energy to assume the duties of the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security to address deficiencies. This statement was unusually direct, outlining specific actions to vitiate objectionable provisions, as noted by Professor Philip J. Cooper. The Administration of George W. Bush also used signing statements to voice constitutional objections. The Bush II Administration used signing statements to voice constitutional objections and assert presidential prerogatives aggressively towards Congress and the judiciary, generating controversy. President Bush issued 161 signing statements, sparking debate over the use of this presidential instrument. During the Bush II Administration, President Bush issued 161 signing statements, with 79% containing constitutional challenges or objections, compared to 18% during the Clinton Administration. These statements included objections to over 1,000 distinct provisions of law, sparking controversy over presidential prerogatives. President Bush used signing statements to assert his constitutional authority over the executive branch, citing reasons such as protecting national security and the deliberative processes of the Executive. This approach sparked controversy over presidential prerogatives. President Bush's signing statements, used to assert his constitutional authority, raised controversy over presidential prerogatives. The substance of his statements did not differ significantly from those of Presidents Reagan or Clinton, as they mainly objected to perceived encroachments on executive authority. Bush often stated he would interpret provisions to avoid constitutional concerns and sometimes declared compliance \"as a matter of comity.\" Professor Philip J. Cooper categorized President Bush's constitutional objections into 17 categories, including challenges to presidential authority over foreign affairs, objections to requirements for submitting proposals to Congress, and concerns about disclosure or reporting requirements. The Bush II Administration frequently issued signing statements to assert the President's power in these areas. The Bush II Administration frequently issued signing statements challenging disclosure or reporting requirements, conditions on executive appointments, and legislative veto provisions, asserting the President's authority. President Bush emphasized the unitariness of the executive branch and asserted sole presidential authority. President Bush's Administration exerted significant control over agency rulemaking, executive orders, and the release of information, including internal deliberations. The signing statements were used to assert the Administration's broad view of presidential prerogatives and to enhance presidential authority. The Bush II Administration used signing statements to assert broad presidential authority and control over executive decision-making, challenging numerous provisions to alter the conception of presidential authority across branches of government. The statements lacked specific constitutional rationales and often made vague assertions of executive power, making it difficult to predict potential conflicts in law implementation. The Obama Administration, like its predecessors, has used signing statements to voice constitutional objections to congressional enactments or interpret ambiguous laws. This practice aims to establish and reinforce presidential authority by objecting to perceived congressional encroachment. The Obama Administration has used signing statements to assert constitutional objections to enacted statutes with less frequency than prior administrations. President Obama issued a memorandum outlining the new policy on signing statements, acknowledging their potential for abuse but stating they serve a legitimate function when based on well-founded constitutional objections. He aimed to curb prior abuses and address common objections to their use. The Obama Administration established principles for signing statements, aiming to communicate constitutional objections early in the legislative process, base objections on well-founded interpretations, specify objections clearly, and seek advice from the Attorney General before disregarding statutes based on signing statements. The Obama Administration has asserted constitutional objections to enacted statutory provisions in signing statements, citing infringements on the President's authority in foreign affairs, as Commander in Chief, and violations of the Appointments Clause. This represents a departure from previous administrations, but the types of objections issued have been similar. The Obama Administration has objected to legislative provisions in signing statements, focusing on the President's relationship with Congress and separation of powers. These objections often relate to Congress's authority to obtain information from the executive branch, with some references to executive privilege as a legal justification. For example, in signing the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009, the President referenced a provision prohibiting the use of funds to pay federal employees who interfere. The President objected to legislative provisions in signing statements, asserting his authority over communications between federal employees and Congress. He also emphasized the protection of privileged and confidential information in certain situations. President Obama objected to provisions in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, stating that the Administration would interpret them to not require the disclosure of privileged information. He has consistently used signing statements to challenge limitations on his discretion regarding individuals. The Obama Administration objected to restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees, citing separation of powers concerns and hindrance to executive branch authority. President Obama used signing statements to interpret restrictions in a way that avoids constitutional conflicts, departing from the Bush II Administration's emphasis on the unitary executive. Obama's statements did not assert sole presidential authority over his Administration like Bush's did. President Obama's administration did not use signing statements to promote the unitary executive theory of presidential control. However, Obama did object to a provision in the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 that he felt infringed on his authority to oversee the executive branch. Obama issued a signing statement objecting to pay restrictions, stating they would impede his ability to receive advice from White House staff. The statement emphasized his authority to supervise the executive branch and obtain advice, arguing that legislative attempts to limit his powers violate the separation of powers. The Administration would interpret the provision to not undermine the President's constitutional responsibilities. These objections were also raised regarding similar provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012. The President's signing statement on the Appropriations Act of 2012 raised concerns about limitations on his ability to receive advice and supervise the executive branch. The controversy surrounding signing statements has led to calls for restrictions or the right for Congress to challenge them in court. However, the legal and constitutional issues involved may not fully consider the historical use and pragmatic concerns of signing statements. There is a long history of presidential issuance of signing statements, which may indicate refusal to enforce a provision believed to be unconstitutional. However, objections in signing statements may not have substantive legal effect, especially if the President opposed the provision. This is supported by the analysis in Dacosta v. Nixon. The President's signing statements, while not legally binding, may indicate refusal to enforce laws deemed unconstitutional. Despite the Take Care Clause imposing a duty on the President to ensure compliance with laws, presidents have historically declared their intention to disregard laws they believe are unconstitutional. The Take Care Clause imposes a duty on the President to ensure officials obey Congress's instructions, without granting the authority to override congressional enactments. The Court's rejection of the government's argument emphasized the President's obligation to faithfully execute laws, not to control legislation. The Court has consistently rejected the idea that the President has the power to forbid the execution of laws, emphasizing that the President's duty is to faithfully execute laws passed by Congress. Despite this, the executive branch has maintained that the President can choose not to enforce certain laws. The Department of Justice has argued that the President can refuse to enforce laws deemed unconstitutional, citing legal precedents such as Myers v. United States and Justice Jackson's concurrence in Youngstown. This stance is supported by the Dellinger Memo, which highlights the President's authority to act contrary to statutory commands. The Department of Justice argues that the President can refuse to enforce unconstitutional laws, citing legal precedents like Myers v. United States and Justice Jackson's concurrence in Youngstown. However, it is unclear if these arguments would hold up under judicial scrutiny, as the Court in Myers recognized limits to the President's authority under the Take Care Clause. The Department of Justice argues that the President can refuse to enforce unconstitutional laws, citing legal precedents like Myers v. United States and Justice Jackson's concurrence in Youngstown. However, Justice Jackson's concurrence in Youngstown and Justice Scalia's concurrence in Freytag do not provide substantive analysis on the President's authority to decline to enforce the law. Scalia's concurrence in Freytag does not offer substantive analysis supporting the President's refusal to comply with the law. The Court's cases suggest the President must enforce acts of Congress under the Take Care Clause. The President should use his veto power if he deems a bill unconstitutional, as per Youngstown. Competing viewpoints exist on this issue, so it is inconclusive whether the President lacks any authority to refuse enforcement. The President's authority to refuse to enforce laws deemed unconstitutional is of constitutional importance, but signing statements themselves have little legal force. If a President's action violates laws or the Constitution, issuing a signing statement does not change the illegality. This has led to the belief that signing statements are used by administrations not to outright reject laws. The use of signing statements by administrations is not to reject laws but to assert the President's view of executive authority. While some objections in signing statements are valid, many issued by the Bush II Administration were non-substantive or general assertions of executive power. The use of signing statements by administrations is to assert executive authority, especially in foreign affairs legislation. Recent Presidents have raised constitutional objections in signing statements, such as President George W. Bush's objections to the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003. The President's signing statement challenges multiple provisions of a bill, asserting constitutional authority in foreign affairs and as Commander in Chief. This approach is typical of the Bush II Administration, raising objections across various constitutional principles. The broad nature of the remarks makes it hard to pinpoint specific implementation objections, but it emphasizes the President's authority in diplomatic conduct and provision of services for government personnel abroad. President Bush and the Obama Administration have both issued signing statements objecting to congressional encroachments on the President's constitutional authority in foreign affairs. Bush's objections focused on separation of powers concerns and national security, while Obama's objections were more specific to congressional attempts to direct negotiations with foreign states. Both administrations emphasized the President's authority in diplomatic conduct and government services abroad. President Obama's signing statement in 2009 objected to provisions in the Supplemental Appropriations Act that directed the Secretary of the Treasury to order U.S. representatives to take specific policy positions in international financial institutions. Obama asserted that this would interfere with his constitutional authority in foreign relations and stated that he would not be limited in engaging in diplomacy or negotiations. The Supreme Court has ruled against legislative attempts to extend the executive's foreign affair prerogatives. The Supreme Court has limited legislative attempts to extend congressional power into the executive branch's core functions. Presidential signing statements asserting broad executive authority in foreign affairs may not fully acknowledge Congress's substantial authority in this area. While the President has some exclusive powers in foreign affairs, Congress also has significant authority to set policy objectives and approve international agreements. Executive privilege is also a factor to consider. Executive privilege has been used as the constitutional basis for presidential signing statements, allowing the President to withhold information that could impact foreign relations, national security, or the Executive's duties. President Obama did not mention executive privilege in his signing statements but objected to provisions requiring information disclosure to Congress. The Obama Administration objected to provisions requiring information disclosure to Congress through signing statements, without explicitly invoking executive privilege. These statements asserted the executive branch's power without providing specific objections or analysis of how the requirements might affect executive authority. The executive branch can withhold documents from Congress, but historical precedents show that Congress can impose reporting requirements. The President can claim privilege for national security reasons, as seen in United States v. Nixon. The privilege is not absolute and can be overcome with a showing of need. The President's authority to protect military, diplomatic, or national security secrets is greater than his power to protect executive communications, as recognized in previous court decisions. Judicial deference to the executive does not apply to access by Congress, as shown in United States v. American Telephone and Telegraph Co. The court in AT&T case rejected the notion that disputes over national security information were beyond the court's jurisdiction, leaving open the possibility for judicial resolution. The judiciary can resolve national security disputes if Congress and the executive branch cannot agree. The President's authority to protect executive communications and national security information is not absolute, as Congress also has the power to investigate. Concerns about executive privilege are not supported by a definitive right to withhold information from Congress. Signing statements have been used by recent Presidents to object to reporting requirements imposed by Congress, but these statements lack legal basis regarding Congress's authority to compel information. Congress has a history of imposing direct reporting requirements on executive branch officials, dating back to the first Congress. Before the President's authority over the executive branch budget process was established in 1921, agencies submitted their annual budget requests directly to Congress. The Supreme Court has recognized the validity of Congress's authority to compel and receive information from the executive branch. Recent Presidents have been active in issuing signing statements objecting to bills passed by Congress that impose a legislative veto over executive branch actions. This demonstrates an attempt to assert broad presidential power and sensitize executive personnel to the President's wishes, rather than a definitive refusal to enforce congressional enactments. Presidents have issued signing statements objecting to legislative veto provisions in bills passed by Congress, despite the Supreme Court invalidating the use of legislative veto in INS v. Chadha. President George W. Bush objected to such provisions in approximately 47 signing statements, citing violations of separation of powers principles outlined in Chadha. President Bush and President Obama have both issued signing statements objecting to legislative veto provisions in bills passed by Congress, citing violations of separation of powers principles outlined in Chadha. President Bush objected to approximately 47 signing statements, while President Obama continued the practice by objecting to provisions in the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009. The Administration argued for the authority of officers to spend or reallocate funds without approval from congressional committees, citing Chadha. While signing statements asserting executive power may be concerning, objections to legislative vetoes are supported by Supreme Court precedent. The continued practice of imposing such requirements by Congress reflects the dynamic between objections and assertions of authority in signing statements. Despite concerns over constitutionality, there has been little complaint voiced. Despite concerns over the unconstitutionality of legislative veto provisions, there has been little complaint voiced. Congress persists in passing bills with these provisions to leverage informal compliance from executive agencies, signaling that non-compliance may lead to difficulties in the legislative, oversight, or budgetary processes. A presidential signing statement objecting to a legislative veto provision serves as a response to perceived challenges to congressional will. The objection to a legislative veto provision in a signing statement is a response to perceived encroachment on executive branch prerogatives and a declaration of support for affected agencies. These statements, while lacking legal force, are used by administrations to assert broad authority, raising questions about their impact on the balance of power between branches of government. The increase in signing statements during the Reagan Administration aimed to influence judicial reliance on them, but courts have not incorporated them as hoped. Attorney General Edwin Meese pushed for their inclusion in legislative histories to guide future statutory interpretation. The Reagan Administration's use of signing statements did not have the intended impact on judicial interpretation due to constitutional constraints. While the Constitution allows the President to note objections when vetoing a bill, there is no requirement for explaining approval reasons. This lack of symmetry hinders courts from giving weight to signing statements in the same way as veto messages. The use of presidential signing statements should be discounted when they conflict with congressional explanations that have traditionally enjoyed judicial deference. Congressional intent should depend on the actions of both houses, and since Congress has no opportunity to act in response to interpretations in signing statements, there is less support for courts to rely on them. The use of presidential signing statements may not be reliable for courts to interpret congressional intent, as they conflict with traditional congressional explanations that have judicial deference. The President cannot have line item veto authority, and granting such power through signing statements could give the President excessive power in relation to Congress. This dynamic raises concerns about the impact of signing statements on the executive branch's interaction with Congress. The President's signing statements, when developed in collaboration with Congress and reflecting compromise negotiations, can provide valuable support to congressional explanations. While courts do not typically view signing statements as legislative history, they do impact agency actions and receive deference in interpretation. Courts grant deference to agency interpretations of statutes, not to signing statements by the President. Signing statements may influence agency implementation but are not measured against statutory requirements. They are akin to informal agency actions and have limited persuasive power. Courts have not heavily relied on signing statements in their decisions. The Supreme Court has shown little regard for presidential signing statements in various cases, such as Bowsher v. Synar, INS v. Chadha, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, and U.S. v Stevens. The American Bar Association Task Force criticizes signing statements for bypassing the constitutional veto process. The President's use of signing statements to avoid vetoing bills has been criticized for expanding presidential power beyond constitutional limits. However, it is rare for a President to outright refuse to enforce provisions, with concerns in signing statements often being vague. The concerns raised in signing statements are often vague and do not clearly specify the nature of the objection or potential conflicts. The interpretation of congressional enactments is not always black and white due to inherent ambiguity in the text, allowing for different interpretations. A signing statement does not have the same effect as a veto, as a bill signed by the President retains its legal effect regardless of any statements made. The legal effect of a bill signed by the President remains intact, regardless of any objections raised in a signing statement. This can be subject to interpretation by the courts and oversight by Congress. Signing statements objecting to specific provisions can be seen as akin to a line-item veto, which was deemed unconstitutional in Clinton v. New York. The use of signing statements by President Bush reflects an expansive view of presidential authority, potentially leading to a constitutional conflict. While similar to a line-item veto, these objections may obscure the underlying issue and could be subject to judicial or congressional review. President Bush used signing statements to strengthen executive authority, not as a line-item veto. Critics have not found instances where the statements were followed through on. The Government Accountability Office identified six provisions of law addressed in the statements. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified six provisions of law in signing statements that were not executed as written by the executive branch. GAO reviewed 11 signing statements accompanying appropriations acts for FY2006, identifying 160 specific provisions. Of the six provisions not executed as written, three were due to agency failures to seek committee approval, one from the Department of Defense's failure to include budget justifications, and one from a congressional inquiry response by the DOD. The GAO identified instances of noncompliance with statutory provisions in signing statements, including delays in congressional inquiry responses and failure to relocate checkpoints as directed. Additionally, there were cases where provisions restricting fund usage were ignored, such as sending officials to participate in U.N. bodies chaired by Iran. The GAO report identified instances of noncompliance with statutory provisions in signing statements, including delays in congressional inquiry responses and failure to relocate checkpoints as directed. There were also cases where provisions restricting fund usage were ignored, such as sending officials to participate in U.N. bodies chaired by Iran. While these examples may support the idea of presidential signing statements as a form of line item veto, the GAO report stated that agency noncompliance could not be directly attributed to the President's signing statements. The report did not provide specific evidence that departments and agencies were relying on signing statements to justify their noncompliance. The GAO report did not find evidence that presidential signing statements influenced noncompliance by departments and agencies. The report highlighted instances of noncompliance with statutory provisions but did not directly link them to signing statements. The examples cited in the report involved legislative vetoes rejected by the Supreme Court, supporting both signing statements and executive noncompliance. The DOD's justification for noncompliance with budget submission was due to unpredictable costs from insurgent activity, not influenced by signing statements. GAO report shows agency failures to meet deadlines, regardless of signing statements. The CBP justified noncompliance with a congressional directive by citing Border Patrol mission requirements and logistical constraints in the Tucson sector. Checkpoints were occasionally shut down briefly to comply with appropriations act provisions. The CBP justified noncompliance with a congressional directive by citing Border Patrol mission requirements and logistical constraints in the Tucson sector, mirroring the President's signing statement. The GAO report lacks details to evaluate CBP's justifications for noncompliance, suggesting reasons not directly linked to signing statements. Some argue that issuing signing statements is beneficial as it alerts Congress to provisions disregarded by the executive branch, allowing for oversight and assertion of congressional prerogatives. Congressional interest in protecting its institutional prerogatives may lead to a reaction against expansive presidential authority expressed in various ways. Recent Presidents have used various tools to exert control over executive personnel and interactions with Congress, including refusals to provide information to congressional and legislative branch agencies. President Bush's claims of executive authority aim to establish expansive presidential powers. While no bills to restrict signing statements have been introduced in the 112th Congress, three bills in the 111th Congress aimed to limit their use, but none significantly constrained the President's ability to issue them. The Congressional Lawmaking Authority Protection Act of 2009 limits the President's ability to issue signing statements, but it may not pose a significant obstacle. Executive branch agencies may still make contemporaneous declarations. The Congressional Lawmaking Authority Protection Act of 2009 restricts the President's use of signing statements, but it may not fully prevent them. The bill does not prohibit the President from issuing memoranda or other declarations for agency guidance. Additionally, a similar bill was introduced in previous Congresses, and there is another bill, S. 875, that aims to prevent courts from relying on presidential signing statements to interpret Acts of Congress. The Congressional Lawmaking Authority Protection Act of 2009 aims to restrict the President's use of signing statements. It allows Congress to participate in cases involving the constitutionality of Acts of Congress with signing statements. Congress can pass a resolution clarifying intent or findings of fact in such cases. The potential impact of prohibiting courts from considering signing statements is uncertain. The Presidential Signing Statements Act of 2009 aimed to increase public awareness and access to presidential signing statements. It required the President to transmit any signing statement declaring intention to disregard unconstitutional provisions to Congress. However, there is little evidence that signing statements have influenced judicial rulings, and the impact of allowing clarifying resolutions is uncertain. Similar bills were introduced in the 110th Congress. The bill would require the President to send any signing statement declaring a provision unconstitutional to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register. It also mandates a high-level official to testify before the House or Senate Judiciary Committees on the meaning and justification of such statements. However, concerns arise over the restriction on executive privilege and Congress's authority. Similar bills were introduced in previous Congresses to limit the impact of signing statements. The proposed legislation, H.J.Res. 87 and H.J.Res. 89, aimed to limit the effect of signing statements by requiring the President to notify Congress if any provision of a law would not be enforced. However, the language in signing statements is often vague, making it difficult to determine if a concrete decision to not enforce a law has been made. Additionally, S. 3731 also addressed this issue. S. 3731 aimed to give Congress legal standing to challenge signing statements and prevent courts from relying on them as a source of authority. The use of executive authority in signing statements can impact Congress by discouraging interaction and discounting constitutional prerogatives. Legislative proposals may fail to address this issue, as focusing on limiting challenges in signing statements may not address the broader issue of presidential authority. Presidential signing statements have a historical background and are used to assert executive authority. While the Obama Administration reduced their use, they still serve as a tool for the President to raise constitutional objections to enacted statutes. Presidential signing statements assert executive authority and raise constitutional objections to enacted statutes. Recent administrations, like President George W. Bush's, have used signing statements to establish broad assertions of authority as a constitutional norm, aiming to leverage power away from Congress. The focus should be on the substantive actions taken to establish presidential authority, rather than just the issuance of signing statements. A robust oversight regime focusing on substantive executive action could allow Congress to assert its constitutional prerogatives and ensure compliance with its enactments, rather than relying on vague signing statements to establish presidential authority."
