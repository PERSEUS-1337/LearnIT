    "content": "There are over 12 million refugees worldwide, part of close to 20 million \"people of concern.\" The global trend shows stabilization in refugee numbers, but population movements are still influenced by external events. U.S. aid to refugees is driven by bipartisan humanitarian tradition and concerns about instability. Congress faces the challenge of responding to refugee needs while honoring American values. This report examines the response to refugee needs by Congress and the executive branch, as well as the role of the international community through UNHCR. UNHCR was established in 1950 to lead international action for refugee protection. UNHCR was established in 1950 to implement the 1951 Convention relating to refugees, defining their status and the international community's responsibilities. The definition of a refugee was initially limited to events in Europe before 1951, but later expanded to include persecution based on race, religion, ethnicity, social group, or political opinion. Refugee organizations in the 1950s and 1960s defined refugees as those fleeing persecution. Refugee emergencies were usually addressed by humanitarian relief agencies. The 1951 Convention on refugees was expanded with the 1967 Protocol, allowing for assistance to asylum seekers, returnees, and internally displaced persons. The UNHCR helps various groups, known as \"people of concern,\" and the number of refugees in camps has been increasing due to global conflicts. The number of displaced persons worldwide has been steadily increasing due to conflicts post-Cold War. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) now outnumber traditional refugees, with approximately 19.8 million people of concern in January 2002, including refugees, returnees, asylum seekers, and IDPs. UNHCR estimates an additional 20-25 million may be displaced for political reasons. The number of refugees and displaced persons in Africa has increased significantly since 1989, with over six million individuals affected today. The rise is attributed to ethnic conflicts post-Cold War and internal political disagreements within countries. Resolving these issues may require unified action from multiple governments or the U.N. Security Council, highlighting the challenge of balancing a sovereign government's authority with humanitarian concerns. International consensus on these matters is difficult to achieve and often takes years. International consensus is challenging to achieve and can take years. Humanitarian suffering continues in affected countries where underlying issues remain unresolved. New types of humanitarian situations have become more common in the last decade and a half, leading to increased military involvement by the United Nations and its member states. This has raised the cost and sometimes reduced the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance. The refugee situation has evolved since post-World War II, leading to new challenges such as refugees fleeing to war-torn areas like Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Humanitarian aid workers helping these victims have also become victims of conflict. Additionally, internally displaced persons (IDPs) are often overlooked despite suffering from warfare, with examples in Afghanistan, the Balkans, Chechnya, Sudan, and Sierra Leone. In response to the growing numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in war-torn areas like Afghanistan, the Balkans, Chechnya, Sudan, and Sierra Leone, the UNHCR expanded its role in assisting those displaced within their own countries. This change made the agency responsible for nearly twice as many needy people almost overnight. Additionally, in situations like Colombia and Afghanistan, where people are prevented from fleeing warfare, UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies must assist them in extremely difficult and dangerous situations. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard C. Holbrook made the plight of IDPs a special concern. Richard C. Holbrook, along with the UN Secretary General and UN High Commissioner for Refugees, emphasized the importance of addressing the needs of internally displaced persons (IDPs). IDPs face challenges such as refugee emergencies, natural disasters, and warfare, leading to food shortages, lack of livelihood, and health risks. International agencies, refugee relief agencies, and humanitarian organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) work to assist IDPs and address program overlap issues. The United Nations Secretary General created the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs in 1991 to address program overlap among international agencies. However, it was abolished in 1997 and replaced with a U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator in the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, improving the coordination of humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian emergencies in countries without a functioning government pose challenges for relief agencies in providing assistance to victims of civil war. The challenges of providing humanitarian assistance in countries without a functioning government include issues with roads, airport facilities, water, power, and protection of aid workers. In some cases, warring factions demand separate negotiations for aid provision. Foreign military forces have been introduced in countries like Somalia and Liberia to restore order. Humanitarian aid personnel are often targeted in internal wars, with 214 U.N. employees killed between 1992 and 2002. Protection of aid workers is a growing concern for the United Nations. The recent U.N. response to armed attacks on aid workers includes using peacekeeping forces for protection. Deputy U.N. Secretary-General Louise Frechette urges governments to investigate and punish perpetrators, ratify international conventions, provide funding for security, and control irregular forces. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposes spending $30 million annually to protect civilian staff in conflict zones. In May 2002, Annan appointed Mr. Tun Myat as full-time security coordinator to manage a security system protecting 70,000 staff and dependents at 150 duty stations. The repatriation of refugees to war-torn homelands with land mines poses challenges. International donors recognize the need for rehabilitation funding in addition to short-term repatriation assistance. This may involve activities like mine-clearing and establishing new government and commercial facilities. The rehabilitation of war-torn countries involves establishing banking and commercial facilities, along with non-traditional humanitarian assistance programs. Countries like Kosovo, East Timor, Cambodia, Mozambique, Angola, and El Salvador have received such help. Foreign military personnel, civil servants, and humanitarian assistance personnel are involved in this process, which can last for years. There is a concern about military involvement undermining coordination with civilian humanitarian agencies, as seen in Kosovo in 1999. Former UNHCR High Commissioner Ogata has expressed concerns about bypassing humanitarian agencies in crises and using military or newly-created governmental entities instead. The use of military forces in humanitarian assistance emergencies raises issues such as coordination with civilian agencies, perception by combatants, and the protection of refugees and aid workers. Refugee flight is often caused by human rights violations, persecution, conflict, and poverty. U.N. Secretary General Annan has cautioned against mixing military and humanitarian actions to avoid government fears of military intervention. Many believe refugee flight is caused by conflict, poverty, underdevelopment, overpopulation, and environmental degradation. Prevention is key to addressing refugee flows. President Clinton created the Under Secretary for Global Affairs to focus on underlying causes. The Bureau of Refugee Programs was reorganized to include population and migration. The Office of Transition Initiatives assists countries in recovery towards self-government and sustained development. Various international actors are involved in addressing global issues. Many international actors, including the United Nations, IOs, NGOs, and PVOs, are involved in addressing refugee and IDP issues. The UNHCR and UNRWA play crucial roles in providing legal protection and assistance to refugees. Core rights are accorded to refugees by UNHCR. The UNHCR provides core rights to refugees, including acceptance at the border, non-refoulement, safety protection, fair asylum procedures, and basic assistance. They aim for permanent solutions like voluntary repatriation, local integration, or resettlement to a third country. UNHCR assists refugees and IDPs returning home, often requiring rehabilitation of land and infrastructure. Repatriation is the best long-term solution but can be expensive and dangerous in the short term. UNHCR coordinates with NGOs to provide emergency relief like shelter, food, and healthcare to refugees. NGOs, including UNRWA, provide emergency humanitarian relief to refugees, offering shelter, food, and health care. UNRWA specifically assists Palestinian refugees, with its mandate continuously renewed since 1950. It has supported over 3.9 million Palestine refugees with essential services for over 50 years, playing a crucial role in the evolving Middle East situation. UNRWA operates as a subsidiary organ of the United Nations, reporting directly to the General Assembly. The U.S. government agencies, including USAID, DOD, and the State Department, provide international refugee assistance guided by specific legislative authority. Congress funds U.S. refugee assistance, which includes urgent food, shelter, and medical needs. The U.S. Government agencies, including USAID, provide humanitarian assistance for food, shelter, and medical needs. Funds can be used directly or given as grants to IOs, NGOs, and PVOs. USAID administers aid through the Bureau of Humanitarian Response and Disaster Assistance Response Teams. FFP under PL 480 and Title II provides relief and development food aid, including emergency and private assistance donations. Section 416(b) is also managed for assistance programs. The U.S. Government agencies, including USAID, provide humanitarian assistance for food, shelter, and medical needs through various programs. Section 416 (b) allows for the donation of surplus U.S. agricultural commodities for assistance programs. OTI provides post-disaster transition assistance with a focus on peace and democratization projects. DOD provides humanitarian support for emergency situations, including food, shelter, medical evacuations, and disaster preparedness. The U.S. Government agencies, including USAID, provide humanitarian assistance for food, shelter, and medical needs through various programs. P.L. 99-145 authorizes donation of excess non-lethal supplies under the Denton Program. PRM deals with refugee and conflict victim issues worldwide, including assistance for refugees, IDPs, and populations of concern to UNHCR. Key programs include refugee protection and small community projects funded through MRA. The Judiciary Committees oversee refugee admissions and assistance through annual consultations with the Administration. MRA funding is under pressure due to growing humanitarian emergencies and donor nations are urged to provide more funds. The MRA includes aid to refugees through contributions to international organizations and private voluntary organizations. UNHCR and UNRWA are primary agencies involved in refugee assistance. In FY2003, the Administration allocated funding for migration within Overseas Assistance to support orderly migration and protect vulnerable migrants, including trafficking victims. Funds are mainly directed to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The United States also contributes to resettling Jewish refugees in Israel through the United Israel Appeal. Funding covers screening, processing, medical exams, language training, cultural orientation, care, maintenance, and transportation loans for refugees traveling to the United States. The United States provides funding for migration and resettlement of refugees, including transportation loans and initial reception grants. The budget for refugee expenditures has increased since the early 1990s, with allocations for personnel and operating expenses. Refugee activities in the Balkans increased pressure on the account starting in FY1999. Efforts have been made to keep refugee expenditures in the foreign aid budget level due to budget constraints and new priorities in the foreign aid program. Planning for future refugee needs and funding is challenging. In FY2002, $705 million was appropriated for the Migration and Refugee Assistance account. For FY2003, the President requested $705 million, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $782 million for MRA. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $782 million for the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) and $32 million for the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) in response to refugee emergencies. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $800 million for MRA and $20 million for ERMA. The Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) fund, established in 1962, is a no-year account that can be used by the President without fiscal year limitations. It is replenished through additional appropriations as needed and provides flexibility in responding to refugee emergencies. The UNHCR's budget tripled in the early 1990s due to complex humanitarian situations. Funding for CY2002 was $1.05 billion, with a CY2003 appeal of $876.5 million. Raising money has become challenging for international agencies, leading to uneven distribution of funds for humanitarian emergencies. The UNHCR has expressed concern over uneven funding for humanitarian aid programs, with rich nations contributing more to certain crises like Kosovo compared to African crises. Despite receiving donations from various sources, 95% of funds come from 15 donors, with the US being the largest contributor. Funding for UNHCR comes through U.N. assessed dues and other channels. The U.S. voluntary contribution to UNHCR in FY2002 was $255 million, and until FY2003 funding is allocated, programs will operate at FY2002 levels. Concerns exist about adequate U.S. contributions in FY2003, with potential shortages in refugee program funding, including for UNHCR. Since 1999, UNHCR has faced budget shortfalls, leading to program cuts due to reliance on voluntary contributions. UNHCR relies on voluntary contributions and faces funding shortfalls, leading to program cuts. In 2002, only $678 million of the $800 million budget was received, resulting in an 11% decrease in planned programs. The budget was cut to $710 million, affecting programs in Africa, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, and the Caucasus. The organization encourages contributions from more governments but struggles due to a small number of donors and earmarked contributions. The unpredictability of global conflicts contributes to UNHCR's financial difficulties, leading to funding problems for refugee emergencies. In CY2002, a supplemental appeal was made to fund new emergency needs in various countries. UNHCR has introduced new mechanisms to improve funding flows, including an operational reserve. Recent debate in Congress has focused on funding issues and policy differences in U.S. refugee policy. The number of refugees admitted to the United States is set annually through consultation between the Administration and Congress, as required by the Refugee Act of 1980. Initial resettlement costs are funded through the MRA. Refugee admissions dropped during the Clinton Administration, with reductions expected due to fewer admissions from the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia. Most refugees pledged under the Comprehensive Plan of Action have been admitted, including Amerasians and former political prisoners. The number of refugees admitted to the United States has fluctuated over the years. While some groups like Amerasians and former political prisoners have been admitted, the admissions of Soviet Jews and Evangelicals have decreased. Despite some opposition from Congress, the resettlement ceiling was raised to 83,000 in FY1998. Subsequent years saw varying admission numbers, with a peak of 85,525 in FY1999 and a low of 27,113 in FY2002 following the events of September 11, 2001. The cost of responding to refugee and humanitarian emergencies has also increased. The rising costs of emergency assistance are impacting the amount of money available for development assistance. Various approaches have been used to address the growing need for refugee assistance without further draining development aid accounts. Congress has transferred interest from funds established for refugee assistance, such as the Persian Gulf Regional Defense Fund and Defense Cooperation Account. The Gulf Regional Defense Fund and Defense Cooperation Account were established to receive contributions from other countries to offset U.S. Iraqi war expenses. Additional funding was provided in FY1994 for Rwanda emergencies, and in 1999 for aid in Central America, the Caribbean, natural disaster response, and humanitarian assistance to Kosovo. The Clinton administration stressed the importance of efficiency in U.N. refugee agencies to meet the growing need for humanitarian assistance within budget constraints. The U.N. refugee agencies were urged to be more efficient by the Clinton administration. The Department of State suggested consolidating humanitarian assistance programs to streamline donations and reduce competition among agencies like UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO."
