    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to establish a well-funded early learning system for children up to five years old, integrated with K-12 education. This includes utilizing state and federal funds, involving all stakeholders, ensuring affordable services, integrated data systems, and supporting educators. A new section is added to the Education Code for an Individualized County of Santa Clara Child Care Subsidy Plan. The County of Santa Clara may develop an individualized child care subsidy plan to address local needs of working families. The plan aims to utilize state and federal funds for affordable services and support educators. An assessment will be conducted to identify the county's goals for its subsidized child care system, examining funding structure, alignment with state requirements, and barriers. Factors considered include demographics of families in need, current supply of subsidized child care, and the level of need for various types of services. The county will assess its subsidized child care system, considering factors like income levels, family fees, cost of care, market rates, and local policy development to prioritize low-income families and meet state goals. The county's subsidized child care system will prioritize low-income families and align with state goals. Local policies can override state laws for child care subsidy programs under certain conditions. Eligibility criteria, fees, and reimbursement rates are key components of the county's subsidized child care system, with a focus on low-income families. Local policies can impact these aspects, including age, family size, income levels, and special needs considerations. The county's subsidized child care system includes reimbursement rates, efficient fund use methods, funding source eligibility, measurable outcomes for goal achievement, and overcoming subsidy system barriers. The county cannot alter regional market rate survey results. The plan for subsidized child care in Santa Clara County must be approved by the local planning council and the Board of Supervisors before being reviewed by the Early Education and Support Division within 30 days. Any modifications to the plan must also be reviewed within the same timeframe, with disapproval only for non-conforming or conflicting portions. The county must demonstrate an increase in child care enrollment compared to the previous fiscal year. An annual report must be submitted summarizing the success of the child care plan. Participating contractors may receive adjusted funding based on their involvement in the plan. The article will be in effect until January 1, 2022, and will be repealed unless a later statute extends the date. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for Santa Clara County due to high living costs, providing a child care subsidy plan to address the unique circumstances in the county."
