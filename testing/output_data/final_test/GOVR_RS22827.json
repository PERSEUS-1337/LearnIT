    "content": "The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) aims to protect the interests of participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans by providing remedies and access to federal courts through Section 502(a). ERISA regulates defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, with the former promising a specific future benefit to employees. In a defined benefit plan, the employer assumes investment risk and is liable for any shortfalls, while a defined contribution plan gives each participant an individual account where benefits are based on contributions. ERISA mandates fiduciary responsibilities for both plan types, allowing civil actions for breaches of fiduciary duty. ERISA mandates fiduciary responsibilities for defined benefit and defined contribution plans, allowing civil actions for breaches of fiduciary duty. A breaching fiduciary must make good any losses to the plan and restore any profits made from improper asset use, facing potential removal and other relief as deemed appropriate by the court. One controversial issue is that individual plaintiffs may bring civil actions, but any recovery must benefit the plan as a whole. The Court rejected a beneficiary's claim for monetary damages under ERISA Section 409, stating relief for an individual beneficiary was not available. In LaRue, a participant in a 401(k) plan suffered losses of $150,000 due to plan administrators failing to make an investment change, leading to a breach of fiduciary duty. LaRue filed a claim against his former employer and the 401(k) plan for breach of fiduciary duty. He sought equitable relief under ERISA Section 502(a)(3) for not following investment instructions, but the district court dismissed his claims for monetary damages. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's decision regarding LaRue's claim for equitable relief under ERISA Section 502(a)(3), stating that the make-whole relief sought was not considered \"equitable.\" The court also found that LaRue's argument under Section 502(a)(2) was waived as it was raised for the first time on appeal. The court determined that Section 502(a)(2) only provides remedies for an entire plan, not for an individual's account, citing the Russell case. The Supreme Court rejected the Fourth Circuit's decision on Section 502(a)(2) of ERISA, allowing recovery for fiduciary breaches that affect the value of plan assets in an individual's account. This decision was supported by the Department of Labor's amicus brief in LaRue. Justice Stevens, writing for the majority, distinguished LaRue from the Russell case. In LaRue, Justice Stevens distinguished the case from Russell by highlighting that fiduciary misconduct violated ERISA's principal duties related to plan management and investment of fund assets. The Court also noted that the emphasis on protecting the \"entire plan\" in Russell only applied to defined benefit plans, not defined contribution plans like in LaRue. In LaRue, fiduciary misconduct can reduce benefits in defined contribution plans without threatening the entire plan's solvency. The Court emphasized that such breaches harm plan assets for all participants, not just those with individual accounts. Justices disagreed on the reasoning behind the outcome of the case. Justice Roberts highlighted the importance of distinguishing between claims for benefits under ERISA Section 502(a)(1)(B) and Section 502(a)(2) to protect plan administrators. He emphasized the need for plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit to uphold the protections for plans and administrators. Justice Thomas, in a separate concurrence, criticized the majority's reliance on pension market trends and ERISA drafters' concerns. Justice Thomas criticized the majority's reliance on pension market trends and ERISA drafters' concerns as misplaced. He concluded that losses to an individual 401(k) account are losses to the plan under ERISA, allowing participants to bring claims for fiduciary actions affecting their accounts. The LaRue case affirmed this protection for individuals in defined contribution plans, with some commentators praising the decision while others foreseeing potential challenges. The LaRue decision may lead to increased litigation of claims by 401(k) participants who have suffered account losses. Questions arise regarding Justice Roberts's concurrence and whether relief under Section 502(a)(1)(B) affects a participant's ability to bring a claim under Section 502(a)(2). Additionally, it is unclear if participants must exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit under Section 502(a)(2)."
