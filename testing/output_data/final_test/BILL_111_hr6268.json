    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Wage Theft Prevention and Community Partnership Act.\" Congress finds that wage and hour violations are a serious problem for working Americans, with low-wage workers routinely denied proper pay. These violations not only disadvantage ethical businesses but also harm local economies by reducing tax revenues. Women and minority women are disproportionately affected by minimum wage violations. Low-wage workers, especially women and minority women, suffer wage and hour violations at a rate nearly triple that of white women. Social service networks are strained, and poverty increases when workers are paid below the legal requirement. The Government Accountability Office recommends that the Department of Labor improve its services through partnerships to address these violations more effectively. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" which does not provide any specific information to summarize. In this Act, definitions include \"eligible partner\" as a not-for-profit organization dedicated to combating poverty and preventing wage and hour law abuse, a labor organization, and a Joint Labor Management Cooperative Committee.
