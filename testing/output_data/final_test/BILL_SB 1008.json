    "title": "SB 1008",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 21080.25 of the Public Resources Code is amended to define terms related to antenna support structures, habitat of significant value, and the Los Angeles Regional Interoperable Communications System (LA-RICS), including LMR and LTE systems. The curr_chunk defines terms related to riparian areas, wetlands, and wildlife habitat. The LA-RICS exemption criteria for project sites include specific elements like antennas, support structures, equipment enclosures, and central system switch facilities. To qualify for the exemption, the project site must be publicly owned and already have certain components in place, such as antennas or equipment enclosures. Construction and implementation of the project at the site would not harm protected species or habitats, have a substantial adverse impact on wetlands, riparian areas, or historical resources, or exceed FCC exposure standards. The new LTE and LMR antenna support structures must comply with height restrictions set by state and federal regulations and airport land use plans. Monopoles cannot exceed 70 feet, and lattice towers cannot exceed 180 feet in height. Central system switches must be located in existing structures at a publicly owned site or private communications facility. These requirements do not apply if the project site is on a school or cultural/sacred site. Before determining that a project is not subject to this division, the authority must hold a public meeting in each county supervisorial district where the project is located to hear public comments. The notice must be provided at least 72 hours in advance and published in a newspaper of general circulation in each county supervisorial district. The authority must hold a public meeting in each county supervisorial district before determining if a project is exempt. If approved, a notice of exemption must be filed with the Office of Planning and Research and the county clerk, and posted on the authority's website. The website must also include draft and final environmental documentation, filing dates, and hearing information for federal agencies. The authority and its member agencies must approve LA-RICS use agreements in public meetings. This section expires on January 1, 2020, unless extended by a later statute. No reimbursement is required for this act as local agencies can cover the costs."
