    "content": "The \"Organic Standards Protection Act\" is cited as the short title. An amendment to the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 includes a new section on recordkeeping, investigations, and enforcement. The \"Organic Standards Protection Act\" includes a new section on recordkeeping requirements for persons involved in the organic certification program. Records such as contracts, agreements, receipts must be maintained for 5 years by most individuals and 10 years by certifying agents. The \"Organic Standards Protection Act\" mandates recordkeeping requirements for organic certification program participants. Records must be maintained for 5 years by most individuals and 10 years by certifying agents to ensure confidentiality of information obtained or provided under the Act. The Secretary may conduct investigations to verify information and determine if violations of the Organic Standards Protection Act have occurred. This includes administering oaths, subpoenaing witnesses, and requesting relevant documents. The Organic Standards Protection Act prohibits individuals from failing to provide accurate information, violating orders or certifications, or falsely representing products as organic. Enforcement measures are in place to ensure compliance. The Secretary may issue an order to stop the sale of agricultural products labeled as organic if they do not meet national and State standards until verified. After notice and opportunity for appeal, the Secretary may revoke organic certification or accreditation if a violation of organic standards is found. A person who violates an order to stop the sale of a product as organically produced or a revocation of certification/accreditation shall face penalties. Appeals can be made through the administrative process established by the Secretary. After a final decision by the Secretary, the affected person can elect to appeal to a United States district court within 30 days. An order or revocation can only be set aside if not supported by substantial evidence. Noncompliance with the order or revocation can result in penalties. The United States can seek enforcement of an order or revocation in district court if it becomes final. The court will enforce the order if it was lawfully made and violated, imposing a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each offense."
