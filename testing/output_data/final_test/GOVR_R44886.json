    "content": "The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the President to proclaim national monuments on federal lands containing historic landmarks and structures. Presidents have established 157 monuments, modifying them over time. Controversies arise over the size of areas protected, effects on land use, and lack of public participation and environmental review requirements. Congress has broad authority to establish, amend, or abolish national monuments, considering factors like optimal size and allowed land uses. President Trump's executive order in 2017 required a review of national monuments established or expanded since 1996. The executive order in 2017 required a review of national monuments established or expanded since 1996, focusing on public outreach, coordination with stakeholders, and balancing protection of landmarks with appropriate land use. Recommendations for presidential actions or legislative proposals may be developed based on the review. The Department of the Interior identified 27 national monuments for review under the President's executive order. One monument is under review for public outreach and coordination, while the others are being reviewed based on their size. Public comments were sought and over 1.4 million were received. An interim report was issued on one of the land-based monuments. The Secretary of the Interior issued an interim report on Bears Ears National Monument, due within 45 days of the executive order. A final report on the review of monuments is due by August 24, 2017. The report covers 21 land-based national monuments established or expanded since 1996, providing information for congressional decision-making and oversight of presidential monument authority. Monument proclamations guide the management of federal lands and resources within the monument areas. Presidential proclamations provide direction on managing federal lands within monument boundaries, addressing specific land uses and activities. This report focuses on key topics such as energy, grazing, vehicles, timber, hunting, fishing, and tribes. It summarizes major provisions of proclamations related to these topics, highlighting their emphasis and variations. The report does not analyze the impact of these changes on land management on the ground. The report focuses on key topics such as energy, grazing, vehicles, timber, hunting, fishing, and tribes within monument boundaries. It summarizes major provisions of proclamations related to these topics, highlighting their emphasis and variations. The summaries do not capture all textual differences in the language of the proclamations, but provide insights on monument management. Verbatim text of pertinent provisions for 21 monuments is provided in separate tables. Monuments are listed in alphabetical order. The tables in the report provide text of monument proclamations, not interpretations. Textual differences may not reflect differences in meaning. Other authorities like laws and regulations also govern monument lands. Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service lands are generally managed for multiple uses. Forest Service lands managed for multiple uses, Fish and Wildlife Service lands under dominant use mission, and National Park Service lands with dual-use mission. Analysis needed to determine authorized activities on specific lands and role of public, states, and tribes. Monument proclamations generally prohibit new mineral leases, mining claims, and exploration activities, with exceptions in some cases. The proclamation for Canyons of the Ancients National Monument allows for oil and gas leasing and development due to existing leases, with new leases only for specified purposes. The proclamation for San Gabriel Mountains National Monument permits disposal of materials under the Materials Act of 1947. Proclamations for some monuments specify management of energy development. Monument designations may impact existing rights, but the extent is not always clear. Monument designations may affect existing mineral and energy leases, claims, and permits by potentially imposing new constraints on development. Concerns include higher environmental review standards and mitigation costs for mineral exploration and extraction activities. Proclamations also address facilities and rights-of-way, but the extent to which they pertain to energy-related land uses or other activities varies across monuments. Some proclamations assert non-interference with existing structures and uses. The proclamations for national monuments may impact existing mineral and energy leases by imposing new constraints on development. Some proclamations allow for the operation, maintenance, and expansion of existing facilities, while others are more restrictive, limiting new rights-of-way for electric transmission or transportation. Energy-related provisions vary across the 21 national monuments. The proclamations for the 21 national monuments address various issues such as livestock grazing, with different language used in each proclamation. For example, the proclamation for Ironwood Forest National Monument states that laws governing grazing permits on Bureau of Land Management lands also apply to lands within the monument. Some national monument proclamations address livestock grazing, specifying that grazing authorities should align with monument management. Certain monuments may only allow grazing under existing permits, while further analysis is needed to determine if new permits could be authorized. For instance, the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument proclamation maintains existing grazing permits and leases, subject to applicable laws and regulations. Livestock grazing is prohibited in two national monuments analyzed: Hanford Reach and Gold Butte. Hanford Reach is managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Energy, where grazing is not allowed to protect identified objects. In Gold Butte, grazing has been banned since 1998. Some monument proclamations restrict or condition grazing, like in the Sonoran Desert National Monument where permits in certain areas cannot be renewed. In some national monuments, grazing permits are restricted or prohibited to protect identified objects. The Secretary of the Interior may study the impacts of livestock grazing in certain areas and determine if grazing is compatible with the monument's protective purposes. Existing grazing may continue with conditions, and if grazing is deemed incompatible, the Secretary may retire grazing allotments. Most monument proclamations address the use of motorized and non-motorized mechanized vehicles on monument lands, prohibiting off-road use except for emergencies or administrative purposes. Some limit motorized vehicles to designated roads, while others restrict them to existing roads at the time of monument designation. Many proclamations also call for the development of transportation or management. Several monument proclamations require plans for managing motorized and non-motorized mechanized vehicles, including designating roads and trails where they are allowed. Some proclamations also address actions like road closures to protect monument objects. Authorization for off-road areas to be open to motorized use is granted in a few proclamations. The proclamation for the San Gabriel Mountains allows for off-highway vehicle areas, while some proclamations close certain areas like the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument and Giant Sequoia National Monument. Few proclamations address timber management, with only four specifically mentioning it: Cascade-Siskiyou, Giant Sequoia, Grand Canyon-Parashant, and San Gabriel Mountains. The Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument prohibits commercial timber harvest except under certain conditions. The Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument and Giant Sequoia National Monument prohibit the commercial harvest of timber, except under specific conditions. San Gabriel Mountains National Monument allows for vegetative management treatments, with timber harvest and prescribed fire permitted under certain circumstances. Grand Canyon-Parashant also permits the sale of vegetative materials for ecological restoration projects. The national monuments examined in this report have provisions related to timber sales and vegetative materials for restoration projects. Proclamations for some monuments recognize state authority in managing fish and wildlife, with specific language on jurisdictional changes. The national monuments examined in this report have provisions related to timber sales and vegetative materials for restoration projects. Some proclamations recognize state authority in managing fish and wildlife, including hunting and fishing. Table 5 outlines hunting and fishing provisions in proclamations for 21 national monuments, with 14 mentioning tribal rights and roles in management. These proclamations do not affect Indian tribe rights, with some specifying protection of Indian sites and access for traditional uses. The proclamations for national monuments outline different types of sites as protected, with provisions for tribal involvement and public input in management plans. Bears Ears National Monument establishes a commission for tribal guidance and recommendations. The proclamations for national monuments include provisions for tribal involvement in management plans. Bears Ears National Monument establishes a commission for tribal guidance and recommendations, with the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior required to engage with tribal government officers. Additionally, an advisory committee will be formed to provide advice on managing the monument. The proclamations for the 21 national monuments generally restrict new mineral and geothermal leases, mining claims, and prospecting activities. Livestock grazing, motorized vehicles, timber management, and state authority over fish and wildlife are also addressed in the proclamations. The proclamations for 21 national monuments restrict new mineral and geothermal leases, mining claims, and prospecting activities. Twenty proclamations specify that they do not enlarge or diminish state jurisdiction over fish and wildlife management, while one proclamation only references \"diminish.\" Fourteen proclamations state they do not affect Indian tribe rights, with nine including language on protecting Indian sites and access for traditional uses. This analysis can aid Congress in managing national monuments and reviewing presidential actions under the Antiquities Act."
