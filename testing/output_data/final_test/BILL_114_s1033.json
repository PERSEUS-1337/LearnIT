This Act amends Section 801 of the Department of Energy Organization Act to establish the Quadrennial Energy Review process. The Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2015 amends Section 801 of the Department of Energy Organization Act to establish the Quadrennial Energy Review process. The Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2015 establishes a Task Force to coordinate the Quadrennial Energy Review every 4 years. The Task Force is comprised of senior officials from various government departments. The Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2015 establishes a Task Force to coordinate the Quadrennial Energy Review every 4 years. The Task Force includes senior officials from different government departments such as the Department of the Interior, Agriculture, Treasury, Transportation, Office of Management and Budget, National Science Foundation, Environmental Protection Agency, and other Federal agencies as deemed appropriate by the President. The review aims to provide an integrated view of national energy objectives and Federal energy policy, as well as identify the maximum alignment possible. The Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2015 establishes a Task Force to coordinate the Quadrennial Energy Review every 4 years. The Task Force includes senior officials from different government departments to establish integrated national energy objectives, recommend coordinated actions, identify resources for energy technologies, provide an analytical base for policy decisions, and consider future budgetary resources. The Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2015 establishes a Task Force to coordinate the Quadrennial Energy Review every 4 years. The Task Force includes senior officials from various sectors to provide input and recommendations, with substantial input from Congress, the energy industry, academia, governments, NGOs, and the public. The President is required to submit a report on the Quadrennial Energy Review to Congress every 4 years, with the option to prepare additional reports more frequently as deemed necessary. The President can publish interim reports as part of the Quadrennial Energy Review, addressing short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term objectives for Federal energy policy. The reports may include potential executive actions and resource requirements coordinated across multiple agencies. The Quadrennial Energy Review involves analyzing the roles of various parties in achieving energy objectives across different sectors like buildings, industry, transportation, and electric power. It also includes requirements for the development and diffusion of energy technologies in each sector. The Quadrennial Energy Review includes assessment of policy options to increase domestic energy supplies and efficiency, evaluation of energy storage and distribution requirements, an integrated plan for Federal Laboratories' involvement in energy programs, portfolio assessments for optimal resource deployment, and mapping linkages among research and demonstration programs. Identification of key details for energy technology innovation:\n- Programs, demonstration projects, and innovation mechanisms in Federal agencies\n- Projections, timeframes, milestones, funding sources, and management for demonstration projects\n- Public and private funding needs for energy technologies, systems, and infrastructure\n- Assessment of global competitors and programs for international cooperation\n- Policy gaps to accelerate adoption of energy technologies The curr_chunk discusses the prioritization of objectives and actions based on estimated Federal budgetary resources, analysis of policy intervention points, effective energy policy areas, and recommendations for executive branch organization changes to facilitate development. The curr_chunk discusses the organization changes needed to implement Federal energy policies, including support for the Quadrennial Energy Review and cooperation with Federal agencies. The curr_chunk states that the Quadrennial Energy Review is supported, and the Act does not supersede any provision of Federal law not expressly affected by it."
