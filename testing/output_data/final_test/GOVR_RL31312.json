The Senate adopted its version of the bill as an amendment introduced by Senator Ted Stevens. The bill replaced versions passed in 2002 and reflected reductions in compliance with the White House's request. FY2003 funds had been pending since October 1, 2002, and Congress passed eight continuing resolutions to provide temporary funding until February 20, 2003. The annual legislative branch appropriations bill structure was changed in the FY2003 Act. The FY2003 legislative appropriations bill restructured the annual legislative branch appropriations bill into two titles. Title I, Congressional Operations, included budgets for activities directly serving Congress such as the House, Senate, CBO, AOC, CRS, and GPO. Title II, Related Agencies, contained budgets for activities not directly supporting Congress like the Botanic Garden and parts of the Library of Congress.

Title I included budgets for activities directly serving Congress such as the House, Senate, CBO, AOC, CRS, and GPO. Title II contained budgets for activities not directly supporting Congress like the Botanic Garden and parts of the Library of Congress. The bill also included additional titles for purposes such as capital improvements and special one-time functions. Appropriations for legislative branch agencies are contained in Title I, while Title II includes general administrative provisions and appropriations for specific activities. Figure 1 shows the breakdown of FY2002 appropriations between Titles I and II. The FY2003 legislative appropriations bill restructured the annual legislative branch appropriations bill into two titles. Title I included budgets for activities directly serving Congress such as the House, Senate, CBO, AOC, CRS, and GPO. Title II contained budgets for activities not directly supporting Congress like the Botanic Garden and parts of the Library of Congress. The bill also included additional titles for purposes such as capital improvements and special one-time functions. Appropriations for legislative branch agencies are contained in Title I, while Title II includes general administrative provisions and appropriations for specific activities. The authority was 30.1% of the total appropriation, including permanent federal funds, trust funds, and other budget authority. Permanent trust funds are monies held in accounts credited with collections from specific sources earmarked by law for a defined purpose. Non-legislative entities within the legislative branch budget are also included in the Budget. The Budget includes non-legislative entities within the legislative branch budget for bookkeeping purposes. It contains legislative branch appropriations from FY1995 to FY2002 in billions of current dollars, excluding permanent budget authorities and including supplementals and rescissions. The FY2000 regular annual Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (P.L.106-57) included supplementals and rescissions in P.L. 106-113, P.L. 106-246, and P.L.106-554. This figure also includes FY2001 regular annual appropriations from H.R. 5657, FY2001 supplemental appropriations from H.R. 5666 and H.R. 2216 (P.L. 107-20). The first FY2001 legislative branch appropriations bill, H.R. 4516, was vetoed, while the second bill, H.R. 5657, was incorporated into P.L. 106-554.

The FY2003 continuing appropriations resolution, H.J.Res. 2, included FY2003 appropriations for agencies from 10 other bills not enacted in the 107th Congress. The legislative branch operated under continuing resolutions from October 1, 2002, to February 20, 2003, maintaining funding at FY2002 levels. This could have delayed authorization and funding for new Capitol Police positions and improvements in police training programs. The FY2003 budget request included funding for new Capitol Police positions, improvements in police training programs, hazardous duty pay, and a 9.1% pay increase for Capitol Police.

It also funded the Government Printing Office and the Architect of the Capitol. A new provision limits the transfer of appropriations in anticipation of the proposed Department of Homeland Security. This is to prevent unauthorized transfers of funds between appropriations. The provision in the Act prohibits transfers of funds to any department, agency, or instrumentality of the US government, except as authorized by the Act or any other appropriation act. This may impact the transfer of funds under the Economy Act, as it is not considered an appropriation act. The Senate version of H.R. 5121, amended to include provisions from S. 2720, was passed on July 25. The bill included a $2.42 billion budget, with increases for Capitol Police funding, pay raises, and personnel expansion.

The Architect of the Capitol is authorized to acquire buildings for computer backup facilities for legislative use. Capitol authorized to acquire buildings for computer backup facilities for legislative branch offices, subject to approval; federal agencies prohibited from using funds for printing services outside of Government Printing Office. The director of OMB issued a directive on May 3, 2002, stating that federal agencies were no longer required to use GPO for printing services. Congress added language to a resolution regarding federal printing requirements, stating that all printing for Congress and government entities must be done at the Government Printing Office and prohibiting the use of funds to implement the OMB directive. The OMB directive of May 3, 2002, allowed federal agencies to use printing sources other than GPO, but Congress prohibited funds for printing the U.S. Budget by any entity other than GPO. The issue remains unsettled, with conflicting views from the Department of Justice, GAO, and OMB. Later, OMB formalized its position in the Federal Register and issued solicitations for printing services for the FY2004 U.S. Budget. The FY2004 U.S. Budget procurement of printing services includes a $150,000 gratuity payment for the late Hon. Patsy Mink's widower.

Howe testified about the challenges Capitol Police face in losing officers to other agencies and the need to attract qualified personnel. Congress authorized recruitment and retention incentives in the Emergency Supplemental Act, 2002. Financial incentives were provided for officers and employees, with the Capitol Police chief having sole discretion. The FY2003 legislative branch appropriations bill also included provisions related to incentives. Both bills aimed to enhance Capitol Police recruitment and retention by giving the chief discretion over bonuses and offering incentives like tuition reimbursement. They also provided tools such as specialty positions, availability pay, and higher compensation rates for new officers. The House bill allowed recruitment of former military and law enforcement personnel without age restrictions and overtime pay for higher-ranking officers, while the Senate bill focused on recruiting without age limits. The House Appropriations Committee-reported measure included a provision transferring the disbursing authority for Capitol Police salaries to the chief, consolidating payrolls for officers assigned to the House and Senate. However, this provision was removed from the bill after a point of order was raised by Representative Robert Ney. Identical language consolidating the Capitol Police payrolls was added to the Senate version of the legislative branch appropriations bill.
