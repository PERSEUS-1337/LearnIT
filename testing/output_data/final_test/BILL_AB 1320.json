    "title": "AB 1320",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 25503.36 of the Business and Professions Code allows authorized licensees to sponsor events and purchase advertising from live entertainment marketing companies at the San Diego County Fairgrounds in Del Mar. The events must be focused on live artistic, musical, sports, or cultural entertainment and last no more than four days with approximately 100 acts performing for 20,000 or more patrons. The live entertainment marketing company must be a Delaware LLC under common ownership with a private equity firm that may also own a licensed California winery, not exceeding 25% of assets. The company should have no control over the winery's operations. Authorized licensees sponsoring events or purchasing advertising must verify compliance with these rules. Any on-sale licensee at the San Diego County Fairgrounds must serve other brands of alcohol from competing wholesalers or manufacturers, not just those from the sponsoring licensee. Agreements cannot be tied to the purchase or distribution of specific alcoholic beverages. Sponsorship and advertising agreements must be in writing between the licensee and the live entertainment marketing company. Any authorized licensee inducing coercion to fulfill contractual obligations with a wholesaler's license holder will face misdemeanor charges, including imprisonment or fines. Additionally, license suspension or revocation may occur. Any on-sale retail licensee who solicits a wholesaler's license holder to purchase advertising space or time will be guilty of a misdemeanor, facing imprisonment, fines, and possible license suspension or revocation. Direct purchasing of advertising space from on-sale licensees is not permitted unless expressly authorized. Authorized licensees are restricted from providing anything of value to on-sale retail licensees, except as permitted by this section or other division provisions. Definitions for \"authorized licensee\" include various types of license holders, excluding certain importer licenses. The Legislature in California recognizes the need to separate manufacturing, wholesale, and retail interests in the alcohol industry to prevent market domination and excessive sales through aggressive marketing. A special law is deemed necessary for unique conditions in San Diego County. The act creates new crimes or infractions, changes penalties, and defines crimes. It is an urgency statute for public safety, allowing events in San Diego County to proceed immediately."
