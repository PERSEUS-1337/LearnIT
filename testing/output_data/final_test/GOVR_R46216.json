After receiving the President's Budget Request, congressional defense committees hold hearings on the Army's budget, posture, and modernization. The Army's 2019 Modernization Strategy aims to develop new weapons systems and capabilities, potentially impacting force structure. The 2019 Army Modernization Strategy aims to transform the Army into a multi-domain force by 2035, expanding beyond the six materiel modernization priorities outlined in the 2018 report. Army Modernization involves modernizing how they fight, what they fight with, and who they are. The Army is focusing on modernizing how they fight with equipment to implement Multi-Domain Operations (MDO). This transformation will require changes in force posture, unit organization, new authorities, capabilities, and technologies. Integration with other Services and Interagency involvement will also be crucial for successful execution of MDO. The Army's Modernization Strategy for Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) requires support from the Department of Defense (DOD), Interagency, and Congress. It is part of a hierarchy of strategies including the National Security Strategy (NSS), National Defense Strategy (NDS), and National Military Strategy (NMS) to inform modernization plans. The National Military Strategy (NMS) supports the aims of the National Security Strategy (NSS) and implements the National Defense Strategy (NDS). It outlines the Armed Forces' plan to achieve military objectives in the near term and ensures their future decisiveness. The NMS is a classified document that guides budget planning and programming across multiple Future Year Defense Programs (FYDP). All strategies focus on countering the perceived threat from Russia and China as competitors to the United States, requiring a return to great power competition. The strategies aim to refocus the Army's modernization efforts on countering the perceived Chinese and Russian military threat. A common oversight architecture could provide continuity for evaluating progress. Key topics for congressional consideration include the appropriateness, achievability, and affordability of the Army's Modernization Strategy. The Army's modernization strategy aims to address future challenges and align with the 2018 National Defense Strategy. However, the Commission on the National Defense Strategy questions the unity among senior leaders in supporting the NDS objectives through readiness, force structure, and modernization priorities. This raises concerns about how modernization plans align with the National Defense Strategy. The Army's modernization strategy aims to align with the National Defense Strategy, but there are concerns about how it directly supports the goal of \"return to great power competition\" with Russia and China. A detailed examination of this alignment with national security and military strategies is needed to ensure effectiveness. The modernization strategy considers military strategies of peer competitors like Russia and China, focusing on anti-access/area denial systems. Both countries have rapidly deployable conventional forces to exploit weaknesses in these systems. Despite their advances, they are aware that a full response from the U.S. would lead to their defeat. Their goal is to provoke the U.S. into a restrained response to secure their objectives. The ideal offensive strategy for peer competitors like Russia and China is to engage in limited war tactics, such as the fait accompli, to secure their gains without provoking a full response from the United States. This approach involves seizing territory before the defender can react sufficiently, making a counterattack too risky and aggressive for the U.S. to mount. If executed skillfully in regions like the Baltics or Taiwan, this strategy could effectively checkmate the United States. The U.S. military needs to shift its strategy to be able to delay, degrade, and deny an adversary's attempt to establish a fait accompli at the beginning of hostilities. This requires immediate ability to blunt enemy attacks and defeat their strategy without overwhelming dominance. New systems developed as part of the Army's Modernization Strategy must support Multi Domain Operations (MDO) to counter Russia and China. The U.S. military must develop new systems to support Multi Domain Operations (MDO) to counter Russia and China. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates emphasized the complexity and unpredictability of future warfare, highlighting various security challenges beyond Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. military's track record in predicting future military engagements has been imperfect, with past missions from Vietnam to Iraq being unforeseen. There is a possibility that direct confrontations with Russia or China may not occur as anticipated, with potential clashes in the form of proxy wars instead. The recent U.S.-Iranian confrontation serves as an example of non-great power military challenges with the potential for escalation. This unpredictability highlights the need for new systems to support Multi Domain Operations to counter security challenges beyond Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army's Modernization Strategy aims to ensure readiness for potential adversaries beyond China and Russia, focusing on land dominance in various conflicts. It is crucial for the strategy to align with other Service branches for a joint war-fighting concept. The Army's Modernization Strategy aims to ensure readiness for potential adversaries beyond China and Russia, focusing on land dominance in various conflicts. A joint war-fighting concept is essential for aligning strategies across all Services, but currently, there is no agreed concept. The Army promotes Multi-Domain Operations (MDO), while the Air Force focuses on Multi Domain Command and Control, the Navy on Distributed Maritime Operations, and the Marine Corps on the Marine Corps Operating Concept. Despite differences in approach, a common joint warfighting concept could still be agreed upon. The Army's modernization programs are aligned with the Air Force and Navy, but there is no common joint warfighting concept. Congress may need to examine the relationship between the Services' modernization strategies to ensure they are complementary. Army officials have identified 31 modernization initiatives to support the Army's priorities. The Army has identified 31 modernization initiatives to support its priorities, including Long Range Precision Fires, Next Generation Combat Vehicle, Robotic Combat Vehicle, Future Vertical Lift, Air And Missile Defense, and Soldier Lethality. Key initiatives include Strategic Long Range Cannon, Precision Strike Missile, Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, Maneuver Short-Range Air defense, and Next Generation Squad Weapons. The Army has 31 modernization initiatives, including Next Generation Squad Weapons, in various stages of development. Questions arise about the survivability of the modernization effort if one or more initiatives fail. It is important to determine the essential systems and capabilities needed for successful implementation of Multi-Domain Operations. The Army's modernization priorities, including rapid maneuver and overwhelming fires, aim to make Soldiers more lethal. $16.1B in legacy equipment programs were identified for reinvestment in 31 critical systems for Multi-Domain Operations. Defense experts have questioned the Army's modernization priorities. Defense experts have questioned the Army's modernization priorities, suggesting different priorities such as long-range precision fires, network improvement, air and missile defense, soldier lethality, next-generation combat vehicles, and future vertical lift. The Army's modernization priorities have been questioned by defense experts, with suggestions for different priorities such as long-range precision fires, network improvement, air and missile defense, soldier lethality, next-generation combat vehicles, and future vertical lift. The need to re-evaluate these priorities is highlighted by recent world events, such as the September 14, 2019 attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, which exposed vulnerabilities in U.S. forces' ability to address threats from unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles. This may warrant a reprioritization of Army air and missile defense. The Army's modernization priorities, including air and missile defense, may need to be reprioritized in response to evolving threats. Army Futures Command is tasked with integrating future operational environments and technologies to develop and deliver future force requirements. Collaboration across the entire Army is essential for continuous modernization. Army Futures Command (AFC), under HQDA's strategic direction, develops future concepts and organizational designs based on the future operating environment. AFC collaborates with modernization stakeholders to integrate solutions into the operational force. Concerns have been raised in Congress regarding AFC's relationship with the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisitions, Logistics, and Technology (ASA (ALT)), who plays a key role in acquisition program planning and resourcing. The Senate Appropriations Committee has directed the Army to clearly define modernization responsibilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee in 2020 directed the Army to define modernization responsibilities. Concerns were raised about the roles of Army Futures Command (AFC) and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics & Technology) (ASA(ALT)), including duplication of roles and funding decisions being directed by AFC instead of ASA(ALT). The Senate Appropriations Committee directed the Army to clarify modernization responsibilities, specifically regarding the roles of Army Futures Command (AFC) and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics & Technology) (ASA(ALT)). The Committee emphasized ASA(ALT)'s statutory role in planning and resourcing acquisition programs and requested a report outlining the roles and relationships between ASA(ALT) and AFC within 90 days. This report should detail responsibilities throughout the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution phases. The Army is focused on modernization with AFC playing a key role. Questions remain about AFC's value and its impact on other Army organizations. The Army aims to have a \"MDO ready force by 2035\" assuming a flat budget, constant demand, R&D advancements, and adversary programs staying on track. It is unclear if \"MDO ready\" means a fully modernized Army. The Army aimed to have a \"MDO ready force by 2035\" with uncertainties about what level of modernization is needed. Plans to field the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) by 2026 were canceled, potentially delaying full fielding to Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs) beyond 2046 without increased budgetary resources. Some policymakers question if full Army modernization by 2035 is feasible due to adversary modernization, complexity of initiatives, and force structure changes needed to support Multi-Domain Operations (MDO). Army officials plan major force structure changes within five years to align with new weapons systems, potentially deactivating or converting existing units. Questions arise on the need for new units, deactivation of existing ones, required endstrength, and budget implications for Army Modernization. Army officials have eliminated, reduced, or consolidated almost 200 legacy weapon systems to shift over $30 billion to modernization priorities. The budget review process, known as \"Night Court,\" initiated by then-Army Secretary Mark Esper, will continue to yield savings with acknowledged uncertainty in budget assumptions. Army officials have shifted over $30 billion to modernization priorities by eliminating, reducing, or consolidating almost 200 legacy weapon systems. Army Lieutenant General James Pasquarette expresses concerns about budget assumptions and the need to make hard choices to protect future readiness amidst uncertainties in long-term costs for modernization priorities. Some policymakers and observers have raised questions about the underestimated bills for future resource allocation. The Army has shifted over $30 billion to modernization priorities by eliminating legacy weapon systems. Some policymakers and observers question the affordability of the Army's modernization strategy. The Army requested $8.9 billion for modernization programs in FY2020, reflecting a significant increase from the previous year. For FY2020, the Army requested $38.7 billion for acquisition, with $8.9 billion allocated to modernization priorities, accounting for 23% of the budget. Policymakers are questioning how funding for modernization programs is identified and why it represents a small share of the overall budget. The Army is facing questions about allocating more budget towards its six modernization priorities, including challenges and timing for full resource allocation. There are debates on the distribution of funds between modernization priorities, current acquisition programs, and legacy programs. Some programs like Future Vertical Lift received higher funding increases in FY2020 compared to others. The FY2020 unfunded priorities list included funding for modernization and lethality requirements, raising concerns about funding constraints. The Army projected a significant increase in funding for its modernization priorities over the FYDP from FY2020 through FY2024, with $57.3 billion allocated for RDT&E and procurement. This represents a 137% increase from the FY2019 budget request. However, funding for these priorities only accounts for 31% of the Army's overall acquisition budget for the FY2020 FYDP. The Army's acquisition budget for its modernization priorities is under scrutiny, with questions raised about funding assumptions, potential changes in planned funding levels, tradeoffs or divestments needed, and possible program cuts. The Army's acquisition accounts have seen fluctuations in funding levels over past decades. The Army's acquisition budget has seen fluctuations in funding levels over past decades, with spikes during periods of conflict like the Korean War, Vietnam War, and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Non-war peaks include the Cold War era in FY1985, when the Army received $48.7 billion for RDT&E and procurement, leading to the introduction of key acquisition programs. The Army's combined RDT&E and procurement funding is projected to decline from $38.7 billion in FY2020 to $34.3 billion in FY2024. This represents a decrease of $4.4 billion (11%) over the FYDP. Despite the decrease, the FY2024 level would still be higher than the Army's historical average of $32.2 billion for RDT&E and procurement. Policymakers may need to consider how this funding decrease could impact the Army's modernization strategy and what tradeoffs or divestments the Army plans to make. The Army's RDT&E and procurement funding is projected to decline from $38.7 billion in FY2020 to $34.3 billion in FY2024, a decrease of $4.4 billion. Policymakers need to consider the impact on the Army's modernization strategy and potential tradeoffs or divestments. Army budget allocation decisions may affect its ability to execute its modernization strategy. The Army's Operations and Maintenance (O&M) account covers salaries, benefits, training, and purchases. In FY1985, O&M accounted for 28% of the budget, now it's 41%. Procurement was 26% in 1985, now 14%. Questions for policymakers include the impact of changes in military personnel and O&M spending on the Army's modernization strategy. The Army is reviewing ways to control military personnel and maintenance costs to allocate more funds for RDT&E and procurement in support of its modernization strategy. The Army has an outstanding balance of $120.6 billion for current major defense acquisition programs, with the CH-47F Chinook Block II modernization program having an estimated balance of $25.9 billion. The Army's major defense acquisition programs include the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), and CH-47F Chinook Block II modernization program with estimated balances totaling $58.4 billion. Funding details can be seen in Figures 3 and 4 of the FY2020 President's budget request. The Army's FY2020 President's budget request includes proposed reductions in funding for modernization programs like the JLTV and AMPV to prioritize new modernization initiatives. Some programs related to the Army's modernization priorities have been designated as pre-MDAPs, such as Future Vertical Lift. The Army plans to gradually equip units with new technology before fully implementing them. Policymakers may question how the Army's modernization priorities align with current major defense programs. The Army's modernization priorities may impact funding for current major defense acquisition programs. Congressional oversight may face challenges as the Army develops new technologies. An oversight framework evaluating relevance, feasibility, and affordability could benefit budgetary activities."
