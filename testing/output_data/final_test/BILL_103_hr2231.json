    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Women's Human Rights Protection Act of 1993\". Congressional Declaration. The Congress finds that a special assistant should be designated within the State Department to promote international women's human rights within the overall human rights policy of the United States Government. This assistant is not meant to segregate women's rights issues but to ensure they are considered alongside other human rights issues in foreign policy development, as gender-based discrimination and violence against women have been historically overlooked in the human rights and foreign policy fields. The Congress proposes appointing a designated women's human rights advocate within the State Department to integrate women's human rights issues into US human rights policy. This advocate would ensure that abuses against women are considered in determining recipients for US bilateral assistance and votes at multilateral development banks. They would also collaborate with State Department regional bureaus to develop strategies. The proposed women's human rights advocate within the State Department would work with international organizations to increase visibility of gender-based persecution and violence in multilateral fora. They would also ensure that the United States Trade Representative takes steps to prevent countries engaging in violence or discrimination against women from receiving benefits. The advocate would work to prevent countries from receiving trade benefits if they fail to address violence and discrimination against women. They would also ensure women's human rights are protected in US-funded democracy programs. The advocate aims to secure funding for programs addressing women victims of human rights abuses, including medical and psychological assistance for rape victims, and to ensure US ratification of the United Nations Convention on women's rights. The advocate aims to upgrade the quality and quantity of information about abuses of women's human rights in reporting from US embassies overseas, incorporating it in various public statements and documents. The Secretary of State must report to Congress within one year on progress towards creating a new position or fulfilling objectives outlined in the Act. Additionally, if the CEDAW has not been submitted for ratification, a report on the administration's position and timetable for submission must be provided within 90 days of the Act's enactment."
