Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on the educational stability of children in foster care. This new provision requires local educational agencies to ensure educational stability for children in foster care by designating a point of contact for child welfare agencies. Each State educational agency receiving assistance under part A must collaborate with the State child welfare agency to ensure educational stability for children in foster care, including attending the school of origin unless it is determined to be in the child's best interest to attend a different school. Children in foster care have the right to attend their school of origin for the remainder of the school year. If it's in their best interest to attend a different school, they must be immediately enrolled, even without required records. Records transfer should occur as usual. Records transfer for children in foster care must be maintained and available when entering a new school, including immunization, health, academic records, and individualized education programs. Transfer should be immediate, even if fees are owed. Each State receiving assistance under part A must ensure that a plan is implemented by local educational agencies to facilitate credit transfer and diplomas for children in foster care changing schools. This includes transferring school credits, receiving partial credits for completed coursework, and providing opportunities for academic continuity. The Increasing Educational Stability for Children in Foster Care Act ensures that children in foster care have opportunities to recover lost school credits and receive a secondary school diploma even if they change schools. Additionally, the State educational agency must provide transportation for children in foster care attending their schools of origin. The agreement ensures that children in foster care receive transportation to their schools of origin, using foster care maintenance payments. It also outlines how children leaving foster care will continue to receive transportation to stay in their original schools if it is in their best interest. Each local educational agency must designate a point of contact. Each educational agency in the State designates a point of contact for child welfare agencies to oversee implementation of requirements. State educational agencies also designate a point of contact for child welfare agencies. State educational agencies designate a point of contact to oversee the implementation of requirements, excluding the State's Coordinator for Education of Homeless Children and Youths unless they can handle both roles effectively. \"SEC. 1602.
