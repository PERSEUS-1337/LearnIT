    "content": "The Act is titled the \"State and Local Government Economic Empowerment Act\". It includes findings related to economic empowerment. The Congress finds that money is created in the domestic economy by banks through deposit expansion, predating the national banking system and the Federal Reserve. Constitutional authority allows the Federal Government to create and regulate money beyond coins, currency, and debt creation. The Federal Government has the authority to create noninterest-bearing credit funds for approved programs, allowing projects to be built at a lower cost and more necessary projects to be completed. Building projects with noninterest-bearing credit funds will allow more necessary projects to be completed at a lower cost, while also creating additional wealth in the communities where the projects are located. The creation of money is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of the Treasury will have money available for this Act based on the US population and $1,400 per person. A Loan Agreement between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve will provide up to $360 billion over 5 years. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay an annual fee to the Board to cover administrative costs incurred in acting as the agent of the Administrator. The amount of the fee will be negotiated and charged to recipients of noninterest bearing loans made under the Act. Any amount made available under the Act will be treated as money created in the sovereign capacity of the United States. The Act does not authorize the expenditure of tax revenue or borrowed funds by the government. It also specifies that certain budget provisions do not apply to the Act. The Act of 1990 specifies that money created under this section and the interest-free loan program established shall not be treated as revenue or budget authority. The Act of 1990 specifies that money created under this section shall not be subject to apportionment, sequestration, or taken into account in the determination of the baseline for any fiscal year. The disbursement of money created under this section shall not be treated as an outlay or a budget outlay. Additionally, no provision of this Act shall affect the authority of the Board to adjust bank reserve requirements. SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATION OF THE ACT.
