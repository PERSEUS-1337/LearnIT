    "content": "The Act titled \"Defined Benefit Pension Plan Reform Act of 2003\" includes a section on the emergency investment loss rule for multiemployer plans. The Defined Benefit Pension Plan Reform Act of 2003 introduces an emergency investment loss method for multiemployer plans under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This method allows plans to elect to use the emergency investment loss method instead of amortizing net experience loss, starting from the first plan year with an emergency investment loss occurring after July 1, 1999. The Defined Benefit Pension Plan Reform Act of 2003 introduced the emergency investment loss method for multiemployer plans under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This method allows plans to elect to use it instead of amortizing net experience loss, starting from the first plan year with an emergency investment loss occurring after July 1, 1999. The method calculates the difference between the fair market value of the plan's assets at the end of the plan year and the projected investment return based on the actuarial interest rate. The funding standard account is charged to amortize the plan's emergency investment loss over 30 years in equal annual installments. The emergency investment loss for a year will increase the determined net experience loss for that year, and any excess will be treated as a net experience gain. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 allows multiemployer plans to elect the emergency investment loss method instead of amortizing net experience loss. An emergency investment loss is calculated based on the difference between the fair market value of the plan's assets and the value that would have been determined based on the plan's earnings. The funding standard account is charged to amortize the plan's emergency investment loss over 30 years in equal annual installments. If an election is in effect, any net experience gain is increased by the emergency investment loss for that year. The Secretary of the Treasury will prescribe a procedure for multiemployer plans to elect the emergency investment loss method. This method allows for the reduction of net experience loss by the emergency investment loss, with any excess being treated as a net experience gain.

Employees classified as white-collar workers must use prescribed tables for all plans unless prohibited by regulations. This is an amendment to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
