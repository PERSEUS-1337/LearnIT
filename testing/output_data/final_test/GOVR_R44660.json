    "content": "This report discusses appropriations for the components of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in FY2017, including the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), the Office of Health Affairs (OHA), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). It covers the Obama Administration's FY2017 request, appropriations proposed by committees, and those enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 and the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017. The report provides information on provisions in bills and reports affecting homeland security appropriations, focusing on discretionary funding amounts. It does not analyze mandatory funding issues or follow legislation related to DHS program authorization. The Appendix explains budgetary concepts like budget authority, obligations, and discretionary spending. The curr_chunk discusses terms related to appropriations process and budget authority, with calculations based on unrounded data. The amounts in narrative discussions are generally rounded to the nearest million. Data for FY2016 and FY2017 are derived from a single source. The curr_chunk discusses the reliance on the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 and the Common Appropriations Structure for DHS in preparing the report for FY2016 and FY2017. It also mentions the authority provided in P.L. 114-113 for DHS to submit its FY2017 appropriations request under the new structure. The FY2017 DHS appropriations request was structured into four categories: Operations and Support; Procurement, Construction, and Improvement; Research and Development; and Federal Assistance. The Coast Guard was an exception as it was transitioning to a new financial system. The House Appropriations Committee used the CAS structure for funding recommendations, while the Senate Appropriations Committee stuck to the FY2016 structure. The Committee proposal in the CAS structure and Senate Appropriations Committee proposal in the legacy structure are publicly available. The explanatory statement for Division F of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, included a \"detail table\" outlining the new structure of DHS appropriations, Programs, Projects, and Activities (PPAs). The table showed FY2016 enacted and FY2017 requested funding for DHS in the new structure for comparisons. The homeland security appropriations bill allocates resources to every departmental component, with discretionary appropriations providing the majority of annual funding for DHS operations. The DHS budget includes overseas contingency operations funding, fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. Appropriations measures are typically organized into five titles, covering various components such as Departmental Management, Security, Enforcement, Investigations, Protection, Preparedness, Response, Recovery, and Research and Development. A sixth title was added in FY2017 to address the Trump Administration's supplemental appropriations request. The Obama Administration's annual appropriations request for DHS components is visually represented in a pie chart. The Protection, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery title (Title III) of the FY2017 DHS appropriations bill is the second largest and includes most grant funding provided by DHS. The Obama Administration requested $5.69 billion for NPPD and FEMA in FY2017, which was $718 million less than FY2016. The Obama Administration proposed consolidating OHA into a new office funded in Title IV, leading to a reduction in the request for Title III. The Senate Appropriations Committee would have provided $6.58 billion in net discretionary budget authority, $898 million more than requested. The House Appropriations Committee would have provided $6.44 billion, $753 million more than requested. The Obama Administration proposed consolidating OHA into a new office funded in Title IV, leading to a reduction in the request for Title III. H.R. 5634 included the reorganization of OHA and requested disaster relief funding. President Obama signed into law a continuing resolution funding the government through April 28, 2017. This was superseded by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, which includes the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 included the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017 as Division F, providing $41.3 billion in annual appropriations and $6.7 billion for disaster relief under the Stafford Act. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 allocated $6.7 billion for disaster relief under the Stafford Act and $163 million for overseas contingency operations. The explanatory statement emphasized the importance of language from House and Senate reports in the appropriations conference, especially in cases without a direct procedural link between bills. The Trump Administration requested $7.85 billion in supplemental funding for FY2017, with $7.4 billion designated for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The House passed the relief package as an amendment to H.R. 601 on September 6, 2017. The House and Senate passed a relief package for disaster relief, including additional funding for HUD's Community Development Fund and a short-term increase to the debt limit. The bill became P.L. 115-56 on September 8, 2017. Table 1 provides a funding history for various components funded under Protection, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery. The table includes funding information for Title III and supplemental appropriations for FEMA's DRF under P.L. 115-56. Separate lines show total funding within Title III and additional supplemental appropriations for the DRF. The NPPD in the Department of Homeland Security leads national efforts on information sharing and risk mitigation. The NPPD in the Department of Homeland Security focuses on information sharing, risk mitigation, and protection efforts for national infrastructure resilience and cybersecurity. It is organized into five offices, with a significant portion of its budget allocated to cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget proposed transferring elements of NPPD to other parts of DHS. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget proposed transferring OBIM to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Office of Bombing Prevention to the new CBRNE Office. Congress did not authorize the transfers, so funding for these offices remains in the NPPD appropriations. The budget request for NPPD in FY2016 was $3.04 billion, with $1.45 billion for FPS. The rest of NPPD had a budget request of $1.59 billion, $47 million less than FY2016. The Obama Administration proposed transferring the Office of Bombing Prevention (OBP) to the new Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives (CBRNE) office in the FY2017 budget. The total FY2017 request for all elements of NPPD, including OBIM and OBP, was $1.91 billion in net discretionary budget authority, which was $272 million more than FY2016. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3001 included $1.82 billion for NPPD, $230 million more than the Administration's request. House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 5634 included $1.76 billion for NPPD. The House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 5634 included $1.76 billion in net discretionary budget authority for NPPD, $167 million more than requested by the Administration. The funding level for NPPD in H.R. 5634 was $120 million more than in FY2016. The enacted annual DHS appropriations bill included $1.82 billion for NPPD, $230 million more than requested. The FY2017 funding for NPPD is $183 million more than in FY2016. There was a proposal to reorganize NPPD into the Cyber and Infrastructure Protection Agency (CIPA) but it was not authorized in P.L. 115-31. The new structure would have three primary elements and seven support elements. Both the House and Senate committee-reported appropriation bills did not authorize the reorganization. The proposed reorganization of NPPD into the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Agency was not authorized by P.L. 115-31. Alternative proposals in the 114th Congress included creating four subelements within the directorate. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2017 aimed to establish CISA as a new agency within DHS to handle cybersecurity and infrastructure security responsibilities. The Office of Biometric Identity Management would be transferred to the Management Directorate, and the Federal Protective Service would be moved to another component. OBIM provides biometric identification services to various government partners by offering technology for collecting and storing biometric data. The House and Senate appropriation bills do not authorize the proposed reorganization, expressing concerns over the governance of the office. The House and Senate expressed concerns over the governance of the Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM). The House report withheld $122 million, while the Senate report allocated $52 million for OBIM's new technology platform. Both reports called for stakeholder input to be addressed and periodic briefings to the committee. P.L. 115-31 provided $235 million for OBIM, $11.6 million below the requested level due to delays in the HART program. Appropriators withheld $20 million until the department briefs on facial recognition and biometrics implementation. The House and Senate committees expressed concerns over the governance of the Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM) and recommended lower funding due to staffing issues. The House committee noted challenges in filling key vacancies, especially in cyber skills, while the Senate committee cited unrealistic staffing levels. Both committees recommended reduced funding to align hiring and attrition, with the House Appropriations Committee suggesting funding for special cyber pay and bonuses but overall funding almost $6 million and 345 FTE below the request. The appropriations act recommended funding less than the requested 2,289 FTEs for non-FPS elements of NPPD due to underexecution against authorized personnel levels. However, funding was kept in place with pay flexibilities to recruit and retain a cybersecurity workforce. Both committees suggested increases for cybersecurity activities but at a lower level than the Obama Administration's FY2017 request. Two major cybersecurity programs for NPPD are the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) and the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigations program (CDM). The National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) is a program aimed at enhancing federal agency security on the public Internet. It includes tools like EINSTEIN for network security. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not specify funding for NCPS, while the House recommended $471 million. The Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigations program (CDM) involves NPPD procuring sensors for agencies to scan their networks and prioritize cybersecurity measures. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $247 million for the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigations (CDM) program, $18 million below the request. The House Appropriations Committee suggested reducing procurement funding for CDM by $102 million. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) collects and disseminates cybersecurity risk information to critical infrastructure and government partners. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an increase in overall NCCIC activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an increase in overall NCCIC activities, but the increase is less than requested due to slower hiring. The House report suggested a reduction in NCCIC funding of $26 million. P.L. 115-31 provides $970 million for cybersecurity, with higher funding levels for FY2017 compared to FY2016, but less than the department-requested amount. Cybersecurity Operations and Support funding is 12.3% greater than in FY2016, while Procurement funding is 58.2% greater, mainly due to increased funding for CDM tools and sensors. In FY2017, funding for CDM tools and sensors in NPPD increased by 123.1%. Research and development funding remained flat. NPPD is directed to develop a strategic plan for securing federal networks, with agencies assuming security costs. The Office of Health Affairs coordinates DHS programs with a public health or medical component, including FEMA operations and medical care at ICE detention facilities. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees various programs, including BioWatch and the National Biosurveillance Integration Center. The Obama Administration proposed reorganizing OHA into a new CBRNE Office in FY2017. This reorganization would also include the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office and parts of other departments. The Obama Administration proposed reorganizing the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) into a new CBRNE Office in FY2017. S. 3001 did not fund the proposed CBRNE Office and recommended funding levels for components in the current DHS structure. S. 3001 would have provided $108 million for OHA, $17 million less than FY2016. House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 5634 did not specify an appropriations amount for OHA. Division F of P.L. 115-31 provided $124 million for OHA. The Obama Administration proposed reorganizing the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) into a new CBRNE Office in FY2017. Division F of P.L. 115-31 provided $124 million for OHA, with $2 million withheld until OHA submits a plan for early detection of bioterrorism events. The BioWatch program, which detects bioterrorism pathogens in U.S. cities, accounts for most of OHA's budget. Despite efforts to deploy more advanced sensors, DHS terminated procurement activities in 2014. The Obama Administration requested $82 million for BioWatch in FY2017, with the Senate committee recommending $12 million less for the program. The House committee expressed concern about the current system's effectiveness and directed DHS to articulate future technology requirements. The Obama Administration requested $82 million for BioWatch in FY2017, with the Senate committee recommending $12 million less. DHS is urged to clarify future technology requirements for the program to private sector innovators. FEMA's primary mission is to reduce loss of life and property from all hazards. FEMA executes its mission through various activities, providing assistance to state and local governments for incident response, recovery, and mitigation. The Obama Administration requested $4.12 billion for FEMA in FY2017, which was $546 million less than the previous year. FEMA's budget includes funding for major disasters declared by the President and the National. The Obama Administration requested $4.12 billion for FEMA in FY2017, which was $546 million less than the previous year. S. 3001 and H.R. 5634 included funding for major disasters, with S. 3001 providing $4.68 billion and H.R. 5634 providing $4.71 billion in net discretionary budget authority for FEMA. The Senate bill was $560 million more than requested, while the House bill was $585 million more than requested. Both bills also included the requested $6.7 billion for the cost of major disasters. The House bill included $6.7 billion for major disasters, while P.L. 115-31 provided $4.72 billion for FEMA, exceeding the Obama Administration's request. The Trump Administration later requested $7.85 billion for FEMA in FY2017, with the House and Senate passing relief packages including additional funding for disaster relief and a short-term increase to the debt limit. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is the main account used to fund emergency and disaster assistance. It is a no-year account with unused budget authority carried over. Funding for activities not directly tied to major disasters is also provided. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is the main account used to fund emergency and disaster assistance. It has two categories of funding: one for disasters under the Stafford Act and another for major disasters under the Stafford Act. The Budget Control Act allows costs for major disasters to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps. In FY2017, the Obama Administration requested $7,348 million in discretionary budget authority for the DRF, with $639 million for the base and $6,709 million for major disasters. Additionally, a $24 million transfer was requested to the DHS Office of Inspector General. The Trump Administration requested a $24 million transfer from the DRF to the DHS Office of Inspector General for oversight of disaster relief activities, which was $26 million less than FY2016. The requested amount was included in the House- and Senate-reported bills, but Division F of P.L. 115-31 did not transfer any resources. In September 2017, $7.85 billion in supplemental funding was requested for FY2017, with $7.4 billion for the DRF provided in P.L. 115-56 as emergency funding. Before the enactment of the BCA, DRF funds often ran low to meet federal disaster assistance needs. Since the enactment of the BCA, annual appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund have increased, reducing the need for supplemental funding. Only two supplemental appropriations bills have been enacted since FY2012, with the first providing relief after Hurricane Sandy. Hurricane Sandy led to the use of over $7.5 billion from the Disaster Relief Fund for immediate assistance. The Obama Administration later requested additional funding for response, recovery, and mitigation efforts. Before Hurricane Harvey hit Texas in 2017, the DRF had around $3.5 billion in unobligated resources. To conserve funds, FEMA implemented restrictions on funding for long-term projects. As of September 1, the DRF had less than $2 billion in unobligated resources. The DRF had less than $2 billion in unobligated resources on September 1. The Trump Administration requested supplemental appropriations for response and recovery needs. Having a larger balance allowed the Obama Administration and Congress more time to assess federal assistance needs. Some argue that a healthy balance is beneficial, while others question budgetary practices for the DRF. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Grant Program, funded at varying levels over the years, allows for mitigation actions without a preceding disaster event. The program is cost-shared on a 75% federal and 25% state and local basis. PDM funds can be used for projects and planning. The Obama Administration's budget requests for the program fluctuated, with a substantial increase in FY2016 to $200 million, of which $100 million was appropriated. In FY2017, the Obama Administration requested $54 million for the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Grant Program, which was ultimately funded at $100 million in P.L. 115-31. The House Appropriations Committee noted FEMA's carryover funding and both House and Senate reports addressed mitigation efforts. The House committee raised concerns about states considering county proposals in their mitigation plans. The House Appropriations Committee directed FEMA to provide guidance on mitigation grants within 90 days of passage, focusing on projects benefiting large population centers. The committee also addressed the use of FEMA funds for \"safe room\" structures in tornado-prone areas. The House Appropriations Committee recommended FEMA consider adopting national guidelines for safe room design in federally-funded structures prone to severe weather hazards. The Senate Appropriations Committee called for a strategy to prioritize Federal resources for mitigation policy. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed FEMA to develop an annual report identifying end users of grants, how funding is used, and cost-benefit analysis for disaster resilience projects. This was in response to concerns raised by GAO after Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed FEMA to maximize mitigation funding through private-public partnerships in high-risk areas like the Cascadia subduction zone. State and local governments have primary responsibility for public safety functions, including homeland security operations, which have become increasingly important due to terrorist threats. State and local governments may reduce resources for homeland security preparedness due to budget constraints, impacting national preparedness. Prior to 9/11, federal grant programs were available for state and local governments. Additional grant programs have since been added to enhance preparedness. Several additional homeland security grant programs were introduced to boost state and local preparedness, such as SHSGP, CCP, UASI, REAL ID, Stonegarden, RCPG, Transit Security Grants, Port Security Grants, Over-the-Road Bus Security Assistance, BZPP, IECGP, and EOC. Some of these programs are no longer funded, while others are still mentioned in appropriations reports or incorporated into larger grant programs without explicit congressional action. The Obama Administration requested $857 million for state and local grant programs for FY2017, which is $460 million less than the previous year. Despite structural differences in legislation, comparisons can still be made between proposed and enacted funding. The Obama Administration did not propose a single block grant for preparedness grants in FY2017. S. 3001 allocated $1.32 billion for state and local preparedness grant programs, while H.R. 5634 allocated $1 million less. P.L. 115-31 appropriated $1.31 billion for preparedness grants, including $41 million for law enforcement costs for Presidential residences. No regional competitive grant program was included. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER grants, a 2.9% reduction from FY2016. The AFG and SAFER grant accounts would be transferred to FEMA's Preparedness and Protection activity. Fire service groups oppose this transfer, fearing a shift towards terrorism response over all-hazards focus. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill proposed $680 million in firefighter assistance, with $340 million each for AFG and SAFER grants, a 1.4% reduction from FY2016. The bill retained a separate budget account for Firefighter Assistance and directed DHS to continue funding applications according to local priorities and USFA guidelines. The House Appropriations Committee-reported bill would have provided $690 million in funding. The House Appropriations Committee-reported bill allocated $690 million for firefighter assistance in FY2017, with $345 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. The bill transferred the Firefighter Assistance budget account to a broader Federal Assistance account in FEMA, directing FEMA to continue administering the fire grants programs as in previous years. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 also provided $690 million for firefighter assistance, transferring the account to FEMA's Federal Assistance account. The DHS appropriations act provides direction for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) funding, with premiums transferred to FEMA's National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF) for specified purposes. Congress also supplements floodplain mapping activities with discretionary appropriations. In FY2016 and FY2017, Congress authorized budget authority for NFIP activities. Mandatory spending fluctuates annually to cover claims on NFIP policies. FEMA was authorized to borrow up to $30.425 billion from the U.S. Treasury for NFIP purposes, but this was reduced to $1 billion after December 8, 2017. After hurricanes in 2017, FEMA informed Congress that NFIP had exhausted its borrowing authority. The NFIP exhausted its borrowing authority on September 20, 2017. The EFS program, established in 1985 at FEMA, aimed to address homelessness as a daily emergency. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved transferring the program to HUD in FY2015. The Obama Administration requested $100 million for EFS in FY2017, with the Senate Appropriations Committee agreeing to the funding. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding the EFS program at $120 million, as included in P.L. 115-31. The Senate agreed to shift the program from FEMA to HUD with conditions, while the House did not recommend transferring funds without a comprehensive plan. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding the EFS program at $120 million in P.L. 115-31. The Senate proposed moving the program directly to HUD with specific conditions outlined in the explanatory statement."
