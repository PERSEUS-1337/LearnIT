Funds will be allocated to compensate producers impacted by these disasters, with expenditures still less than the budget baseline for agriculture in fiscal year 2002. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide emergency financial assistance to producers who have suffered qualifying losses in the 2001 or 2002 crop due to damaging weather. The assistance will be administered in the same manner as specified in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2001. If a producer incurs qualifying crop losses in both the 2001 and 2002 crop years, they must choose to receive assistance for losses in either year, not both. Payment assistance is limited to the estimated value of the crop without losses, including crop insurance or other payments. The Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 allows producers to receive assistance for crop losses, with the value of the crop that was not lost estimated by the Secretary.

INELIGIBILITY FOR PAYMENTS. In this section, insurable commodities are defined as agricultural crops eligible for insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act, while noninsurable commodities are eligible for assistance under another act. Producers on a farm are ineligible for assistance if they did not obtain insurance for insurable commodities. Producers on a farm must obtain insurance for insurable commodities or file paperwork and pay fees for noninsurable commodities to be eligible for assistance. The Secretary may waive this requirement if producers enter into a contract agreeing to obtain insurance. Producers must obtain insurance for insurable commodities or file paperwork and pay fees for noninsurable commodities for the next three crops to be eligible for assistance. Violation of the contract results in reimbursement to the Secretary and imposition of a civil money penalty for insurable commodities. The Secretary may impose a civil money penalty equal to the producer-cost of a 65/100 crop insurance policy on crops where the producer failed to purchase insurance in the past three years. The Secretary will transfer $250,000,000 from the Commodity Credit Corporation to the account under section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935. The funds, facilities, and authorities of the Commodity Credit Corporation will be used to implement this Act. Regulations will be established. The Secretary of Agriculture may issue regulations to implement the Act without following certain procedural requirements. Congressional review of agency rulemaking will be conducted under specific authority."
