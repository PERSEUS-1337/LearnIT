    "content": "SECTION 1. TEACHER RECRUITMENT. Amends Title V of the Higher Education Act of 1965 by adding a new part for Future Math and Science Teacher Recruitment. The 'Recruit and Reward Future Math and Science Teachers of America Act of 1998' aims to address the shortage of qualified math and science teachers in the United States. Congress acknowledges the low rankings of US high school students in science and math globally and the impact of teacher knowledge on student learning. With over 2 million teachers needed to be hired in the next decade, proactive policies are crucial to ensure highly qualified teachers in these fields. The importance of proactive policies to increase funding for teacher training, recruitment, and induction is crucial to address the shortage of qualified math and science teachers in the United States. The purpose of this pilot program is to provide scholarship grants and stipends to outstanding students in teacher training programs committed to teaching math and science at urban or rural secondary schools. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2001. Scholarship designation and selection criteria are outlined in the following section. The National Math and Science Teacher Scholarships are designated for funds under this program. The Secretary of Education may award funds to qualifying higher education institutions with teacher training graduate programs. Institutions can receive up to $100,000 per academic year if they meet accredited standards or show high pass rates for graduates. The program helps new teachers pass State teacher qualification assessments on their first attempt. \"Individual scholarship eligibility under SEC. 599D.\" \"An individual eligible for a National Math and Science Teacher Scholarship must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, majoring in a science or math teacher training program at an accredited institution, and willing to be certified as a teacher.\" To be eligible for the National Math and Science Teacher Scholarship, individuals must commit to teaching math or science in a public secondary school for at least 3 years. The National Math and Science Teacher Scholarship awards $10,000 per student per academic year. The scholarship amount cannot exceed the cost of attendance and does not affect eligibility for other federal student financial assistance. Recipients must commit to teaching math or science in a public secondary school for at least 3 years. Recipients of the National Math and Science Teachers Scholarships must teach in an urban or rural public secondary school for 3 years. Failure to fulfill the agreement results in repayment of scholarship funds plus interest and fees. Exceptions to repayment provisions are outlined. An individual recipient of a Scholarship under this part shall not be considered in violation of the agreement if they are pursuing full-time study in math and science, serving in the armed forces, totally disabled, seeking employment without success, or seeking employment as a math and science teacher. The repayment period for the scholarship shall not exceed 27 months or may be extended under certain conditions set by the Secretary. The Secretary of Education must submit a report to Congress by January 29, 2002, evaluating the National Math and Science Teacher Scholarships pilot program's success in recruiting teachers for public secondary schools."
