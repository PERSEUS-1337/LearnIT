It amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a credit for manufacturing facility costs under section 45S. The \"Scaling Up Manufacturing Act of 2012\" introduces a manufacturing facility expenditure credit for eligible businesses, equal to 25% of qualified construction expenditures. Eligible businesses must be actively engaged in a trade or business, headquartered in the US, with management activities primarily in the US, and have not previously placed a designated manufacturing facility into service. The \"Scaling Up Manufacturing Act of 2012\" offers a manufacturing facility expenditure credit for eligible start-up companies with a rating of B minus or higher from a credit rating agency. A start-up company is defined as a corporation or partnership with gross receipts and qualified research expenses after December 31, 2012.

Qualified facility construction expenditures refer to amounts paid for constructing a facility in the U.S. to manufacture a qualified product. The tax credit under the \"Scaling Up Manufacturing Act of 2012\" allows for the planning and construction of facilities to manufacture qualified products. A qualified product is one that has been produced and sold before facility construction. Special rules apply for recapture events related to taxpayer facilities. The tax credit allows for facility construction for manufacturing qualified products. Special rules apply for recapture events related to taxpayer facilities. The applicable recapture percentage is determined according to a table for facility construction tax credit purposes. The recapture percentage for facility construction tax credit varies depending on the year of the recapture event, starting at 100% in Year 1 and decreasing to 0% in Years 6 and thereafter. The recapture event is defined based on the taxable year when the facility was placed in service. The recapture event occurs if the taxpayer becomes insolvent or disposes of the facility to an ineligible business. There is a special rule for facilities not placed in service within 5 years. The recapture event for a facility occurs if the taxpayer becomes insolvent or transfers the facility to an ineligible business. Qualified facility construction expenditures can be assigned to another person, and the initial taxpayer cannot claim them. Any person assigned qualified facility construction expenditures cannot be claimed by the initial taxpayer. Members of the same controlled group of corporations are treated as one person. References to corporations or partnerships include predecessors. Double benefits are denied if a credit is allowed for any property expenditure. The amendment to the tax code denies double benefits for manufacturing facility expenditures by reducing the basis of the property by the amount of the credit allowed. The credit is also included as part of the general business credit. The tax code amendment reduces property basis by the manufacturing facility credit amount and includes it in the general business credit. Section 1016 of the Code is amended to reflect this change, effective for expenses incurred after the enactment date."
