    "content": "The Pension Protection Act (PPA) of 2008 establishes new rules for determining if a defined benefit pension plan is fully funded and requires companies to prefund pension benefits for employees. Plan sponsors must amortize any underfunded liabilities over time. The law's provisions will be phased in over several years, as pension plan liabilities extend into the future. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 introduces new funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, including rules for calculating plan assets and liabilities. It aims to ensure that pension plans are adequately funded by comparing the present value of liabilities with plan assets. The law also addresses underfunded plans by requiring companies to prefund pension benefits and amortize any deficits over time. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 introduces new rules for calculating plan assets and liabilities, requiring plan funding to be 100% of liabilities. Sponsors of underfunded plans must amortize any unfunded liability over seven years. Special rules will apply to severely underfunded plans, leading to higher employer contributions. Credit balances can be used to offset contributions if the plan is funded at 80% or more, with adjustments for market value changes. Minimum required contributions will be based on the plan's target normal cost. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 requires plan funding to be 100% of liabilities. If a plan's assets are less than the funding target, it has an unfunded liability that must be amortized over seven years. The minimum required annual contribution is based on the plan's target normal cost. The 100% funding target will be phased in gradually from 92% in 2008 to 100% in 2011 and later years. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 mandates that plans must be 100% funded, with a gradual phase-in from 92% in 2008 to 100% in 2011. Plans already underfunded and subject to deficit reduction rules in 2007 will have a 100% funding target in 2008. The Act requires pension plans to use different interest rates to discount future liabilities based on the time until the obligations are due. The Secretary of the Treasury will determine these rates from a \"yield curve.\" The Pension Protection Act of 2008 mandates plans to be 100% funded by 2011, with a gradual phase-in starting from 92% in 2008. The Secretary of the Treasury will determine interest rates based on a \"yield curve\" of corporate bonds averaged over 24 months, replacing the previous four-year average. Plans at risk of defaulting must use specific actuarial assumptions, increasing required contributions if they fail certain funding tests. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 requires plans to be fully funded by 2011, with a gradual increase from 92% in 2008. Plans that are less than 70% funded under worst-case assumptions are deemed at-risk, unless they are at least 80% funded under standard actuarial assumptions. Plans passing these tests must still make up funding shortfalls over a maximum of seven years. Plans in at-risk status for two of the last four years face an additional \"loading factor\" of 4% of liabilities plus $700 per participant. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 requires plans to be fully funded by 2011, with a gradual increase from 92% in 2008. Plans that are less than 70% funded under worst-case assumptions are deemed at-risk. Plans in at-risk status for two of the last four years face an additional \"loading factor\" of 4% of liabilities plus $700 per participant. Plan years prior to 2008 will not count for this determination. Plans with 500 or fewer participants in the preceding year would be exempt from the at-risk funding requirements. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 requires plans to be fully funded by 2011, with a gradual increase from 92% in 2008. Plans that are less than 70% funded under worst-case assumptions are deemed at-risk. Plans in at-risk status for two of the last four years face an additional \"loading factor\" of 4% of liabilities plus $700 per participant. Plans with 500 or fewer participants in the preceding year would be exempt from the at-risk funding requirements. Actuarial valuations allow for asset smoothing over a two-year period, narrowing the range to no less than 90% and no more than 110% of fair market value to reduce volatility in required contributions. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 mandates full funding for plans by 2011, with gradual increases. Plans with fewer than 100 participants use the plan year's start for asset calculations. Credit balances can offset current contributions, but only if assets are at least 80% of the funding target. Adjusted funding target attainment considers credit balances and prefunding balances. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 requires full funding for plans by 2011, with gradual increases. Credit balances must be categorized into balances from 2007 and contributions from 2008 onwards. The Act places limits on plan amendments, benefit accruals, and distribution options for defined benefit plans. Shutdown benefits are negotiated between employers and labor unions and are not prefunded. The Act prohibits shut-down benefits and other contingent event benefits from being paid by underfunded pension plans unless additional contributions are made. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 requires full funding for plans by 2011, with gradual increases. Benefit accruals cease in plans funded below 60%, and plan amendments increasing benefits are prohibited if funded below 80%. Employer contributions are required to fully fund new benefits. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 mandates full funding for plans by 2011, with benefit accruals ceasing in plans funded below 60%. Lump-sum distributions are restricted based on funding levels, and nonqualified plans for executives do not receive favorable tax treatment. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 requires full funding for plans by 2011, with benefit accruals stopping in plans funded below 60%. Nonqualified plans for executives, known as \"nonqualified plans,\" can set aside funds to prefund deferred compensation without it being treated as income, but rules under the PPA apply during restricted periods such as bankruptcy or plan termination. Amounts set aside for the top executives during a restricted period will be taxable income to them. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 requires full funding for plans by 2011, with benefit accruals stopping in plans funded below 60%. Nonqualified plans for executives can set aside funds to prefund deferred compensation without it being treated as income, but rules under the PPA apply during restricted periods such as bankruptcy or plan termination. Amounts set aside for top executives during a restricted period will be taxable income subject to a 20% excise tax. Plan sponsors must notify participants of restrictions on benefits within 30 days. Defined benefit pensions must offer participants the option of receiving accrued benefits as an annuity or lump sum. Lump-sum distributions are inversely related to the interest used to calculate the present value of the benefit. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 requires full funding for plans by 2011, with benefit accruals stopping in plans funded below 60%. Lump-sum distributions from defined benefit plans are now calculated using a three-segment interest rate yield curve based on investment-grade corporate bonds. Different interest rates are used for participants of different ages, with older workers receiving lower interest rates for their lump-sum distributions. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 requires full funding for plans by 2011, with benefit accruals stopping in plans funded below 60%. Lump-sum distributions from defined benefit plans are now calculated using a three-segment interest rate yield curve based on investment-grade corporate bonds. Older workers will receive larger lump sums than younger workers due to lower interest rates. Plans funded below 60% cannot pay lump sums, while those funded at 60% to 80% can pay up to half of an accrued benefit as a lump sum. The new rules for calculating lump sums will be phased in over five years. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 mandates full funding for plans by 2011, with benefit accruals ceasing in plans funded below 60%. Lump-sum distributions from defined benefit plans are now calculated using a three-segment interest rate yield curve. Cash balance plans are not discriminatory against older workers if benefits are fully vested after three years and interest credits do not exceed a market rate of return. The law also ensures that the age discrimination test is met if a participant's accrued benefit is not less than any other. The law prohibits wear-away of benefits accrued before the conversion of a plan to a cash balance plan if the conversion occurred after June 29, 2005. Earlier conversions may still be subject to legal challenge under the laws in effect at the time of the conversion. These provisions are effective beginning in 2008. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 eliminates the requirement for employers to pay departing employees an amount exceeding the nominal value of their cash balance account. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 eliminates the requirement for employers to pay departing employees an amount exceeding the nominal value of their cash balance account. It also allows lump-sum distributions from cash balance plans to be equal to hypothetical account balances, effective for distributions made after the date of enactment. Beginning in 2008, cash balance plans and other hybrid plans must fully vest participants in their accrued benefits after no more than three years of service. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures pension benefits under private-sector defined benefit pension plans and is funded by premiums paid by plan sponsors and investment returns. The PBGC receives premiums from employer-sponsored plans, including a per-capita premium and a variable premium based on underfunding. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 increased the per capita premium to $30 per year, indexed to wage growth. Multiemployer plans have a flat-rate premium of $8 per person, also indexed to wage growth. Under the PPA, underfunded plans are no longer exempt from the variable premium. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) requires a variable premium to be assessed on all underfunded plans, regardless of their funding status in previous years. For small employers with 25 or fewer employees, the variable premium is capped at $5. The PPA also makes permanent a surcharge premium for certain distress terminations, with a surcharge of $1,250 per participant for three years for firms that terminate underfunded pension plans during bankruptcy. Additionally, the PPA authorizes the PBGC to pay interest on overpayment of premiums and requires the director of the PBGC to be appointed by the President, subject to Senate confirmation. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) establishes limits on employer tax deductions for contributions to defined benefit plans, with a maximum deductible contribution formula based on the plan's target normal cost, funding target, and future pay or benefit increases. Contributions exceeding this limit are subject to a 10% excise tax. The PPA also repeals the alternative maximum deductible contribution calculation method using a specific interest rate. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) establishes limits on employer tax deductions for contributions to defined benefit plans. Large contributions to a defined benefit plan can make employer contributions to a defined contribution plan nondeductible. The PPA revises the law to determine the combined contribution limit without considering defined benefit plans insured by the PBGC. Employer contributions exceeding 6% of participant compensation to a defined contribution plan will be subject to the limit. Multiemployer defined benefit plans have different funding requirements from single-employer plans. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) establishes new funding requirements for multiemployer plans in \"endangered\" or \"critical\" status. Actuaries must certify the plan's funding status annually and develop a funding schedule within 30 days if underfunded. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) introduces new funding requirements for multiemployer plans in \"endangered\" or \"critical\" status. Plans must meet statutory funding requirements before the end of the funding improvement period. Changes in anti-cutback rules allow plans to reduce benefit payment options and early retirement benefits for non-retired participants. The PPA also mandates new disclosure requirements and shortens the amortization period for plan liabilities to 15 years. Employer contributions to multiemployer plans are now tax-deductible up to 140% of the plan's current liability. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) introduces new funding requirements for multiemployer plans, allowing contributions up to 140% of the plan's current liability and eliminating the 25%-of-compensation limit. The law permits plans projecting a funding deficiency within 10 years to extend amortization schedules by five years, with a further extension possible. Plans must adopt a recovery plan and use specific interest rates for funding calculations. Endangered plans are those less than 80% funded or projected to have a deficiency within seven years. Plans that are less than 80% funded and projected to have a funding deficiency within seven years are considered seriously endangered. They have one year to implement a \"funding improvement plan\" to reduce under-funding. Endangered plans have 10 years to improve their funding by one-third of the difference between 100% funding and the plan's funded percentage. Seriously endangered plans that are less than 70% funded have 15 years to improve their funding by one-fifth of the difference between 100% funding and the plan's funded percentage. Plans that are less than 80% funded and projected to have a funding deficiency within seven years are considered seriously endangered. They have one year to implement a \"funding improvement plan\" to reduce under-funding. Endangered plans have 10 years to improve their funding by one-third of the difference between 100% funding and the plan's funded percentage. If the parties to the collective bargaining agreement are unable to agree on a funding improvement plan, a default funding schedule will apply, reducing future benefit accruals. Additional contribution requirements will only apply if needed to achieve the required funding improvement. Plans in critical status are those with projected funding deficiencies within a certain timeframe or greater liabilities for inactive participants than active participants. They must develop a rehabilitation plan within one year to address underfunding. Plan sponsors are exempt from making lump-sum contributions to meet minimum funding standards in this situation. Employers are not subject to excise tax if the plan is meeting obligations under the rehabilitation plan and collective bargaining agreements. The PPA allows plans in critical status to reduce or eliminate certain benefits to improve funding, with approval from bargaining parties. Benefits at normal retirement age cannot be cut, and benefits of participants who retired before being notified of critical status cannot be reduced. Adjustable benefits include optional forms of payment, disability benefits, early retirement benefits, certain annuities, and recent benefit increases. The PPA allows plans in critical status to implement a surcharge of 5% to 10% on employers to prevent funding deterioration while a rehabilitation plan is developed. Increases in benefits and reductions in contributions are prohibited during this period. Plans have 10 years to move out of critical status after adopting a rehabilitation plan or after collective bargaining agreements cover 75% of active participants. The PPA requires annual funding notices to be sent out 120 days after the end of the plan year, rather than within 11\u00bd months after the end of the plan year, as under prior law. Plans in endangered or critical status must have the plan actuary certify that the funding improvement is on schedule. Annual reports must contain information on funding. The PPA requires annual funding notices to be sent out 120 days after the end of the plan year. Plans in endangered or critical status must have the plan actuary certify that the funding improvement is on schedule. Annual reports must contain information on funding improvement plans. Notification must be provided to participants, beneficiaries, bargaining parties, the PBGC, and the Secretary of Labor within 30 days after the plan determines that it is in endangered or critical status. The PPA makes permanent the higher benefit limits in defined benefit plans, higher contribution limits for individual retirement accounts and defined contribution plans, and catch-up contributions for workers 50 and older. Federal law prohibits tax-qualified retirement plans from discriminating in favor of highly compensated employees. A \"highly compensated employee\" is defined as an employee who owns 5% or more of the company or whose compensation exceeds $100,000. To be tax-qualified, a \u00c2\u00a7401(k) plan must meet certain criteria regarding employee coverage and contribution percentages. Plans cannot discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees, and those with after-tax or matching contributions are subject to the ACP test. The ACP test measures contribution rates to HCE and NHCE accounts in retirement plans. Safe-harbor designs ensure compliance with ACP test for employer matching contributions. Employer-matching contributions must meet specific criteria to avoid discrimination. The ADP test measures employees' elective-deferral rates in \u00a7401(k) plans. Safe-harbor designs automatically satisfy the ADP test. Cross-testing allows defined contribution plans to base nondiscrimination tests on projected account balances at retirement age. Employers can make larger contributions on earnings exceeding the Social Security wage base. The PPA creates a \"safe harbor\" for plans with automatic enrollment, allowing for a minimum matching contribution of 100% of elective deferrals up to 1% of compensation, plus 50% of elective deferrals between 1% and 6% of compensation. This safe harbor helps plans comply with nondiscrimination rules. The automatic enrollment safe harbor for \u00a7401(k) plans requires a contribution rate of at least 3% in the first year, increasing to 6% thereafter. Employees must be fully vested in employer contributions after two years. Distribution restrictions apply, and employees have 90 days to opt out and withdraw contributions. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) allows employees enrolled in automatic enrollment plans 90 days to opt out and withdraw contributions without penalty. Plans must have default investments for participants who do not choose. Automatic enrollment plans are protected from fiduciary liability under ERISA \u00a7404(c) for default investments. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) allows employees to opt out of automatic enrollment plans and change investments. ERISA preempts state laws prohibiting automatic enrollment, as long as employees are notified annually of their rights. The PPA also allows certain fiduciaries to receive compensation for providing investment advice without violating ERISA's prohibited transaction rules. Different rules apply for employer-sponsored plans and IRAs. Registered investment companies, banks, insurance companies, and broker-dealers can provide investment advice without engaging in prohibited transactions. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) allows certain fiduciaries to provide investment advice without violating prohibited transaction rules, as long as they charge a flat fee or use a certified computer model. An annual audit is required, and fee arrangements must be disclosed to participants. Effective after December 31, 2006, advisors must also disclose affiliations with recommended investments and the computer model developer. For individual retirement accounts, investment advice based on a compliant computer model is exempt from prohibited transaction rules, with guidelines to be developed by the Department of Labor. If no suitable models exist, the Secretary of Labor will write regulations for investment professionals to provide advice. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) allows investment professionals to provide unbiased advice to IRA owners. Investment funds and limited partnerships are not considered plan fiduciaries under ERISA if ERISA-covered plans account for less than 25% of assets. A new \"eligible combined plan\" for employers with fewer than 500 employees is authorized, containing a 401(k) and defined benefit component. The defined benefit component must provide a benefit equal to 1% of final average pay for each year of service up to 20 years or a cash balance plan. The Pension Protection Act allows for unbiased advice to IRA owners. An \"eligible combined plan\" for employers with fewer than 500 employees includes a 401(k) with automatic enrollment and employer matching contributions. Vesting requirements for benefits and contributions are specified, with nondiscrimination tests required. Cash balance plans must also meet vesting requirements. The Pension Protection Act requires cash balance plans to meet vesting and interest credit requirements. It also mandates offering a 75% survivor annuity option if the plan's survivor annuity is less than 75%, and a 50% option if greater. Plan distributions can be rolled over directly to a Roth IRA starting in 2008, with taxable portions taxed at the time of rollover. The Pension Protection Act introduced rules for IRA conversions and beneficiary rollovers. It also expanded portability of after-tax amounts between different employer-sponsored plans. Additionally, the Act accelerated vesting schedules for employer matching contributions to defined contribution plans. The Pension Protection Act introduced rules for IRA conversions and beneficiary rollovers, expanded portability of after-tax amounts between employer-sponsored plans, and accelerated vesting schedules for employer matching contributions to defined contribution plans. The Act also addressed graded vesting and the purchase of service credits in public employee pension plans. The Pension Protection Act requires defined benefit plans to distribute annual funding notices to participants within 120 days after the plan year ends. Small plans with 100 or fewer participants can include the notice with their annual Form 5500 filing. Starting in 2008, the Department of Labor must electronically display Form 5500 information within 90 days of receiving it, and companies with intranet sites must display this information. A simplified Form 5500 is available for plans with 25 or fewer participants. Additionally, the Act eliminates the requirement for employers to file a separate form if the plan's unfunded vested benefits exceed $50 million, instead amending ERISA to require financial and actuarial filings. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 amends ERISA to require financial and actuarial filings for PBGC-insured plans with funding below 80%. Plan sponsors must provide quarterly or annual benefit statements to participants based on plan type. If a defined benefit plan terminates underfunded or involuntarily, participants must receive the same information submitted to PBGC within 15 days. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 requires defined contribution plans holding publicly traded employer securities to allow diversification of account balances. Participants must be offered at least three alternative investments, with phased-in rules for diversifying employer stock. These provisions do not apply to ESOPs without certain types of contributions. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 requires defined contribution plans to allow diversification of account balances, with rules for diversifying employer stock. ESOPs without certain contributions are exempt. The act also defines governmental plans and introduces the Retirement Savings Tax Credit for low- and middle-income taxpayers contributing to retirement savings plans. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 introduced the Retirement Savings Tax Credit for low- and middle-income taxpayers contributing to retirement savings plans. The maximum credit is 50% of contributions up to $2,000, resulting in a tax credit of $1,000. The act also makes the Retirement Savings Tax Credit permanent and allows for in-service distributions from defined benefit plans for participants aged 62 or older. Additionally, the act permits hardship withdrawals for non-spouse or non-dependent beneficiaries and allows IRAs and 401(k) plans to make distributions to qualified reservists. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 allows IRAs and 401(k) plans to make distributions to qualified reservists called up to active duty for 180 days or longer. The 10% tax on distributions before age 59\u00bd does not apply to these distributions. Reservists can redeposit an amount equal to the distribution into an IRA within two years of active duty. Public safety employees are exempt from the 10% tax if the distribution is made after separation at age 50 or later. Retired public safety employees can exclude up to $3,000 per year in distributions for health insurance or long-term care insurance after 2006. The Pension Protection Act of 2008 expands benefits for governmental plans, allows surplus plan assets transfer, and enables tax refunds to be deposited directly into an IRA. It also indexes income levels for deductible IRA contributions, allows tax-free IRA donations to charities, and sets deadlines for plan amendments."
