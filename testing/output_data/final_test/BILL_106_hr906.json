    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act of 1999\". The Congress finds that the right to vote is essential for citizenship and reintegration into society. It must not be denied based on race, color, gender, or past servitude. Congress has the ultimate authority over Federal elections to ensure fairness and equal protection. Discrepancies in State laws regarding felony convictions create unfairness in Federal elections. The Congress must ensure that State laws regarding voting rights are in line with the Constitution to prevent disparities in Federal elections. Discrepancies in laws governing the restoration of voting rights after felony convictions lead to unequal participation, especially impacting ethnic minorities. About 3,900,000 Americans, or one in fifty, are affected by these disparities. An estimated 3,900,000 Americans, including half a million women, cannot vote due to felony convictions. Disenfranchisement varies by State laws, with some States allowing voting rights restoration after completing a felony sentence. Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont do not disenfranchise felons. Approximately 3,900,000 Americans, including half a million women, are disenfranchised due to felony convictions. In some States, ex-offenders can regain voting rights, but the process is often difficult. In certain States, a pardon or order from the Governor is required, while Federal offenders face additional barriers. The only method provided by Federal law for restoring voting rights to ex-offenders is a Presidential pardon. Restoring voting rights to ex-offenders, especially African American and Hispanic citizens, is crucial for ensuring fairness in Federal elections. Congress should address the discrepancies in disenfranchisement rates to provide equal opportunities for all Americans to vote. The Act aims to restore fairness in Federal elections and help former offenders reintegrate into society as law-abiding citizens of the United States. SEC. 3. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS: The right to vote for Federal office shall not be denied to a U.S. citizen based on a criminal conviction, except for those serving a felony sentence in a correctional facility at the time of the election. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. The Attorney General can seek relief in a civil action to address violations of the Act. Individuals aggrieved by a violation can notify the state's chief election official and pursue declaratory or injunctive relief through a civil action if the violation is not corrected within specified timeframes. If an individual is aggrieved by a violation of the Act, they can bring a civil action to obtain relief without notifying the state's chief election official first. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The term \"correctional institution or facility\" refers to prisons, jails, or similar facilities for convicted individuals, excluding residential community treatment centers. The term \"election\" includes various types of elections and political party events for candidate nominations. A primary election is held to nominate candidates for the office of President, Vice President, Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner in the United States Congress. SEC. 6. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS. This Act does not prevent states from enacting less restrictive voting laws for Federal elections. The rights and remedies provided by this Act do not override the Voting Rights Act of 1965 or the National Voter Registration Act."
