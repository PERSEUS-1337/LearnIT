    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Cookstoves Support Act of 2012\". Congress finds that nearly half the world's population cooks over open fires or inefficient cookstoves, leading to health issues like respiratory illnesses and burns. Smoke from cooking fuels causes around 2,000,000 deaths annually in the developing world, surpassing deaths from malaria, tuberculosis, or HIV. Millions more suffer from toxic smoke exposure. The use of inefficient cookstoves leads to health issues and environmental problems. Women and children spend significant time collecting biomass fuel, risking violence as they travel farther to find resources. Black carbon from biomass cookstoves contributes to regional air pollution. Biomass cookstoves contribute significantly to regional air pollution and climate change, with black carbon emissions from residential cookstoves in developing countries accounting for 21% of the global inventory. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, a public-private partnership led by the United Nations Foundation, aims to enable the adoption of clean and efficient stoves in 100 million homes by 2020 by raising $250 million to overcome market barriers. The United States Government has committed up to $105,000,000 over five years to support the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. This includes funding from various departments for promoting clean cookstoves, research on technologies, and health initiatives. The United States Government has allocated $2,180,000 for health research, $6,000,000 for stove testing and design, and up to $50,000,000 for clean energy projects through the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. The United States Government has allocated funds for health research, stove testing and design, and clean energy projects through the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. Additionally, there is a focus on advancing the goals of the alliance. The Secretary of State, in consultation with relevant agencies and organizations, will work to advance the goals of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves through research, development, diplomatic engagement, and promoting consumer awareness. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves aims to improve consumer awareness, access to carbon financing, and support women-owned businesses. It also focuses on international development projects for clean stoves and fuels, efforts in refugee camps and disaster relief, and financing for projects providing clean energy access. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS.
