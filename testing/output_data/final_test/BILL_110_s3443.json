The \"Clean Water Affordability Act\" authorizes grants for sewer overflow control, prioritizing financially distressed communities for funding. The \"Clean Water Affordability Act\" authorizes grants for sewer overflow control, prioritizing financially distressed communities for funding. States determine distressed communities based on specified criteria, with the Federal share of project costs being at least 75 percent. Non-federal funding sources may include public and private funds, in-kind services, and financial assistance from State water programs. The \"Clean Water Affordability Act\" authorizes grants for sewer overflow control in financially distressed communities, with the Federal share of project costs being at least 75 percent. Projects receiving grant assistance must adhere to the same requirements as those funded by State water pollution control revolving funds. Governors can waive certain requirements if they are deemed inconsistent with the Act's purposes. Funding authorization is provided for in the legislation. Funding authorization is provided for in the \"Clean Water Affordability Act\" with specific amounts authorized for fiscal years 2009 to 2013. The funds allocated under this section shall remain available until expended. In fiscal year 2009, grants will be provided to municipalities and municipal entities using the appropriated amounts.

Definitions in this section include the meaning of \"Administrator,\" \"Affordability,\" \"Financial capability,\" and \"Guidance.\" The term \"guidance\" refers to the Administrator's published guidance on Combined Sewer Overflows and Sanitary Sewer Overflows. The Administrator is required to update the guidance within one year to ensure evaluations meet specific criteria related to financial capability assessment. The guidance emphasizes considering local economic conditions, regional economic factors, and site-specific conditions when assessing financial capability for community projects. Prescriptive formulas should not be the sole indicator of financial capability. The guidance stresses the importance of considering various economic measures and community investments in assessing financial capability for projects. It also highlights the need to factor in the economic outlook and potential impacts of program requirements over time in implementation schedules. The implementation schedules for water quality-related improvements should consider mitigating adverse impacts on distressed populations and reflect local financial conditions. Evaluation of local financial capability for methodologies should consider a variety of factors that may vary across regions. The residential indicator should be revised to consider costs imposed on ratepayers for essential utilities, quantify local community-imposed costs in regional systems, and assess impacts on communities with varying economic conditions. The consideration of industrial and population trends, median household income, and affordability factors like shelter costs and essential utility payments should be included in assessing impacts on communities with disparate economic conditions. The updated guidance should consider factors like low-income ratepayer percentages, impacts on program delivery, and the ability to modify long-term control plans or agreements based on economic changes in the community. The Administrator will update guidance on financial capability determinations and implementation schedules, with consideration of factors like low-income ratepayer percentages and economic changes in the community. Upon completion, the updated guidance will be published in the Federal Register and submitted to relevant committees. Appropriations are authorized as necessary for implementation."
