    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Public Transit Authority Pilot Procurement Authorization Act of 2001\" and defines terms like \"heavy-duty transit bus\" and \"intercity coach.\" It establishes a pilot program for the sale of vehicles to public transit authorities. The Federal Transit Administration will conduct a pilot program to speed up the procurement of heavy-duty transit buses and intercity coaches by transportation authorities receiving Federal assistance. They must get approval before placing orders. The General Services Administration Solicitation FFAH-B1-002272-N will be reopened for bidding by qualified manufacturing companies. The Federal Transit Administration is conducting a pilot program to expedite the procurement of heavy-duty transit buses and intercity coaches by transportation authorities receiving Federal assistance. Qualified manufacturing companies can bid for contracts to sell buses and coaches to these authorities. Existing GSA contracts can be modified to respond to prospective sales. State, local, and regional transportation authorities receiving Federal Transit Administration assistance can purchase heavy-duty transit buses and intercity coaches from existing or new contracts, including those modified under a pilot program. The pilot program under this Act will terminate on December 31, 2006. The General Services Administration, with assistance from the Federal Transit Administration, must establish a multiple award schedule for heavy-duty transit buses and intercity coaches by December 31, 2003. This schedule will allow Federal agencies and transportation authorities receiving Federal Transit Administration assistance to procure buses under these schedules. Reporting requirements are also specified. The Administrators of the Federal Transit Administration and General Services must submit a joint quarterly report to specific Senate and House committees. The report should detail measures to speed up processes authorized by the Act, estimate the impact on job retention and creation in the bus and intercity coach manufacturing industry, and describe economic growth in participating States and localities. The pilot program under this Act involves States and localities that have participated in it. SEC. 6. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAW. This Act shall be carried out in accordance with all applicable Federal transit laws and requirements."
