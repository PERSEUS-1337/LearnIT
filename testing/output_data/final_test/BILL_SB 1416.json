    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Article 4 adds Section 18735 to Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. It allows individuals to designate contributions to the Revive the Salton Sea Fund on their tax returns. Contributions must be in full dollar amounts and are irrevocable once made. If the contributions exceed the tax liability, they will be treated as a voluntary contribution. The Franchise Tax Board will update the tax return form to include a section for contributions to the Revive the Salton Sea Fund. Contributions can be one dollar or more and will support programs for public awareness, education, and restoration projects for the Salton Sea. The Revive the Salton Sea Fund allows contributions on tax returns, with a deduction permitted. The fund supports projects for the restoration of the Salton Sea, including those identified by the Salton Sea Authority. The Revive the Salton Sea Fund allows contributions on tax returns for restoration projects. Up to 5% of funds go to public awareness activities. Money in the fund cannot replace state General Fund money. The article expires five years after the fund first appears on tax returns. The Franchise Tax Board determines the minimum contribution amount for the Revive the Salton Sea Fund each year and notifies the Natural Resources Agency. They also estimate contributions to ensure they meet the minimum requirement. The Franchise Tax Board determines the minimum contribution amount for the Revive the Salton Sea Fund each year. If contributions fall below the minimum amount, the article will be inoperative for taxable years starting in that calendar year and repealed by December 1. The minimum contribution amount is $250,000 for the second calendar year after the fund's first appearance on tax returns. The Franchise Tax Board adjusts the minimum contribution amount for the Revive the Salton Sea Fund annually based on the California Consumer Price Index. The minimum contribution amount is calculated by multiplying the prior year's amount by the inflation factor adjustment and rounding it off to the nearest dollar."
