    "content": "The House Appropriations Committee introduced the Military Construction Appropriations Bill for FY 2004, which was passed by the House and amended by the Senate. A conference was requested, and the conference report was completed on November 4, 2003. The President also submitted an emergency supplemental appropriations request during this time. The House passed the Military Construction Appropriations Bill for FY 2004 (H.R. 3289) on October 17, 2003, and the Senate approved the amended bill. The conference report (H.Rept. 108-337) was filed on October 30, approved by the House on October 31, and by the Senate on November 3. The bill was presented to the President on November 5. The Department of Defense manages a vast infrastructure worth over $500 billion. The military construction appropriations bill, part of annual legislation for national defense, funds projects for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and their reserve components. It also includes funding for NATO Security Investment Program, military family housing, and Base Realignment and Closure account for base realignment and closure costs. The defense appropriations bill provides funding for non-construction military activities of the Department of Defense and constitutes over 90% of national security-related spending. Other major appropriation legislation includes the energy and water development appropriations bill for atomic energy defense activities and civil projects. No funds can be spent by any federal agency without appropriation, and the Department of Defense is forbidden to use funds without specific authorization. The defense appropriations bill funds non-construction military activities and is crucial for national security spending. Authorization and appropriations bills are required for defense funds, with separate bills for military construction and other defense appropriations. Major debates over defense policy and funding issues are associated with these bills. The report includes key parts of the authorization bill in discussing the military construction appropriation process. Military construction funding dates back to the late 1950s, with a surge in appropriations during the Korean War. Due to the ongoing security threat from the Soviet Union, a high level of spending on military infrastructure was expected to continue. Separate military construction bills were established, with the first stand-alone bill written for FY1959. In addition to military construction appropriations, defense agencies also have funds for minor construction and property maintenance within their operations and maintenance accounts. Maintenance of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation-related facilities is also included in defense funding. Military construction appropriations include funding for the construction and maintenance of military infrastructure, as well as Morale, Welfare, and Recreation-related facilities. Special accounts within the appropriation, such as the Homeowners Assistance Fund and the Department of Defense Family Housing Improvement Fund, support ancillary functions. These funds can be obligated for up to five fiscal years due to the long-term nature of construction projects. The military construction budget is considered when the President's budget is delivered to Congress each year. The President submitted his FY2004 budget request to Congress on February 3, 2003. The House Subcommittee on Military Appropriations marked up its bill on June 17, with the bill passing in the House by a vote of 428-0 on June 26, 2003. The bill was then received in the Senate. The Senate Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction held hearings on its bill during March and April of 2003. The full Committee reported legislation (S. 1357, S.Rept. 108-82) to the Senate on June 26. The bill was passed by the Senate on July 11 (91-0) and requested a conference with the House. On September 16, 2003, the House disagreed with the Senate amendment and appointed conferees for a conference. The conferees met on October 22 but did not agree on a final report regarding funding allocations for construction projects in Europe and the Republic of Korea. The House approved the report on November 5, with the President's original military construction budget of $9,036,721,000 being amended to $9,237,096,000. The Congressional Budget Office re-appropriated $55 million for construction projects, including a Special Operations Forces facility and chemical demilitarization. The Senate Appropriations Committee amended the President's budget submission, resulting in a quoted budget of $9,117,281,000. The President requested an emergency supplemental fund from Congress on September 21, 2003. The President requested emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2004 from Congress on September 21, 2003. The Department of Defense requested $65.6 billion for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and supporting coalition forces. $412.5 million is designated for construction projects in Iraq and Afghanistan, with $119.9 million for the Army and $292.6 million for the Air Force. The request for additional funding includes trailers and containers for soldiers, drawn from Army Operation and Maintenance and Other Procurement appropriations. The request also includes authorization to transfer funding into construction from other accounts, including a $1.99 billion Iraqi Freedom Fund. The Secretary of Defense has the discretion to create a transfer account for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The legislation grants authority to transfer funds from the Iraqi Freedom Fund to various military accounts. The Secretary must notify congressional defense committees before any transfer. Any excess funds can be returned to the Iraqi Freedom Fund for retransfer. The Secretary of Defense can transfer funds from the Iraqi Freedom Fund to military accounts with notification to congressional defense committees. Temporary authority allows the use of $150 million for contingency construction projects under 10 USC 2804 for national security purposes. The Secretary of Defense can transfer funds for contingency construction projects with notification to congressional defense committees. The request for Supplemental Appropriations would have allowed the transfer of DOD funds into the contingency construction account after a 7-day notification period. The recommendation proposed streamlining the process for transferring funds for contingency construction projects by eliminating the need to explain the necessity for such projects. It would have allowed the Secretary of Defense to notify Congress within 15 days of obligating funds for the project, specifying the estimated cost and including project details. The recommended language expands the definition of real property for contingency construction projects to include any building or structure used by the Armed Forces, regardless of duration. The Secretary of Defense was authorized to use operations and maintenance funds in FY 2004 for urgent military construction projects outside the US with temporary needs and no long-term presence planned. The Act allows the Secretary of Defense to use appropriated operations and maintenance funds for construction projects that meet temporary requirements. The Secretary must notify congressional defense committees within 15 days of fund obligation and submit a report on all projects within 30 days of each fiscal-year quarter. Senate Emergency Supplemental Appropriation (S. 1689) was introduced by Senator Stevens without a report on September 30, 2003, and placed on the Legislative Calendar. It was debated and amended before being taken up on October 2. The Senate bill S. 1689 was debated and amended before being taken up on October 2. The Committee on Appropriations recommended emergency military construction appropriations totaling $412.5 million, with provisions for the Secretary of Defense to transfer funds and an expedited waiting period. On October 17, the Senate substituted the language of S. 1689 into H.R. 3289 for further discussion. The House Committee on Appropriations marked up its version of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriation bill, recommending $544.6 million for military construction and family housing accounts. The Senate and House recommendations differ in funding for the reconstruction of military facilities and housing damaged by Hurricane Isabel in North Carolina and Virginia. The House bill allows the Secretary of Defense to use up to $500 million in operations and maintenance funds for construction projects outside the United States during FY2004. The House and Senate passed different versions of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriation bill, with the Senate allowing the Secretary of Defense to use operations and maintenance funds for construction projects outside the US. The Senate amendment was disagreed upon by the House, leading to a conference where the conference report was filed on October 30, 2003. The conference report for the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill was filed on October 30, 2003, and was considered by the House and Senate on various dates. The bill passed in the House on October 31 and in the Senate on November 3. Several issues related to military construction were discussed during the legislative deliberations, including funding levels, overseas base realignment, BRAC, and perchlorate groundwater contamination remediation. The FY2004 budget requested $9.24 billion in new budget authority, with an additional $412 million in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations request. The Department of Defense is realigning overseas bases in Germany and Korea to become lighter and more agile. Military construction projects are being reviewed to support changing military objectives overseas. The Administration requested the deletion of 16 construction projects totaling $269 million for Germany and Turkey in the FY2004 budget. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of a well-considered strategy for military construction at overseas sites. The committee recommended rescinding $107 million from prior year appropriations. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended rescinding $107 million from prior year appropriations at sites slated to be closed and re-appropriating them to installations expected to remain in service. They supported the DOD's effort to reevaluate overseas basing requirements but noted the absence of a DOD overseas basing master plan. The committee also suggested forming a Commission on the Review of the Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States. A Commission on the Review of the Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States was recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee to assess overseas basing adequacy and propose new configurations. The Commission, appointed by congressional leadership, would submit a report with findings, recommendations, and a proposed strategy to the President and Congress by August 30, 2004. The Department of Defense was directed to submit master plans for changing military infrastructure requirements within each overseas regional command and report annually through FY2008 on plan implementation. Despite this, reports indicate that the Department of Defense and military services have already begun realigning force levels and overseas basing locations. The U.S. and Japanese officials agreed to return land near Yokosuka to Japanese control in exchange for building new housing units. The U.S. European Command is considering closing military installations in Germany and relocating combat units to new, austere bases in countries like Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania. The U.S. is considering redeploying Army divisions from Germany to the United States. In Korea, U.S. forces are being realigned with some units moving south. Additionally, a Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States is being established. The Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States was established with a report deadline of December 31, 2004. The Department of Defense was directed to prepare master plans for overseas military bases to be submitted with the Fiscal Year 2006 budget. The movement of US military forces from garrisons near the Demilitarized Zone in Korea to bases further south was noted. Reporting on the plans and their implementation was required annually through Fiscal Year 2009. The Department of Defense plans to move US military forces from garrisons near the Demilitarized Zone in Korea to bases further south, with a focus on Camp Humphreys. Construction at Camp Humphreys is pending a master facilities plan and cost-sharing agreements with South Korea. A fifth Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round is scheduled for FY2005, affecting multiple installations. The Secretary of Defense must publish criteria for the BRAC by December 31, 2003. The Defense Secretary must publish criteria for the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) by December 31, 2003, with the final list of BRAC actions due to Congress on November 7, 2005. The FY2005 BRAC round is not the same as the Efficient Facilities Initiative (EFI), which is a separate process for managing DOD real property holdings. The Efficient Facilities Initiative (EFI) was introduced by the Department of Defense as a new approach to managing military installations, both domestic and overseas. It included actions such as potential realignment and closure of bases, but the proposed legislation was not adopted by Congress. Some aspects of the EFI were incorporated into the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002. Congress incorporated some aspects of the EFI into the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002, but ignored the Secretary's suggested process for review of domestic bases. Instead, Congress created the FY2005 BRAC round and authorized a \"Pilot Efficient Facilities Initiative\" for up to two military installations of each military department. These pilot initiatives were modeled on the Brooks Air Force Base Development Demonstration Project in San Antonio, Texas. The Brooks Air Force Base Development Demonstration Project is a partnership between the Secretary of the Air Force and the City of San Antonio, Texas, offering an alternative to traditional base closings or realignments. Congress authorized the Secretary to convert activities at Brooks Air Force Base into contracted activities or exchanges of services compensated by property transactions. This allowed the transfer of federal real property at Brooks to the city in exchange for appropriate compensation. The Brooks Air Force Base Development Demonstration Project allows the transfer of federal property to the city for military use, shifting maintenance costs to the local community. Funds generated are placed in a special Project Fund for various purposes. The initiative aims to provide management tools to service secretaries, but is currently limited in scope and duration. The Department of Defense has yet to select candidate sites for this project. The Department of Defense has not selected candidate sites for the Perchlorate Groundwater Contamination Remediation. The Senate Appropriations Committee requires a report by March 30, 2004, on the activities of the Interagency Perchlorate Steering Committee. The House Appropriations Committee directed a joint study with the EPA on perchlorate contamination in southern California, Arizona, and Nevada. The conferees directed the Department of Defense to submit a report on groundwater contamination in southern California, Arizona, and Nevada within 180 days. The report would recommend national contamination standards, identify military and defense industry sources, and outline federal government mitigation steps. The conferees also moved the deadline for a report on perchlorate contamination on BRAC properties to April 30, 2004. Military construction funding declined between FY1985 and FY1998 due to strategic changes, force reduction, and base realignments. Military construction funding declined between FY1985 and FY1998 due to strategic changes, force reduction, and base realignments. Appropriations began to rise from FY1998 onwards to replace outdated facilities and improve military personnel's quality of life. Requests for military construction funding declined until FY2000 but have been rising since FY2001. The DOD projects a significant increase in annual construction requests from FY2003 to FY2007. H.R. 2559 (Knollenberg) was a bill for military construction, family housing, and base realignment for the Department of Defense in FY2004. The bill passed the House on June 26, 2003 (428-0) and the Senate on July 11 (91-0) after amendments.
