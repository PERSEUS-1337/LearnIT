    "content": "The \"Salt Cedar and Russian Olive Control Demonstration Act\" establishes a program to assess and demonstrate solutions for managing salt cedar and Russian olive trees in the western United States, in cooperation with various government agencies. The Act aims to remove salt cedar and Russian olive trees, reestablish native vegetation, and find economic ways to dispose of biomass. A memorandum of understanding will be established between the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture to administer the program. An assessment of the extent of infestation by these trees on public and private land in the western United States will be completed within a year of funds availability. The assessment of the severity of infestation by salt cedar and Russian olive trees in the western United States will consider research on control methods, water consumption reduction feasibility, revegetation challenges, and cost estimation for destruction, biomass removal, and land restoration. The Secretary will submit a report to relevant Senate and Committee bodies. The report to be submitted by the Secretary will include long-term management and funding strategies for addressing salt cedar and Russian olive infestation, deficiencies in the assessment, areas for additional study, and field demonstrations for control efforts. The Secretary may provide grants to eligible entities such as institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations with expertise in public policy issues related to salt cedar and Russian olive trees for technical support in identifying long-term management and funding strategies. The Secretary may provide grants of at least $250,000 for projects to control salt cedar and Russian olive trees in collaboration with various entities. These projects must demonstrate effective methods over a specified time period and scale. The projects funded by the Secretary aim to fully assess long-term management strategies for controlling salt cedar and Russian olive trees. They will implement various control methods, assess combining multiple methods, evaluate soil conditions, and define final vegetative outcomes. The projects funded by the Secretary aim to define and implement final vegetative states and optimal revegetation methods, prevent regrowth of salt cedar and Russian olive trees, monitor water savings, assess wildfire activity and wildlife habitat changes, determine biomass removal conditions, and evaluate economic impacts. The Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, will analyze economic means to use or dispose of biomass from removal of salt cedar and Russian olive trees. This analysis will determine economic viability, consider existing research on beneficial uses of tree fiber, and explore economic development opportunities. The Act considers economic development opportunities, such as manufacturing wood products using biomass from demonstration projects to offset control costs. Costs for projects under the Act are limited to specific amounts for assessments, management strategies, and demonstration projects. The Act limits costs for assessments, management strategies, and demonstration projects to specific amounts, with full Federal expense for certain activities and a maximum cost of $3,000,000 for analysis under subsection (f). Demonstration projects on non-federal land have a maximum Federal cost share of 75 percent. The non-Federal share of costs for demonstration projects on non-Federal land can be provided in the form of in-kind contributions. The Secretary must cooperate with Federal agencies and other entities conducting research on salt cedar and Russian olive tree control. Independent review is required for the assessment and documentation of long-term activities. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on the results of the Act, including independent reviews and fund expenditures. Public access to information resulting from the Act must be facilitated. Authorization of appropriations includes $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and $15,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2007 to 2010. Authorization of appropriations includes $15,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2007 to 2010, with a limit of 15 percent for administrative costs. The Act and its authority terminate 5 years after enactment. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
