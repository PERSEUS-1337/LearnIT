    "title": "AB 1751",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature clarifies that pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers must report the acquisition of tangible personal property using plain text, in descriptive language historically used in the industry, to the Department of Justice's electronic reporting system or local law enforcement if the system is not yet implemented. The Legislature specifies that pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers must report acquisitions of tangible personal property using plain text to the Department of Justice's electronic reporting system or local law enforcement. This aims to relieve businesses of the costs and burdens associated with reporting on paper forms or converting descriptions to law enforcement categories. The Legislature intends for the Department of Justice to accept plain text descriptions from pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers for reporting to law enforcement databases. Trained law enforcement personnel will classify and encode the reported property. The California Pawn and Secondhand Dealer System (CAPSS) is a statewide electronic reporting system operated by the Department of Justice. It receives reports from secondhand dealers and is funded by the Secondhand Dealer and Pawnbroker Fund. Every secondhand dealer or coin dealer must report daily to CAPSS all secondhand tangible personal property, excluding firearms, that they have acquired. The report must include the name and address of the seller or pledger. The identification of the seller or pledger of the property must be verified using valid documents such as a US passport, driver's license, or state-issued identification card. Verification can be done remotely using technology like cameras or software. Valid identification for sellers or pledgers includes a US passport, driver's license, state-issued ID, Matricula Consular, or a passport from another country with an address-bearing ID. The property description required by secondhand dealers includes serial numbers, inscriptions, identifying marks, size, color, material, manufacturer's pattern name, brand, model name or number, and a plain text description. Watches do not need to be disassembled unless requested by a peace officer. When disassembling a watch for information, the watchband must be removed first. The cost of opening the watch is the responsibility of the pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, or customer. A secondhand dealer must use a specific article field descriptor provided by the Department of Justice or a recognized plain text descriptor in their records. The lack of a Department of Justice descriptor does not affect the dealer's obligation to report the necessary information. When a secondhand dealer receives or purchases a handheld electronic device, they must report the serial number, which can be the IMEI, MEID, or another unique identifier assigned by the manufacturer. If these numbers are not available at the time of reporting, they must be updated within 10 working days. (D) \"Handheld electronic device\" refers to portable devices capable of storing electronic data, including cell phones, smartphones, and tablets.\n(4) Seller or pledger must certify ownership or authority to sell the property.\n(5) Seller or pledger must certify the truthfulness and completeness of the information.\n(6) Fingerprint requirement for seller or pledger, except for coin dealers unless mandated by local regulations. When a report is submitted by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer, it will be accepted by the Department of Justice if all required information is provided in good faith. Any errors or omissions will be noted, and the dealer will be notified to make corrections within three business days. Compliance with these provisions deems the dealer to have received adequate evidence of authority to sell or pledge the property. Any person conducting business as a secondhand dealer at a gun show outside their jurisdiction may need to submit a transaction report to the local law enforcement agency. The Legislature intends for these provisions not to interfere with Penal Code enforcement. The Department of Justice will accept plain text property descriptors from pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers, transmitted electronically to CAPSS. Additional seller information is not required in the report. Future changes to the reporting requirements of CAPSS must comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. The Department of Justice, chiefs of police, and sheriffs must also adhere to specific sections when implementing these changes. The Department of Justice is prohibited from using emergency regulations for the implementation, operation, or maintenance of CAPSS as required by this chapter. The Department of Justice will meet with the Department of Technology to discuss changes to CAPSS by July 1, 2017. Coin dealers must report information daily to the chief of police or sheriff using a specific form. Each transaction should involve only one item. The subdivision defines \"item\" as a single physical article or a commonly accepted grouping of articles purchased as a set. Secondhand dealers are not exempt from fingerprinting requirements. Firearms dealers must still comply with reporting requirements. Sections 21628.1 and 21630 of the Business and Professions Code are repealed. Section 21630 of the Business and Professions Code is repealed and replaced with new requirements for secondhand dealers and coin dealers to electronically transmit reports of tangible property acquisitions to CAPSS within one business day. Submission of a report is not needed if the same property was acquired from the same customer within the past 12 months. Section 21642.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require applicants for licenses to pay a fee not exceeding $300 for initial or renewal applications. The fee may be increased based on the California Consumer Price Index to cover regulatory costs. Licensees holding a license issued before the effective date of the act must pay a fee not exceeding $288 to the Department of Justice within 120 days. This fee is in addition to any required under Section 21642.5 of the Business and Professions Code. The fees paid by licensees are deposited in the Secondhand Dealer and Pawnbroker Fund for the Department of Justice to cover specific costs upon legislative appropriation. Applicants in subdivision (a) must submit fingerprint images and related information to the Department of Justice for background checks. The Department of Justice will provide a state-level response and subsequent notification service for these applicants. The Department of Justice charges a fee to cover processing costs for fingerprint requests. Fee revenues go to the Fingerprint Fee Account for department use. This act is urgent for public peace, health, or safety and takes immediate effect. To protect the public from stolen property dissemination, a statewide electronic system will be cost-effective for secondhand dealers and pawnbrokers. Plain text property descriptions will be accepted by the Department of Justice immediately."
