    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nevada Test Site Veterans' Compensation Act of 2007\". The Nevada Test Site played a crucial role in the United States' nuclear defense capabilities, conducting 928 out of 1,054 nuclear tests from 1951 to 1992. It was designated as the country's nuclear proving grounds by President Harry S Truman in 1950. During the Cold War, workers at the Nevada Test Site and other facilities played a vital role in building and testing the nuclear arsenal for the United States, exposing themselves to radiation and other harmful substances in the process. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA) was enacted to provide fairness and equity for workers exposed to radiation, beryllium, and silica without their knowledge or consent during nuclear weapons production and testing programs. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 aims to provide compensation for beryllium- and radiation-related health conditions. Research shows inadequate monitoring and record-keeping at nuclear weapons facilities, leading to harm for workers. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 designated certain atomic weapons employees as members of the Special Exposure Cohort. It is challenging to accurately estimate radiation doses for workers at the Nevada Test Site due to incomplete radionuclide lists and limitations in dose estimation for exposure to nonrespirable hot particles. Significant gaps exist in environmental measurement and exposure data, leading to underestimated resuspension doses and inaccuracies in estimating exposures to bomb assembly workers and radon levels. NIOSH has limitations in accurately sampling tritiated water vapor and lacks integrity in external dose records. Beta dose data before 1966, neutron dose data before 1966, and internal dose data before late 1955 are either missing or limited. Some Nevada Test Site workers have been denied compensation under EEOICPA due to flawed calculations based on incomplete records or faulty assumptions. NIOSH has ignored exposure from underground tests vented in the late 1950s and 1960s, resulting in unreliable personnel monitoring. Some Nevada Test Site workers have been denied compensation under EEOICPA due to flawed calculations or incorrect models. Basal cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, both radiogenic cancers, are not currently included in the Special Exposure Cohort for compensation. SEC. 3. Certain nuclear weapons program workers to be included in Special Exposure Cohort for compensation under Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 is amended to include individuals who worked at the Nevada Test Site or similar sites in Nevada from 1950 to 1993 and contracted specific illnesses related to nuclear testing. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 is amended to include individuals who worked at the Nevada Test Site or similar sites in Nevada from 1950 to 1993 and contracted specific illnesses related to nuclear testing. This includes those who were involved in underground nuclear tests, venting events, radiation releases, nuclear rocket testing, or worked in classified program areas like Area 51. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 is amended to include individuals who worked at the Nevada Test Site from 1950 to 1993 and contracted specific illnesses related to nuclear testing. Claims for compensation under the amended act must be adjudicated and a final decision issued. Claims for compensation under the amended Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act must be adjudicated and a final decision issued within 30 days of the enactment date for pending claims and within 30 days of filing for new claims."
