The Secretary can accept these alternatives after a hearing on disputed facts. The Secretary can accept alternative conditions proposed by license applicants for projects within US reservations if they provide adequate protection and utilization, cost less to implement, or improve operation for electricity production. The Secretary must explain the basis for accepting a condition and provide reasons for not accepting any alternative conditions. The Secretary must consider the effects of adopted conditions and alternatives on various aspects like energy, cost, water supply, and air quality. Other parties can propose alternative conditions, and if not accepted, the Commission must be informed. If the Commission finds the Secretary's condition inconsistent with the law, the dispute may be referred to the Dispute Resolution Service. The Service will issue a non-binding advisory within 90 days, which the Secretary can accept unless it doesn't adequately protect the reservation. The advisory and final determination will be submitted to the Commission's record. Amendments are made to Section 18 of the Federal Power Act regarding alternative fishways.
