The International Communication Agency (ICA) was formed in the 1970s by merging State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and USIA's activities. In 1982, ICA was renamed the U.S. Information Agency (USIA). In 1994, international broadcasting activities were consolidated under the Broadcasting Board of Governors. USIA was abolished in 1999, and its functions were merged back into the Department of State. Public diplomacy now includes international information programs, educational and cultural exchanges, and international nonmilitary broadcasting. The U.S. government's public diplomacy efforts involve various agencies such as the Bureau for International Information Programs, the Bureau for Educational and Cultural Affairs, and the Broadcasting Board of Governors.

The Administration's response to 9/11, referred to as \"Operation Enduring Crusade,\" was criticized for its potentially inflammatory nature towards Muslims. The Bush Administration took steps to improve public diplomacy after 9/11, creating the Coalition Information Center and the Office of Global Communications. Condoleeza Rice established the Strategic Communication Policy Coordinating Committee to coordinate interagency activities.
