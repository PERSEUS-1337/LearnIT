    "content": "The Social Security program, known as OASDI, pays monthly benefits to retired or disabled workers and their families. Its ability to meet benefit payments relies on payroll taxes, taxation on benefits, and interest earned on trust fund assets. In 2020, total costs are projected to exceed total income for the first time since 1982. The program can cover the shortfall by drawing on cash surpluses accumulated in trust funds from 1983 to 2019. The Disability Insurance Trust Funds project that trust fund depletion in 2035 could lead to OASDI program paying 80% of benefits. Economic, program-specific, and demographic factors impact the program's financing. The focus is on fertility and mortality's influence on the program's ability to pay full benefits. The trustees' 2019 Annual Report projects OASDI cost increases faster than non-interest income through 2040 due to the retirement of the baby-boom generation. The cost rate declines from 2040 to 2051 as subsequent lower-birth-rate generations replace the baby boomers. After 2051, life expectancy increases cause OASDI costs to rise relative to income, but at a slower pace than from 2010 to 2040. Immigration's impact is not analyzed in the report. The Board of Trustees analysis shows that changes in fertility and mortality are the main financial pressures on the OASDI program. Decreased fertility rates and increased life expectancy are leading to an older population, resulting in higher costs for the program. Trust funds' assets are being used to cover benefit payments, with projections indicating this will continue until 2034. The Board of Trustees projects that the trust funds' assets will be exhausted by 2034 due to rising costs from demographic changes, leading to a cash flow deficit. This deficit is expected to persist for the next 75 years, impacting the OASDI program's ability to pay benefits. Policymakers have options to address the program's financial shortfall caused by reduced fertility rates and increasing longevity. The Social Security population is aging due to reduced fertility rates and increasing longevity. The percentage of older individuals in the population is rising, with three age subgroups analyzed: those aged 65 and older, those aged 20 through 64, and those under age 20. Population growth rates from 1945 to 2015 and projections for the next 70 years show the concentration of retirees, prime working-age individuals, and those not yet in the paid workforce. The population of the United States has been steadily growing older, with the number of individuals aged 65 and over more than tripling from 1945 to 2015. This demographic shift has implications for the Social Security program's ability to meet projected benefits, as the working-age population is growing at a slower rate. The aging population in the United States is causing the working-age group to contribute to the Social Security system while the older age group is collecting benefits. By 2085, those aged 65 and older are projected to make up 22% of the total population, leading to rising program costs outpacing revenues. This trend will result in a smaller working-age population percentage and impact the program's ability to pay full benefits. The aging population in the United States is leading to a decrease in the working-age group (20-64) as those aged 65 and older increase. Dependency ratios show the burden on the working-age population to support dependents. In 1945, the working-age group accounted for 59% of the population, while in 2015, it was also 59%, with the under 20 age group at 26%. The United States has transitioned from being youth-dependent to aged-dependent, with the percentage of the population aged 65 and older increasing from 7% to 15% from 1945 to 2015. This shift is important for Social Security as the working-age population will need to support a larger elderly population in the future. The youth dependency ratio, which measures the support of young individuals by those in working ages, has changed historically. In 1945, the ratio was 56%, indicating that 56 youths were supported by every 100 working-age individuals. This ratio increased until 1965 due to a growing youth population, but decreased after 1985 as the baby boom generation reached working age. The aged dependency ratio, which indicates the number of people aged 65 and older collecting benefits relative to those still working, increased from 12% in 1945 to 25% in 2015. This highlights the aging of the population. The aged dependency ratio, indicating the number of people aged 65 and older collecting benefits versus those still working, doubled from 1945 to 2015. This trend is projected to continue increasing, with a projected ratio exceeding 35% by 2025 and 40% by 2065, reflecting the faster growth of the aged population compared to the working-age population. The total dependency ratio is rising due to the baby boom generation exiting the workforce, with projections showing an increase even after the last baby boomers reach retirement age in 2031. This imbalance is a result of decreased fertility rates since the 1970s. The aging population, driven by declining fertility rates since the 1970s, will lead to a larger number of beneficiaries compared to covered workers in the Social Security system. This imbalance is projected to increase OASDI costs relative to revenues. The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in the United States was at its lowest in 1940 with 2.23 children per woman. The baby boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964, followed a period of high fertility. Fertility rates dropped significantly after 1964, reaching a minimum of 1.77 children per woman. This decline in fertility rates has led to an aging population and a projected imbalance in Social Security costs and revenues. The U.S. Total Fertility Rate (TFR) reached a low of 1.77 children per woman in 1975 and has remained relatively low since then. The Board of Trustees projects it to stay close to 2.0 children per woman for the next 75 years. Research suggests that factors like personal income and employment rates influence fertility rates, with economic uncertainty impacting birth rates. Studies show that concerns about future job prospects can lead to doubts about having children. Research suggests that concerns about future job prospects can lead to doubts about having children and postponement of childbearing, which can increase children's socioeconomic opportunities. The average cost of raising a child has increased over the years, with healthcare costs doubling and child care and education costs rising significantly. This trend of having children later in life is reflected in historical data showing a decline in fertility among women. The decline in fertility among women has not been uniform across age groups, with an increase in fertility among women aged 30-34 and 34-39 since the mid-1970s. This trend of postponing childbearing results in a lower overall fertility rate. Additionally, the Social Security population is living longer, with a decreasing mortality rate and increasing life expectancy. More individuals are surviving to retirement age and collecting benefits for a greater number of years than previous generations. The average life expectancy for males at birth increased by almost 4 years from 1965 to 62.9 years. Females saw an increase of 5.4 years during the same period. Trustees attribute lower mortality rates to advancements in medical care, antibiotics, clean water, and improved living standards. Infectious diseases were the leading cause of death in 1900, but have declined significantly by 1940. From 1900 to 1940, infectious diseases declined as a major cause of death due to nutritional improvements, public health measures, and medical treatments. Diseases of old age such as cardiovascular disease and cancer became the leading causes of death. Cardiovascular disease alone surpassed other leading causes by 1950. The age-adjusted death rate for cardiovascular disease decreased by over 70% by 2015, aided by improved medical treatments and access to healthcare through Medicare. The developments cited by the trustees led to a significant decrease in mortality rates in the Social Security population from 1945 to 2015. The death rate declined by approximately 52%, indicating an aging population with more people surviving to retirement age. This trend is projected to continue. The decrease in mortality rates translated into higher average life expectancies for Social Security-covered individuals. In 1945, period life expectancy at birth was 62.9 years for males and 68.4 years for females. In 2015, it increased to 76.2 years for males and 81.0 years for females, indicating a significant increase in life expectancy over the years. In 1945, period life expectancy at age 65 was 14.4 years for females and 12.6 years for males. In 2015, it increased to 20.4 years for females and 17.8 years for males. This trend is projected to continue, leading to rising costs for the Social Security system due to population aging. In 2035, the Social Security system is projected to face aged dependency ratios not seen before, due to lower fertility rates and increased life expectancy. The baby boom generation retiring will further increase these ratios, putting strain on the program's financial position. The ratio of beneficiaries per 100 covered workers is another measure of program sustainability. The ratio of beneficiaries per 100 covered workers is influenced by the baby boom generation. From 1970 to 2008, the ratio remained around 30, but from 2009 to 2017, it increased to 35 as the oldest baby boomers reached retirement age. The trustees project this ratio to continue rising. The ratio of beneficiaries per 100 covered workers is projected to increase steadily, reaching 44 in 2031 and 46 in 2035 when the youngest baby boomers reach full retirement age. The OASDI program requires a ratio of 35 beneficiaries to 100 covered workers to sustain itself. The cost rate is determined by the age distribution of the population. The cost rate of the OASDI program is influenced by the age distribution of the population. The number of beneficiaries per 100 covered workers has been stable from the 1970s to the 2000s due to the baby boomers being in prime working ages. However, both measures have increased in the 2010s as the baby boomers transition into retirement, leading to higher costs. The effects of aging are already evident in the Disability Insurance program. The Chief Actuary testified in 2014 that aging had increased costs in the DI program. Baby boomers entering disability-prone ages caused costs to rise while incomes remained stable. OASI cost rate is projected to rise rapidly as baby boomers retire, increasing beneficiaries faster than workers. The OASDI program's costs are rising while incomes remain stable, leading to a projected imbalance where costs exceed income. The program is primarily funded through a payroll tax on covered earnings and federal income taxes paid by beneficiaries. From 1984 to 2009, annual income exceeded costs, resulting in cash surpluses invested in federal government securities. However, a program with contingency reserves may face periods of cash deficits. The OASDI program's costs are projected to exceed annual income, leading to a depletion of trust funds reserves by 2035. Once the trust funds are exhausted, the program will operate as a strict pay-as-you-go system, only able to pay out 80% of scheduled benefits. Trust Funds depletion will lead to OASDI program funding only 80% of scheduled benefits. Measures to improve solvency include reducing benefits or increasing revenues. Trustees estimate changes like a payroll tax increase to 15.10% or a 17% benefit reduction to maintain solvency. More significant measures will be needed over time. If policies enacted in 2035, when trust funds deplete, the payroll tax rate needed for solvency would rise to 16.05% and benefit reductions to 23%. Lawmakers have various options to address funding shortfalls, including addressing demographic drivers like economic uncertainty affecting fertility rates. Some proposals suggest extending Social Security benefits to cover childcare costs during childbirth. Some proposals argue for extending Social Security benefits to cover childcare during birth or adoption, aiming to reduce financial pressures and potentially increase fertility rates. The benefit formula calculates a worker's Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) based on lifetime earnings indexed to national wage levels. This indexing ensures benefits reflect wage growth over the worker's earning history. Exiting the paid workforce for childcare can impact a worker's future Social Security benefit by reducing the number of computation years used in the benefit formula. If a worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings, years of zero earnings are factored in, affecting the worker's earnings record. Some proposals suggest allowing one parent per household to claim dropout years for childcare-related gaps in earnings. One proposal suggests allowing one parent per household to claim dropout years for childcare-related gaps in earnings, incorporating childcare into the Social Security benefit formula. Childcare credits would be set at one-half the average wage index for that year, ensuring parents with young children are credited for their caregiving. Parents earning less than the childcare credit level would have their earnings records increased to that level. Under current law, increasing fertility rates could help decrease the projected funding shortfall for the OASDI program. A 65% increase in childbearing would be needed to avoid trust fund depletion. Some policymakers suggest increasing eligibility ages to address changing demographics and improve solvency, such as raising the full retirement age. The Social Security program has faced funding shortfalls in the past, leading to measures like raising the full retirement age from 65 to 67 in 1983. There are proposals to increase the earliest eligibility age or further raise the full retirement age to address current funding challenges. Similar to 1983, proposals are being considered to increase the full retirement age (FRA) or the earliest eligibility age (EEA) in response to funding challenges faced by the Social Security program. The Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT) provides estimates for policy provisions affecting claiming ages, with options including raising the FRA, the EEA, or both. The impact of these provisions on solvency dates and actuarial balance is assessed, such as a proposal to gradually raise the full retirement age to 68. Raising the full retirement age to 68 is estimated to improve actuarial balance by 16% and extend solvency to 2035, one year later than current law. Various policy measures increasing eligibility ages do not ensure trust fund solvency or eliminate the funding shortfall. Studies show that adjusting the FRA and EEA reduces Social Security program costs, but solely increasing the age for claiming benefits may not be enough. Research suggests that solely adjusting the age for claiming Social Security benefits may not be sufficient to address the funding shortfall. Demographic changes via eligibility ages have limitations in resolving rising program costs. Disparities in life expectancy based on gender, race, and income levels impact the effectiveness of raising the full retirement age or early eligibility age. Social Security benefits are tied to the average life expectancies of the population. Social Security benefits are linked to the population's average life expectancies, leading to disparities in benefits between groups with longer or shorter life expectancies. Increasing the Full Retirement Age (FRA) could exacerbate these differences. One approach to adjust the FRA is to index it to changes in life expectancies, maintaining a constant ratio of expected retirement years to potential work years. Disparities in life expectancies based on gender, race, and income levels should be considered when implementing policy changes. Policy options involving indexing the FRA to address disparities in life expectancies aim to reduce the projected funding shortfall, but may not eliminate it entirely. Encouraging delayed claiming through adjustments in the benefit formula is one way to address increases in longevity. Under current law, the benefit formula uses a worker's highest 35 years of earnings to calculate the primary insurance amount (PIA). Including more years of earnings in the formula could result in workers needing to work longer or delay claiming to maintain their benefits. Workers can receive their full PIA once they reach full retirement age (FRA) but can choose to delay payment to collect delayed retirement credits. For those born in 1960 and later, adjustments in the benefit formula may be necessary to address increases in longevity. For those born in 1960 and later, delaying retirement credits can increase benefits by 8% of the worker's PIA for each year of delay. This could result in a worker collecting 124% of their PIA if claiming is delayed until age 70. Adjustments to the benefit formula may be needed to address longevity increases, potentially favoring higher earners and impacting certain workers negatively. The proposal to adjust the benefit formula based on longevity increases may favor higher earners and negatively impact workers in more arduous jobs. Increasing life expectancy and decreasing fertility rates are leading to a growing ratio of Social Security beneficiaries to covered workers, weakening the program's financial position. The rising ratio of Social Security beneficiaries to covered workers is projected to deplete trust funds reserves by 2035, leading to insufficient revenues to pay full benefits. Policy measures, such as increasing retirement ages, aim to improve the program's solvency and reduce costs, but may not evenly distribute benefit reductions across all segments of the population. The rising ratio of Social Security beneficiaries to covered workers is projected to deplete trust funds reserves by 2035, leading to insufficient revenues to pay full benefits. Policy measures, such as increasing retirement ages, aim to improve the program's solvency and reduce costs, but may not evenly distribute benefit reductions across all segments of the population. The projected long-range funding shortfall of the OASDI program necessitates policy measures that include both revenue-increasing and benefit-reducing mechanisms to restore solvency and maintain full benefits for the Baby Boomers born between 1946-1964. The baby boomer generation's impact on Social Security demographics is significant. As baby boomers age, the percentage of the population aged 65 or older is increasing. This demographic shift is leading to rising costs and an imbalance between costs and revenues in the Social Security system. Policymakers need to address these trends to ensure the program's solvency and maintain full benefits for all beneficiaries. The imbalance between costs and revenues in Social Security is projected to continue due to demographic trends, particularly beyond the baby-boom generation. This imbalance reflects a persistent gap between those in covered employment and those collecting benefits."
