    "content": "The \"Deficit Reduction Act of 2003\" and the \"Irrigation Subsidy Reduction Act of 2001\" are two Acts with short titles. The first Act focuses on reforming the Bureau of Reclamation water pricing, while the second Act aims to reduce irrigation subsidies. Congress acknowledges the long-standing Federal reclamation program's significant impact on western States' water resources. The program, in existence for over 90 years with a substantial taxpayer investment, provides irrigation water to meet increasing demands. However, the original intent to support small family farms has been hindered by inadequate subsidy implementation, leading to excessive water use encouraged by below-cost prices. (5) Below-cost water prices in the arid West encourage excessive water use, while reasonable price increases for wealthy farmers could promote water conservation. (6) The Federal Government has started using income-based eligibility tests for entitlement and subsidy programs, aligning with the historic approach of limiting water subsidies to smaller farms in the reclamation program. (7) Implementing a means test based on gross income in the reclamation program would enhance the achievement of family farm goals outlined in Federal reclamation laws. SEC. 103. AMENDMENTS. The Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 is amended to redefine legal entity and operator in relation to farm operations.

This definition includes employees and legal entities that are controlled by or have control over another legal entity. The term 'single farm operation' refers to the total acreage of land served with irrigation water for which an individual or legal entity is the operator. The term 'single farm operation' pertains to the total acreage of land irrigated by an individual or legal entity, with rules in place to determine if separate parcels are operated as a single farm operation. Labor and equipment sharing activities do not automatically indicate a single farm operation, and the performance of certain services is also considered.

The Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 is amended to include provisions for single farm operations generating over $500,000 in gross farm income.
