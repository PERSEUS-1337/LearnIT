The \"Country-of-Origin Meat Labeling Act of 1999\" mandates labeling of meat and meat products with country-of-origin details. Definitions in the act include livestock (cattle, sheep, swine, etc.), domestic meat (from US-raised livestock), domestic livestock (born, raised, and processed in the US), and imported meat (not meeting domestic meat criteria). The term 'ultimate purchaser' refers to a person or institution that buys meat for consumption, excluding restaurants and food service establishments. Country-of-origin labels are required for meat and meat products in the US so consumers know where the livestock originated. Packers and processors must label products with origin information before sale. The country-of-origin label requirement for meat and meat products in the US mandates that packers and processors must label products with origin information before sale, specifying the country or countries where the livestock were born, raised, and slaughtered. The country-of-origin label requirement for meat and meat products in the US states that packers and processors must ensure the label is maintained throughout distribution. Exceptions include institutions and restaurants not required to disclose origin. Additionally, products cannot bear a label identifying their origin. The country-of-origin label requirement for meat in the US mandates that imported meat must be labeled with the country of origin. Blended meat products must also have a country-of-origin label. The country-of-origin label for meat products in the US must list the countries of origin of the livestock used, in descending order of predominance. The label must be clearly visible on the product or its packaging, and should not be substituted by an inspection stamp. The Federal Meat Inspection Act requires meat products to bear a country-of-origin label, distinct from inspection stamps, to indicate the origin of the livestock used. Failure to comply results in misbranding under section 1(n) of the Act. Amendments take effect 60 days after enactment."
