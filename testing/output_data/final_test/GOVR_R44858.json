    "content": "Congress has allocated over $2 billion annually for democracy promotion activities in other countries, focusing on good governance, rule of law, and human rights. Policy debates in the 116th Congress may question the consistency and effectiveness of such foreign assistance, especially with President Trump's proposed funding cuts indicating a shift in priorities away from promoting democracy and human rights. The 116th Congress may review the impact of Trump Administration's foreign assistance spending cuts on democracy promotion, assess the effectiveness of democracy promotion activities, and evaluate where democracy promotion ranks among foreign policy priorities. This report provides information on the history of democracy promotion, U.S. agencies involved, funding details, and potential issues for Congress to consider. Democracy promotion aims to encourage the transition to or improvement of democracy in other countries through foreign aid. U.S. foreign aid for democracy promotion focuses on electoral democracy and fundamental rights. Democracy promotion assistance includes activities to establish, consolidate, and protect democratic institutions and values. U.S. foreign aid for democracy promotion focuses on establishing, consolidating, and protecting democratic institutions, processes, and values, including governance, rule of law, political competition, civil society, human rights, and free flow of information. Congress defines \"democracy programs\" as supporting good governance, elections, freedom of expression, human rights, independent media, and strengthening democratic political parties, governments, NGOs, and citizens. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) supports democracy promotion through activities like election support in Afghanistan and judicial reform in Jordan. This includes training for party poll watchers, civic education initiatives for women and youth leaders, and installing computer automation in Jordan's courts. The State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) collaborated with Ukraine to establish a new first-responder police force after the 2014 revolution, focusing on transparency and inclusivity in recruitment, including a public awareness campaign for women's participation. INL's partners focused on women's inclusion in Colombia's municipal governance to implement peace accords. USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives aids in aligning plans with accord priorities, training community leaders, and providing technical assistance to improve government ministries for accord implementation. NED grants in Ethiopia support workshops for officials and leaders to enhance human rights and rule of law. NED supports workshops in Ethiopia for officials and leaders to enhance understanding of human rights and democratic principles. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 emphasizes democratic participation and good governance in U.S. foreign assistance policy. The law has been amended to include democracy promotion authorization for specific regions through legislation such as the Central America Democracy, Peace, and Development Initiative, Support for East European Democracy Act, and the FREEDOM Support Act. State Department democracy activities are guided by various authorities in the U.S. Code chapter on Advancing Democratic Values, and NED activities are authorized through the National Endowment for Democracy Act. Annual appropriations language designates funds for democracy promotion in lieu of new authorizing legislation. Congress uses funds for democracy promotion instead of new authorizing legislation. Democracy assistance can be implemented in countries where other foreign assistance may be prohibited. However, there are laws and agency policies that restrict the scope of democracy assistance activities, such as not influencing election outcomes or supporting partisan political purposes. The United States has supported democratization efforts in some countries post-World War II, but also backed the overthrow of democratically elected regimes. Stability often took precedence over democracy promotion during certain administrations, prioritizing stable dictators for U.S. interests. In the 1970s, U.S. foreign policy focused on promoting democracy and human rights. Congress amended the Foreign Assistance Act to restrict aid to governments with human rights violations. President Carter emphasized democracy promotion, especially in Central and South America, using foreign assistance as leverage to reduce aid to human rights violators. President Carter focused on promoting democracy and human rights, using foreign aid as leverage to reduce assistance to violators in Latin America. In contrast, President Reagan resumed aid to the region, prioritizing the fight against communism over democracy promotion. Reagan's administration adopted a unique approach to democracy promotion, distancing it from human rights and using it as part of an anticommunist agenda. Reagan emphasized the need to cultivate democracy in a famous 1982 speech before the United Kingdom Parliament. President Reagan emphasized the importance of cultivating democracy and supporting democratic ideals through structural reforms like free and fair elections. The Reagan Administration established the National Endowment for Democracy in 1983 to assist foreign prodemocracy organizations. This approach allowed the Administration to support dictatorships while also strengthening democratic movements, replacing covert programs with overt activities independent of U.S. policy. President Reagan solidified bipartisan consensus on promoting electoral democracy among autocratic allies. Focus shifted to Eastern Europe and former Soviet states post-Cold War. The U.S. aimed to promote stability in the region and support transitions to democratic governance and free markets. The Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 was enacted to assist Poland and other countries in the region. The Clinton Administration continued and expanded democracy promotion efforts, making it a pillar of foreign policy. President Clinton focused on enlarging the community of democratic nations, aligning with the \"National Security Strategy of Engagement and Enlargement.\" The 1990s saw significant growth in democracy promotion activities due to low threat perception and global democratic transitions. The global spread of democracy seemed inevitable in the 1990s, leading to the integration of democracy promotion into U.S. foreign policy. Clinton established offices at USAID and the State Department to support democracy in transitioning countries. After 9/11, the Bush Administration emphasized democracy promotion as a way to combat terrorism in the Arab world. The Bush Administration emphasized democracy promotion in the Middle East to combat Islamist extremism, establishing initiatives like MEPI and MCC. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice outlined a vision for \"transformational diplomacy\" in 2006, focusing on building democratic, well-governed states. The Foreign Assistance Framework includes Governing Justly and Democratically as a key objective. The Bush Administration's efforts to promote democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan faced challenges and criticism, with questions raised about the effectiveness of foreign-led democracy promotion. The association of democracy promotion with military intervention, counterterrorism measures, and Islamist parties gaining power in free elections were cited as factors undermining the \"Freedom Agenda.\" Some also argue that Western support for civil society groups was insufficient. The Bush Administration faced challenges in promoting democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan, with criticism over the effectiveness of foreign-led efforts. Western support for civil society groups in \"color revolutions\" led to backlash against democracy promotion in Russia and other countries. The Obama Administration shifted focus by improving relationships with nondemocratic governments. The Arab Spring in 2011 raised hopes for democracy but faced challenges. The Obama Administration and Congress provided democracy assistance in regions with promising democratization prospects while maintaining relations with stable authoritarian regimes. USAID expanded democracy and governance efforts in 2012, focusing on program evaluation and learning. The Trump Administration prioritizes U.S. economic and security interests over democratic governance in foreign relations. Some analysts argue that democracy promotion as a U.S. foreign policy objective is at a crossroads, with concerns about declining political rights and civil liberties in many countries. There are questions about the effectiveness of democracy promotion efforts given the challenges of instability, sectarian conflict, and anti-Western sentiment in some regions. Political polarization, economic recession, extremism, populism, and nationalism have also raised doubts about the appeal of Western-style democracy. Some argue that the appeal of Western-style democracy has diminished, while others believe concerns about declining democracy and authoritarianism are exaggerated. Democracy promotion is now ingrained in U.S. foreign policy, making significant policy changes unlikely. Despite a shift away from the belief in inevitable democratic expansion, Congress continues to support democracy promotion aid, especially focusing on human rights. Concerns have arisen about the effectiveness of democracy promotion in countries with restrictive political environments. In countries with restrictive political environments, NGOs and civil society organizations face attacks on their fundamental rights. CIVICUS documented violations in 96 countries, while ICNL reported over 60 laws restricting civil society since 2015. Supporting democracy advocates in repressive countries can create tension due to oversight conflicts. In 2015, USAID issued guidance on programming in closed spaces, defining them as nonhumanitarian programs in politically repressive countries where the government has adverse relations with the United States. The guidance aimed to review and potentially discontinue programs that require partners to distance themselves from USAID. The USAID guidance on programming in closed spaces emphasizes the need for transparency, unclassified program documents, and awareness among implementing partners. The majority of USAID's closed spaces portfolio is deemed balanced in this regard, with a focus on promoting human rights and democratic governance while ensuring transparency and security. Some argue that the challenges of closed spaces justify U.S. support for organizations like NED over USAID. NED, a nongovernmental organization, is seen as better suited than USAID or State for working in politically restricted environments due to its NGO status and independence from the U.S. Government. NED continued supporting programs in Bolivia even after USAID was expelled in 2013. Democracy promotion is managed by various agencies, with USAID being the primary manager of foreign assistance programs. USAID is the lead U.S. government manager of foreign assistance programs, including democracy promotion and human rights assistance. Programs are designed and monitored by USAID officials at the mission level, often in collaboration with nongovernmental partners. The Center for Excellence on Democracy, Human Rights and Governance (DRG) in USAID's Washington office supports democracy promotion activities. The Center for Excellence on Democracy, Human Rights and Governance (DRG) is the hub of USAID democracy promotion, focusing on policy changes, program development, and research. Established in 2012 with increased staff and new divisions, DRG produced the 2013 USAID Strategy on Democracy, Human Rights and Governance. The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), established in 1994, provides rapid response peace and democracy promotion assistance in countries in political crisis, with short-term programs lasting two to five years. The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) operates short-term programs in countries experiencing political change, staffed by personal service contractors for rapid expansion. OTI works in strategic countries where other entities like DRG cannot engage due to lack of presence or time pressure. As of early 2018, OTI was active in several countries including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burma, Colombia, and Syria. OTI complements State Department democracy promotion activities, focusing on advancing democracy, good governance, and human rights globally through the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL). The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) primarily provides short-term assistance through grant-making to U.S. nonprofit organizations promoting human rights, democracy, religious freedom, labor rights, transitional justice, and Internet freedom. DRL targets countries with closed societies and little political will for reform, where USAID does not operate. It focuses on building demand for accountable governance and rule of law through international and local NGOs. The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) works on democracy promotion in countries where USAID does not operate. It collaborates with public-private partnerships to address gender-based violence, anticorruption, and civil society organizations. The bureau is under the authority of the Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, who oversees various offices related to democracy promotion, including the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) office. INL supports anticorruption, law enforcement, and justice sector strengthening activities to promote accountable, rights-respecting institutions. The State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) manages exchange programs with democracy promotion elements. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) provides grants for democracy promotion activities. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) provides grants to organizations involved in human rights and democracy promotion. NED grants are awarded to affiliated organizations and indigenous NGOs, allowing for activities in places where official entities are limited. NED's activities are seen as more independent of U.S. foreign policy compared to USAID or State democracy programs. Grants are reviewed and approved by the NED board of directors on a case-by-case basis. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) provides grants for various program areas such as freedom of information, political processes, democratic values, human rights, and civic education. NED reports annually to Congress and quarterly to the State on fund usage. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), established in 2004, implements foreign assistance compacts with countries based on governance indicators to reduce poverty through economic growth, excluding human rights and democracy promotion activities in its compacts. The MCC selection process promotes democracy and human rights by including indicators related to civil liberties and political rights. MCC holds partners accountable for good governance, with the threat of suspending or terminating programs creating leverage for the U.S. government in policy discussions. The MCC threshold program used to directly promote democracy, but now focuses on it only when lack of progress hinders economic growth. The U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Justice, Department of Labor, and Department of Defense, play a role in promoting democracy internationally through various programs. International broadcasting activities also contribute to democracy promotion. The U.S. government supports democracy promotion through various agencies and programs, including international broadcasting activities. Nonprofit organizations like The Asia Foundation and the U.S. Institute of Peace also receive direct appropriations for democracy promotion efforts. Additionally, U.S. intelligence agencies may engage in similar activities, but details are not publicly disclosed. The United States also backs multilateral institutions like the United Nations Development Program and Freedom House in democracy and human rights promotion. The U.S. government supports democracy promotion through various agencies and programs, including international broadcasting activities. Nonprofit organizations like The Asia Foundation and the U.S. Institute of Peace also receive direct appropriations for democracy promotion efforts. Multilateral donors committed $17.47 billion in official development assistance for governance and civil society development programs in 2016. U.S. democracy promotion assistance is primarily funded within the Department of State and USAID budgets. Funding for U.S. democracy promotion activities is channeled primarily through the Economic Support Fund (ESF). Funding for U.S. democracy promotion activities is primarily channeled through various accounts within the annual State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations bill. While specific allocations for democracy programs are often unspecified in legislation, the NED and DF accounts focus on democracy promotion, while the ESF, DA, INL, and AEECA accounts support a wide range of activities. The proportion of these accounts allocated to democracy promotion activities is determined by Administration reporting after the fact. Funding for U.S. democracy promotion activities is categorized by Administrations under the Governing Justly and Democratically (GJD) objective. The framework tracks funding across appropriations accounts into subcomponents such as Civil Society, Political Competition, Good Governance, and Rule of Law/Human Rights. Data is available from FY2002 through the FY2019 request, with FY2018 data currently only available in total, not by sub-objective. The FY2019 request includes a $1,689 million budget for overall democracy promotion assistance, with $1,595 million allocated for GJD activities and $107 million for NED. This represents a 32% cut from the enacted FY2017 funding level. \"Good governance\" and \"rule of law/human rights\" have been the highest-funded subcategories, while \"political competition\" has consistently been the lowest-funded subcategory within the GJD framework. NED funding has comprised between 3%-7% of annual democracy promotion assistance each year since FY2002. The FY2019 budget proposal includes a $1,689 million budget for democracy promotion assistance, with $1,595 million for GJD activities and $107 million for NED. The request shows a shift towards good governance activities and away from rule of law and human rights activities. Afghanistan has been the top recipient of assistance funds in recent years. In FY2017, Afghanistan received $302 million, the State Department's Western Hemisphere Regional Office received $235 million, and other top recipients included Syria ($161 million), Ukraine ($100 million), Mexico ($77 million), Colombia, Iraq, and Jordan. NED funding is provided annually through a NED appropriations account, with allocations specified in annual reports to Congress. NED funding breakdown by primary grantee and discretionary grant funds over the past 10 years is detailed. Top country recipients in FY2017 and FY2018 are listed. Critics argue that imposing American values through democracy promotion is arrogant and fuels resentment, while advocates argue for the importance of democracy and participatory government. Proponents of democracy promotion argue that it supports organizations and individuals abroad fighting for freedom, while critics claim it interferes with local politics. Critics also argue that leaders not elected through fair elections lack legitimacy. Democracy promotion can conflict with other foreign policy priorities. Critics argue that US pressure on undemocratic regimes conflicts with foreign policy priorities, undermining moral authority. Some believe democracy promotion efforts in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq are ineffective and lead to unintended consequences like regional instability. Advocates of democracy promotion argue that focusing on examples like Iraq and Afghanistan overlooks successful cases in countries like Colombia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Slovakia, and Tunisia. Congress plays a crucial role in shaping U.S. democracy assistance programs, with concerns raised about the Trump Administration's actions undermining these efforts. President Trump's praise for authoritarian leaders and intermittent criticism of democratic leaders have also sparked worries among Members of Congress. President Trump's actions, including praise for authoritarian leaders and criticism of democratic allies, have raised concerns about the Administration's stance on promoting democracy. The prioritization of economic ties with Saudi Arabia over human rights issues and proposed cuts to democracy promotion aid have further fueled worries. The conflict between Congress and the Administration on promoting democracy and condemning authoritarian regimes may continue in the 116th Congress. The Administration proposed significant cuts to democracy promotion aid, exceeding cuts for foreign assistance programs overall. Congress reduced funding for democracy promotion assistance in FY2018, but FY2019 bills include slightly more funding. Concerns have been raised about the Administration's stance on promoting democracy, especially with its prioritization of economic ties with Saudi Arabia over human rights issues. Congress may scrutinize costs versus benefits of democracy promotion activities and foreign assistance budget if significant cuts are proposed. Monitoring and evaluation of democracy promotion assistance are similar to other foreign aid programs, with established practices for tracking resources and contract performance. Evaluating program effectiveness remains challenging, especially in documenting impact. The impact of democracy promotion activities can be challenging due to abstract objectives, political sensitivity, and potential backsliding. A 2006 study by USAID found significant positive effects of democracy assistance programs. However, recent evaluations of U.S. democracy promotion aid are lacking, despite attention to disappointing results in countries like Egypt and Russia. USAID is increasing efforts to assess its programs. USAID has intensified efforts to evaluate democracy and human rights programs, focusing on effectiveness. Congress may consider using oversight to examine the impact of such assistance. Implementing democracy aid directly through USAID or indirectly through NED or multilateral entities has pros and cons. NED was created for transparent democracy promotion, but limits policymakers' control. Multilateral channels like the U.N. Democracy Fund further restrict U.S. policymakers' oversight. The U.N. Democracy Fund limits U.S. policymakers' oversight, viewed as more legitimate but can create conflict. Less than 10% of U.S. democracy assistance goes to NED and multilateral programs. Congress should consider aid channels and resource allocation for democracy promotion. The Trump Administration prioritizes national security and economic gains in bilateral relationships, potentially overshadowing democracy and human rights promotion. Congressional advocates of human rights may oppose bolstering nondemocratic regimes for security reasons or viewing democratic systems as a trade disadvantage. Congress must consider various interests in foreign policy. Some experts argue that the American \"brand\" has been tarnished by problems within American democracy, leading to questions about ongoing U.S. efforts to promote democracy abroad. Global perceptions of the relationship between democracy, peace, and prosperity have changed as new democracies face economic and security challenges. Despite challenges, some assert that promoting democracy abroad is more important than ever for U.S. global leadership. The importance of promoting democratic values abroad is crucial as diminished U.S. leadership could allow other countries, like China with its authoritarian capitalism model, to gain prominence. The implications of alternative models gaining legitimacy should be considered as Congress and the Trump Administration discuss the role of democracy in foreign policy."
