    "content": "The text chunk discusses the National Transportation Safety Board Amendments of 1996, including a section on foreign investigations. Section 1114 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to include provisions regarding foreign aircraft accident investigations. The Board is restricted from disclosing records or information related to its participation in such investigations, except under specific circumstances outlined in the amendment. The amendment to Section 1114 of title 49, United States Code, allows the Board to refer to foreign accident investigation information for safety recommendations without restrictions. SEC. 103 amends Section 1114(b) of title 49, United States Code to protect voluntarily provided safety-related information from disclosure if it is not related to accident or incident investigations. SEC. 104 amends Section 1115 of title 49, United States Code to allow the Board to conduct training for its employees and other government personnel, foreign governments, and industry personnel in accident investigation. Reimbursement of training costs may be required, with amounts credited to the Board's appropriation. SEC. 105 amends Section 1118(a) of title 49, United States Code to authorize appropriations of $42,400,00 for fiscal year 1997, $44,400,000 for fiscal year 1998, and $46,600,000 for fiscal year 1999. TITLE II is the \"Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Amendments Act of 1996\" and includes definitions and amendments to title 49, United States Code. SEC. 203 amends Section 5901 by updating definitions and adding a new one for 'gross cargo weight'. SEC. 204 addresses notification and certification requirements. Section 5902 is amended to require prior notification for intermodal transportation, specifying weight limits and communication methods. This applies to any person in the United States. Section 5902 requires certification for intermodal transportation of containers or trailers with a gross cargo weight over 29,000 pounds. The certification must include the weight and a description of the contents. Section 5902 mandates certification for intermodal transportation of containers or trailers over 29,000 pounds, including weight, contents description, certifying party identity, container/trailer number, and certification date. Carriers can transfer certification data to another document or electronic format for subsequent carriers, noting the transfer date and party identity. Shipping documents prepared by the container/trailer tenderer must contain this information. The term 'Freight All Kinds' or 'FAK' cannot be used for certification after December 31, 2000, if any commodity in a trailer or container exceeds 20 percent of the total weight. A separate document used for certification must be marked 'INTERMODAL CERTIFICATION'. This applies to anyone who tenders a container or trailer. The certification for intermodal transportation within the United States must be forwarded before or when the container or trailer is tendered to the subsequent carrier. Failure to do so may result in liability for any fines incurred. The liability for inaccurate transfer of information or failure to forward certification includes fines, penalties, costs, and interest. A subsequent carrier may have a lien against the contents of the container for any incurred expenses. Liability for inaccurate transfer of information or failure to forward certification includes fines, penalties, costs, and interest. If a subsequent carrier incurs expenses due to this, the person responsible is liable to the owner or beneficial owner for the lien amount and related costs. The notification and certification requirements do not apply to intermodal containers or trailers loaded by a motor carrier if the carrier performs the highway portion of the movement or assumes responsibility for weight-related fines incurred by another carrier. SEC. 205. PROHIBITIONS. Section 5903 is amended to include provisions regarding the transportation of intermodal containers or trailers without certification. If a motor carrier does not receive certification before receiving a loaded container, they can presume the weight is under 29,001 pounds. A copy of the certification is not required to accompany the container or trailer. Section 5903 is amended to include provisions for notifying leased operators of intermodal containers or trailers that may violate state weight laws. Motor carriers must inform operators of the certified gross cargo weight to prevent violations. The motor carrier must provide written notice to the operator before tendering the container or trailer, bearing the burden of proof. If the operator is fined for violating weight laws and the carrier fails to provide the required notice, the operator is entitled to reimbursement for fines and court costs. The motor carrier is responsible for reimbursing fines and court costs if they fail to provide notice to the operator before tendering the container or trailer. SEC. 206. LIENS. Section 5905 is amended to address situations where a person involved in intermodal transportation of a loaded container or trailer is required to post a bond or pay a fine due to violations of state weight laws. This includes cases of erroneous information provided in certifications, failure to provide certifications, failure to forward certifications, or errors in information transfer. The amendment to Section 5905 addresses errors in information transfer on certifications in intermodal transportation. It establishes a lien against the contents for the bond, fine, penalty, costs, or interest incurred until payment is received from the owner or responsible party. The amendment establishes a lien against the contents for costs, expenses, or interest until payment is received. SEC. 207 amends Section 5906 regarding perishable agricultural commodities. SEC. 208 changes the effective date to 180 days after enactment. SEC. 209 adds a new section on the relationship to other laws. Section 5908 clarifies that this chapter does not affect transportation of hazardous materials or state highway weight/size laws for tractor-trailer combinations. It also includes a clerical amendment to the table of sections."
