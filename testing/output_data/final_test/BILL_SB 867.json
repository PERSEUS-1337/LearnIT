    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 76000.5 of the Government Code is amended. Section 76000.5 of the Government Code allows county boards of supervisors to levy an additional penalty of $2 for every $10 of fines collected for criminal offenses to support emergency medical services. This penalty applies to fines for violations of various codes and ordinances and is collected in the same manner as other penalties. The additional penalty of $2 for every $10 of fines collected for criminal offenses to support emergency medical services does not apply to certain penalties, including restitution fines, penalties authorized by specific codes, parking offenses, and state surcharges. Funds collected should not reduce funding for other programs, and the money collected will be taken from fines and forfeitures deposited with the county treasurer. Funds collected from penalties for criminal offenses will be deposited into the Maddy Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Fund. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2027. Each county can establish an emergency medical services fund for reimbursements, administered either by the county or the state. The Maddy Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Fund reimburses administrative costs up to 10% of the fund amount. Interest earned is deposited for disbursement. Administering agencies can maintain reserves up to 15% for physicians, surgeons, and hospitals, and any amount for other emergency medical services determined by each county. The Maddy Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Fund reimburses administrative costs up to 10% of the fund amount and allows for reserves up to 15% for physicians, surgeons, and hospitals. The remaining balance is distributed to physicians, surgeons, and hospitals for emergency medical services, with 58% going to physicians and surgeons for emergency services and 25% to hospitals providing disproportionate trauma and emergency medical care services. Seventeen percent of the Maddy Emergency Medical Services Fund is allocated for various emergency medical services purposes determined by each county, such as funding regional poison control centers. The source of the fund is penalty assessments as outlined in the Government Code. Physicians and surgeons can be reimbursed up to 50% of claimed amounts for the initial cycle of reimbursements in a year. Any remaining funds at the end of the fiscal year will be distributed proportionally to all physicians and surgeons who submitted qualifying claims. (e) 15 percent of funds from Section 76000.5 of the Government Code will support pediatric trauma centers in the county, reimbursing physicians and hospitals for emergency care services and equipment. Local EMS agencies can assess needs for allocation. Counties without pediatric trauma centers must use the funds accordingly. The funds from Section 76000.5 of the Government Code will be used to improve pediatric trauma and emergency services in the county, with a preference for hospitals specializing in children's services and physicians providing emergency care for children. Funds spent for this purpose will be known as Richie's Fund and will be in effect until January 1, 2027. Costs of administering funds from Section 76000.5 of the Government Code will be reimbursed from the money collected, not exceeding actual administrative costs or 10% of the funds collected, until January 1, 2027."
