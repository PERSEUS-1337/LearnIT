    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Chemical Facilities Security Act of 2008\" and involves the modification and transfer of the chemical-facilities security program. Modification and transfer of the chemical-facilities security program involves striking sunset provision and preemption clauses, transferring and redesignating sections, and making stylistic modifications in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Title XXI of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 focuses on the regulation of security practices at chemical facilities, including risk-based performance standards, vulnerability assessments, and site security plans. The Secretary will establish risk-based performance standards for security of chemical facilities, requiring vulnerability assessments and site security plans for facilities with high security risk levels. Chemical facilities can choose layered security measures to address these standards. The Secretary has authority over the development and implementation of site security plans. The Secretary has authority to approve site security plans based on risk-based performance standards and may also approve alternative security programs. The Secretary is responsible for reviewing and approving vulnerability assessments and site security plans. Exempted facilities are not subject to these requirements. The Secretary exempts certain facilities from regulations under this title, including those regulated by other acts, public water systems, treatment works, facilities owned by the Department of Defense or Energy, and those regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \"SEC. 2102. PROTECTIONS FROM PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.\" \"Information developed under this title, including vulnerability assessments and security-related documents, shall be protected from public disclosure similar to chemical facilities under regulation. The Secretary may share information with State and local officials with security clearances, but not disclose it under State or local laws.\" \"Vulnerability assessments, site security plans, and related security information submitted to the Secretary shall be treated as classified material.\" \"SEC. 2103. ENFORCEMENT.\" The Secretary can impose civil penalties for violating orders under this title. Chemical facilities will be audited and inspected for compliance. Noncompliance will result in written notification and an order to comply. The Secretary has the authority to issue an order for a chemical facility to cease operation if the owner or operator continues to be in noncompliance. This title gives exclusive authority to the Secretary for enforcement, and it does not affect other federal laws regulating chemical substances. The authority of states to adopt more stringent regulations for chemical facility security is preserved under this title, without impairing their jurisdiction over facilities within the state."
