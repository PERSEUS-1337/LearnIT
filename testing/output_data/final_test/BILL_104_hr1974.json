The SSI Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1995 mandates reapplication for adults receiving SSI benefits based on disability. An individual's eligibility for benefits is effective for a 3-year period starting from the determination date, with lapses unless continuing eligibility is reassessed before each 3-year period ends. This provision ceases when the individual turns 65. The SSI Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1995 requires adults receiving SSI benefits based on disability to reapply every 3 years. Eligibility for benefits lasts for a 3-year period, with reassessment needed before each period ends. This requirement ends when the individual reaches 65 years of age. The SSI Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1995 mandates adults on SSI disability benefits to reapply every 3 years. Eligibility lasts for a 3-year period, with reassessment required before each period ends, until the individual turns 65. If the individual has been receiving benefits for 3 years or less, the first period is deemed to end after a specific number of months. If receiving benefits for 5 years or less but more than 3 years, the first period ends after a 1-year period. The SSI Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1995 requires adults on SSI disability benefits to reapply every 3 years. If the individual has been receiving benefits for more than five years, the Commissioner will make redeterminations without requiring new applications. The first 3-year period is determined based on the individual's age at the time the clause takes effect. The SSI Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1995 mandates adults on SSI disability benefits to reapply every 3 years. The Commissioner must notify individuals one year before their determination expires, explaining the consequences of not submitting the application on time. If the application is submitted at least 180 days before the expiration date and the redetermination is not completed by then, benefits will continue until the redetermination is made. The SSI Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1995 requires adults on SSI disability benefits to reapply every 3 years. If the application is not submitted on time, individuals may apply for a redetermination. The amendment takes effect after 9 months from the enactment of the Act, and a section of the Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994 is repealed. SEC. 3.
