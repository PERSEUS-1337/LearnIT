    "content": "The \"Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act\" includes provisions such as processing facilities, refugee program priorities, special immigrant status for certain Iraqis, and reports. The Act also addresses countries with significant populations of displaced Iraqis and authorization of appropriations. The United Nations estimates 2,000,000 Iraqis internally displaced and over 2,000,000 Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries. The humanitarian needs of these populations are significant, and if not met, they could become a recruiting ground for terrorists. Iraqi refugees are a financial burden on the region, and the Iraq Study Group warns of further destabilization if the crisis is not addressed. Many Iraqis who supported the US Government in critical positions have faced reprisals. Many Iraqis have been killed or injured in reprisals for supporting the American effort, leading to a significant number fleeing Iraq in fear. The United States has a fundamental obligation to assist Iraqis displaced by the war, especially those who have supported America's efforts. US officials have expressed commitment to resettling Iraqi refugees, with estimates of up to 25,000 refugees being resettled. The United States must develop a comprehensive approach to support host governments and assist Iraq's refugees and internally displaced persons, particularly those who have worked with or for the US military and embassy.

Special immigrant status may be granted to eligible aliens under the Immigration and Nationality Act if they meet certain criteria, including submitting a petition, being eligible for an immigrant visa, and being admissible to the United States for permanent residence. Aliens described in this subsection are nationals of Iraq who worked for the United States Government in Iraq for at least 1 year after 2003 and provided faithful service. Spouses and children of these principal aliens may also qualify for special immigrant status.

These aliens are eligible for resettlement assistance and other benefits similar to refugees.

Ineligible aliens under section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act cannot participate in the program.
