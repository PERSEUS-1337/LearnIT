    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 17144.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to modify the Internal Revenue Code regarding exclusion limits for gross income and qualified principal residence indebtedness. The exclusion amount is set at $500,000 ($250,000 for married individuals filing separately), and the indebtedness limit is adjusted to $800,000 ($400,000) from the previous $1,000,000 ($500,000). The amendments made by Section 102 of the federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 to Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code apply to discharges of indebtedness occurring on or after January 1, 2007. No penalties or interest are due for the discharge of qualified principal residence indebtedness during the 2007, 2009, or 2013 taxable year, regardless of whether the taxpayer reports it on their return. The changes made by the federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 to Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code apply to discharges of indebtedness from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2015. No penalties or interest are due for the discharge of qualified principal residence indebtedness in the 2014 taxable year. No penalties or interest are due for the discharge of qualified principal residence indebtedness during the 2015 taxable year. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code apply to discharges of indebtedness from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2015. The Legislature deems the amendments necessary to align state law with federal tax changes, preventing hardship for taxpayers with discharged home debt from 2014 to 2015. The amendments align state law with federal tax changes regarding income from discharge of indebtedness for qualified principal residence indebtedness. The changes apply to debts discharged between January 1, 2015, and January 1, 2017, with exceptions for pre-existing arrangements. The amendments align state law with federal tax changes for qualified principal residence indebtedness discharged between January 1, 2015, and January 1, 2017. This act is an urgency statute for immediate effect to prevent undue hardship to taxpayers. To provide immediate tax relief to distressed homeowners, this act must take effect immediately."
