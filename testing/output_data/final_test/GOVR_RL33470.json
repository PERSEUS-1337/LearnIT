The NTIA budget for FY2006 was $39.6 million, with two main components: Salaries and Expenses received $17.8 million, mainly for managing information and telecommunications policies, and the Public Telecommunications and Facilities Program (PTFPC) received $21.7 million. The Bush Administration requested $18.5 million for Salaries and Expenses in FY2008. The Bush Administration sought to end funding for the Public Telecommunications and Facilities Program (PTFPC) in its FY2008 budget request. Another program requested was the Digital Transition and Safety Public Fund, funded by receipts from spectrum license auctions, set at $45 million in FY2007. This fund would support a digital-analog converter box program and public safety grants for interoperable communications. The FY2007 CR includes funding for public safety interoperable communications grants, New York City's 9/11 digital transition, assistance for low-power television stations, a national alert and tsunami warning program, and funding to enhance a national alert system. However, complete funding for these functions has not been determined yet. The President's budget did not request funding for the National Technical Information Service for FY2007. The House of Representatives also did not appropriate any funding. The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) did not receive funding for FY2007 from the House of Representatives, Senate Committee on Appropriations, or the continuing resolution (P.L. 110-5). NTIS will continue to draw funding from its Revolving Fund. NTIS achieved a positive net income of $1.92 million for FY2006 due to efforts to develop new products and limit spending. NTIS is part of the Technology Administration at the Department of Commerce. The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) was established within the Department of Commerce in 1970, with origins dating back to World War II. It serves as the central source for the sale of scientific, technical, engineering, and business information for the U.S. government and international sources, supporting economic growth and job creation. The NTIS supports economic growth and job creation by providing access to government information products. It offers fee-based services to federal agencies, including distribution of information products, web development, and custom research services. The growth of electronic publishing has impacted NTIS sales, as more documents are available online for free from other sources. The NTIS provides information services that may overlap with private sector companies. They maintain a permanent repository of information, including budget requests for discretionary spending by the Bureau of the Census. The FY2007 budget request for the Bureau of the Census was $66 million higher than the FY2006 enacted amount. This increase was mainly for preparations for the 2010 census, including the American Community Survey. The Bureau planned to use the funds for planning, testing, and developing the census, improved mapping, and maintaining the ACS implementation. To help fund the 2010 census, the Bureau proposed eliminating the Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey from the economic census. The Bureau of the Census proposed phasing out the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and designing a new data collection system on income and wealth dynamics to meet policy and operational needs. This new system will replace the SIPP, which has been the leading source of data on the economic well-being of Americans for the past two decades. The FY2007 budget includes $9.2 million for this purpose, with $5.6 million allocated for designing the new system. The Bureau of the Census allocated $9.2 million in the FY2007 budget to design a new data collection system to replace the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). $5.6 million was designated for the design, with the remaining $3.6 million intended for a ninth wave of 2004 SIPP panel data collection. The House Appropriations Committee recommended an additional $10 million for SIPP data collection and dissemination. The House approved amendments to shift $58.3 million from FY2007 Census Bureau funding to crime-fighting efforts, including combating methamphetamine-related crimes. Representative Ginny Brown-Waite proposed reallocating $10 million to the Violence Against Women Act. Representative Nancy Johnson's amendment decreased Bureau funding by $3.3 million. Nancy Johnson's amendment reduced Bureau funding by $3.3 million and allocated the same amount to the FBI's Innocent Images Program for protecting children from online predators. The House approved $825.9 million for the Census Bureau in FY2007, with $190.1 million for salaries and expenses and $635.8 million for programs. The funding shift would impact data collection for the ACS, affecting the representation of the U.S. population. The Senate recommended $828.2 million for the Bureau in FY2007. In FY2007, the Bureau received $828.2 million, exceeding the House amount by $2.3 million and the FY2006 enacted amount by $26.3 million. However, it was $50 million less than the budget request. The shortfall was in the periodic programs account, which received $644.1 million instead of the requested $694.1 million. The committee report encouraged the Bureau to minimize personal visits for non-response follow-up in census surveys to increase cost savings. Congress later agreed to $696.4 million for periodic programs and $196.6 million for salaries and expenses, totaling $893 million for the Bureau in FY2007. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) received $1.843 billion in budget authority for FY2007, funded by user fees. The Administration requested an extension of a fee increase law for patents and proposed additional legislation for a permanent extension. The USPTO received $1.843 billion in budget authority for FY2007, funded by user fees. Legislation was proposed to permanently extend a fee increase law for patents. H.R. 5672 would have provided $1.771 billion for FY2007, 5% above the previous fiscal year. The CBO re-estimated fees collected downward to $1.771 billion. No final FY2007 appropriations bill was enacted during the 109th Congress. The USPTO was funded through February 15, 2007, by continuing resolutions. P.L. 110-5 provided $1.771 billion for the Patent and Trademark Office in FY2007. H.R. 2862 initially allocated $1.703 billion, but final appropriations (P.L. 109-108) reduced it to $1.683 billion due to revised fee collections. Appropriation measures since 1990 have limited the USPTO's use of collected fees, sparking controversy. The Technology Administration and the Office of the Under Secretary of Technology in the Department of Commerce advocate national policies to foster technology development for economic growth. The Office also manages the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Technical Information Service. The President's budget proposed a $1.5 million spending for the Technology Administration in FY2007, a 75% decrease from the previous fiscal year. The Technology Administration's funding for the Office of the Under Secretary of Technology decreased significantly in FY2007. The House and Senate proposed funding levels were below the previous year's figures, with the final appropriations bill providing $2 million, a 66% decrease from FY2006. The final FY2006 appropriations bill, P.L. 109-108, funded the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at $5.9 million. NIST's mandate is to support U.S. companies with technology development and diffusion, as well as provide measurement and quality assurance techniques for commerce and public safety. The Administration's FY2007 budget proposed $581.3 million for NIST, a decrease from the previous year. The Administration's FY2007 budget allocated $581.3 million for NIST, a 22.7% decrease from the previous year. Funding for internal R&D activities would increase by 18.3% to $467 million. No funding was requested for the Advanced Technology Program, and support for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership would decline by 55.7% to $46.3 million. Construction financing would total $68 million, a 60.8% decrease from FY2006. H.R. 5672 provided $627 million in FY2007 funding for NIST, a 16.6% decrease from the previous year. In the STRS account, laboratory R&D funding would increase by 18.3% to $467 million, while MEP funding would total $92 million, 12% below the previous fiscal year. The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed funding NIST at $764 million, 1.6% above FY2006. No financing was allocated for ATP, but increased support was provided for internal laboratory R&D, MEP program, and construction activities. Funding for MEP would increase by 1.3% to $106 million, and construction would be financed at $191 million, 10% above the previous level. The 110th Congress passed P.L. 110-5, appropriating $675 million for NIST in FY2007. Funding for the STRS account increased by 9.6% to $432.8 million, construction support decreased by 66% to $58.6 million, while other programs remained at FY2006 levels including $79 million for ATP and $104.6 million for MEP. The President's FY2006 budget requested $532 million for NIST, with $426.3 million for the STRS account. H.R. 2862 would have provided $548.7 million for NIST. The House initially proposed $548.7 million for NIST, with $397.7 million for the STRS account, $106 million for MEP, and $45 million for construction. The Senate later funded NIST at $844.5 million, including $399.9 million for STRS, $106 million for MEP, and $140 million for ATP. The final FY2006 appropriations provided $752 million for NIST, with $394.8 million for STRS, $104.6 million for MEP, and funding for ATP. Continued support for the Advanced Technology Program has been a major funding issue. ATP provides \"seed financing\" to businesses for development of generic technologies with broad applications. Opponents criticize it as \"corporate welfare,\" while supporters argue it assists businesses in developing crucial technologies. Funding for ATP has been maintained by Congress, often decreasing. Funding for the Advanced Technology Program has been a major issue in Congress. While support for the program has been maintained, funding amounts have fluctuated over the years. Additionally, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program has also faced budget challenges in recent years. The President's recommendation led to a decrease in federal funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, but funding was restored in FY2005. The Administration plans to double funding for innovation research at NIST over 10 years as part of the American Competitiveness Initiative. The President's FY2007 budget requested an 18.3% increase in funding for intramural research at NIST. President Bush's FY2007 budget requested a significant increase in funding for intramural R&D at NIST. P.L. 110-5 provided for a 9.6% increase in research support within NIST facilities. NOAA, the largest agency in the Department of Commerce, had a budget request of almost $3.68 billion for FY2007, with $2.59 billion for Operations, Research, and Facilities and $1.02 billion for Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction. Additional funding was requested for Other Accounts, including the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund and Coastal Zone Management Fund. In FY2006, NOAA received a total appropriation of $4.1 billion, with $3.94 billion funded by the Science, State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Act. There was an across-the-board rescission of 0.28% for DOC, resulting in a net appropriation of $3.91 billion for NOAA. Additionally, NOAA received $54 million in emergency appropriations for Hurricane Katrina recovery, bringing their total FY2006 appropriations to almost $3.95 billion. In FY2006, NOAA received a total appropriation of $4.1 billion, with increases proposed for the National Weather Service and NOAA Satellite programs. This included funding for the Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellite program and the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite System. President Bush's FY2007 budget request for NOAA was $3.68 billion, $420 million less than the previous year. The President requested $12.4 million for NWS for FY2007 to procure the last 19 tsunami detection buoys as part of a National Tsunami Warning Program. He also proposed savings of $590 million for FY2007 by terminating funding for certain NOAA programs. Joint Oceans Commission leaders objected to funding cuts for ocean and coastal research budgets in the President's FY2007 budget. Issues debated during NOAA's FY2007 budget deliberations included dissatisfaction with the management of the polar satellite program and concerns about funding not meeting recommendations for ocean research. The House passed legislation to fund all NOAA programs under a single law, but no further action was taken in the Senate. President Bush signed the budget on February 15, 2007. President Bush signed H.J.Res. 20 into law as P.L. 110-5 on February 15, 2007, providing almost $3.98 billion for NOAA for FY2007. The act increased NOAA appropriations by about $26 million above FY2006 levels, with certain loan guarantees reduced by $21 million. The FY2007 appropriation was $298 million more than the FY2007 request of $3.68 billion. H.J.Res. 53 (Miller-MI) proposes amending the U.S. Constitution to base House of Representatives apportionment on U.S. citizens, not persons. It would require a citizenship question on the decennial census. H.R. 5450 (Ehlers) establishes NOAA within the Department of Commerce, maintaining current leadership but creating a new Deputy Assistant Secretary for Science and Education. It also mandates the National Weather Service to remain within NOAA. The legislation establishes programs to support NOAA's operations and services, requires assessments of environmental data systems, strategic plans, and a reorganization plan to be submitted to Congress. It also repeals the executive order establishing NOAA, preserves current rules and regulations, and sets conditions for program cost baselines. H.R. 337 (Maloney) proposes amending present law to extend the term of office of the Director of the Census to five years and require direct reporting to the Secretary of Commerce. Introduced on January 25, 2005, it is currently under review by the House Committee on Government Reform. The curr_chunk provides an overview of various CRS reports on different government agencies and initiatives, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, Ocean Commissions, Strengthening America's Communities Initiative, Tsunamis monitoring, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Appropriations Process. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established in 1958 to conduct space and aeronautics activities. NASA's budget for FY2007 was $16.792 billion, with a 1% increase from the previous year. The House provided $16.709 billion in funding, while the Senate recommended $16.757 billion plus an additional $1.040 billion in emergency funding. In FY2007, NASA's budget was $16.247 billion, with additional funding for civil servant pay. NASA implemented a new accounting system called \"full cost simplification\" in September 2006, which balanced program costs without changing the total budget. The new system made it difficult to directly compare amounts between FY2007 appropriation and request. NASA's FY2007 budget of $16.247 billion included additional funding for civil servant pay. The budget priorities were driven by the Vision for Space Exploration, aiming to return the space shuttle to flight status, retire it by 2010, complete the space station by 2017, return humans to the moon by 2020, and eventually send humans to Mars. The President did not propose increased funding for NASA, relying on redirecting funds from other activities to achieve the Vision. Griffin's approach of \"go as you can afford to pay\" constrains NASA's priorities, with funding for Constellation Systems increasing from $1.7 billion in FY2006 to $3.1 billion in the FY2007 request. The House and Senate provided less funding than requested for Exploration Systems, resulting in a $578 million reduction in the final appropriation. Additionally, reduced growth in Science funding would lead to a proposed $3.1 billion reduction through FY2010. The FY2007 budget request included a proposed reduction of $3.1 billion through FY2010, mainly to offset costs for the space shuttle program post-Columbia accident. Funding for Mars missions was cancelled, while Research and Analysis funding decreased by 15%. The House allocated $75 million more for Science, including $50 million for Research and Analysis, while the Senate recommended increases for two Science programs. Funding for SOFIA and the Europa mission was not requested. In FY2007, NASA's final appropriation was $5.251 billion, $79 million less than the request. Aeronautics Research in SA&E remained the same but with significant content changes. The largest program, Vehicle Systems, was renamed Fundamental Aeronautics and focused on subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flight regimes. Congressional opposition led to increased funding recommendations for NASA aeronautics. The House and Senate provided more funding than requested for Aeronautics Research. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $35 million more than the request, providing $890 million for aeronautics. NASA's human space flight programs, the space shuttle and the International Space Station, are affected by the Vision to retire the shuttle in 2010. The Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) is being developed to take astronauts to the moon and visit the ISS, with a planned launch no later than 2014. There may be a multi-year gap where the US cannot launch its own astronauts into space. NASA was directed to restructure its research program aboard the ISS. NASA is restructuring its research program aboard the ISS to focus only on research needed to accomplish the Vision. There is uncertainty about the future of the ISS after NASA's use ends in 2017. The final appropriation for Exploration Capabilities was $6.140 billion, $94 million less than the request. A Mikulski amendment created new appropriations accounts for NASA, including $1 billion for space shuttle Return to Flight expenses and $40 million for Hurricane Katrina recovery expenses. The National Science Foundation (NSF) was established in 1950 to support science and engineering research at U.S. colleges and universities. It promotes academic research and education across various disciplines. The NSF supports academic research and education in various disciplines, providing funding for investigator-initiated awards, tools, facilities, and science education. It also supports university-industry relationships, Antarctic research stations, oceanographic vessels, and national research centers. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is led by a presidentially appointed Director and a National Science Board (NSB) consisting of 24 scientists, engineers, and officials. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and investigations, reporting to the NSB and Congress. In FY2007, NSF was funded at $5.92 billion, a 6% increase from FY2006. The FY2007 appropriation for NSF aimed to double the budget over 10 years, supporting priority areas like broadening participation in science, world-class facilities, frontier research, and K-12 education. NSF invested over $600 million in programs for underrepresented groups and funded construction of facilities for advancing research. International research partnerships were emphasized for maintaining competitiveness. In FY2007, NSF increased funding for international science and engineering, led U.S. participation in the International Polar Year, invested in the National Nanotechnology Initiative and Climate Change Science Program, supported homeland security, and funded research on sensor systems for detecting explosives. The FY2007 appropriation included $4.67 billion for Research and Related Activities (R&RA), a 7.7% increase over the previous year. Funding for the physical sciences was increased in response to concerns about support imbalance. R&RA funds research projects, facilities, education, and training activities, including Integrative Activities (IA) and research instrumentation at U.S. colleges and universities. It also supports Partnerships for Innovation, disaster research teams, and the Office of Polar Programs (OPP). The Office of Polar Programs (OPP) is funded at $485 million in the FY2007 appropriation, with significant increases directed at Arctic and Antarctic sciences. NSF will continue to operate and maintain three icebreakers previously funded by the U.S. Coast Guard. Research project support in the FY2007 appropriation totals approximately $2.40 billion, providing funding for various research centers and programs. The NSF funding for various research centers and programs includes support for Science and Technology Centers, Materials Centers, Engineering Research Centers, Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers, and Centers for Analysis and Synthesis. The Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account remains at $190.9 million in FY2007, supporting the acquisition and construction of major research facilities and equipment. NSF prioritizes ongoing projects and those approved by the National Science Board for new starts, emphasizing projects with the potential to advance scientific understanding and infrastructure technology. In FY2007, NSF funded several projects including the Atacama Large Millimeter Array Construction, EarthScope, IceCube Neutrino Observatory, National Ecological Observatory Network, Scientific Ocean Drilling Vessel, Alaskan Region Research Vessel, and Ocean Observatories Initiative. Additional funding was provided for the South Pole Station Modernization project. The appropriation also supported NSF-wide investments in biocomplexity in the environment, human and social dynamics, and mathematical sciences. The NSF aims to strengthen core disciplinary research, lead in networking and information technology R&D, and sustain organizational excellence. They propose a $596.8 million investment in cyberinfrastructure for research tools and facilities. Grant size and duration have been a long-term priority, with a funding rate decline from 30% in the late 1990s to 23% in FY2006. The Education and Human Resources Directorate (EHR) funding has remained steady at $796.7 million in FY2007, with a focus on increasing technological literacy, preparing STEM professionals, and closing achievement gaps in scientific fields. Support is provided at pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate levels, with priorities including research in science education, informal science education, and the new Discovery Research K-12 program. The Education and Human Resources Directorate (EHR) funding in FY2007 focuses on enhancing technological literacy, preparing STEM professionals, and addressing achievement gaps in scientific fields. Funding supports programs at pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate levels, including the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program, Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement, STEM Talent Expansion Program, National STEM Education Digital Library, Federal Cyber Service, and Advanced Technological Education. The Math and Science Partnership Program (MSP) has transitioned to the undergraduate level in FY2007, with ongoing support for existing awards and activities. The FY2007 budget for the Education and Human Resources Directorate (EHR) focused on supporting programs at pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate levels. Priorities included Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship, Graduate Research Fellowships, Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education, and programs to increase underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. Funding requests were made for various programs such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities Programs, Tribal Colleges and Universities Program, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, and Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology. The EHR maintained funding at the FY2006 level, with revised funding levels yet to be determined. The NSF is facing debates over the management and oversight of major science education projects funded in the MREFC account. Recommendations have been made for a more open project selection process and improved oversight. The NSB released a management report in September 2005 outlining guidelines for the selection process of major research facility projects supported by the National Science Foundation. The report emphasizes the need for flexibility in reconsidering facilities at different stages of development and the ability to adapt to changes in interagency participation and funding. Collaboration across different disciplines is encouraged for project planning. The NSF released a report in September 2006, outlining investment priorities for the next five years to address the accelerating pace of scientific discoveries in a competitive international environment. The priorities include enhancing U.S. economic competitiveness, supporting multidisciplinary research, improving STEM education, developing cyberinfrastructure, and strengthening collaborative networks. The National Science Foundation (NSF) aims to enhance the nation's collaborative advantage through innovative partnerships and management excellence. The State Department, established in 1789, works to advance and protect worldwide interests. The State Department, established in 1789, supports over 50 U.S. agencies and organizations in 180 countries. It employs around 30,000 people, with 60% working overseas. State Department funding categories include administration of foreign affairs, international operations, and international broadcasting, with an enacted FY2006 appropriation of $9.56 billion. The FY2005 supplemental funds within P.L. 109-13 for Title IV were allocated for State's Administration of Foreign Affairs, which includes salaries, diplomatic security, programs, technology, and maintenance of overseas buildings. The Administration's FY2007 request for this category was $6.93 billion, with the House-passed level at $6.66 billion and the Senate Appropriations Committee funding level at $6.58 billion.

The International Commissions account includes various commissions with missions focused on treaty obligations, water quality improvement, and border sanitation. The FY2007 funding request of $63.9 million represented a decrease of 3.9% over the previous year, largely due to a decrease in funds for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. The House funding level for international commissions was $67.9 million, while the Senate committee level was $67.4 million. The final FY2007 enacted level for related appropriations was $67.0 million, with the House-passed level at $68.1 million and the Senate committee-recommended level at $43.5 million. The total funding for related agencies in FY2007 was $108.6 million, including allocations for the Asia Foundation, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), and the East-West and North-South Centers. The Administration's FY2007 request for related appropriations was $103.6 million, 8.7% less than the FY2006 enacted level. The Asia Foundation (TAF) is a nonprofit organization receiving government and private sector contributions. The FY2007 request of $10 million reflected a 27.5% reduction from the previous year. The funding would support programs promoting tolerance in Muslim countries, free and fair elections in Asia, and democratic institutions in various countries. The organization planned to raise $4 million in private funds for FY2007. The Asia Foundation received $13.8 million in funding for FY2007, the same as FY2006. The National Endowment for Democracy requested $80 million for FY2007, an 8% increase from the previous year. Critics argue that NED duplicates government programs and could operate solely on private funding. The East-West Center, established in 1960, received $19 million in FY2007, a decrease from the requested $12 million. The Senate committee recommended $19 million, while the House level was $3 million. The North-South Center in Miami, Florida, received a funding level of $19 million.

The International Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue was established with a trust fund of $6.9 million for perpetual operations in Istanbul, Turkey. In FY2005, Congress provided $7.3 million for the North-South Center in Miami, Florida. The Administration requested funding from the Trust Fund for FY2006 and FY2007. International Broadcasting is now under the Broadcasting Board of Governors, including VOA, RFE/RL, and others. The Administration requested funding for international broadcasting activities under the Broadcasting Board of Governors, including VOA, RFE/RL, Radio Sawa, Radio Farda, and Radio Free Asia. A new U.S. Middle East Television Network, Alhurra, was initiated. The FY2007 funding request totaled $671.9 million, with the House passing $658.9 million and the Senate recommending $661.2 million for broadcasting operations and capital improvements. The FY2007 funding for international broadcasting totals $661.2 million, with $636 million for broadcasting operations and $8 million for capital improvements. S. 600 (Lugar)/ H.R. 2601 (Smith, C.) authorizes appropriations for the Department of State and international broadcasting activities, including provisions on the Peace Corps and foreign assistance programs for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. The Senate bill was introduced on March 10, 2005, and received floor action on April 6, 2005. The House bill was introduced on May 24, 2005, and passed on July 20, 2005 (351-78). No further action occurred. The EEOC enforces laws against employment discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability. Appropriators have been concerned about the agency's restructuring plan, which includes the National Contact Center pilot project and field operations. The EEOC implemented a two-year pilot project in March 2005 and realigned field structure and staff in January 2006. The agency's budget for FY2007 was $327.0 million, the same as FY2006, despite the Administration's proposed cut. The budget request for the EEOC in FY2007 aimed to reduce staffing by 19 full-time equivalents and allocate up to $28 million for state and local entities with work-sharing agreements.
