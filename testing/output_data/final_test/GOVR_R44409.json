Funding decreased from FY2010 to FY2013, with a slight increase in FY2016. Sequestration in FY2013 cut nearly $4 billion from the total amount appropriated for CJS. If not for sequestration, funding would have remained steady at around $61 billion between FY2011 and FY2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 set discretionary budget caps. Total appropriations for CJS from FY2007-FY2016 show increases in FY2009 and FY2010, mainly for the Department of Commerce for the 2010 census. Decreases in funding for DOJ and NASA also contributed to overall decreases in CJS appropriations between FY2010 and FY2013. Despite cuts, DOJ and NASA had higher appropriations in FY2013 than in FY2007. The appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice and NASA have generally increased since FY2013. Funding for the NSF has steadily increased over the past 10 fiscal years, with Congress increasing funding for the NSF's Research and Related Activities account. The decrease in NSF's funding for FY2013 was due to sequestration."
