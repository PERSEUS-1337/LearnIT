    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Streamlined and Improved Methods at Polling Locations and Early Voting Act\" or the \"SIMPLE Voting Act.\" It amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to establish minimum requirements for early voting and reducing waiting times for voters in federal elections. Each State must allow individuals to vote in a Federal election during the 15-day period before the election, with a minimum of 10 hours of voting each day and uniform hours. Polling places must be located near public transportation. The Commission shall issue standards for the administration of voting prior to Federal elections, including the geographic placement of polling places. States can deviate from these standards in unforeseen circumstances. Effective January 1, 2014. SEC. 305. PREVENTING UNREASONABLE WAITING TIMES FOR VOTERS. SEC. 305 requires each State to provide enough voting systems, poll workers, and resources at polling places to ensure fair waiting times for all voters and limit wait times to one hour. Factors to consider when determining resources include the number of voters and the voting history of the precinct. Factors to consider when determining resources at polling places include the voting age population, voter turnout in past elections, number of registered voters, new voter registrations, census data for the population served, educational levels, socio-economic factors, voters with disabilities or limited English proficiency, and the type of voting systems used. The Commission will establish guidelines for States to meet requirements related to polling place resources, including voting systems, ballot complexity, and other factors deemed appropriate. No actions can be taken to restrict access to polling places or prevent individuals from voting. Each State must develop and implement a contingency plan to provide additional resources to polling places with long wait times on election day, approved by the Commission. The Commission may establish procedures for elections after January 1, 2014. Section 401 of the Act is amended to reference subtitle A of title III. The table of contents is updated to reflect these changes. The Act allows states to provide longer early voting periods and more resources at polling places for federal elections without restrictions."
