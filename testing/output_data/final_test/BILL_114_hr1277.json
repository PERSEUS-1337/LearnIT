    "content": "The \"Ocean Acidification Research Partnerships Act\" may be cited as the short title. It amends the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act of 2009 by adding a section for Ocean Acidification Collaborative Research Grants. The \"Ocean Acidification Research Partnerships Act\" defines terms like academic community and seafood industry. It authorizes grants for collaborative research projects on ocean acidification involving partnerships between the seafood industry and academic community. Grants are subject to approval based on specific criteria. The project must align with the strategic research plan and aim to develop partnerships, involve the seafood industry in ocean acidification research, deliver results benefiting both sectors, and utilize expertise from both industry and academia. The Secretary will prioritize funding for projects addressing vulnerable ecosystems and communities impacted by ocean acidification, with support from local stakeholders like States, community organizations, tribes, and educational institutions. Implementation guidelines for projects addressing ocean acidification will be issued by the Secretary in collaboration with the Subcommittee, including criteria and priorities for grants. Consultation will involve State, regional, and local decisionmakers, the seafood industry, educators, and tribes. Each proposal for a grant under this section must include qualifications of project conductors, plans for industry and academic community involvement, and dissemination strategies for research results, such as educational programs. The research project for grant funding must include educational programs, presentations to industry and community stakeholders, scientific publication, and delivery to government representatives. The project must align with program elements and provide any additional necessary information for evaluation. The Secretary may consider marine-dependent industries as alternative participants for funding. The project must align with program elements and provide necessary information for evaluation. Grantees must submit periodic reports to the Secretary. Federal funding for collaborative research projects cannot exceed 85% of the total project cost, with a required non-Federal share. Marine-dependent industries may be considered as alternative participants for funding. The Secretary may waive the matching requirement for project costs if no reasonable means are available for applicants to meet it. $5,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary for fiscal years 2016 through 2020."
