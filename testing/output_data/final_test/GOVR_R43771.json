    "content": "The United States primarily relies on group health insurance coverage, with disparities between small and large employers. In 2013, only 34.8% of small private-sector employers offered coverage compared to 95.7% of larger employers. Cost is a significant barrier for smaller employers in providing coverage. The ACA includes provisions to enhance access to health insurance. The ACA implemented provisions over several years, with some taking effect in 2010 and others in 2014. These provisions address issues in the small group market, including low offer rates and high coverage costs. The SHOP exchanges were established to help small employers access health insurance plans. SHOP exchanges are administered by states, HHS, or a combination of both. The ACA established SHOP exchanges to assist small employers in accessing health insurance plans. These exchanges can be solely administered by a state, solely by HHS, or by HHS with some state involvement. Plans sold through SHOP exchanges must be certified as qualified health plans meeting ACA criteria. Employers are not required to purchase coverage through SHOP exchanges. The ACA established SHOP exchanges to assist small employers in accessing health insurance plans. SHOP exchanges have prescriptive requirements for establishment and operation, which may vary between SB-SHOPs and FF-SHOPs. Each exchange implements features differently, and small employers offering coverage to full-time employees are eligible to use SHOP exchanges. The report discusses the current and future role of SHOP exchanges in the private health insurance market. Beginning in 2016, all states must define small employer as 100 or fewer employees. Starting in 2017, states have the option to allow large employers to use a SHOP exchange. Small employers may purchase coverage through one or more SHOP exchanges based on their employees' worksites. In order for an employee to be eligible for coverage through a SHOP exchange, the employer must offer insurance to all full-time employees. To be eligible for coverage through a SHOP exchange, an employer must offer coverage to all full-time employees. Employer eligibility for a SHOP exchange depends on size and offering coverage to full-time employees. The ACA and its regulations define employer size and full-time employees using methods from the Internal Revenue Code. A full-time employee works 30 hours or more per week, and the full-time equivalent method calculates the number of employees by including both full-time and part-time employees. Each full-time employee counts as one, and part-time hours are converted into FTEs. To determine eligibility for coverage through a SHOP exchange, employers must offer coverage to all full-time employees. The full-time equivalent method calculates the total number of employees by including both full-time and part-time employees. Part-time hours are converted into FTEs by adding all part-time employees' hours worked and dividing by 120. This calculation is added to the number of full-time employees to get the total number of FTEs. For example, if an employer has 10 full-time employees and 20 part-time employees working 24 hours per week, the part-time employees' hours would be equivalent to 16 FTEs. This total FTE count determines the employer's eligibility as a small employer in an FF-SHOP. For plan years before January 1, 2016, SB-SHOPs can choose to use IRC 4980H(c) definitions or state-specific terms for determining employer size. Starting January 1, 2016, all SHOP exchanges must follow IRC 4980H(c) definitions. Exchanges must provide consumer assistance, including operating call centers and implementing Navigator programs and certified application counselor programs. Exchanges must establish Navigator programs and certified application counselor (CAC) programs to help consumers make informed decisions about insurance options. Consumer assistance personnel, agents, and brokers can assist individuals and small employers in obtaining coverage through exchanges. Agents and brokers have the ability to enroll individuals and small employers in coverage through exchanges. Employers and brokers can enroll in coverage through SHOP exchanges by submitting applications for verification of eligibility. Enrollment is not limited to a specific open enrollment period, allowing employers to enroll at any time during the year. Each SHOP exchange must establish uniform enrollment timelines and provide a timeframe for selecting qualified health plans and an annual open enrollment period for employees. Minimum participation rates are required for annual open enrollment periods in SHOP exchanges. Special enrollment periods are available for employees and dependents, allowing enrollment outside the open enrollment period based on specific eligibility criteria. Health insurance issuers may set minimum participation rates, but SHOP exchanges can establish uniform rates based on employee participation. For plan years starting in 2014, FF-SHOPs use a 70% minimum participation rate. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of employees accepting coverage by the number offered, excluding those enrolled elsewhere. Employers not meeting the rate may have coverage limited to a specific enrollment period. The FF-SHOPs use a 70% minimum participation rate for plan years starting in 2014. Employers failing to meet this rate may have coverage limited to a specific enrollment period. SB-SHOPs can set their own participation rates within certain requirements, and minimum contribution rates may be established by issuers as long as allowed by state law. HHS has not explicitly prohibited minimum contribution rates for QHPs purchased through SHOP exchanges. In 2014, FF-SHOP exchanges may not allow issuers to set minimum contribution rates, unlike SB-SHOP exchanges. ACA's guaranteed issue provision ensures that issuers must accept all applicants for coverage, regardless of meeting minimum participation or contribution rates. Small employers and employees can enroll in Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) through SHOP exchanges during the annual enrollment period from November 15 to December 15. Different enrollment pathways are available depending on the SHOP exchange. For the 2014 plan year, small employers and employees using FF-SHOPs can compare QHPs on the website or apply by mailing an application or using direct enrollment through an agent, broker, or insurance company. For the 2015 plan year, small employers and employees may enroll in a QHP through the contacted entity without waiting for eligibility determination from the FF-SHOP exchange. Different SB-SHOP exchanges offer various enrollment pathways, with some supporting online enrollment and others relying on mail-in applications. The availability of enrollment pathways for the 2015 plan year in SB-SHOPs remains uncertain. Regulations allow agents and brokers to assist individuals and small employers in enrolling in exchange coverage using their own services. Agents and brokers can help individuals and small employers enroll in exchange coverage through their own websites. This feature is available in individual exchanges but not in SHOP exchanges for 2014. SHOP exchanges may allow enrollment through agents' websites in 2015 if state law permits. HHS does not anticipate FF-SHOPs offering this function in 2015. Employers eligible for SHOP exchanges can choose one or more QHPs to offer employees, with the exchange determining the number of QHPs allowed and the selection method. For the 2014 plan year, FF-SHOPs only allow employers to select one QHP to offer to their employees. Most SB-SHOPs for 2014 allow employers to choose more than one plan for their employees, either through employee choice or a different method. Starting in 2015, SHOP exchanges can decide whether to offer the employee choice method based on a recommendation from the State Insurance Commissioner. HHS has approved recommendations from State Insurance Commissioners not to implement employee choice in 18 states in 2015 for FF-SHOP exchanges. The remaining 14 FF-SHOPs will implement employee choice in 2015. SB-SHOPs can choose a different method to offer one or more QHPs to employees if they opt out of the employee choice method. HHS states that the option to implement employee choice in 2015 is a transitional policy, with all SHOP exchanges required to offer at least the employee choice method starting in 2016. Under current regulations, starting in 2016, employers can offer more than one plan to employees in all SHOP exchanges. ACA requirements apply to how issuers set premiums for small group market coverage, regardless of whether it's inside or outside a SHOP exchange. Employers must determine their contribution to employees' premiums, and SHOP exchanges may establish standard methods for defining contributions. Additionally, SHOP exchanges are expected to implement administrative procedures for collecting and paying premiums for QHPs. The ACA imposes adjusted community rating rules on premium determination for health insurance plans in the small group market, prohibiting pricing based on health factors but allowing variation for self-only or family enrollment, geographic area, tobacco use, and age. Issuers must use per-member rating to calculate total premiums for small employers' health plans. State laws may impose stricter rating rules, such as pure community rating. The premium charged by an issuer to an employer is determined by summing the premiums of each employee and dependent enrolled in the plan, adjusted for rating variations like age. Issuers may offer per-member or composite premiums to employers. Composite premiums are average enrollee premium amounts calculated by dividing the total premium amount by the total number of enrollees. If an issuer offers composite premiums, it must comply with certain rules, including basing the total premium on per-member rating and ensuring the premium does not vary during the plan year. During a plan year, tobacco use cannot affect the composite premium and must be applied separately. Issuers offering composite premiums must make them available to all employers interested in purchasing the health plan. SHOP exchanges have additional rules, such as requiring uniform rate changes no more than quarterly and prohibiting rate variations for employers during the plan year. If the employee choice function is available in FF-SHOPs, employers cannot receive composite premiums from issuers. Instead, they may only receive per-member premiums. This is not a requirement in SB-SHOPs, where issuers can provide composite premiums to employers opting for the employee choice method. Employers can determine their contribution towards employees' premiums once an issuer has developed premiums for a health plan. FF-SHOPs must establish standard methods for defining contributions, while SB-SHOPs are not prescribed specific methods. For plan year 2014, determining employer contributions in FF-SHOPs is straightforward as employers select one QHP for employees. They define percentage contributions for employee-only and dependent coverage. Employee choice will be available in some FF-SHOPs in 2015, with regulations outlining contributions if multiple QHPs are offered. For plan year 2014, employers in FF-SHOPs select one QHP as a reference plan for contributions. Employees can enroll in other QHPs. Contribution percentages can vary for different employee categories. HHS guidelines allow composite ratings only for employees. For plan year 2015, it is uncertain if FF-SHOPs will accommodate composite ratings for dependents. SHOP exchanges will establish procedures for employers to pay premiums, including providing monthly bills with employer and employee contributions, collecting total amounts due, and making payments to QHP issuers. Maintenance of records and evidence is also required. The SHOP exchanges must maintain records of premium aggregation functions for at least 10 years. Small employers eligible for tax credits must contribute at least 50% towards employee health insurance. Tax credits are available to eligible small employers since 2010, but starting in 2014, they are generally only available through a SHOP exchange. Beginning in 2014, tax credits are available to eligible small employers through a SHOP exchange. The maximum credit is 50% for for-profit employers and 35% for nonprofit organizations. The full credit is for employers with 10 or fewer full-time equivalents and average taxable wages of $25,400 or less. The credit phases out as the number of full-time equivalents increases from 10 to 25. The tax credit phases out as an employer's number of FTEs increases from 10 to 25 and as average employee compensation increases from $25,400 to $50,800 under the ACA. HHS has set requirements for issuer participation in FF-SHOPs, certifying a QHP for the individual market based on specific conditions met by the issuer. The FF-SHOP exchange requires issuers with a share of the small group market greater than 20% to also offer through the FF-individual exchange. States with SB-SHOPs may have their own requirements. SHOP exchanges are part of the larger health insurance landscape in the US. The SHOP exchanges in the US aim to improve access to health insurance coverage, particularly in the small group market. ACA provisions such as the small business health care tax credit and SHOP exchanges address the cost barriers faced by small employers. Additionally, ACA includes consumer protections to enhance access to various parts of the health insurance market. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes consumer protections for accessing health insurance in the individual market, Medicaid expansion, individual mandate, and penalties for non-compliance by large employers. In 2014, internal and external factors influenced the functionality of SHOP exchanges for small employers. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014 impacted the role of SHOP exchanges for small employers. SHOP exchanges offered unique features like viewing, comparing, and enrolling in plans from multiple issuers on one website, employee choice, and assistance in administering coverage finances. These features aimed to attract small employers and increase competition in the market, potentially reducing the cost of small group coverage. The implementation of features in SHOP exchanges was delayed in 2014 due to external factors like changes in the health insurance landscape influenced by the ACA. ACA reforms required small group health plans to cover essential health benefits, potentially increasing costs for some plans. This may have deterred small employers from obtaining coverage through SHOP exchanges. In 2013, some small employers early renewed their plans to avoid potential cost increases under ACA reforms. This allowed them to renew their plans before 2014, changing their contract year. In 2013, some small employers early renewed their plans to avoid potential cost increases under ACA reforms, changing their contract year to November\u2013October. A small employer that renewed in October 2013 would not have to comply with 2014 ACA market reforms until October 2014. Issuers in the small group market could choose to continue coverage that would otherwise be cancelled under a transitional policy announced by CMS in November 2013. State insurance commissioners could decide whether to enforce compliance with ACA market reforms, allowing issuers to renew coverage for small employers that would otherwise receive cancellation notices. The transitional policy, extended in March 2014, allows coverage renewed between January 1, 2014, and October 1, 2016, to not comply with certain ACA market reforms under specified conditions. Small employers with non-ACA compliant coverage do not need to purchase through a SHOP exchange. External factors affecting SHOP exchanges are more related to improved access to other coverage types under the ACA. Individual exchanges and Medicaid expansion make it easier for individuals to access coverage outside of the small group market. The ACA's Medicaid expansion and individual exchanges make it easier for individuals to access coverage outside of the small group market, potentially reducing the incentive for small employers to provide coverage through SHOP exchanges. Changes in factors affecting SHOP exchange performance in 2014 will continue in 2015 and beyond, with new factors expected to impact how issuers, employers, and consumers interact with SHOP exchanges. Delayed features of SHOP exchanges are anticipated to be implemented in the future. In 2015 and beyond, SHOP exchange websites are expected to be more functional with online enrollment available in all FF-SHOPs. Employee choice function will be implemented in some FF-SHOPs in 2015 and in all SHOP exchanges in 2016. The definition of small employers will change in 2016 to include those with 100 or fewer employees, potentially increasing enrollment in SHOP exchanges. The definition of small employers will change in 2016 to include those with 100 or fewer employees, potentially increasing enrollment in SHOP exchanges. In 2017, states have the option to open the SHOP exchange to large employers, which could also change employer and issuer participation patterns in SHOP exchanges. The broader health insurance market will evolve as ACA-related changes continue to occur. Small employers will have to obtain ACA-compliant coverage for plan year 2015 if they want to continue to offer coverage. The potential impact of SHOP exchanges changes and the requirement for small employers to offer ACA-compliant coverage is uncertain. It is unclear how many small employers early renewed or opted for transitional policies and may need to purchase ACA-compliant coverage in the future. The decision to offer ACA-compliant coverage may influence small employers to either continue offering coverage or stop. The appendix explains how employers can determine coverage options through an FF-SHOP exchange. The employer purchasing coverage through an FF-SHOP exchange can determine contributions towards employees' health insurance premiums. In 2014, the employer may select one QHP to offer to all employees and their dependents. An issuer provides per-member premiums based on the reference plan selected and the age of enrollees. In 2015, employers using FF-SHOP exchanges can calculate contributions towards employees' health insurance premiums based on composite or per-member premiums. The employer's contribution is determined by multiplying the employer contribution percentage by the premiums for employees or dependents. The employer then pays the resulting contribution towards each enrollee's premium. In 2015, employers using FF-SHOP exchanges can calculate contributions towards employees' health insurance premiums based on composite or per-member premiums. The employer may select more than one QHP to offer to its employees, with one plan serving as the reference plan for contributions. FF-SHOPs can accommodate composite ratings for employees only, allowing employers to define different contribution percentages for different employees. In 2014, FF-SHOP allows employers to set different contribution percentages for employees and dependents based on composite and per-member premiums. The employer's contribution is calculated by multiplying the percentage by the premiums and paying the resulting amount towards each enrollee's selected QHP premium."
